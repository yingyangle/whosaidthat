6828,Bart,why are you greeting low-lifes like us at the airport?
7049,Bart,"well, we've learned if you don't like something, just go to the office and complain. what's our next stop?"
3727,Bart,"come on, boy, let's go home and have some fun. that cat's been strutting around like she owns the place..."
4947,Bart,i have to take these stupid pills twice a day.

5135,Bart,my skin! my beautiful skin!
3773,Bart,"i know, i'll go to my room and think about what i did."
7540,Bart,"lis, you're a shoo-in."
9085,Bart,one of us should go look at it.
3225,Bart,"so what's it like being famous, dad?"
7401,Bart,"well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn."
10457,Bart,"really? it's not that bad, is it?"
10209,Bart,"there's nothing i can do to save my sister, the blimp or this airship."
13057,Bart,every moment i live is agony!

10318,Bart,yeah!
1816,Bart,"uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, mom."

11553,Bart,um... that's kind of a baby show.
2609,Bart,"hey, milhouse. how's the lemonade business?"
1933,Bart,no problem-o. just make a pass at your commanding officer.
2306,Bart,"did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?"
3737,Bart,maybe it's a box from the future!
5406,Bart,yuk!
9860,Bart,i'm playing with my sergeant activity doll.
1459,Bart,it was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the irish.

11988,Bart,bart.
2627,Bart,"okay, here's how it goes. i'm the leader. milhouse is my loyal sidekick. nelson is the tough guy, martin's the smart guy and todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. and now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. to step out of childhood and become men."
5889,Bart,is that my jacket?
4159,Bart,eat your vegetables. take a sweater. i don't think that's a good idea.

1616,Bart,observe - a bike lock.
10519,Bart,"thanks, milhouse. we make a great team."
8632,Bart,"hey, i didn't know this park was here."

8210,Bart,up above the world so high / like a diamond in the sky...
2801,Bart,"say what? cartoons don't have messages, lisa. they're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. stuff like that."
6877,Bart,why don't you let us watch tv and get her a roofi cd?
10501,Bart,accident! here comes another one!
6112,Bart,"i don't know, dad. what if she's still mad at me?"
4816,Bart,"great news, everyone. goliath is dead! although i haven't seen his body, the blast that failed to kill me, surely killed the giant. anyhoo, now that i'm your king again..."
1727,Bart,any popped eyeballs?
4040,Bart,"um, i think that one's broken."
12904,Bart,what's this stuff for?

2045,Bart,"if that's not flanders, he's done his homework!"
6679,Bart,"dad, you can't let him take our dog!"
12549,Bart,"well, old timer... i guess this is the end of the road. i know i haven't always been a good kid. but if i have to go to school tomorrow, i'll fail the test and be held back. i just need one more day to study, lord. i need your help."

3958,Bart,we should have lived together first.
573,Bart,"""the inventor i admire"", by bart simpson. the inventor i admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. he's my father, homer simpson, creator of... the ""flaming homer""!"
3403,Bart,"yo, dad, can i have a sip of your beer?"
9706,Bart,"i know he doesn't look like him, but i'll never forget that voice!"

1898,Bart,"i'm sorry, dad... you're fired!"
11000,Bart,the world is my ring now.
1646,Bart,one that's made: entirely out of syrup.
9542,Bart,let's roll.
10184,Bart,"there are no more great days, bart. just days."
1878,Bart,"...and i had the greatest time. mr. burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit."
8977,Bart,"fine, go nuts -- see if i care!"
10361,Bart,"come on, skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. you've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think."
3040,Bart,"aw, that's my krusty. i got a feeling he'll be allll-right."
4280,Bart,but asking you was ralph's idea.
11310,Bart,"nothing. on tv, when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea. i thought it might work for me."
11116,Bart,dad! we don't watch that show anymore!
11208,Bart,did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
10585,Bart,i'm just not ready for cookies!
7171,Bart,leslie who?
551,Bart,"dad... i don't know how to say this, but i don't want to drive your car. it's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart..."
7752,Bart,cool...
13080,Bart,"hey milhouse, did i ever tell you about the catch i made when i was ten? greatest moment of my life..."
439,Bart,"don't worry, i don't even like using the bathroom after you."
3756,Bart,"solve your problem, milhouse?"
9561,Bart,"destroy! destroy! boy, look at that iron work."
9334,Bart,there's no way that runs on electricity.
9283,Bart,"if i say ""crisscross"" one more time, will that change your mind?"
2037,Bart,"what have we here... ""the lighter side of hippies"". they don't care whose toes they step on. ."
3733,Bart,turn it down! we don't wanna wake up mom and dad!
11680,Bart,no.
7412,Bart,they left a message right here.
1129,Bart,suckers.
7908,Bart,you're a boy -- nothing is sweet.
4292,Bart,time to reap the benefits of being cool.
10456,Bart,"milhouse! what do i have to do, besides changing in any way, to get you to forgive me?"
7361,Bart,"step off, mom. rap is the poetry of the streets."
5679,Bart,that bob.
9269,Bart,glad you didn't come cheap.
10286,Bart,i need to know that chalmers will be taken care of!
209,Bart,...was in my hand...
10923,Bart,it's hard to pick just one of those.
8568,Bart,ow! mom! lisa hit me!
7651,Bart,that's a brilliant idea. those tv writers are geniuses!
6585,Bart,or the fox network getting a new president.
8152,Bart,i'm really sorry.
7359,Bart,"i love you, dad."
9191,Bart,but...
2853,Bart,"that dummy worked like a charm, dad."
7922,Bart,"oh dad, no one can rationalize like you."
1059,Bart,cool.
9352,Bart,so it kinda works...
9167,Bart,"dad, do you have to hang out at my school? it's bad enough i have to be here three days a week!"
5794,Bart,"oh, yeah, that's the spot. ohhh... that is perfect."
6412,Bart,"okay, here's the drill. a rogue elephant -- played by my old friend stampy -- is about to crush sweet young milhouse. then you run up and save the day, by saying stampy's safety word, ""mogumbo""."
10770,Bart,boxing wizards. boxing wizards. what's she up to?
9955,Bart,why not? are you having red meat?
3929,Bart,"i cannot believe you are here! do you think, maybe, you could give me some pointers?"
5339,Bart,you had a meeting this morning.
11444,Bart,"hey, i bet you have a great smile."
12589,Bart,did not.
12557,Bart,"i'm not missin'anything. frozen earlobes, trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over again... how good could it be?"
81,Bart,this looks like a discount for...
9917,Bart,"no disrespect, fat man, but you'd better poop out a dirt bike."
10242,Bart,remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code.
9012,Bart,"um mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes."
9625,Bart,ka-ra-té!
1007,Bart,"cool, she can fly!"
8261,Bart,"hello, redemption."
7565,Bart,i submit! i submit!
10034,Bart,take that back!
3479,Bart,"oh, dad, you are the living end."
12783,Bart,"i'm runnin' on empty, milhouse. you kids get a kick out of my jumps, and i love you for it, but it's all too easy."
5687,Bart,"okay, okay."
11999,Bart,"yeah, homer. room for one more."
1963,Bart,"ya see, lisa? they don't need my testimony."
1781,Bart,"thanks, mom."
3458,Bart,haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
1273,Bart,"hey homer, this luggage is crushing me."
3647,Bart,my name is... santa's little helper.
12215,Bart,what about a robot with a human brain?
7748,Bart,"hey losers, i'm gonna do to you what you did to these songs."
3390,Bart,"i'll finish this later. hi, dad."
6092,Bart,loser principal!

6900,Bart,"boy, i'm really gonna miss you. we've really had some great... ooh, a mercedes!"
11968,Bart,all he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
3222,Bart,"you know what, dad? maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
5084,Bart,daytime tv is muy estupido.
8083,Bart,"dad, don't make me go! i'll give you a back rub!"
11531,Bart,i can think of worse.
10124,Bart,"okay, go straight..."
2276,Bart,"okay, but on my way, i'm gonna be doing this."
5399,Bart,"hey, what's all the screaming?"
6366,Bart,"when you see a volkswagen bug, you punch somebody and yell the color."
6563,Bart,"sorry, no can do. i'm taking off for six months to join the skewed tour."
11729,Bart,who's gonna stop me?
9709,Bart,sideshow bob!
2649,Bart,milhouse! milhouse! now what do i do?
1028,Bart,uh-oh.

9954,Bart,awesome! i'll get the white wine.
10543,Bart,"wait, chief. i must know... who tipped you off?"
12133,Bart,"and homer is down! three seconds, folks -- a new record!"
11400,Bart,stupid kid. do you really think that's the way we should communicate?
8342,Bart,good boy! now go find homer!
8512,Bart,"lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, superman dies, aquaman dies, casper dies, caveman robin, black robin, born-again robin..."

11675,Bart,i will not. anything to delay a spelling test!
1812,Bart,"i don't get it, lis. you said everything would be back to normal, but homer and flanders are still friends."
2530,Bart,"thank you, sir."
3752,Bart,"he's got you there, dad."
4191,Bart,enh.
2755,Bart,i wasted five bucks on these.

8507,Bart,"wait, milhouse! don't go! you're my best friend."
6934,Bart,"you look a little sluggish out there, boy. i'd better open you up."
12622,Bart,"well, this is my day and we do, sir."

10606,Bart,"mom, dad, do you know there's a boat out there where nothing sucks? it's called royalty cruises and royalty cruise specialists are standing by now!"
311,Bart,"yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
3523,Bart,"give it up, bob. we found the money."

8670,Bart,i'm not a nerd -- i'm a jock who's too cool for sports.
5649,Bart,"c'mon, we're takin' over the school!"

8739,Bart,"lou! where are you, little buddy?"
8796,Bart,"hey, homer! your butt still looks big from down here!"

4842,Bart,what are you gonna do to me?
1080,Bart,uh oh.
6964,Bart,what?
4217,Bart,"well, i don't know about that... it might help him a little..."
11674,Bart,when he opens the door...
11654,Bart,"oh man, he made us watch him dance for three hours. and he really only has one move."
12495,Bart,"ah well, maybe just one more hour."
7398,Bart,that means it's a place where we do radio... activities.
2653,Bart,"oh, it's no use. i'm never gonna find that tree. this whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. wait a minute! there's a lemon behind that rock."
12336,Bart,"welcome back, dad."
10673,Bart,shut up!
1907,Bart,i'll be right back.
8904,Bart,what? you can't take my balderdash!
6909,Bart,"hey, guys! this butt's for you!"
12679,Bart,true.
9788,Bart,did someone order a happy ending?
7349,Bart,it's all in this book.
12453,Bart,"you don't have a clue, do you, dad?"
1018,Bart,testify!
878,Bart,"i didn't know you played the guitar, otto-man!"
7888,Bart,uh-oh.
5234,Bart,"oo, tough room. video games. whaddaya got? ""billy graham's bible blaster""?!"
5497,Bart,"speaking of which, how about seconds?"
6352,Bart,what's a fortnight?
7282,Bart,then let's hurry up and rip it out of my head.
10608,Bart,and there's a dvd library of movies that haven't been released yet!
2027,Bart,"traitors. go on and have your pool. i'm fine by myself, right here."
1784,Bart,and he taught me how to do this.
16,Bart,i can't believe i'm getting combat pay for this.
1998,Bart,"don't worry, here's the cash."
2106,Bart,i learned it screws everybody up.
1198,Bart,homer.
11506,Bart,only if they have five dollars.
12455,Bart,"aye-aye, mambo man."
10098,Bart,what does that mean?!
12802,Bart,maybe.
9125,Bart,just wait.
5211,Bart,"hey, dad."
9022,Bart,nice doorbell. is it computerized?
7742,Bart,you know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. some of the little kids are bringing their parents. do you wanna go?
13046,Bart,i did it. i finally got my revenge.
8173,Bart,"y'know, it'd be a real shame if someone started investigating your ""indian heritage."""
5893,Bart,ow! you stepped on my arm!
1834,Bart,"he smells worse than anything! hey, you! elephant! lift me up on your back, man."
12754,Bart,really? did they cry?
1092,Bart,i'unno.
9059,Bart,"no, sir."
3793,Bart,then i'll just stick by you in secret. like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
8658,Bart,i'm tending to martin's butterfly enclosure. his butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.
356,Bart,eat my shorts.
6333,Bart,"no, it was the night you got loaded at moe's and the car had to be towed home."
7757,Bart,"well, that sign would look good hidden under my bed."
6408,Bart,the doorman died.
6063,Bart,"cool, mom's on drugs. if we turn her in we get a form letter from dick cheney!"
5531,Bart,"ooo, baby."
6571,Bart,"dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. you're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart."
11664,Bart,"yeah, like the guy who designed bender just took a drawing of dad and stuck an antenna on it."
5718,Bart,how could you spend all our money on a comic published by lens crafters?
7795,Bart,now i gotta warn you. we could get in trouble.
2469,Bart,"hello, i'm bart simpson. in the past, i've brought you such classic films as ""homer in the shower,"" and ""homer on the toilet."" and now, i give you... ""the eternal struggle."""
6299,Bart,"when nerds are in trouble, i am not slow. it's spin, spin, spin and away i go!"
4929,Bart,"sure, i can do something destructive!"
438,Bart,"yeah, spill your guts, man."
11656,Bart,"i'm so proud of you, poppa."
10662,Bart,hitler mash-ups.
11433,Bart,"i'm just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever. eh, why not?"
7516,Bart,where are you really going?
11801,Bart,you take it!
4376,Bart,i got it! i got the flag!
1373,Bart,doctor wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell them.
12402,Bart,"thanks, krusty."
3072,Bart,"lisa, if i ever stop loving violence, i want you to shoot me."
61,Bart,"hey, grampa. aisle six and step on it."
1583,Bart,"uh, sure. well, now that we're friends, uter, how 'bout loosening these straps, huh?"
1225,Bart,"can you say ""david hasselhoff""?"
2720,Bart,television.
11379,Bart,i'll take that.
9192,Bart,"milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it."
4317,Bart,"the shirts continued their domination over the skins today. and in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between kearney and mr. largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. lisa?"
8017,Bart,"""his,"" eh? hmm, so it's a dude."
62,Bart,"yeah, you should go to bed, grampa. we've had a big day."
4054,Bart,does it matter?
5214,Bart,"don't worry, boy. i'll love you even if you don't win."
1705,Bart,"by the way, your martinis suck!"
10298,Bart,yep.
4705,Bart,"dad, that doesn't belong to you."
1445,Bart,sweet.
6516,Bart,"hey, a box of old videotapes."
10976,Bart,"make me, baldy."
2932,Bart,"well, you lucked out, marge my man, 'cause i'm in a smiling mood today."
12821,Bart,all right.
2048,Bart,sure. that was twenty minutes ago.
10521,Bart,"oh god, man! here, drink this paint thinner."
10748,Bart,it's homer! before his boobs came in!
1299,Bart,homer simpson! homer simpson! pick up bart! pick up bart!
9769,Bart,"fine, you can be our coach."
9726,Bart,that is bob. guess i was wrong.
5168,Bart,number of miracles performed by bart: two. number performed by lisa: zero.
8821,Bart,nope... nope... dime... button... pepperoni slice...
11527,Bart,dad!
10336,Bart,"um mom, where are we?"
5894,Bart,there's gotta be a way to get back at dad.
10791,Bart,forget i said anything!
10810,Bart,cool.
5993,Bart,"uh, yeah. i'll have the shark butt with butt sauce."
8571,Bart,it's not funny! you're wearing cleats!
5337,Bart,help! secret service!
6137,Bart,"no kiddin'. anyway, i climbed over your gate. a dog was after me."
4234,Bart,"oh lord, i thank you for this bounty i'm about to receive..."
494,Bart,"quit riding the brake, otto. give it some gas, man."
6073,Bart,your dad's mcbain?

3643,Bart,"oh, how come i never get any mail?"
2904,Bart,i wanna stay here with mr. burns.
3965,Bart,superman.
7466,Bart,"french it up, lover boy!"
11742,Bart,then can we get pizza on the way home?
3901,Bart,"i'd like to order a wake-up call, please... three am... ah, for every room except this one... that's right. goodnight."
5726,Bart,"look at all these bootleg videos! ""alien autopsy"" ""illegal alien autopsy"", ""godfather iii -- good version""..."
2060,Bart,but i distinctly heard you say that maude was with god.
2341,Bart,"been there, done that."
12230,Bart,but sneaking into a movie is practically stealing man.
8093,Bart,"not bad. we had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with nelson's gramma. but, it was a one-time thing, and now i'll never see him again."
3078,Bart,loser.
10538,Bart,"wait, is the hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?"
6780,Bart,this is boring. can't we go home? this overpass smells like urine.
6263,Bart,"this little trap is gonna make my dad angrier than he's ever been. in the meantime, i gotta tell those internet guys to hold tight."
3467,Bart,"really?! oh, how terrible!"
1787,Bart,"right on! say it, sister!"

8946,Bart,heard what?
6436,Bart,wait. wait. wait. bob can't stay with us. this man has tried to kill me so much it's not funny anymore.
1864,Bart,"whoa! whoa, boy!"

10051,Bart,thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of angry dad will be on a speakerphone today.
4336,Bart,"well, maybe they should have three. i'm bart simpson."

4402,Bart,"milhouse, i'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground and put it on my face. i have a better idea."
3704,Bart,that's him all right. i'll be happy to take him off your hands.

4742,Bart,"oh, quit complaining. it's half the work of the divorced dad."

8475,Bart,check it out -- an animal hole.
1097,Bart,i got my ticket.
4220,Bart,"ralph, i just got through sorting those."
756,Bart,"hey, i don't need you to get me in the back of a police car."
10052,Bart,"hi, everyone. i'm bart simpson, the creator of ""angry dad."" to make this film, i had to miss countless hours of school, and there was also some hardship. i hope you like it as much as i do."
8443,Bart,"well, i have to look good for tomorrow."
246,Bart,"aw, come on. if you're really michael jackson, who were your last four dates for the grammys?"
2272,Bart,"lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. at first i thought we can talk it over like civilized people. but instead, i just ripped the head off mr. honeybunny."
8136,Bart,problem solved.
5601,Bart,sounds good. wanna eat my fat?
8319,Bart,"i still can't believe it. they dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush, so we have to play the last inning over again."
10081,Bart,"hm, wrong hands, eh? that's your cue, boys."
7819,Bart,i'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
7243,Bart,party! party! party! party!
2057,Bart,"gotta save lisa, trash can or no trash can!"

671,Bart,"mom, i'm tired. i wanna go home. can't i just lie down for a minute?"
672,Bart,"fine, get it. lets go."
7771,Bart,"c'mon, slice, dice, and serve on rice."
11906,Bart,whew!
10789,Bart,did you give the money back to the people who lost it?
11145,Bart,nowhere to tie my kite... and i forgot my scarf.
866,Bart,i said slag off!
7678,Bart,mom... dad. i'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
4307,Bart,my board!
2666,Bart,"well, um, yeah. i guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
6096,Bart,"all right, i know what to do. i'll dump her like she's never been dumped before, then we'll go right back to being friends."
9894,Bart,"well, boy, i guess this is it. we've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption ""who's walking who?"""
2882,Bart,"but you can't kill krusty. he made you what you are. without him, you wouldn't even be called sideshow."
8662,Bart,calm down!
7007,Bart,what're you talkin' about?
12396,Bart,"we don't expect you to, mom."
2362,Bart,woo! all hands on deck! pirates off the port bow! hey!
717,Bart,no! it's not for me. it's homework.
4792,Bart,whoa-ho-ho!
10644,Bart,"all that happened is we got a little extra vacation, is that so bad!?"
12417,Bart,"oh, come on lis, you know why."
9974,Bart,"mom, i'll admit it: i wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my mom."
8229,Bart,"seymour, gary."
5380,Bart,"hey, here's a camera."
1970,Bart,"mom, mom, mom!"
10477,Bart,"he's still inside-in, folks! and just to prove it:"
11763,Bart,"well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!"
6216,Bart,"hey look, there's copacabana beach. the heart and soul or rio."
932,Bart,"hello, mr. stanky... i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha... who am i? let's just say i'm a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands."
6590,Bart,i got lisa's plankton kebabs!
1738,Bart,"i saved your career, man! remember your comeback special?"
11651,Bart,what? why?
8653,Bart,"yeah, nothing's up and nothing's down -- except for martin, who died."
9983,Bart,"okay, have fun dying alone."
10506,Bart,"aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity."
8289,Bart,shhh.
7139,Bart,we have a free hotel room in miami for two days?
706,Bart,"one months detention... she'll pay for this. yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a malibu stacy head down here."
2783,Bart,"yes. a simple proposition, ralph: how would you like to make a dollar?"
8704,Bart,but wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
10486,Bart,not me.
5807,Bart,take that!
12662,Bart,wow! free balloons for everyone who enters!
6226,Bart,"you know, lisa, they say father knows best."
5670,Bart,"cool, japanimation."
2061,Bart,"but i saw the murder, and then i saw you bury the corpse in the backyard."
8387,Bart,"lis, you have to release that water. it's the only way to short out the fan."
11469,Bart,"so you see, chief, snake wasn't stealing that stuff out of greed. he was stealing it to thank me."
1375,Bart,cool. she'll be a freak.
1160,Bart,"oh no! here comes the ""conservative judge!"""
12636,Bart,he wouldn't sign my ball.
5724,Bart,en garde!
8329,Bart,and that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
7491,Bart,"hey, i didn't do anything! yet."
5770,Bart,this is for sideshow bob.
9880,Bart,as long as it means we're not learning.
11297,Bart,"oh yeah, more. a little bit more. right there. oh yeah. oh yeah, that's the stuff!"
11489,Bart,how'd you do that?
131,Bart,"terrible. cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
8539,Bart,"hey, aren't you bob's brother?"
699,Bart,yo.
11022,Bart,"you saved me, lis! for the rest of my life, you'll always be my ""one phone call."""
5499,Bart,those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. we've gotta warn grampa.
12532,Bart,"i said little help! throw me the ball, poindexter."
9875,Bart,"now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here."
12992,Bart,bo-ring.

2744,Bart,milhouse!
6896,Bart,"hey, give those back."
7860,Bart,whee. whee.
7094,Bart,"hey, the next time my mom asks me to help around the house, i could come live with your family."
4061,Bart,"if i like ya, it is."
240,Bart,happy birthday lisa /
5247,Bart,"dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars."
8204,Bart,/
5199,Bart,"wow, you can do anything out here."
4683,Bart,now we come to mr. homer simpson...
6895,Bart,now to turn on the moto-mimic.
12519,Bart,"oh, you don't say? what about that history test?... huh? piece of cake, huh? so listen, what'd you get for number one? uh huh. number two?... oh yeah, that sounds right."
12485,Bart,"yes, ma'am."
1774,Bart,the best performance of my life.
10362,Bart,"with your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment..."
7032,Bart,"hey, mom. can i sleep over at milhouse's?"
12720,Bart,"uh-oh!... i mean, good!"
8021,Bart,i brought you breakfast in bed.

1828,Bart,"uh, gentlemen, i am not leaving without my elephant."
6921,Bart,but don't worry. i've got a name all picked out for you.
1282,Bart,let's see if they wore underwear back then.
5816,Bart,"ohh, that's impossible."
10093,Bart,"how now, mad spirits, before we part / 'tis i, mischievous and puckish bart / 'twas not i the players did disturb / 'twas the doings of a green and naughty herb / the gods have righted every wrong / cheech the stoner has his chong!"
11007,Bart,"they're cheering, grampa."
5067,Bart,hey! hey! that's a leave-in conditioner!
7001,Bart,i knew you'd blow it. now let me show you that mound.
11558,Bart,"i've gotta set things straight. during that same race, my friend milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened..."
9874,Bart,that coop looks a little flimsy.
4382,Bart,my dad could do it!
147,Bart,"hi, mom."
8935,Bart,fancy party! this is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
6158,Bart,"yeah, we can have showdowns at the schoolyard and use nerds as indians!"
806,Bart,"grampa, he's not dead!"
7874,Bart,what's a macgyver and why does it have a convention?
11165,Bart,yeah.
5589,Bart,nuh-uh!

659,Bart,like to see you fit.
8217,Bart,"no lunch for me...unless i ""scare"" one up."
13079,Bart,uh... apu.
8699,Bart,you'd think a house full of crazy people would be fun. it's actually really depressing.
3576,Bart,and you'll never baby-sit again!
10038,Bart,well...
7020,Bart,did we ever turn off that shower nozzle?
5572,Bart,oh yeah...
5836,Bart,which way should we go?
1267,Bart,"dad, you're a hero!"
4890,Bart,fine. i don't care what you're doin'.
8988,Bart,mycube! take me away!
9135,Bart,uh... it's not an easy thing to admit.
9713,Bart,we need a third maid. maybe someone will step in and help.
4063,Bart,"um, hey, dad, i, i think he wants a..."
12075,Bart,i'm here to see grampa.
11033,Bart,what's the hurry?
9586,Bart,so i kinda like this girl at school but i'm not sure if she likes me back.
1490,Bart,"krusty, are you making any money?"
7375,Bart,"look, i need a place to hide out 'til the heat is off."
4442,Bart,nah. these days everything's done on computers.
545,Bart,"don't worry, dad, as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says, ""gravity is my co-pilot."""
11108,Bart,but there's really only one girl whose opinion matters to me. my mom.
10568,Bart,"hey, nametag! do you know who her boyfriend is? jimbo jones!"
4776,Bart,he hit us!
3544,Bart,this is an outrage! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world!
5535,Bart,eh.

503,Bart,we both had nightmares.
6642,Bart,"but you're not gonna get divorced like milhouse's parents, are you?"
5619,Bart,that was too close. maybe it's time to quit the game.

232,Bart,i tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
8696,Bart,"fine with me. look, i packed you a bag."

8415,Bart,dad?
1848,Bart,"don't worry, stampy. i won't let homer sell you to that ivory dealer."
5621,Bart,"wow, he did."

1717,Bart,"it's not just a megaphone, dad. it's a rapmaster 2000."
1536,Bart,uh-oh.
2721,Bart,"but milhouse! they haven't cured anything. heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. every last one of them. want results? you have to go to the schwarzeneggers, the stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the van dammes."

12866,Bart,why are we all dressed up?
6579,Bart,"finally, a simpson has a trophy without a bowling ball on it."
10950,Bart,"that's the way people talk about ralph! ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter!"
1866,Bart,"i just don't want to be here, dad. besides, i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on."
6249,Bart,"wow, i made it! my week-long dream has come true."

5749,Bart,lisa's your teammate?
1413,Bart,lie in the snow and count to sixty.
4079,Bart,"i kinda think it's cool. just pretend you're in a zombie movie. besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc."
6573,Bart,"nelson, how was your summer?"
1488,Bart,well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
6655,Bart,i'll save you!

5954,Bart,i'm cold and scared.
5623,Bart,"oh, this is terrible. now who do we give the money to?"
10672,Bart,"if you don't act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends."
2229,Bart,that's very disturbing.
2498,Bart,"twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four..."
2741,Bart,"there was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though."
7707,Bart,i heard ol' neil put her down.
12372,Bart,"hey, come on guys. quit being so grabby."

1101,Bart,"dad, you gotta let me see that movie. can't you just give me a spanking?"
780,Bart,"uh, i don't know."
3312,Bart,but then they'll just beat me up even worse.
9601,Bart,"yeah, till they find out about us."
8716,Bart,oh. i thought she was peeing out of her nipple.
7902,Bart,"i'm gonna call you ""toilet."""
3307,Bart,"well, not really... 'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord..."
6614,Bart,y'see? this is the stuff mom won't do with me.

7510,Bart,no thanks -- the vending machines at school feed me now.
10888,Bart,doges?! why do we have to play this stupid game lisa likes?
6181,Bart,is that her?

9493,Bart,are you sure you're okay?

9138,Bart,"yeah, i meant to, i've just been sooo busy. my schedule has been all like ."
5898,Bart,and he gambles like crazy.
12109,Bart,one more time.
860,Bart,"thanks, mom. now. let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."
10319,Bart,and best of all i got funding for my homer humiliator.
3784,Bart,"cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything i stand for. i don't think i can survive here, lis."
8630,Bart,"aw, but hers was better!"
1254,Bart,"c'mon, lis. we both know how this money should, nay, must be spent."
8943,Bart,why won't you come down?!
3874,Bart,uh-oh.
3265,Bart,maybe it was just the cat.
413,Bart,"don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
3830,Bart,"well, i don't see how me signing homer's name is any different from you using sgt. skinner's name."
4304,Bart,"ready, milhouse?"
11205,Bart,you don't know what rough is.
2154,Bart,oh my god! the dead have risen and they're voting republican!

1578,Bart,"otto, you gotta do something! there's a gremlin on the side of the bus!"
5571,Bart,rusty the clown?! springfield gets the lamest balloons.
3138,Bart,maybe when we find something decent to do with this i.d.
8186,Bart,"no, i'm not, but--"
6109,Bart,"wow, this bus station is the birthplace of paul shaffer."
5928,Bart,"wow, tear gas, riot club, police hat..."
8243,Bart,i think i just got dumped.
1137,Bart,"nervous, lis? i don't blame you. this is where the winfields hid their mutated son."
9043,Bart,kid at school.
1493,Bart,i didn't know you knew luke perry!
3640,Bart,"oh, no problemo. so, i guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh?"
6589,Bart,why don't you ask those guys?
6558,Bart,"please, i'm trying to keep it quiet. catch ya later, tony hawk."
6739,Bart,"lisa, it says one year and up."

8749,Bart,i didn't know cletus was your dad.
1388,Bart,arrrgh!
1381,Bart,i've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? he must have a weakness.

9832,Bart,school bus!
8940,Bart,"wow, only you survived which means the entire fortune went to you."
12777,Bart,"better than all right, i got stitches."
10666,Bart,which one? homer or fat ass?
4362,Bart,no way.
9005,Bart,did you factor in one bald idiot?
590,Bart,"excuse me, i'm looking for --"
2830,Bart,"uh, may i take your coat, aunt selma?"
8746,Bart,"hmmm, a cow on a farm... with a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... yes, it works!"
7966,Bart,"sorry, sorry, sorry!"
5733,Bart,cool!
10316,Bart,check it out.
2083,Bart,"well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the french say, ""bartesque."""
10769,Bart,i don't hear anything.
547,Bart,"hey man, cool crash. way to cheat death."
12158,Bart,"hi, man."

7985,Bart,"lisa, you've got to be more careful! i need you to teach me all about the world of juzz."
13084,Bart,"don't have a cow, man."
1405,Bart,it was just an april fool's joke.
8413,Bart,"give 'em hell, homer."
9511,Bart,"wait, here comes the ""mykeeyah."""
7828,Bart,hee-eere.
5779,Bart,"grazie, springfield!"
1909,Bart,"what? no, it's my dog!"
6879,Bart,you don't understand -- i can't go home! you gotta give me detention. look -- i fed the gerbil coffee!
10551,Bart,"wait, dreams have rules?"
6657,Bart,they took the bait. let's go.
7552,Bart,instead of video games they have weird free newspapers.
1879,Bart,"well, for all intents and purposes."
2560,Bart,i'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on his percodan addiction.
12418,Bart,"i'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me."
7840,Bart,"where'd it go?! where'd it go?! oh, it's in the cap."
11733,Bart,"way to go, george mucus. the fattest, stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles."
1523,Bart,i'm going to kill you.
1136,Bart,"the truth is, there was no wolf. i faked the whole thing. i'm just going to lie on the floor now. please don't let me swallow my tongue."
7319,Bart,you really think my shirts will sell?
3067,Bart,"look alive, simpson! i'm not paying you to goldbrick!"
8020,Bart,"i'm not a big fan of detention. you might say, it drives me nuts."
10853,Bart,"dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? we're already bored."
9730,Bart,"uh, you missed the turn-off, mr. warren."
3259,Bart,"i guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough, but it did teach you a lesson: it's important to be yourself."
10977,Bart,pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.
1912,Bart,"yeah, i guess it is guilt."
9086,Bart,oh yeah. / that's it.
1477,Bart,did you see that?
9060,Bart,just don't stretch it out.
4734,Bart,do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
7406,Bart,"no, cash."
3716,Bart,"here, boy! come on!"
9831,Bart,i'm not a bully! it's just a series of incredible coincidences!
3144,Bart,"cruise control, my good man. everybody all set back here? nelson, good to see you! martin, always a pleasure..."
11580,Bart,"i'm gonna prove you did groundbreaking work. krusty, i want you to binge-watch all the shows you've ever done."

8098,Bart,"nelson, do you ever wish you weren't a bully?"
10613,Bart,i woke up and the money jar was full! that means the devil accepted my bargain. now to uphold my end of the deal!
4553,Bart,really?
951,Bart,"i think we should get a machine gun. we could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!"
2166,Bart,"don't you remember, dad? flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world."
2427,Bart,"hey, g.i. joe, your sign's broken. we're already in australia."
923,Bart,"yeah, right. anyway... do you want to do something after school?"
1964,Bart,the system works. just ask claus von bulow.
2190,Bart,must... fight... satan. make it... up to him... later.
3670,Bart,"uh, to the best of my recollection, yes."
4243,Bart,"ohh, i found something all right."
10440,Bart,"helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
3083,Bart,huh?
3676,Bart,"oh no, repo men. laddie, hide behind that bush there."
22,Bart,i guess this is a good time to tell you i've been a double agent all this time. but now i am totally on your side.
12475,Bart,"is it ready? ha, what a question. fellow students, prepare to be dazzled. well, as mrs. krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that i read was ""treasure island""."
3623,Bart,okay. that one.
8489,Bart,"oh my god, look at these poll numbers."
8025,Bart,no one teaches me history!
9454,Bart,"princess, before you marry krusty, there's someone you should meet..."
6930,Bart,"okay i've been studying frink's robot, and i've discovered he has one small weak spot."
9781,Bart,"no, no, no, no. i got a lot goin' on."
13101,Bart,"hi, mrs. k. this is sure weird, huh?"
4203,Bart,"yes, sir."
6832,Bart,"'e claimed he was me father, he did."
299,Bart,"rudy my man, you're a miracle worker."
5700,Bart,looks like we're down to our last ten bucks hello.
9333,Bart,"all right, i'll watch a dvd."
8085,Bart,"okay, just walk in, say happy birthday, and get out."
9322,Bart,"no, no, no. you're too young to be a witch. savor the steps leading up to it: college anorexic, string of bad marriages, career disappointments, failed pottery shop. and then when you're old and alone, you can hit the witch thing hard."
4522,Bart,uh-oh.
12689,Bart,"mom, do i have to?"
6257,Bart,"okay, let's hear it."
314,Bart,"akira, my good man. when do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"

8374,Bart,"dammit, these blueprints are all wrong! where's the roller coaster room? and the shark tank?"
9783,Bart,testing...
8332,Bart,"hey, mom, can we go see dad put out the fire?"
1726,Bart,...and then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody?
9367,Bart,i'd give my brother everything i have! he could be the race car in monopoly! monopoly! the race car!

3682,Bart,"mom, can i feed laddie at the table?"
12310,Bart,"oh, thanks, man. whoa, look at the size of this thing. i wonder if it really works."
5859,Bart,what's it like riding a girl's bike?
8520,Bart,you want to know what i think?

10050,Bart,hey homer! you want to be the voice of angry dad?
10254,Bart,"i've never said this before, but i'd like to learn more!"

3942,Bart,"so what's the charge, chief? vandalism? smoking?"
10387,Bart,is there any better feeling than waiting for a live krusty show to start?
8705,Bart,"hey, check it out!"
9090,Bart,"hey, i just spent ten hours on a plane. i'm stayin' here. they've got german ""krusty"" on tv!"
9640,Bart,"don't worry. i gave 'em a pop tart. the healthy kind, strawberry-frosted."
2497,Bart,two sets of twins and a triplet!
7916,Bart,wait a minute -- do you know why you did good at math?
3421,Bart,i have a watch with a minute hand.
4760,Bart,cool. even this menu is made of meat. it's an entire chicken pounded flat.
11549,Bart,"a chicken feather? why would you hand this to me? oh, you must've figured out i chickened out during the race! well who are you to judge me?!"
11234,Bart,"to avoid temptation, i'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. i buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard."
2411,Bart,"one moment, please."
9154,Bart,"hit me again, 'pu."
11266,Bart,and wand.
10186,Bart,"hey lis, those books aren't gonna pick themselves up."

1366,Bart,huh?
9930,Bart,i don't even want to smell sparkling apple juice again.
4342,Bart,"""dear bart, i came to this country, hoping to share the american dream. but after many years of back-breaking labor, i find myself homeless and sleeping in a junkyard."""
1856,Bart,"ow. anyway, i want him to go to that animal refuge."
7989,Bart,not smoking reefer!
949,Bart,"unky herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
8147,Bart,"nicely done, lis. instead of killing living things, they're just killing trees."
558,Bart,let's rock.
6321,Bart,lisa is a dork. lisa is a dork.
12776,Bart,oof!
8667,Bart,"oh man, i'm too pretty to go to jail. you don't know how lucky you are."

6912,Bart,"face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. but you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. that's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news."
8449,Bart,why did you come to our world?
7621,Bart,again!
6192,Bart,i'm on it.

4135,Bart,"well, if you're running the show, how could you leave out, krusty the clown?"
7,Bart,the only thing that looks good on this stupid planet are the bananas.
7387,Bart,i lied about being kidnapped. the whole thing was a hoax.
8938,Bart,"oh, mr. burns! i'm really sorry!"
8388,Bart,the hot dog water's gonna push us into the fan!

8588,Bart,let's take a ride. i got a place with a view.
3694,Bart,"uh, dad? laddie's not coming. i gave him away."
3059,Bart,"krusty's tired of having phonies around, pretending to be his friends. i'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is."
7126,Bart,"what is your deal, anyway?"
3970,Bart,so long! / good-bye! / good luck!
10781,Bart,"fine, fine."
4395,Bart,"the world is completely different on a weekday morning. banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity..."
1276,Bart,can we go to duff gardens this weekend?
2004,Bart,"well, me and milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer."
4961,Bart,"i think it's the bright blue pants. i mean, you're not on a golf course."
12382,Bart,"but you gotta help me. these two guys i'm staying with, they work me day and night, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the..."

5516,Bart,"dad, you got syrup on your sash."
6576,Bart,imply. i-m-p...
7447,Bart,"we understand, ma'am. we're pretty lousy kids."
9630,Bart,you can't hurt what's already dead.

12612,Bart,this better be good.
8611,Bart,"normally, you can't even buy these. you have to buy the ostrich and wait."
2750,Bart,how much you got?
12059,Bart,"i'm gonna miss you, big guy."
6915,Bart,awesome! i gotta tell milhouse.
10733,Bart,"uh, well, since we're here, i'm gonna go try to get al roker's autograph."

2076,Bart,"suit yourself. but if you change your mind, here's my card."
12098,Bart,i won't have cowards in my army.
4214,Bart,don't talk. listen. the social order of elementary school is densely layered. the coolest kids are at the top.
6069,Bart,you can always find your favorite shows next month.

4725,Bart,"i didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows."
5476,Bart,rocks!
7756,Bart,"cool, i'm a street!"
9231,Bart,"hey... ""just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
11408,Bart,who's chester?
11586,Bart,"well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet."
4678,Bart,no! we have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. and i think i know how. why don't we...
6702,Bart,"if they don't, i've wasted a lot of my life."
12838,Bart,ow! quit it!
6858,Bart,"well, you're still my hero."
7783,Bart,"hey grampa, we got a letter for gramma."

7036,Bart,"hey dad, maybe this'll cheer you up. why you little..."
3681,Bart,"sorry, boy. i didn't plan this. it just sort of happened."
9158,Bart,"you've always been there for me, man. i'll never turn my back on you again."
4102,Bart,one at first. but he'll train others.
6795,Bart,"bravo, lisa. bra-vo."
956,Bart,"much obliged, doll."
8446,Bart,are you guys fighting over us?
3127,Bart,why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
6602,Bart,"congressman, i have a tape here of you using your free-mail privilege to send a get well card to your aunt."
10826,Bart,i've labeled all his boxes!
8306,Bart,"gee moe, you give great advice."
11957,Bart,"oh, no."
12919,Bart,uh oh.
7421,Bart,how am i supposed to know if i'm twenty feet away?
12135,Bart,i didn't do it. nobody saw me do it. there's no way they can prove anything.
11138,Bart,he laughed as he heard that old codger's house-sizzles.
6772,Bart,"wait, when people see all the stuff we did, they're gonna want to kill us."
1877,Bart,"hey, wait! how can you be here when your show's on live?"
5269,Bart,what's dad doing on the show?
1568,Bart,buh dmfl! the devil!

6701,Bart,"hey, i've got an idea. let's tie a string around a fly."
12050,Bart,but i can't squeal. it would violate the code of the school yard.
5522,Bart,"well, dad, you're mayor of a ghost town."
10405,Bart,nice save.
12095,Bart,go! go!
12865,Bart,it was like that when i got here.

12530,Bart,"thanks a lot, son."
10998,Bart,"you know it, glamorous. eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then i start fighting dirty."
11160,Bart,i'm afraid i am.
1346,Bart,"hey, girls. check out this president."
4346,Bart,"lisa, i've just arrived at the springfield dump. a lot of things get thrown out here. sometimes, even a human being. somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses..."
11780,Bart,ay carumba!

8984,Bart,"man, those are ugly kittens."
6639,Bart,oh. time to repress another memory.
1921,Bart,"yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge."
12468,Bart,"we know who you are, ms. botz. or should i say, ms. botzucowski. you're the babysitter bandit."
3534,Bart,all the best bands are affiliated with satan.
2544,Bart,in my weaker moments i almost pity them. then i just remind myself they're trying to teach.
9264,Bart,i was just doing the moves i learned from ultimate punching!
8094,Bart,"yeah, yeah, it was uh, super fun. good times. hey, ralph! have i got a half a sandwich for you."
8747,Bart,"all right, lou! to freedom! lou?"

2132,Bart,sideshow bob! i'm only ten and i already got two mortal enemies.
3167,Bart,"lisa? this isn't working. i've got to courier something to springfield. and it's gotta be big enough to fit milhouse, martin, and nelson inside."
450,Bart,we'll put them on later. now can you give us the rabbi's address?
12499,Bart,"hey, otto-man. i've got a big test that i am not ready for. could you please crash the bus or something?"
2683,Bart,"nah, he's just a cheap imitation of radioactive man."
2367,Bart,huh?
5023,Bart,"don't worry, dad. we'll be dead in five minutes."
4562,Bart,whoa!
12906,Bart,excellent.

12851,Bart,"what? we could have bought tons of great stuff, mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if i'm wrong."
10875,Bart,"they will be, seymour. they will be."
12526,Bart,"otto, you know i respect you. i mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns..."
2746,Bart,"soul? come on, milhouse. there's no such thing as a soul. it's just something they made up to scare kids, like the boogeyman or michael jackson."
8405,Bart,etch... sketch... etch... sketch...
11299,Bart,"that's because jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""it was me who sent you to hell."""
6151,Bart,everything tastes better when it's lassoed.
4257,Bart,"hey, give it back!"
5238,Bart,"why are you taping flanders, dad?"
4731,Bart,i did not.
3920,Bart,since when?
12256,Bart,c'mon lis. school bus.
5460,Bart,"mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot."
5466,Bart,"i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school, and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt."
3032,Bart,"lisa's autograph... apu's autograph... oh, whaddaya know, jimbo's real name is corky... aannnnd krusty... hey! ""cayman islands offshore holding corporation""?"
10001,Bart,don't you minimize me!

3049,Bart,"wait a minute! all those things i saw -- there's a connection! the truck full of nets and buckets, the queasy guy, the lobsters... they all point to one thing. follow me."
5244,Bart,cheeky.
4597,Bart,whooa!
537,Bart,"thanks, but i'm almost done. why don't you get back on the couch and watch tv?"
7474,Bart,my baby turtle crawled into your basement window.
12186,Bart,how do you know?
3751,Bart,"hey, i'm a busy man. you want a job or not?"
9451,Bart,milhouse van houten...will you do me the honor of ruining krusty's wedding with me?
2335,Bart,or a fjord.
8110,Bart,"sorry, i was uh... stealing loose grapes at the grocery store."
4673,Bart,"oh no, it won't."
11275,Bart,thank you sir!
1926,Bart,"it's weird, lis. i miss him as a friend, but i miss him even more as an enemy."
7147,Bart,"lis, you awake?"
2988,Bart,"who are you talking to, homer?"
10102,Bart,homer.
7844,Bart,because i'm a screw-up. my sister's the smart one -- all i do is get in trouble.
4017,Bart,wake up dad / you're singing a song!
1927,Bart,"if there was some way to get rid of flanders, would you want to come back?"
12504,Bart,why'd they leave england?
10714,Bart,"c'mon, dad. you love new york. now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: old penn station and shea stadium."
7081,Bart,yeah? why would they believe you?
7368,Bart,"damn, this ride is pimped-out."
6704,Bart,the fly's stuck in flanders' house!
4142,Bart,"oh sure, there were a lotta laughs. y-you probably couldn't hear 'em, the acoustics were so bad."
12387,Bart,mon sauveteur! vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur!
8202,Bart,utah karate!
8378,Bart,"me? uh, i'm... ahmed adoody."
8171,Bart,"hey, guys. i'll see you in a bit. i entered a thousand mile baja road race."
9588,Bart,"whoa, she boards, too?"
3622,Bart,"oh, can't i just turn the page for you?"
2460,Bart,"go ahead and laugh. but i took a chance and did something i wanted to do. and if that makes me a sissy, well then, i guess i'm a sissy."
4160,Bart,"thank you. thank you. and now, the all new comedy stylings of... krrrusty the clown..."
4536,Bart,"oh, no!"
10100,Bart,"dad, how could you do that? the whole audience saw me pee my pants!"
6892,Bart,"hey, milhouse! oh, what's this?"
9276,Bart,"mom, that's a beautiful thought."
8649,Bart,i'm filled with rue!
13113,Bart,"which one? radioactive, smallpox, eternal midnight..."
6654,Bart,i thought you guys lived off the land. how come you're selling junk to jerks like us?
11828,Bart,ow! quit it.

10910,Bart,it's eight in the morning!
3249,Bart,fresh out.
3270,Bart,"you expect me to believe all this? if any of it was true, wouldn't i have a big, hideous scar..."
5851,Bart,that's milhouse.
7741,Bart,"mom, i really did like hanging out with you."
6287,Bart,ow!
9720,Bart,"aww, the little guy can't get out of the pumpkin. there must be something here!"

4341,Bart,"oh, so many souls, so little air time."
5493,Bart,"eh, she seems nice. i'm gonna go with my gut and trust her."

4788,Bart,"man, captivity blows."
1710,Bart,dad! we've been robbed!
5797,Bart,"oww! hot, hot, hot!"
8274,Bart,"i'm putting in my ""catch a rising krusty"" doll!"
1112,Bart,you guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
5416,Bart,"yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives."
8968,Bart,pg-13.
11289,Bart,"oh man, i would love to pirate that."
5503,Bart,"whoa, a badger! sorry man, you can't crash here. c'mon, let's go."
6390,Bart,"oh cool, the old ""batman"" show."
12968,Bart,"...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?"
11788,Bart,"whoa, that is the best deal any songwriter ever got. and that's true even if i don't get the brownies. i'm in."
4826,Bart,"well, i'm flunkin' math, and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse."
6,Bart,no thanks.
2218,Bart,"oh, the glue will slow me down."
8023,Bart,"good morning, seymour. you may be wondering what i'm doing with this hat full of maggots..."
9892,Bart,"why is it coming with us? and for once, i'm not talkin' about lisa."
8071,Bart,she's been gone for a while.
3188,Bart,"great story, grampa. coulda used a vampire, though. 'night."
4672,Bart,lis! no! it's prime-time!

5747,Bart,"i may have the looks, but he's the trophy husband."
46,Bart,what?
9491,Bart,you don't look fat.
3966,Bart,not in my damn house.
1278,Bart,"to get to duff gardens, i'd ride with satan himself."
2419,Bart,i can handle that. i'm an expert at phony apologies.

10729,Bart,i could listen to your twang all day.
1352,Bart,allow me to demonstrate.
7074,Bart,"not so tough now, huh?"
6869,Bart,can we get our big christmas tree now?

7295,Bart,"sergeant activity, your mission is to scale the icy walls of mount bloodkill!"
5781,Bart,who are you?
4119,Bart,"after careful deliberation, it's my opinion that milhouse probably did eat the food. but since there's no proof, i must find him not guilty."
2405,Bart,yes. yes i do.
8638,Bart,"a lot of people blow, but no one blows like you."
805,Bart,"what are you gonna do, homer?"
13034,Bart,"me, too, mom. i think they're drifting apart."

6344,Bart,"hey, let's get one of those home satellite dishes! then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat."
10389,Bart,"milhouse, i'm gonna win that thing."
5788,Bart,"screw you, man! we're gonna play it anyway!"
6177,Bart,can i tag along?
9386,Bart,...and murder and swears and brains and basements...
9041,Bart,what are you doing?
1017,Bart,"tell it, daddy!"
9395,Bart,i'unno.
2725,Bart,but they told us to wear 'em.
3781,Bart,i want to quit and come home.
2164,Bart,"homer, change channel!"
11050,Bart,"for every one of my cartoons that you erase, i rip up a family vacation photo. and just so you know i mean business, here's an ear!"
6897,Bart,"oh man, i sure wish i had a ten-speed bike."
4956,Bart,it's from the book.
1396,Bart,it was an amusing episode... of our lives.
13129,Bart,"hey, that rundown old house looks familiar! that's where doc frink used to live!"
12153,Bart,me three. what are we talking about?
261,Bart,hey... you.
8752,Bart,d.q.a.t.?
1021,Bart,"ooop, i got him."
670,Bart,so even though i'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. it's not...
6840,Bart,"i'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. and then, finally, i can eat my shorts."
8288,Bart,"actually, it's saturday."
10805,Bart,"dad, over here!"
10299,Bart,"and whatever you do, avoid the urge to make homemade gifts."
2910,Bart,"oh, i'll never get that game."
4564,Bart,"oh, man!"
2563,Bart,"oh, my stomach!"
9925,Bart,"me and milhouse had a snowball fight, then an ice-ball fight, then a fight-fight!"
9164,Bart,"dad, yes!"
883,Bart,otto-man?
7077,Bart,i'm gettin' out in two weeks. why would i want to break out with you?
2482,Bart,ow! hey watch those virtual darts. i'm trying to play virtual pool!
10647,Bart,"lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! mom and dad, you were more happy and in love than i ever saw you!"
1626,Bart,rudiger.
8928,Bart,just sit tight -- i'm sending a car.
779,Bart,hmm.
10576,Bart,i stole this...
2082,Bart,"well, the important thing is that we survived."
6492,Bart,"come on, mom, let's go."
2346,Bart,then why no pictures?
3937,Bart,"you don't get it, do you? i don't want to be your stupid quarterback! i quit!"
1011,Bart,"hey, where's homer?"
11634,Bart,penal.
1483,Bart,yes they do.
4642,Bart,"try not to move, dad. you swallowed a lot of motor oil."
8560,Bart,the nineties? never heard of it.
10528,Bart,count me in.
2747,Bart,"well, if your soul's real, where is it?"
8713,Bart,"awww... looks like we're partners. you're a scrappy little misfit, just like me... anyone want to trade? no reasonable offer refused. i'll take a chicken!"
4330,Bart,one man. no ducks. lisa?
3413,Bart,"hey, what's going on?! wait, wait! hey, let go of me!..."
2239,Bart,"jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
2979,Bart,how do you know it's from mad?
2996,Bart,"did your secret service goons ever whack anybody, george?"
11556,Bart,hey everyone. i sure got a lot of attention for winning this year's race around the school.
1675,Bart,"the guys who wrote this show don't know squat. itchy should have tied scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend."
5280,Bart,"hey, i bought it from a guy on your reservation."
2208,Bart,oh yeah? i'll prove it.
238,Bart,"yes. ""are you quick to anger?"""
3186,Bart,"mmm-hmm. you bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town. how come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?"
6816,Bart,next!
477,Bart,i can do that but i don't wanna.
11822,Bart,"all right, the mall!"
2701,Bart,i just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. george burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
6546,Bart,"boy, it's really empty in here."
7082,Bart,but you've got twenty pounds on me!
7685,Bart,thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
4359,Bart,"see you in hell, brussel sprouts."
2462,Bart,why did she just leave me here when i clearly need medical attention?
3983,Bart,"oh, aunt selma. always good for a fin. whoa-ho-ho. here we go."
2729,Bart,i hate this place.
220,Bart,wow! a big ugly head!
9829,Bart,"i'm just whistlin', man."
9028,Bart,"homer, that guy's your age?"
4577,Bart,hmm...
6332,Bart,"""homer, i need cash or they're gonna break my legs."""
7288,Bart,i'm not gonna grow up!
3848,Bart,"d, e... um... line?"
6931,Bart,uh-oh. his weak spot is now his strongest point.
2814,Bart,okay boy. catch the frisbee.
7944,Bart,not if i spend the whole time running around like this.
2265,Bart,"mom, will you stop showin' us those?"
5602,Bart,"this book has all the classic cons. there's ""the pigeon drop,"" ""the ear wigger,"" ""the brillstein grab..."""
7847,Bart,i need an operation?
8042,Bart,"i don't think so. in fact, why don't you give me your lunch money?"
5255,Bart,can it wait? i just got off work!
2704,Bart,milhouse!
12752,Bart,"hey, lis! lisa! it's me, bart!"
6218,Bart,there's gotta be a million kids here. we'll never find ronaldo.
2728,Bart,"here you go, todd. the city edition."
12051,Bart,"look, everybody. i would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. i'm not saying i'm not a hero. i'm just saying that i fear for my safety."
12424,Bart,"sideshow bob, can we ask you a few--"
12813,Bart,really? what kind of robots?
13013,Bart,bitchin'.
5764,Bart,you looked!
12441,Bart,awww... homer!
9004,Bart,i can't believe your dad gets paid to blow stuff up.
6949,Bart,he'll never see it.
5523,Bart,"don't give up, dad. maybe we can get the who to play here instead."
3591,Bart,what are yew lookin' at?
2344,Bart,"dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight."
8628,Bart,"whatcha doin', mom? goin' crazy?"
5287,Bart,or the incident with the over-salted fries...
6545,Bart,"being a free man is great, milhouse. i can draw on myself with a magic marker."
7267,Bart,"c'mon, boy. take your pill."
2152,Bart,heyyy...
361,Bart,"oh... i dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
7396,Bart,sweet. fresh meat.
4897,Bart,"mom, lis! check it out. dad's on tv."
5393,Bart,"you did it, dad!"
5271,Bart,"yeah, but i really wanna..."
1579,Bart,eyahh! everybody! there's a monster on the side of the bus!
7520,Bart,i'm not fat!
12570,Bart,"i passed! i passed! i passed! i passed! i got a d minus. i passed!... i got a d minus. i passed!... i got a d minus. i passed! i passed! i kissed the teacher. peh, peh, peh peh."
12303,Bart,"yeah. you did! you told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. at least that way you won't make things worse."
5905,Bart,can't live this way... anymore.
1795,Bart,hello! pay attention to me! look at me! i'm bart! i'm bart! look at me! look at me! look at me!
6324,Bart,what are you lookin' at?
7162,Bart,...for me.
5793,Bart,now we gotta send them a basket.
10308,Bart,or do they?
10071,Bart,oh my god! the legends are true!
11859,Bart,"sorry, dad."
4955,Bart,"well, this has been terrific. let's do it again sometime."
3241,Bart,last one in is a yearbook editor!
6534,Bart,"mom, you've always been cool to me. but homer is a lousy dad and i'm not gonna take it anymore."
11447,Bart,you can't buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.
1228,Bart,i know a new song.
5558,Bart,"ah, yes. ghastly business, that."
8536,Bart,"oh my god, it's beautiful! are you buying this?"
6055,Bart,"no objections, eh? oh, that's great."
12962,Bart,"like a hose, your wrinkled highness."
2915,Bart,"then may i please rent it, please?"
3110,Bart,it's there!
11245,Bart,skinner didn't let me go.
2092,Bart,"you're a shoo-in now, lis."
6090,Bart,sey-mour...
11079,Bart,well... you are the first thing i took care of that didn't die.
2481,Bart,"anyway, hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. i also crush cars into cubes. and on the side, i promote local tough man contests. basically i'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til i go to law school."
4074,Bart,mom. get him away from the window.
6835,Bart,dad!
11454,Bart,whoa.
6291,Bart,contagious? outrageous!
5145,Bart,"all right, food!"
14,Bart,"uh... it's a place on the other side of this planet that's... very rainy so you can only see one moon. you know, like portland."
6360,Bart,"an ""a""? copacetic."
11247,Bart,"i know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but i got screwed. is there anything you can do?"
5498,Bart,woo hoo! yay snorky!
12070,Bart,gotcha.
5590,Bart,"maybe i can make some money, dad. my magic act is really coming along."
9294,Bart,slice her like a bagel!
9001,Bart,salaam alaikum.
2303,Bart,can i sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a u.f.o. does come?
12864,Bart,"hey, this is good stuff."
8307,Bart,whatever. i'm gonna go play outside.
2102,Bart,"watch this, lis. you can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
7915,Bart,fight! fight! fight!
3987,Bart,uh-oh.
7677,Bart,this is all my fault! i planted mom's bra in milhouse's parents' bed!
6948,Bart,he'll never read it.
500,Bart,you got it.
6689,Bart,"i think he left a ""big hug"" in your lunch box."
1391,Bart,"i love you, dad."
6292,Bart,i got me some teachers to lick.
2319,Bart,"right here, dad."
10185,Bart,"what's wrong, man?"
11376,Bart,wait. when will i see you? you can't quit the falconry club!
10603,Bart,"sorry kid, but there comes a day when that just doesn't do anything anymore."
10774,Bart,"write stupid stuff on the chalkboard. and if you have any ideas, i'm really running out. today's was ""mousetraps are not slippers"" or something. now what are you up to?"
5662,Bart,underachiever and proud of it? how old is this thing?
9904,Bart,"great, mom. now i lost track of my pump count. one pump, two pump..."
8609,Bart,"don't worry, we'll get him out in a couple hours."
12196,Bart,uh homer. bees!
12706,Bart,got it. now what?
7997,Bart,this benefit concert is gonna be scooby dooby.
8206,Bart,"you know, for a while, i was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad."
4268,Bart,"uh-oh, let's get out of here."
534,Bart,"well, as three-time soapbox derby champ ronnie beck says, ""poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
5565,Bart,"mercury, venus, earth, mars..."
5044,Bart,it does. but it's smooth and mild. and refreshingly addictive.
5102,Bart,deal!
9668,Bart,...scores on battle ball!
2703,Bart,"hi, milhouse. hey, i want you to know that i'm glad at least one of us got the part."
410,Bart,nah.
2613,Bart,"well, i know you are, but what am i?"
10829,Bart,santa's little helper! santa's little helllper!
11005,Bart,but i'm so pretty.
4872,Bart,"i don't get it, grampa. if you guys like all that boring stuff, why did you follow me out here?"
5782,Bart,"well, it says here your name is ""l.t. smash."""
7258,Bart,what are you doing in my jammies?
6133,Bart,"hey, wait a minute. these animals are stuffed."
1526,Bart,that's good.
7984,Bart,i was jamming with skinny turner and marbles le marquez! and they want me to join their trio!
4515,Bart,crooked sight?
1817,Bart,i'm tired. i'm hungry. can't we just buy a new house?
11478,Bart,"every time i do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist."
12252,Bart,"g-o-o-o-d morning, everybody."
12305,Bart,"yeah, right."
5464,Bart,tv families were always hugging and tackling issues.
3573,Bart,"yah! oh, cool, it must be dislocated or something..."
5813,Bart,all night. you were yelling at the swing.
6981,Bart,"lis, you are so dead."
8834,Bart,"what, do you think i'm crazy?"
12403,Bart,i wish i could believe you.
2012,Bart,"look, lis, i snatched five bathing suits. all martin's!"
10800,Bart,i'm the son of an oaf.
2800,Bart,"hey, that's my chop!"
1165,Bart,you're not my grampa.
4414,Bart,"well, you should have thought of that before i glued all this stuff to my face."
9810,Bart,that blank can be any letter we want!
11624,Bart,"yeah, sure."
5212,Bart,this horse is pretty fast. maybe we can race him.
678,Bart,"dad, i promise you i will never get tired of this."
7876,Bart,"also, i can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and..."
9274,Bart,"and mom, if you punch him in the junk, you'll get no disrespect from me."
9252,Bart,"listen... i was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
7721,Bart,"sorry, milhouse, i've got plans."
8553,Bart,let her figure out someone to dump it on.
4465,Bart,i thought he invented the light bulb.
418,Bart,"hey mom, i'm friends with milhouse again."
11347,Bart,wow.
13125,Bart,"cheer up, milhouse. you got your whole life ahead of you."
8590,Bart,check this out.
3904,Bart,"come on, smelly!"
2320,Bart,alaska!
9577,Bart,"oh man, you girls ruin everything -- even vampires."
6275,Bart,"if you love me so much, why don't you marry me? that's a good one."
3828,Bart,"hey, armin."
8323,Bart,i can't take it anymore!
5811,Bart,"no i don't, that's the problem."
2571,Bart,"hello, i'm dr. cheeks. i'm doing my rounds and uh, i'm a little behind."
4722,Bart,"i hope you're happy, nelson."
1088,Bart,indeed i did.
7940,Bart,gotta go.
8683,Bart,oh yeah? they made you build this statue.
5030,Bart,you mean grampa's old farm?
10140,Bart,"the name's ""bart."""
10300,Bart,"oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee?"
6132,Bart,whew. safe at last. now i'll just turn around and confirm that safety.
12198,Bart,what?
4097,Bart,go apple!
10956,Bart,"all right, let's just use a razor."
968,Bart,"i'd also like to add as i gaze upon your beauty, i've never seen an angel fly so low."
3972,Bart,"aww, thanks, mom."
1584,Bart,"look at the bus! i was right, i tell ya! i was right!"
4688,Bart,you can't make us come down.
11589,Bart,the cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
9531,Bart,focused...
2681,Bart,"d.n.a., positive i.d. -- those won't hold up in any court -- run, dad!"
1749,Bart,there's my name. right there. bart simpson.
3485,Bart,"what are you talking about, homer? where are we going?"
11462,Bart,i helped snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. it was an honorable arrangement. but i never thought he'd steal from you.
9836,Bart,what does your note say?
1818,Bart,"amen, ernie."
12269,Bart,"well, that's my story. and if you still want to tear apart this young sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, i await your wrath."
4463,Bart,remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
255,Bart,"yes dad, i solemnly swear i will not tell another living soul... no, not even milhouse."
10002,Bart,how can i earn money to buy the world's most awesome thing?
9117,Bart,"when she talks to me, i feel like a better person."
6182,Bart,is that her?
9074,Bart,"hit the road, ya big load!"
5644,Bart,hey!
10843,Bart,"dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?"
7848,Bart,and that's why i didn't have time to study for my geography test.
10821,Bart,"ah relax, i'm over it. why aren't you at the block party?"
12537,Bart,perhaps another demonstration.
11047,Bart,now to leave a nice clean trail of bugs out of the swamp... the frogs follow... and hooper's got a plague he can't handle.
2402,Bart,"we understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not."
5367,Bart,"you're not gonna believe it, lis! this cool indian guy showed me our future!"
1261,Bart,"but now, i want to follow in your footsteps."
10392,Bart,read to lisa? why don't you just ask me to kiss her?
2527,Bart,"well, i had to clean it up a little."
3989,Bart,who designed this house?!
12947,Bart,they hate each other.
6910,Bart,uh-oh.
6882,Bart,"mom, i locked your keys in the car."
8804,Bart,now i'm a jack-o-lantern...
2873,Bart,"free 'n' easy, lis. ahh. there's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
8150,Bart,ay carumba!
3115,Bart,ow!
11995,Bart,"kiss you? but, dad, i'm your kid!"
3209,Bart,"hey, what's this one for?"
7046,Bart,but the bread's still dancing!
3016,Bart,"aww, raspberries."
10164,Bart,"oh, man!"
12218,Bart,our teacher.
2844,Bart,"bad news, dad, we're out of food. we're even out of the basic elements of food. you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce."
11282,Bart,"chins up, homer. you don't need a theater to watch the movie. you just have to illegally download it."
998,Bart,"krusty, this camp was a nightmare. they fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
7693,Bart,"yeah, maybe. what did you used to do?"
6309,Bart,does this thing suck or blow? suuuuck!
4540,Bart,"that bird i killed was their mother. i don't want her babies to die, too."
10842,Bart,"""learn zone?"" mom, you said we were going someplace fun."
3256,Bart,grammar rodeo -- head buccaroo.
10217,Bart,you shouldn't suffer for my bad deed. it should just go unpunished forever.
3273,Bart,you're crazy!
7217,Bart,learning is cool!
4815,Bart,hope i don't give you heartburn!
9900,Bart,"hey, i need those cookies for santa."
10502,Bart,it's like going to hawaii without the murderous locals!
441,Bart,"yeah, i've got a lot of fond memories."
9559,Bart,"destroy the school, eh?"
7515,Bart,"okay mom, for you, i'll try."
7429,Bart,can't i even finish my milk?
10549,Bart,what's goin' on? is this a joke?
10112,Bart,well you're not!
11823,Bart,"one ""mother"", please."
8572,Bart,"sorry i'm late -- i was in a car crash. many hurt, but nobody cool was harmed."
11126,Bart,the sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
1908,Bart,"boys and girls, mrs. krabappel, i come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- what has four legs and ticks?"
9543,Bart,the violence really relaxes me.
7107,Bart,cowabunga one to fat load.
948,Bart,what about the emmys?
30,Bart,lewis?
5758,Bart,"oh, it's you, bob. how ya doin'?"
3193,Bart,now we can get the treasure!
5113,Bart,"well, there's something you don't see every christmas."
3332,Bart,no.
6479,Bart,"i'm sorry, i can't read. mrs. krabappel never taught me to read!"
5672,Bart,cartoons don't have to make sense.
1235,Bart,stupid mailman... squeal on me...
11439,Bart,don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.
628,Bart,hmmm.
6317,Bart,can i have a beer?
2568,Bart,lunchlady doris! why are you here?
3762,Bart,"mardi gras, man! when the big easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!"
8494,Bart,fine. i'll call three numbers. what are they?
3165,Bart,i'm in trouble already. here's what happened...so you've got to think of a way i can come home for free.
3707,Bart,my name is bart simpson. i have to talk to you about your dog.
7780,Bart,i've gotta get dad a lousy tie!
5193,Bart,"sorry, dad. i can't just magically cure a broken leg."
10536,Bart,correction. it's worth ten times as much.
5240,Bart,got it.
1890,Bart,"mr. burns, i don't want to seem ungrateful. but, i want to go home to my family."
12682,Bart,"no answer? lisa, listen up."
2221,Bart,"uh, we should get to class."
4170,Bart,guard! guard!
9363,Bart,you're right -- i can't risk another girl. use whatever birth control you want. it's your body.
7451,Bart,i'm on it.
2256,Bart,i'm saved! i love being a s-s-s-simpson!
11640,Bart,"hey pal, what are you in here for?"
9808,Bart,"i wish i could see my mom one last time so i can say ""this is all your fault""!"
6960,Bart,"milhouse, why are you acting so crazy? did your imaginary friend try to kill you again?"
9489,Bart,now how am i supposed to get to soccer practice?
471,Bart,nope.
5511,Bart,"no, there's a badger in there."
4467,Bart,dad? what are you doin' here?
7535,Bart,"no fair, lisa didn't get sick."
8911,Bart,"hm, i don't know. i'm pretty attached to my family, and..."
5666,Bart,one of which?
10712,Bart,"mom, can we go to new york to find this girl i used to know?"
7635,Bart,i figured the best thing i could do is monitor the news for any reports.
10552,Bart,not me when i hit the dance floor!
1891,Bart,it's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
10070,Bart,"we can still order a replacement from the academy, right?"
4979,Bart,okay. sure.
11725,Bart,not enough ketchup!
4023,Bart,and it really does blow...
6322,Bart,"ne-e-ed, i'm ba-a-ack! give me a ki-i-iss."
12486,Bart,"yes, ma'am."
6251,Bart,"wow! ""angry dad""... an internet cartoon. i'll be in cyberspace next to the nabisco cookie web site."
13108,Bart,i guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
3079,Bart,the mouse.
11298,Bart,"well, no way i'm giving a valentine to nelson. he's a bully, and i do not love him."
10030,Bart,i don't want to talk about my mom's hair.
9708,Bart,really? hm. maybe i...
2055,Bart,uh... i'll save you by calling the police.

893,Bart,"what are you going to do, otto?"
4051,Bart,hose down the freaks?
11854,Bart,"come on, dog! go, man! go! come on santa's little helper! run baby run!"

2339,Bart,"get the camera ready, bart very seepy."
12638,Bart,"hey, dad, look, you're on jumbovision!"

1133,Bart,ivanhoe is the story of a russian farmer and his tool.
2441,Bart,"aw, who needs him. i can have fun all by myself."
9037,Bart,"dad, we need to have a talk."
9540,Bart,so much homework... childhood slipping away...
5674,Bart,i don't believe it. say something else smart.
4538,Bart,can't right now. come back later.
12494,Bart,"no, dad, i should really... whoop!"

3057,Bart,"but krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons? are you going to turn your back on them?"
9567,Bart,"dad, no! that takes us into a construction site!"
8013,Bart,"a fire?! i didn't start a fire in the teachers' lounge! i mean, what fire? i mean, a letter from school? please elaborate."

10530,Bart,"i carumba? not so loud! if my dad hears about the show, he might realize mr. fatso is him!"
3037,Bart,"i'm sorry for all the trouble i've caused you, krusty. but, you know, my mom says god never closes a door without opening a window."
1776,Bart,i didn't do it.
3292,Bart,"two, wintim amd jawwy wirt..."
2117,Bart,"i'll have the brain burger with extra pus, please."
2903,Bart,"no, let me try the cup and ball."
1328,Bart,will you teach me how to do that?
6258,Bart,wow! i think we have our angry dad.
4978,Bart,question.
4510,Bart,"no way. c'mon, quit hoggin' the gun."
835,Bart,bleuh.
10096,Bart,stop it!
5182,Bart,tes-ti-fy!!!
316,Bart,paying money to read books... the hell with this.
8523,Bart,i don't read the words. i just like when he punches people. how do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
9919,Bart,"oh c'mon, man. things aren't that bad."
9555,Bart,...and i'm not feeling the rush.
6784,Bart,gramma!
1106,Bart,tv sucks.
8381,Bart,yes what?
7014,Bart,"just because i have milhouse back, doesn't mean i haven't learned a few things about being a brother."
5326,Bart,i'm gonna!
12419,Bart,"so, you with me?"
6179,Bart,"what are those, grampa?"
12764,Bart,"hey, milhouse, crank it up."

7789,Bart,how's things with you and frank?
8822,Bart,nope... nope... nope...
4490,Bart,one stinkin' letter? why'd you make us gather 'round like that?
5885,Bart,"sorry, i've got a baseball game in fifteen minutes."
10249,Bart,"same garbage, different dumpster."
8573,Bart,huh?
11947,Bart,do you think i'm dumb enough to fall for that. i'm insulted.
1323,Bart,"oh yeah? remember this? ""higher, dad, higher!... whee, whee... push harder, dad!..."""
7425,Bart,no... you don't mean...
849,Bart,aunt selma has one hour to live!
6752,Bart,"cool... milhouse, do you have your change purse?"
8763,Bart,"lou, if that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it. maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy joes."
3071,Bart,makes sense to me.
4594,Bart,don't forget ken starr.
104,Bart,please dad.
3497,Bart,"dad, i'm scared."
10493,Bart,is there gas in these?
12409,Bart,"oh, man."
11172,Bart,ay carumba!
4558,Bart,"go, chirpy boy! go, bart junior!"
13065,Bart,now just relax. for once you didn't do anything wrong. just explain yourself and everyone will understand.
435,Bart,"yeah, just relax and be yourself."
12835,Bart,"oh, okay. see you later then."
10234,Bart,"if fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible."
2956,Bart,"okay, okay, i won't bug milhouse... but... well, mrs. van houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb, but can i hang out with you while you do mom stuff?"
6920,Bart,"well, i wish homer was here."
1074,Bart,poison pizza.
6935,Bart,dad?!
6673,Bart,"oh, that's it. you are going down."
12573,Bart,it is.
637,Bart,rod... todd... this is god.
5070,Bart,p.s. we've taken your old lady.
8105,Bart,"hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. it's offensive."
1771,Bart,yargghh!
12469,Bart,"you're crazy if you think you're gonna get away with this, lady. you can't --"
12629,Bart,"dear god, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'."
6227,Bart,but it's all worth it just to hear him sing.
10470,Bart,"luckily, she doesn't know that our viewing platforms are... multi."
2168,Bart,"hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. let's kill it."
1064,Bart,"zabar, kresge, caldor, walmart!"
1729,Bart,aha! the perfect escape!
8003,Bart,good morn-ing.
1107,Bart,"i'm not licked yet. i can entertain myself. no matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
12946,Bart,"bye, unky herb."
1703,Bart,woo hoo! jackpot!
2404,Bart,"she was right. stupid lisa science queen. look, why don't you just check your neighbor's drains. i'll hold."

5716,Bart,mark down the poochie crap. and then unstick all the supergirls.
4273,Bart,"operator, get me morningwood penitentiary. it's an emergency."
7436,Bart,"lis, just let me be!"
4016,Bart,"yeah, their guns are right there!"
2170,Bart,hey everybody! let's all turn our desks backwards before mrs. krabappel shows up!
93,Bart,i bet it's worth a million bucks!
10991,Bart,can i have one! can i?
3953,Bart,wow! i wish i had an elephant.
8242,Bart,huh? but we were doing such good work.
7200,Bart,"dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?"
289,Bart,"no thank you, i'd rather push this button."
10043,Bart,let me freshen that up for ya.
663,Bart,sting!
9607,Bart,"i don't get you! you're hot, you're cold... what is your deal?!"
4716,Bart,thanks! it's due tomorrow.
4855,Bart,that place sucks! the nurses don't let grampa do anything. they practically chew his food for him.
11804,Bart,"nine-thirty, starting in summer! mom said!"
7237,Bart,"i'm just spreadin' the playdude philosophy. hi-fi's, norman mailer, gettin' some..."
4790,Bart,how am i supposed to get up there?
1665,Bart,"i'm outta here, man."
2819,Bart,"um... we didn't mention groundskeeper willie, mom."
5024,Bart,it's a history lesson come to life.
12350,Bart,uh-oh.
12405,Bart,and his feet... they're so small.
1617,Bart,now just turn around and count to three.
1363,Bart,"oooh - wise guy, eh?"
7969,Bart,you said you meant to make brownies. any other lies?
9182,Bart,a deal's a deal.
10446,Bart,that's even sadder than being friends with milhouse!
287,Bart,"mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
10229,Bart,even on snow days?
10223,Bart,who says you're leaving?
8835,Bart,"mom, even milhouse has a cell phone! your son is lamer than milhouse! what does that say about you?!"
12676,Bart,okay.
7156,Bart,he was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
9217,Bart,"oh, no worries. i heard on the four-square court she's doin' great."
3930,Bart,"okay, bart. concentrate."
9246,Bart,but this place was your dream!
4543,Bart,i see a neck!

3879,Bart,mom! dad! i'm the real bart! that's just some overgrown fly with my body! somebody listen to me!
12001,Bart,these people are obviously freaks.
5021,Bart,wait a minute. they're not so great.
3886,Bart,must-drop-pantaloons.
6093,Bart,"oh, man. what a dork."
2614,Bart,"oh, i know you are, but what am i?"
2422,Bart,oh.
1976,Bart,shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
3558,Bart,i am!
12092,Bart,it bounces off us and sticks to you.
6532,Bart,i said i want a divorce from my parents.
7033,Bart,"yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed."
10196,Bart,time to get my mischief on!
9312,Bart,knock it off! that's my mom you're talkin' about.
10934,Bart,so this is where you go when mom kicks you out?
9497,Bart,"lis, what's going on? you're not normally this interesting."
6156,Bart,"dad, why are you wearing that?"
4563,Bart,that's snake's voice!
10936,Bart,"aw, man! we just missed it."
7619,Bart,a stamp museum?
6719,Bart,"hey, lazy horse! find us something cool to do."
3028,Bart,"no, mom, i can handle it. let's see... pay to the order of... lisa. one cent... and no cents. and now the old john hancock... here you go."

9993,Bart,i think i just met the thing i'm gonna die on.
9948,Bart,you sure none of you guys gave me this?
848,Bart,romantic? with aunt selma?
9279,Bart,i heard about your run-in with hoover. aren't teachers the worst?
9582,Bart,"anyway, i'm really hoping you could... dad?"
11427,Bart,"everyone does that with good dads. but with our dad, it's like climbing mount everest. you either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. either way, hell of a show."
6124,Bart,what flavor?
2029,Bart,wow. the universe is so boring.
8505,Bart,"oh yeah? well when you're mean, i'm a trampoline, so everything you said goes back and hits your ugly head."
1410,Bart,cartoons have writers?
3373,Bart,"jeez, sorry. it's a pretty standard stunt, homer."
6189,Bart,"dad, i loved it, too, but it was seven years ago."
12808,Bart,"but, dad, you'll never make it."
12131,Bart,"in the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, battling bart simpson. whoopee! whoo! whoo! whoo! and in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout..."
2280,Bart,"you go, mom. for the greater good."
8284,Bart,dad! it's drederick tatum. try to get him to punch you.
3821,Bart,"hey, it's dad! right on time!"
1975,Bart,"i guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
3755,Bart,wacky shack!
13075,Bart,"wake up, dad."
5002,Bart,i can stretch!
8620,Bart,"why'd you do it, man?"
4048,Bart,"starting today, we're carnies. just like you."
9583,Bart,"dad, that is genius, but i need some advice--"
7038,Bart,"chill out, mom. they gave me this hat."
4613,Bart,"well, why don't you just pull it out?"
5604,Bart,"oh, wait. here we go..."
1654,Bart,"oh, no. i must have joined the junior campers!"
4172,Bart,my joe isn't sloppy enough!
13062,Bart,he's buying it!
7140,Bart,and i have a card that can take us anywhere they go.
2962,Bart,you guys made a snowman family?
9067,Bart,"yeah, without the sun, my hair's reverting to its natural red."
5897,Bart,this is the real homer simpson -- a beer-drinking meanie!
1826,Bart,"eh, either way."
7938,Bart,"no, not yet! i have to have a summer romance!"
1588,Bart,"but, you didn't get any on m..."
7119,Bart,welcome to lecture number eight on the water balloon. yesterday i asked everyone to think of other liquids you could fill a balloon with.
7926,Bart,i can't believe you remembered me through milhouse. he's not even my best friend.
453,Bart,"hello, my name's dimitri. i'm a first time caller, long time listener."
2483,Bart,"wow, lisa. looking at you makes me want to get married for a third time. i met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at hugh's bachelor party."
7346,Bart,ay carumba!
6463,Bart,they have an award for teaching?
9644,Bart,i will never forgive you.
7577,Bart,"i'm bart simpson, ay carumba, do the bartman, etcetera, etcetera."
12428,Bart,"i don't think so, sir."
8389,Bart,"keep pitching, i'll be back."
696,Bart,those guys must be millionaires!
12178,Bart,no!
6044,Bart,"you crapped out, vegas mom."
350,Bart,tan die doe dow?
10433,Bart,i love that guy.
6307,Bart,"good going, lis. and it sure is great to be out of that bubble."
7472,Bart,now she just bottles up her misery like a normal mom!
12593,Bart,do you get hbo?
7153,Bart,place-setting? how is someone so lame related to a hot tamale like me?
11665,Bart,"wow, i'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later. ay carumba!"
6338,Bart,"sorry, dad. maybe now you'll appreciate us..."
10276,Bart,"well, dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe i should tell you..."
4167,Bart,"you're up to something, aren't you?"
1686,Bart,a real swiss army knife. cool!
9914,Bart,just point me to santa.
9967,Bart,comic book guy! thanks.
12523,Bart,okay... okay! why are we dancing around the obvious? i know it. you know it. i am dumb. okay? dumb as a post. do you think i'm happy about it?
5429,Bart,we're lumberjacks!
11639,Bart,"huh?! we're in hell?! cool! now i can look up all those people who said ""see you in hell""!"
524,Bart,"hey, pink hat, when i ordered that blueberry squishee, i meant today."
6628,Bart,"no lis, i've got my eyes on the prize: the hood ornament i desperately want. for reasons i can no longer remember. the only thing stopping me is those lights."
4459,Bart,"well, it used to be."
8895,Bart,"don't waste your shot, bart. you've got just enough cat pee to soak two dorks."
11903,Bart,"hi, li'l control hamster."
2474,Bart,"nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
405,Bart,"whatever she's paying you, i'll double it."
12493,Bart,what's the big idea? you covered up my paper.
6823,Bart,"you can't whitewash history, lis."
10351,Bart,how is that the lesson? the point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. so we should party hard and wreck the place.
4401,Bart,"well. thanks, guv'nor."
8608,Bart,you grew tired of always being in my shadow.
3659,Bart,let me answer that question with... cookware!
9339,Bart,stupid shoes over tights! why did i want to play with a couple of lame-o girls?
3119,Bart,"dad, can we have $183,000?"
9185,Bart,"que pasa, ladies?"
4314,Bart,"so we meet again, mr. bond."
4306,Bart,"hi, willie."
6850,Bart,dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off!
660,Bart,no!
576,Bart,okay.
12205,Bart,dad! oh dad!
12246,Bart,well... i was wondering... how important is it to be popular?
5694,Bart,what about jags?
1591,Bart,big deal. it's no different from the basement in grampa's rest home.
6831,Bart,good luck!
2812,Bart,i agree. destroy the school.
11631,Bart,grampa.
11573,Bart,don't you know what kind of animal we're dealing with?
9615,Bart,never gonna happen.
3663,Bart,"no, not you -- laddie."
12503,Bart,and where did they land?
7815,Bart,"dad, i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer."
11155,Bart,"hey, i did that!"
2898,Bart,"clean as a whistle, homer!"
5246,Bart,pledge drive?
3124,Bart,what the hell is going on?

7770,Bart,"bob, your family will find out the truth. sooner or later you'll try to kill me again. watch, i'll prove it."

2815,Bart,"good catch, boy."
331,Bart,good mornin' world!

3297,Bart,"look, lady, i'm s'posed to be in the fourth grade."
2538,Bart,"milhouse, i found a hive of killer bees. you wanna go throw rocks at it?"
11377,Bart,"well, i guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage."
2299,Bart,wow. v8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.

9176,Bart,i didn't make this terrible model... my dad did.
4168,Bart,"well, dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff."
7547,Bart,"what lisa's trying to say is... there's a new kids' barbershop in the mall, and we'd like to start going there."

6591,Bart,"hey, krusty should run for congress. he could help us with the airplanes!"
3026,Bart,i got the account where you get free customized checks. i chose the hindenberg flip-book series.
2792,Bart,there's no change in your piggy bank.
12547,Bart,okay.
11562,Bart,but don't people hate cowards?
123,Bart,empty bottles... empty bottles...

9696,Bart,"i need some cash, man."
11312,Bart,"this is what it means to everyone. how can you be forced to say ""i love you?"" people only give valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't."

5712,Bart,"well, we're gonna make some changes around here. this store's gonna be run by kids and for kids."
2383,Bart,"dad, you can't just go around pretending to be krusty. it's sacrilege. he's a one and only. i mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as i know."
9947,Bart,when did this happen?
4988,Bart,"check it out, dad. you can print out the headline from the day you were born."

10452,Bart,"c'mon, man. at least listen to what i have to say."
7725,Bart,"yeah. you know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal."
4209,Bart,whoa! get him off! get him off!
9767,Bart,"no, we can't stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team."
7079,Bart,hey guards! help! help!

9742,Bart,"so, do we have a winner?"
12828,Bart,"come on, lis. let's go finish our soapbox racers."
5178,Bart,"i was a sinner, a real bad kid / what thou shalt not, i shalt did / neighbor's cat i tried to neuter / took a whiz on the school computer."
214,Bart,"yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"

2927,Bart,"um, okay, i've really really really learned my lesson. can i please go now?"
12714,Bart,"well, it's taking up valuable real estate."
6945,Bart,at the university of... psyche!
10954,Bart,"don't worry, i'll clean it up. get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors."
7428,Bart,"i can't take it anymore! every time i try to relax, she-- ow, my neck!"
2593,Bart,what if they shot at a coke machine?
4554,Bart,"guys, is it really true? are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?"
8367,Bart,sorry... but a boy's gotta go with his dog.
10160,Bart,just think of what we can do with that moolah.
8552,Bart,"no, you idiot. we just pay for it with another bond issue."
1251,Bart,what about abraham lincoln?
2360,Bart,uh huh.
1651,Bart,"new york is that-a-way, man."
776,Bart,"that's right, man. i got my first taste of authority... and i liked it."
1457,Bart,"well, according to this, snakes ""hear"" by sensing vibrations in the ground. so, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes'll be in here like oprah on a baked ham."
8555,Bart,"i got some old magazines to burn. ""popular science,"" ""redbook"", ""big and tall halloween costume"" catalogue..."
4134,Bart,oh.
738,Bart,mrs. krabappel.
1942,Bart,my fantasy's come true.
8373,Bart,"lisa, they're gonna put a stink bomb in the school! i might be able to stop them, but i'll need a schematic of jimbo's house."
9986,Bart,sure.
4400,Bart,maybe you can help me. i don't think my face is as hilarious as it could be. what can you show me in a nose or forehead accessory?
5152,Bart,"tonight we're gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at club med, and scare the normals."
6229,Bart,why does danger dog mean more to me than school or church?
3723,Bart,"c'mon, santa's little helper! i'm sorry i ever let you go! pick me! please pick me!"
9226,Bart,bookstores don't have answers. they just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
7252,Bart,"say ""goose,"" you stupid freak!"
11812,Bart,are you... a hostess?
9830,Bart,we're both in the same reading group. i think you know how smart i am.
2298,Bart,it's just hard not to listen to tv. it's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
9766,Bart,lisa?!
12210,Bart,okay. it all started sunday morning...
6272,Bart,"say it, don't spray it."
12122,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. there are no winners, only losers. there are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the american revolution, world war ii, and the star wars trilogy. if you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. well, good night, everybody. peace, man."
8809,Bart,"lisa's got school, career, posture -- why'd she have to steal krusty from me?!"
8869,Bart,i'll just take milhouse home.
8899,Bart,a vacuuming robot!
4112,Bart,"no it's not, it's my tummy. i mean stomach. gut. crap factory."
1444,Bart,what's in it?
321,Bart,you missed a spot.
4366,Bart,wowwww! mcbain has really buffed up. you could grate cheese on those abs.
7194,Bart,"dad, i am going on a talk show. i have to say something!"
2802,Bart,what's that extra b for?
306,Bart,"lis, you taught me to stand up for what i believe in."
10289,Bart,ay carumba!
3305,Bart,i'll give you four bucks for it!
2849,Bart,he's a nuclear safety technician.
5241,Bart,aah!
7698,Bart,but what will junkies do drugs under?
3631,Bart,"you, you, uh, wanted to see me, principal skinner?"
5195,Bart,heal... heal... heal...
8824,Bart,"now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again."
166,Bart,"uh-oh, looks like rain. we better get this baby home."
6540,Bart,look at it.
2318,Bart,okay.
800,Bart,"oooh, big man."
2242,Bart,yeah. this is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
13040,Bart,no snake tattoo.
130,Bart,"oh, this is so humiliating... i feel like such a geek."
11106,Bart,i'm sorry! i was faking it!
12374,Bart,can i have something to go with my turnip?
3952,Bart,tradition.
10473,Bart,"today we tackle the most terrifying ""myth"" in the history of springfield elementary: that if you press e-8 on the candy machine, you get electrocuted and die."
10009,Bart,"uh, dad. if we could get to the reward...?"
515,Bart,"uh-oh, here comes a xylon cruiser. whoa, whoa, whoa! go into hyperspace! ready, hit it!"
9871,Bart,you and i have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this.
2134,Bart,who would've thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
5713,Bart,"ah, nice to see ya'... hey, how 'bout that bloodzilla? vampire dinosaur, ohh, you can't make that stuff up..."
10812,Bart,fine. you have a weird old version of something. let's just watch tv.
2493,Bart,"hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?"
12736,Bart,"a...listen, guys i was thinking, uh... unless you'd feel weird about taking money from a kid...i thought maybe..."
5029,Bart,we can't go back home?
1052,Bart,"grampa, why don't you tell us a story? you've led an interesting life."
12884,Bart,"all right. i've sat through mercy and i've sat through forgiveness. finally, we get to the good stuff."
11061,Bart,"yes, grampa!"
2990,Bart,"helloooo, mr. bush!"
9047,Bart,looks like you took a big number two.
7231,Bart,"listen up, ring-a-ding-dingers. i'm throwin' a little sip 'n' quip at the playdude treehouse. saturday night, at the top of the ladder. be there or be square."
2765,Bart,let me try.
334,Bart,"why shouldn't i be happy? it's a beautiful day, my homework is done, i've got my mojo workin' and we're goin' on a field trip this afternoon."
3624,Bart,ow!
8508,Bart,then i'm going with you!
1650,Bart,"springfield, springfield--!"
5449,Bart,"a man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down!"
6435,Bart,mm hm.
6613,Bart,hey! you nearly hit me on the head!
12721,Bart,"hey boy, come here! you're a good dog! come on, we don't need them to get a thanksgiving dinner!"
1940,Bart,"hi, abe."
5387,Bart,the play-doh factory...
5551,Bart,"hey man, this job is too dangerous."
11521,Bart,or tomorrow we will pay!
12476,Bart,it's about these pirates. pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
12980,Bart,"i'm sorry, boy. you can't help being dumb."
8120,Bart,say again?
12467,Bart,the thing is no one was hurt. i think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
609,Bart,all right! here comes my name!
4277,Bart,they're getting ready to throw the switch!
3380,Bart,lisa and i built your room.
6201,Bart,"no, i think it's niagular."
11865,Bart,like a light bulb!
3465,Bart,what? they've given you thousands of

1585,Bart,at least now i can get some rest.
187,Bart,"oh, so that's your little game. let old bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
3476,Bart,"aw, boo hoo. that's what they get paid for."
9214,Bart,our cell phones!
538,Bart,"sorry dad, but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad's help."
8754,Bart,have you seen my sister?
1941,Bart,"ah, the joys of mortgaging your future."
12213,Bart,"uh ma'am, what if you're a really good person but you're in a really, really bad fight and your leg gets gangrene and it has to be amputated; will it be waiting for you in heaven?"
2935,Bart,i don't have to listen to these wild allegations.
6595,Bart,"but, if you get elected, you can change all that, and stop those stupid airplanes from flying over my house."
2485,Bart,"oh, please! this is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary."
10776,Bart,"gentleman doesn't ask, lady doesn't tell. now all i need is one for martin luther king day."
12443,Bart,"that's okay, mom!"
9949,Bart,"mom, do you have any idea how i got this scar?"
11154,Bart,not the pony dream again!
7342,Bart,"sure, why not."
5577,Bart,i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
9184,Bart,"now to turn my sis from ""loser"" to ""schmoozer."""
3524,Bart,"get 'im, lis!"
1314,Bart,"dad, it just kinda happened. you're taking this too hard."

2561,Bart,"oh you bet, mom. ask me anything."
10899,Bart,um... why don't we discuss it over dinner?
7907,Bart,"hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. i'll teach you how to be a boy."
3277,Bart,"hey, dad."
911,Bart,"no, that's okay. you can stay. you can read comics with us. let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""radioactive man vs. the swamp hag."
10169,Bart,truffle's in your room? i thought you'd been selling them!
9134,Bart,"so this is setting the table. if i'd known how easy this was, i'd have just done it instead of throwing all those tantrums."
11598,Bart,no.
4871,Bart,"but i've set you free. no more nap time, no more bingo. you can do whatever you want!"
4879,Bart,"if you love me, you'll kill me."
5742,Bart,"yeah, you know her."
11199,Bart,no! you never let me be mike singletary!
5309,Bart,he's right. i'm a loser. there's only one way out of this mess.
399,Bart,you did have a party. you didn't invite me. and i thought we were best friends.
11091,Bart,let me try.
25,Bart,eat my shorts! / aye carumba!
8924,Bart,"ooh, and a racecar bed...that really races!"
3614,Bart,"so i looked in the window and there it was, the grossest sight i have ever..."

10701,Bart,my ex-girlfriends.
12749,Bart,"my wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... i've hit the jackpot!"
7011,Bart,yep. pick up another one.

3887,Bart,"well, i'll be a son of a witch!"
8497,Bart,you're uncle norbert?
10939,Bart,why did i buy her that rhyming dictionary?
1802,Bart,"aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod."
1171,Bart,how can i get her to notice me?
1514,Bart,yeah!
11375,Bart,um... with our minds?
6548,Bart,"okay, that was just my imagination."

12880,Bart,"wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?"
5536,Bart,"oh, he's wonderful. he would do anything for his fans."
7595,Bart,i thought there was a monster in the potty.
160,Bart,really?
9029,Bart,what about sunday?
12550,Bart,"a teacher's strike, a power failure, a blizzard. anything that'll cancel school tomorrow. i know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. thanking you in advance, your pal, bart simpson."
5502,Bart,"hey, if you're out here, then who's in there?"
8357,Bart,"i don't want a new dog. i want my old dog, the one who bit me."
1838,Bart,"strip the bark now, stampy."

10721,Bart,"thanks for asking, duchess. i'm sittin' here waitin' for a girl that's never gonna show up."
7123,Bart,"hmm, not otto -- he'd drive us off a cliff."
10306,Bart,"that was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, you're right."
9289,Bart,"yeah, 'cause you're smart. you don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" like mom and dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""

10815,Bart,"come on dude, this party rocks! love the temporary tattoo station!"
10263,Bart,a man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.

7380,Bart,the kidnappers say if you worry too much... they'll kill me.
4141,Bart,"no! no, i was talkin' to lisa back there, we both agreed you killed."
6484,Bart,it's really cool. you can point a red dot at people's crotches from really far away.
11514,Bart,"i wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! pub crawls, naked frisbee golf..."
9736,Bart,i'm a slow reader!
11471,Bart,that man sure loved potato salad.

8362,Bart,"hey, don't ask me to show if you can't handle the tell."
11921,Bart,"um, look dad, i got something to tell you."
3907,Bart,"yeah, but i could get seriously hurt."
8408,Bart,"dad, you barely go to work at all."
4392,Bart,all i see is a pole. maybe the flag fell off.
7170,Bart,i've kissed three girls.
11685,Bart,"we've all read the terms and conditions, milhouse."
1832,Bart,where's my elephant?!
2989,Bart,"wow, a former president, living right across the street!"
7774,Bart,"krusty, you gotta help us."
10802,Bart,"dad, all the jury summons you buried in the back yard are coming back up!"
9364,Bart,"one boy to go, please. easy on the freckles."

8913,Bart,"my father's name is homer... my mother's name is mom... my sister's name is lisa, but everyone calls her loser."
10291,Bart,one or two?
11848,Bart,"come on, dad. they're all scrawny little bags of bones."
8730,Bart,"if i could save lou, i'd never eat meat again. not even prosciutto and melon!"
981,Bart,"don't look in my closet. in fact, stay out of my room all together."
6599,Bart,"krusty, i can't believe you're giving up. i thought you'd make a difference, that's why i voted for you."
11805,Bart,"how come there's never a ""take your son to work day?"""
5298,Bart,but i want some.
7302,Bart,"lis, i think i'm having a midlife crisis."
4699,Bart,"oh, man."
10297,Bart,yeah!
8484,Bart,"hey, i'm happy to see milhouse get some hand-on-hand action. but no one is cooler than bartholomew j. simpson."
11753,Bart,wow. he doesn't want to be my dad. he just wants to be a kid like me. almost makes me not wanna prank him. almost.
7303,Bart,"or, i could write something that's not gay."
6521,Bart,"wait, i was in a commercial? i don't remember this at all."

8303,Bart,big if!
9003,Bart,"dad! these people are my friends! don't fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is bin laden!"
6806,Bart,"lisa is a nut. she has a rubber butt. every time she turns around it goes ""putt putt."""
2448,Bart,i don't want to be the next anything. i'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
2234,Bart,i didn't take it.
6993,Bart,psyche!
6538,Bart,no. i assume it has hay.
3794,Bart,my killing teacher says i'm a natural.

970,Bart,you bet. check out this hand. all aces!
9495,Bart,"principal skinner?! this is bogus, man. you know the rules: two letters and a conference before i get a home visit."
2652,Bart,"okay. think, bart. where have you seen roman numerals before? i know, ""rocky vee!"" that was the fifth one. so ""rocky five"" plus ""rocky two"" equals ""rocky seven: adrian's revenge!"""
12973,Bart,uh... take a walk!
11757,Bart,you're in the top hundred.
3386,Bart,"lis, check it out. time for chili."
10671,Bart,"well, what you've gotta do is get them into the real world."
5361,Bart,legalize it.
9602,Bart,"well, like, uh, aren't you my girlfriend now?"
11071,Bart,"grampa, we've been spending so much time together, i almost feel like you're part of the family."
771,Bart,"mom, before you blame the dog, i think you should take a look at these surveillance photos."
10363,Bart,"our crew needs you, bouvier. you've read enough fantasy novels to choke a hippogriff!"
10314,Bart,"baby seal, huh?"
10047,Bart,my stupid cartoon a movie? thank you!

3935,Bart,"no, i got hit by a couple of cars. i won't be able to play today."
2624,Bart,and now i am going to teach some kids a lesson.

6652,Bart,"daddy, i need upsies!"
8404,Bart,uh... i'll etch-a-sketch it for you.
1573,Bart,krusty poses for trading card photo.
741,Bart,"ohhh, homer, you old honey dripper."
6485,Bart,i'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
7763,Bart,"this is worse than ""wheelchair-nocchio."""
3158,Bart,what about the sunsphere?
9070,Bart,"we know, dad. we were there."
2119,Bart,"wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."

1404,Bart,"dad, it's all my fault! i shook up that can of beer!"
6520,Bart,"oh my god, that's me!"
12429,Bart,"true, sideshow bob, but that doesn't bother me. you see, my sisters and i have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like krusty was framed."
6861,Bart,"yes it is, you're a clown."
783,Bart,"not in my hall, bub."
10121,Bart,and don't you come back without it! you hear me?! hurry up!
1326,Bart,"another beer, dad?"
12359,Bart,wow. and one back?

458,Bart,"oy, this guy's tough."
1379,Bart,"you're goin' down, homer! i'm gonna fool you!"
7644,Bart,"and i always got the spillover. drive-in movies, two christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!"
1647,Bart,just make it happen.
5988,Bart,"oh, forget it."
9055,Bart,"hey seymour, i just realized something. you're stuck babysitting us losers which makes you the real loser!"
12239,Bart,"that one looks like the statue of our town founder, jebediah springfield."
11697,Bart,enough!
7034,Bart,"hey, let me read it to her. ""johnny's friends get some payback on daddy while he's sleeping..."""
647,Bart,my name is timmy o'toole. i just turned ten years old.
5853,Bart,"okay, okay."
2499,Bart,twenty-five.
12542,Bart,"only geeks sit in the front seat. from now on you sit in the back row. and that's not just on the bus. it goes for school and church, too."
12940,Bart,"ohh, oh, got him."
11692,Bart,nooo!
5245,Bart,here come the cricket bats.
10994,Bart,"what kind of person, indeed?"
272,Bart,you're just putting that in because it's commercial.
10981,Bart,mine's full of hand mirrors.
10836,Bart,you have a story with an ending?!
396,Bart,"they're official krusty the clown walkie-talkies. i'll keep one and you keep one. now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
414,Bart,i don't wanna play with milhouse.
251,Bart,poor house.
8403,Bart,dad!
12941,Bart,"i want to go on a boat ride, unky herb."
4310,Bart,what's he gonna do?
10925,Bart,"mary, we've just been through three hours of music. usually, i only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for fire island."
5362,Bart,tasty. that calls for some tuneskis.
1603,Bart,"you're absolutely right, homer. we don't need a baby-sitter."
9328,Bart,what the?
10870,Bart,uh... pajamas?
8145,Bart,"we're still gonna make it, aren't we dad?"
6685,Bart,"hey, duffman!"
2025,Bart,"aw, great. i get to spend the summer with my brain."
10865,Bart,"thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks."
4222,Bart,that's not a toy. hey... do you know how to play hide and seek?
5787,Bart,"hel-lo, springfield! now, here's a song that your principal skinner doesn't want us to play."
11998,Bart,me.
6724,Bart,hey! some jerks cleaned our field!
12548,Bart,this is hopeless.
5524,Bart,"dad, the chloroform!"
8163,Bart,"cool -- look what snap's doing to pop, while crackle watches!"
9172,Bart,"we'd like some balsa wood, please."
11264,Bart,"i don't think you're giving them what they were promised, dad."
12012,Bart,see.
2784,Bart,"all you have to do is sign a paper that says i can have your soul. i need a soul, ralph. any soul. yours."
4953,Bart,i'm reading.
10726,Bart,they let sideshow bob out of prison again.
12882,Bart,cool. this is where die hard jumps through the window.
560,Bart,"thanks, nelson, put her there."
7130,Bart,i say bury her before she starts to smell.
11215,Bart,and what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? the new whiffle-bats? pizza friday?
5812,Bart,good grief.
11563,Bart,"wow, that sounds pretty sweet."
8877,Bart,"i can do anything i want! first i'm gonna take a bath, then i'm gonna eat some vegetables, and then i'm gonna get to bed nice and early with no tv."
12578,Bart,uh-oh.
8714,Bart,keep it down! i'm trying to feed my runt.
5457,Bart,too soon.
10621,Bart,double upgrade!
12179,Bart,dad's feet.
5177,Bart,"satan, eat my shorts!!"
2151,Bart,but dad can't afford six dollars a night.
1540,Bart,"well, you have such a beautiful voice..."
2447,Bart,"okay, steady bart. taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."
11419,Bart,for ourselves?
2074,Bart,note for later. put rubber spider down lisa's dress.
7501,Bart,"hey dad, remember when you said if i used a chainsaw unsupervised i'd hurt myself? well, you were wrong. i hurt someone else."
6129,Bart,a crazy dog's trying to kill me!
3802,Bart,that was close.
8398,Bart,"let's see... according to your charts, you're due for your annual throat scraping."
9544,Bart,"smooth move, mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer."
4859,Bart,"ahoy mateys, it's me, long bart silver and i'm gonna rip you a new i.v. hole."
6734,Bart,"man, the plant cut one!"
3236,Bart,"mom, i'm gonna tighten milhouse's straps. he's fidgeting again."
8318,Bart,i hate bart simpson!
3098,Bart,"he's not a regular bum, mom. he's a genius bum. he created itchy. and he's the father of cartoon violence."
828,Bart,it's over.
279,Bart,"hey, michael. what happened to your voice?"
4131,Bart,"hey, somebody screwed up bad! you've got all these big comics lined up for your show, but there's no krusty."
3924,Bart,"aw, crap."
1060,Bart,"chapter eight, ""let's talk zombies..."" if a zombie bites you, you become a zombie. you must walk the earth feeding on the brains of the living until the spell is broken."
3239,Bart,i thought springfield was america's scrod-basket.
222,Bart,"hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
13020,Bart,"hey, mom. did he have those spots all over his body?"
11055,Bart,clueless little lisa doesn't suspect a thing.
6776,Bart,woo hoo! mom finally stopped caring!
4485,Bart,"your electric hammer, maestro?"
12883,Bart,cool. this is where wall street gets arrested.
6490,Bart,she's in the back yard!
1972,Bart,"well, i was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened..."
4794,Bart,i'm bored. send in my jester.
9355,Bart,"well, i need a baby now and i'm not getting any younger!"
11783,Bart,sister weenie.
6105,Bart,i knew it. you're there. just hear me out.
161,Bart,"dad, i've done everything i could and i've only got thirty-five bucks. ugh.. i am through with working. working is for chumps."
11166,Bart,i'm father o'greedy! dimes for the needy!
7311,Bart,but i'm just a kid.
5872,Bart,"we can take whatever we want, right?"
7271,Bart,this isn't what it looks like.
1152,Bart,maybe it's time i wash my hand.
8172,Bart,hello?
11939,Bart,i had a little accident in chemistry today.
11885,Bart,yaaaaahhh!
4351,Bart,gaaah!
6568,Bart,"don't worry, dad, it's just a commercial. no one will remember this in fifty years."
4139,Bart,woo hoo! yeah! krust-ee!
3417,Bart,sharing is a bunch of bull too. and helping others. and what's all this crap i've been hearing about tolerance?
929,Bart,what? get bent.
12436,Bart,"see that? krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people."
10627,Bart,i'm just glad everyone is having the best week of their lives.
3597,Bart,dad! knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
8179,Bart,"wow, a mint condition ""hippie hulk"" from 1968!"
11143,Bart,"yes, kids will get candy, whatever you say."
12129,Bart,oh yeah!
12658,Bart,"heh, heh, heh heh..."
6286,Bart,how'd that get in there?
9803,Bart,"here, i'll be the demon, you be the thimble."
2997,Bart,"yeah, well, welcome to the twentieth century, george."
8024,Bart,no! i'm allergic!

2389,Bart,"go, toothpaste! go! move your pasty white butt!"
8089,Bart,nelson... nobody's coming.
8602,Bart,"thanks, willie!"
13086,Bart,"speakin' of cracks, pull up your pants, dude."
10035,Bart,i... i don't want to talk about it.
788,Bart,all-riight!
448,Bart,really?
1154,Bart,"hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
3172,Bart,"what do you think, milhouse? milhouse?"

4114,Bart,no talking in the cage. court is now in session. all rise.
10816,Bart,hey! my dad worked really hard to make that. he took a class to learn denim painting!
12011,Bart,"they'd work much better without the padding, doc."
3581,Bart,i'm... i'm sorry i was such a jerk last night. guess i sort of ruined your babysitting business.
4375,Bart,"no, wait. i have a plan. but i'll need your underpants."
6445,Bart,"okay, time to start this paper. world war one. w.w. one. well, that's a good start. time to watch wrestling!"
9057,Bart,"what's your plan now, skinrash?"
10760,Bart,"mom, how come you didn't do my homework last night?"
340,Bart,i didn't know dogs really did that.
11391,Bart,why would you want to do that? he's tried to kill us.
10758,Bart,give yourself a wedgie.
1602,Bart,"don't worry. you'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, homina..."
12990,Bart,"you know, grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet."
504,Bart,"hey, dad. here's one. twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people."
11992,Bart,yeah. shut my mouth and let your boss win.
10411,Bart,who's fatso flanagan?
3430,Bart,"oh, that's okay. i'll just go without liquid."
1844,Bart,"uh, here's a better sign, dad."
12166,Bart,"you're right, mom. i'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing."
10916,Bart,a lot of musical talent in this house. but no one blows on a blade of grass like you.
1001,Bart,doh-kay.
2587,Bart,oh yeah? take a look at this:
5295,Bart,"hey, dad. my band finally got a break. i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. how about a little loanski?"
11802,Bart,i refuse to accept it!
5483,Bart,"oh, it's not so bad..."
6876,Bart,"mom, that's roofi. his music is why babies are idiots."
8996,Bart,"okay, next, here's the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick: coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. the only thing that's safe is the pork chops."
5848,Bart,diamond vision.
10368,Bart,"no one's goin' anywhere. okay, the vampire genre is sucked out. all we gotta do is find a new monster to be our hero."
6457,Bart,"""... and so on november 11, 1918, the guns fell silent and peace returned. the end."""
3197,Bart,"hey, grampa, do you think your dead buddies get up and walk around at night?"
11134,Bart,"i'm bart simpson, who the hell are you?"
2177,Bart,"all right, ""thinks too much,"" it shall be so."
10230,Bart,but... what if my dog eats it?

6058,Bart,we're rehearsing a play.
7616,Bart,"so, how are we related again?"

7647,Bart,that's why he had to go away forever.
2705,Bart,i didn't do it! i wished him well! i wished him weeelll!
11961,Bart,"oh, okay. i thought you were puttin' him down."
11784,Bart,lisa is blown away.
11401,Bart,"not what i was hoping for, but it'll do."
1376,Bart,"we can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the south, and charge two bits a gander."
2315,Bart,"no offense, homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
3528,Bart,guess who!
2526,Bart,"yeah, skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it."
2363,Bart,"observatory? this is bart simpson. i see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven."
445,Bart,poor krusty.
492,Bart,okay.
2125,Bart,"so, mr. itchy. you think you're god's gift to women, do ya?"
2969,Bart,i wanted to surprise you for christmas...
12817,Bart,"oh, oh, baby!"
5014,Bart,"oh, no! krusty!"
5871,Bart,"ice cream at church? i'm intrigued, yet suspicious."
10818,Bart,"have you been ""oh boy""-ing all night?"
10679,Bart,she just found out no one likes her. i thought she knew!
7069,Bart,"hello, ladies."
3693,Bart,"why don't you guys take him. i thought he was the right dog for me, but i guess i made a mistake."
1041,Bart,"hey, i'm starting to think i can win."
5082,Bart,tah dah!
2243,Bart,"give it up, lis. she's a criminal mastermind. she's got a 108 iq, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red fruit loops."
11814,Bart,"yeah, we are grown up."
1720,Bart,"we're having a field trip today. ah, lis, won't it be great to cast off the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is springfield elementary? oh, i'm sorry, i forgot. your class isn't going."
8069,Bart,i've always done it. just like i only eat the eyes off a lobster.
8867,Bart,"sure, i got my seatbelt on."
2644,Bart,i could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
10973,Bart,"au contraire, starfish hair!"
2675,Bart,"aren't we forgetting someone, sister suspect?"
11677,Bart,terrible.
11135,Bart,you guys know i don't talk to field agents. get your boss on the phone.

10482,Bart,"milhouse, i've just figured out a way to make school cool again."
2797,Bart,"so long, suck--"
1446,Bart,cool.
1754,Bart,you want me to be on the show?
1195,Bart,aye carumba!
7884,Bart,"when we landed, i was gonna denounce my sister as a witch."
10120,Bart,"i forgot, mama."
5391,Bart,we should be safe up here. i'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees.
6744,Bart,"please, don't take me! take milhouse. we all know there's no happy ending there."
638,Bart,talk is cheap. perhaps a test of thy faith. walk through the wall. i will remove it for you...later.

6023,Bart,all right! trash cookies!
13025,Bart,"oh look, this is really cool. when i hit reverse, i can make them go back in."
2191,Bart,you know i was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
11152,Bart,"yeah, it's like looking down a canadian tunnel."
926,Bart,"hey, i've got an idea. why don't the three of us go spit on the principal's car?"
13014,Bart,okay.
6424,Bart,what the hell was that?
12173,Bart,aye carumba!
3134,Bart,"yes. you are right, milhouse. it is a fake. which makes it a fake i.d."
5877,Bart,you could fix up the old storytime village. they've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
12541,Bart,no.
8903,Bart,that too.
2160,Bart,of course!
4320,Bart,"anchorman, huh? well, if i'm gonna be an anchorman, i'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. i'll be in makeup."
3031,Bart,"if he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. then when my monthly bank statement comes, i'll get the check back complete with autograph. no fuss, no muss."
10165,Bart,all i smell here is desperation.
1991,Bart,three hundred fifty dollars.

8868,Bart,"uh, trying to do something constructive?"
1037,Bart,"okay, wipe away a tear... ... hug the loser..."
3561,Bart,i'm using non-violent resistance.
5703,Bart,"don't do it, lady. that stuff's worth thousands."
12666,Bart,what?
8300,Bart,it was just a game. a game i used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
47,Bart,they're fighting in the car again.
2957,Bart,who are dan and sherry adler?
5340,Bart,of what? the united states of dorksylvania?
11217,Bart,remember you've got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.
7704,Bart,moms don't get lonely.
2512,Bart,dogs always land on their feet.

5757,Bart,"ha. so long, suckers!"
2531,Bart,"great news, mom!"
2387,Bart,i'm more striking than lovely.
2622,Bart,"that lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. we'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead."
13050,Bart,s'allright.
8923,Bart,a candy corn volcano! a ceiling from saddam's palace!
9611,Bart,krav ma-wha?
3533,Bart,"heh, funny, isn't it, lis? those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
1984,Bart,he's damn opposed! damn! damn! damn opposed!
7395,Bart,everyone in town is wise to us. we need someone new we can prank.
2236,Bart,we've gotta talk.
13049,Bart,"hey homer, you wanna eat my shorts?"
8111,Bart,we were just having fun. don't get upset.
3392,Bart,"hey, look! is that dad?"

6409,Bart,"listen, i have a plan that will make the world fall in love with krusty the clown again."
1461,Bart,"hey, dad. this came for you in the mail."
113,Bart,no.
4949,Bart,i'll do it.
7236,Bart,canned and frozen juices are more popular than ever these days. but most bachelors we know would prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes.
10720,Bart,i guess my search for true love is doomed.
5966,Bart,"no, it's terrible."
424,Bart,consider it done.
6718,Bart,how come i'm not doing this stuff with milhouse?
1400,Bart,i know that i got you mad once in a while...
1434,Bart,"hey, i think i can squeeze through that vent."

5579,Bart,"you know, it might've been jimbo."
7527,Bart,"they can't see or hear us, right?"
8994,Bart,"hey, i never refuse food from strangers."
11109,Bart,is it too late to make you breakfast in bed?
9455,Bart,holly hippie. krusty's sidekick in 1969 and his first wife.
10407,Bart,"aw, come on, guys, it's getting dark."
11189,Bart,"mom, lisa's ruining football."
7524,Bart,"look, i'm really, really sorry. now let me get that ice cream off your shoe."

7993,Bart,"hey guys, great news -- i can drum again!"
8728,Bart,i can't help you! i'm just a little boy!
4468,Bart,"that's great, dad."
5839,Bart,okay.
1565,Bart,they become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
6644,Bart,"hey, i love watching you guys fight. it's my earliest memory."
12905,Bart,what's a herbicide?
3658,Bart,and for the college-bound... 500 stay-alert capsules.
4085,Bart,does anyone here like food?
10876,Bart,"when i start, i'll tell ya."
6651,Bart,i'll show you how they get on a horse where i come from.
6053,Bart,"i prefer to egg him on. hey dad, has the movie started yet?"
596,Bart,that's because i forgot to stamp it.
9624,Bart,"ay carumba. hey, is that the ark of the covenant?"
9048,Bart,no test?
5069,Bart,"hm. ""thanks for letting us crash in your pad. we had a very nice time."""
9194,Bart,"ooh, twelve cents. i'll take eight!"
10424,Bart,"lisa, do you really need all these kurt vonnegut novels?"
4797,Bart,but goliath is dead. i smote him myself. i smoted him good.
5748,Bart,he thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. but it was the perfect place to shoot him.
4069,Bart,check this out!
1399,Bart,"dad, i'm so sorry. i know i haven't been a perfect kid..."
1048,Bart,"oh, dad, this is the best birthday i've ever had."

7713,Bart,zumanity by cirque de soleil?
10059,Bart,my category comes up pretty soon. i'm home free as long as this oscar show is tight and fast-paced.
12268,Bart,"oh yeah, right..."
7367,Bart,"you can trace my remorse to its super-sized source / a hungry, hungry hypocrite named homer of course / my old man's pathetic / damn is his head thick / the gas from his ass is carcinogenic / every day i pray his dna ain't genetic"
12477,Bart,did i mention this book was written by a guy named robert louis stevenson? and published by the good people at mcgraw hill.
3244,Bart,my friendship. you know you want it.
5348,Bart,lisa's counting on me for this coolness report.
1344,Bart,"watch this, lis. you can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
11901,Bart,what's your problem?
2798,Bart,this one spent two hours in the broiler.
3102,Bart,"hey dad, can i have $1,000?"
6120,Bart,yep. it's just that easy.
6517,Bart,"hm, ""marge and homer get dirty."""
3852,Bart,"uh, homer? it's five years later and i'm still miserable at school."
5762,Bart,krusty?! that's the one man i would never kill.
7481,Bart,"hey lis, there's your boyfriend."
1661,Bart,"i'd love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities."
11073,Bart,"okay, okay! just checking."
9654,Bart,"goodbye, annie, my eight-legged friend."
9034,Bart,not even when she's snorkeling.
7952,Bart,remember when we saw hunch's butt in the shower?
9721,Bart,"something, something, something!"
8551,Bart,"because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee."
762,Bart,"so, you guys like being cops?"
10212,Bart,no one cancels my free play!
11835,Bart,can we?
5805,Bart,"aw, man, we could have been on the cover of ""mad""."
2618,Bart,hey! they're taking our lemons!
12341,Bart,"cool, man."
10114,Bart,you couldn't get in the door of random house if your name was bennett cerf the third!
11826,Bart,cool!
11866,Bart,like strip poker!
2751,Bart,deal.
4499,Bart,"but, mom --"
3800,Bart,well. okay.
9981,Bart,"i see how it is. you get a booty call and i get a cootie call. well, it's gonna cost ya."
6091,Bart,sey-mour...
1737,Bart,"yes, krusty?"
10539,Bart,"dad, it's getting cold out here."
11881,Bart,"an hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on."
3420,Bart,oops. sorry.
13027,Bart,"why, mrs. krabappel! how would i know where the principal's office is?"
9656,Bart,i can't believe you're making us go to a birthday party for a kid we don't even know.
8435,Bart,you just bought another freezer!
12294,Bart,"no, i'm not."
11691,Bart,i was trying to even it out!
10961,Bart,what if we... van houten to the max?
4671,Bart,you wanna hold it for a while?
6420,Bart,"heads up, dad. here comes the scum!"
6691,Bart,"okay, five more minutes and i'm chewing my hand off."
5365,Bart,i'll do my best.
4031,Bart,"all right, you chop my hands half way off and then i'll still have enough strength to chop..."
9558,Bart,wow.
2120,Bart,"look at all this great stuff, lis. cool, personalized plates."
12533,Bart,"hm, hey, martin."
9100,Bart,"because he knows that if mom and dad don't get married, i'll never be born!"
3725,Bart,"oh geez, i'm sorry. i wish there was some way we could both have a dog."
6914,Bart,smash this six pack!
12058,Bart,let's just say i paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
6550,Bart,not up! down!
1503,Bart,to krusty. the greatest entertainer in the world. except maybe that guy.
843,Bart,"oh well, i guess the wedding's off. fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day."
8795,Bart,you got nothing! you got nothing!
11966,Bart,is mr. freely there?
9701,Bart,oh come on. what kind of big fat moron would fall for...
4444,Bart,"uh, dad, i don't think the dog can handle any more bacon."
3107,Bart,keep the trial going. i'll be right back.
12942,Bart,boat ride!
9002,Bart,"dad, that's bashir -- my new friend."
2558,Bart,i'm listening...
12890,Bart,"hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell."
9356,Bart,got it. how can i thank you?

12086,Bart,that guy's been tormenting all of us for years. and i for one am sick of it.
12363,Bart,"yes, sir."
11636,Bart,hm.
1127,Bart,can't complain.
5284,Bart,"way to make a guitar, sears."
11498,Bart,so i did make her pregnant?

221,Bart,awesome!
3344,Bart,he's tough but fair. i'll start sorting these bras.
6128,Bart,help!
6426,Bart,"good morning, ladies."
708,Bart,hmmm.
541,Bart,"helmets are for wusses, sir."
8741,Bart,"i don't care how much of a pumped-up freak you are, i still love you. the way barry bonds's kids probably still love him."
6302,Bart,"tomato, tomato."
4550,Bart,no! don't hurt them! i'll just keep them as pets.
4917,Bart,i don't see any cameras.
57,Bart,check.
1463,Bart,can you get me some of those flintstones' chewable morphine?
2596,Bart,but mom--
11358,Bart,he's just riding the thermals from dad's butt.
3317,Bart,uh-oh.
3498,Bart,"no, don't! you have to protect yourself!"
5120,Bart,"look dad, it's the drummer from bread!"
12668,Bart,mom.
8393,Bart,"let's get this show on the road, man. we got things to do."
11407,Bart,"um... thanks, but i'm not sure i want to be a bully."
7867,Bart,"well, my mom says why bother punishing me, i never learn."
3957,Bart,"it's probably a million years old, dad. i think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
1258,Bart,true or false: you can get mono from riding the monorail?
12705,Bart,here?
11819,Bart,all right!
3268,Bart,i don't care. i can't breathe in here.
122,Bart,i need some money / a lot of money... ahh
11830,Bart,ow! quit it!
3020,Bart,i'm gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
9816,Bart,that's it. from now on we'll just play hangman.
2954,Bart,"yeah, right. you're just trying to trick me because you don't want me playing with your videogame."
6422,Bart,"hey ma, our crap shack's going to hell."
10960,Bart,now sing the alphabet song!
4939,Bart,"dad, i admit i have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer."
12649,Bart,what's with these people? why are they sitting on their hands?
4583,Bart,a cartoon axe. i love it.
7645,Bart,that was some new years. now listen. i think we should consider breaking your parents up again.
8406,Bart,it won't come off!
1669,Bart,knives are boring.
2135,Bart,but it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
3549,Bart,more.
4944,Bart,i'm having some side effects from the dope.
2513,Bart,"no, it's dogs. i'll prove it."
9774,Bart,"my stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball. what happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin' a little chin music?"
12849,Bart,"luckily, i was not killed that day. although sometimes i wish i had been."
3813,Bart,i'm in over my head here. thank you for your time.
4251,Bart,"those are all moderately cool ideas, but if you really want to walk on the wild side, i know just the place."
2172,Bart,"hmm, i wonder where jimbo is today. he should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago."
10205,Bart,what videogame is this like?
6783,Bart,ka-ra-té!
1829,Bart,hey!
8851,Bart,"hello?... you want denis leary? wrong number, dumbass."

10283,Bart,"yo, teachwads! the brotherhood of the spectacles has taken over the school!"
4987,Bart,"well, that's great, dad, except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper."
8395,Bart,dentist?! you said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!
5016,Bart,you have been selected for operation exodus...
8685,Bart,"for the next three days i'm gonna stick to you like waffle syrup on a shag rug. i'm gonna be on you like fish stink on a gloucester dog. i'm gonna be all over you like-- hey, where'd she go?"
6341,Bart,finally. can we go now?
12579,Bart,uh-oh.
3489,Bart,why the hell would i want to see that?
5632,Bart,"wild, bushy hair, like an animal."
12275,Bart,"all the way from gay paree. four bucks, plus tax."
4321,Bart,damn blueberry stains.
3954,Bart,"oh, yeah."
9316,Bart,"dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on sunday?"
10827,Bart,um... where's santa's little helper?
10233,Bart,"see, dad? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. we're natural enemies, like george washington and abraham lincoln."
5951,Bart,the town keeps getting bigger. will there always be enough electricity?
655,Bart,no! my name is bart simpson!
1542,Bart,hardly ever! he's hardly ever sick at sea!
12716,Bart,bitchin'!
1575,Bart,"ooh, i hope this is sweat."
5887,Bart,"yeah. hey, homer, i thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better."
10029,Bart,"you know, dad, i really did have a good time hanging out with you."
6775,Bart,jealous much?
8700,Bart,mom! we need to throw out all this krusty cereal and get robot-clown cereal!
10937,Bart,"um, i've gotta make a phone call."
4426,Bart,"yeah, what's with the love thang?"
1993,Bart,can't you give me anything for it?
10106,Bart,"okay, first i'll send down my shoes."
6904,Bart,"can i, for true?"
5041,Bart,"let 'im go, mom."
8260,Bart,could a kid like me get these boxes? then use 'em for whatever he wanted?
2084,Bart,"then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. now here's what we do. tomorrow morning when allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry."
2214,Bart,wow. now i have the energy to do anything!
1513,Bart,i bought this cool pencil holder.
2147,Bart,cool! i call the flintstone phone!
3246,Bart,"oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
11990,Bart,ooops!
6924,Bart,"dad, it was so great -- knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
9324,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, i am a big dummy with a stupid job. i write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. could the court reporter read that back?"
2240,Bart,"you know, with the way you're treating me, why should i protect you?"
3442,Bart,it's the american way!
11810,Bart,"dad, mom trusted us with a secret--"
7663,Bart,but he's innocent.
3744,Bart,wow.
9445,Bart,snap out of it! you're krusty the clown! one of look magazine's hundred most-promising clowns of nineteen fifty-eight!
4226,Bart,"well that is your problem, ralph. this is how i always walk."
5685,Bart,are you okay?
7165,Bart,i wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud.
1770,Bart,do the line. just do the line. what's gonna happen to me?
11458,Bart,what the?
2416,Bart,nothing. some stupid country thinks i owe them money.
7212,Bart,cool! i'm vomit.
1022,Bart,dad!
11972,Bart,"don't do it, dad!"
1424,Bart,grampa? grampa?
9885,Bart,nooooo!
10678,Bart,"hey, dubya."
5130,Bart,it's an illusion.
12751,Bart,"touchdown, simpson! the boy nobody wanted just won the superbowl!!!"

5656,Bart,i'm getting a cramp in my wrist!
2506,Bart,"well, i have to coordinate, don't i?"
12775,Bart,"spare me your lectures, ladies."
1175,Bart,how can you like that guy?
3535,Bart,"hey, dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?"
1279,Bart,"it won't be any fun without you, dad."
8469,Bart,he died as he lived -- like a dork.
5108,Bart,unless...
12650,Bart,"well, i guess it's back to good old springfield."
11258,Bart,"sure, dad."
3594,Bart,"i'm trying, dad."
5509,Bart,"hey, todd! can we borrow your woodpecker?"
2659,Bart,"gun it, flanders!"
9845,Bart,it's not milhouse!
10707,Bart,no sir.
3069,Bart,"quick, mom! whip up a cake before dad fires you!"
2338,Bart,oh please.
6958,Bart,"hey, that wasn't me, that was milhouse?"
5616,Bart,why are we still grifting? the car's paid for. doesn't that balance out the universe?
9408,Bart,not that stupid stuffed lamb again. this isn't learning!
9516,Bart,so that's why i'm so cool!
685,Bart,"well, i'll be damned."
2994,Bart,"that's a dumb name. who's that, george?"
12995,Bart,"no way, josé."
206,Bart,an elephant's butt?
8366,Bart,"santa's little helper, you came too!"
12238,Bart,so... watch me hit him right between the eyes.
2080,Bart,"way to go, lis. i mean, why compete with someone who's just gonna kick your butt anyway?"
1734,Bart,no.
9506,Bart,"his name is ""fatov."" he represents the russian spirit of sloth and alcoholism."
10740,Bart,"dad, you forgot to pick me up after little league!"
1640,Bart,"crank it, homer."
8482,Bart,"come on, it's easy. just push a, b, up, up, left trigger, right trigger, and both triggers at once."

12247,Bart,so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?

8525,Bart,you had your hot dog plumped?
4608,Bart,"uh, so, dad, regarding that form... why not just make up a middle name?"
326,Bart,"sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old daddly-doodly."
7454,Bart,"i see. you were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? that's my half-assed dad!"
4050,Bart,"so what's our first job, huh? test the roller coaster?"
5451,Bart,who'd have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket?

9157,Bart,i am so sorry i tried to deny who i really was. you deserve better. i'll never hurt you again. can you forgive me?
9149,Bart,"jenny, i can't take the pressure anymore. i have to come clean. i'm only pretending to be good..."
12701,Bart,"who? wait a minute, who's that?"
7373,Bart,"well... some kidnappers might be after me. it's a big world. but in this case, i faked the whole thing."
1002,Bart,he's such a bitch.

6284,Bart,hmmm...
3660,Bart,"aw, you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since i gave you those pep pills."
11301,Bart,"perfect. bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock."
1743,Bart,"hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."

3318,Bart,"i got your tooth, dad!"
11110,Bart,"uh, mom? i'm sorry i pretended to be good at piano-- and i'm really ashamed that i lied."

7030,Bart,say no more.
9392,Bart,"charlie, you'd rat on me?"
12262,Bart,to my room.
175,Bart,"uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, martin. it almost worked. but tonight, this comic book stays right here."
10803,Bart,then you explain that.
2006,Bart,i'm outta here!
12104,Bart,i can't hear you.
5343,Bart,too slow!
1131,Bart,yeah.
6042,Bart,"eh, i already got a system."
288,Bart,oh baby!
7749,Bart,die! die! die!
11618,Bart,can't you just do what i say?!
5445,Bart,why am i just learning this now?
9007,Bart,"she said something about ""the bottom of the ocean"" and ""be back in a month."""
6154,Bart,i can't wait till i get good.
3739,Bart,bor-ing.
484,Bart,"jeez, now we're slaves. this paw sucks."
1778,Bart,what happened?
1943,Bart,that does it. i'm outta here.
11352,Bart,"well... my dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
12091,Bart,"we are rubber, you are glue."
6845,Bart,"screw that. when i grow up, i'm legally changing my name to joe kickass."
1075,Bart,now's our chance to be bad.
12731,Bart,"all right. twelve big ones and free grub to boot. viva skid row. hey, it's that anchor dude from channel six."
2817,Bart,yes.
2381,Bart,"yes. he can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny."
11942,Bart,"i cheated on the intelligence test. i'm sorry. but i just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. i love you, dad, and i think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad."
10688,Bart,"oh good, she's playing."
11459,Bart,"oh, yawn. another freebie. better be a sixty-four gig."
2212,Bart,i guess.
11372,Bart,"no offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny."
9838,Bart,ha! you're not so tough now.
164,Bart,"look, pal. we've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""radioactive man no. 1"". so why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
3170,Bart,...but i don't think i'd go back again next year. it's getting too commercial. they've forgotten it's supposed to be about the grammar.
1417,Bart,"eh, too predictable. the way i see it, instead of shampoo itchy covers scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
9144,Bart,sorry i'm late. i didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
154,Bart,"no! no, not the iodine! burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- yaaauuuggghhh!"
8149,Bart,"papa, may we have chocolat?"
1679,Bart,"look, homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. then it'll be his fault."
9966,Bart,and i bet it has something to do with this scar.
6952,Bart,ay carumba!
517,Bart,"game's over, grampa."
2745,Bart,you shank. how could you tell on me?
7023,Bart,"welcome to ""the others."""
10795,Bart,"okay, but when i grow up and i'm living on your couch, and i drink all your booze, and sell your jewelry, you gotta be cool."
1694,Bart,"you mean it ain't me noggin, it's me peepers? well that's just loverly."
7743,Bart,sure... why not? it'll be fun.
8037,Bart,come to my house at midnight.
1441,Bart,"how about ""beans, beans, the musical fruit?"""
6466,Bart,"these stink lines stand for dedication, caring, and for letting me drink coffee in class. way to go, edna!"
7865,Bart,mom didn't say anything about high-def!
10602,Bart,monday... here we go again...
11889,Bart,"sign me up, doc."
5729,Bart,i'll say... partner.
2978,Bart,"oh man, is it hot in here! i better take off my sweater."
9849,Bart,oh yeah! and-and you always avoid the face around picture day. people appreciate that.
832,Bart,"hey dad, can i do a ham-bone solo?"
13097,Bart,"no, mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house."
2922,Bart,i'm outside. i got away with it! i'm free!
952,Bart,"dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. it may as well be your brother."
7426,Bart,"oh, this place smells, and something's dripping on me."
3825,Bart,principal skinner?
12006,Bart,the fat guy on tv?
2923,Bart,uh... i don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
1402,Bart,...but you always looked out for me.
10422,Bart,thanks.
10670,Bart,i don't. i'm just bored watchin' worms drown.
9739,Bart,"see, bob. even you hate to see you."
3333,Bart,"milhouse, this is boring. make it crash or something!"
9382,Bart,"be cool, be cool -- he's an orphan. you know, just like annie, except he's a dude and he hates tomorrow."
5931,Bart,really? what?
8265,Bart,now we just have to figure out what to do with these boxes.
3629,Bart,"oh, now martin's scoring off of me. oh, that is it. listen up, everybody! follow me!"
7132,Bart,lisa made me! with a witch's spell!
2554,Bart,"that's it. i can't take this anymore, milhouse. i've gotta get the real teachers back."
11667,Bart,let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
9863,Bart,"this town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
3569,Bart,"if you want me, you gotta catch me!"
8686,Bart,what if someone catches him?
8036,Bart,"krusty, what's that monster?"
5432,Bart,"well, do you see him or not?"
7026,Bart,maggie! press the red button!
215,Bart,"dad, the mailman is here."
5698,Bart,too much raw bacon.
8737,Bart,what's my code name?
3580,Bart,"it's all right. i was hoping they'd give me one of those steel claws, but what're ya gonna do?"
41,Bart,"yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
9343,Bart,dad... i want a baby brother.
8894,Bart,i thought it was fifty.
1475,Bart,"we flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway and now we have to feed it."
2463,Bart,no tourists? i'll be ruined.
3189,Bart,"oh wow! there really is a treasure! whatever you do, don't give him the key, grampa!"
6130,Bart,what?
12278,Bart,hep! hep! lisa! my ungue is stuck in the eater. hep-hep!
3665,Bart,twelve hundred bucks?! i better just get one.
8189,Bart,really? we didn't? but we kissed and held hands at the same time.
7309,Bart,"come on, chief. i can't afford to pay protection to you and nelson."
3345,Bart,just glad to be on the team!
5134,Bart,polo!
4624,Bart,"relax, there's nothing here you didn't see when dad boycotted pants."
3227,Bart,what religion are you?
2906,Bart,"oh, yeah."
5818,Bart,"uh, mom..."
4033,Bart,"work was hard, so we quit."
4670,Bart,scratching their big butts...
2749,Bart,"how can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? listen. you don't have a soul, i don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul."
245,Bart,uh-huh. and is elvis with you?
1606,Bart,cool!
4567,Bart,dad?
4602,Bart,there goes my turn.
12035,Bart,not really.
4774,Bart,"dad, no!"
1009,Bart,"way to go, mom."
8543,Bart,i'm going to set things right. wanna come with me?
7544,Bart,"so, are you a colonel or a captain?"
11550,Bart,i suck?! you suck!
8972,Bart,thirty-five cents? where did that come from? can't be mine -- must be yours.
12696,Bart,"put her there, man!"
879,Bart,where's otto?
12182,Bart,"there aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, dad?"
148,Bart,"not yet, but at least i'm in a lot of pain."
7600,Bart,"you just don't get it. i've made a sacred commitment to the catholic church, and... paintball! awesome!"
10514,Bart,you're in.
7781,Bart,let's hit the floor!
10322,Bart,"hi, we need someone to re-program our robots to break out of jail."
9535,Bart,but dad said i had to finish--
6029,Bart,"well, i'd like to trust you, homer. but you've been in jail three times."
9687,Bart,"he sure nailed you, lis."
11144,Bart,"hey, if they get on an airbus, they know they're taking their chances."
95,Bart,"but i must. until this moment, i never knew why god put me on this earth, but now i know... to buy that comic book."
2187,Bart,"i've changed my ways. please give me another chance, ma'am."
7718,Bart,"oh, you."
1889,Bart,"um, i'd kind of like to go home now."
11641,Bart,ow! this has never happened before! i have a crush on my teacher!
9228,Bart,"so, um, you're wearing the same bathrobe you were the last time i was here. that's cool."
10149,Bart,i was invited to that party!
9998,Bart,are you kidding? you're the worst dad who ever lived! i'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
4580,Bart,whoaaa! cool!
10369,Bart,"a troll, that's it! our book could be about an orphan troll!"
4892,Bart,"my name is mary. i'm 45, heavy and willing to settle for less."
6577,Bart,"well, i got my laugh. i'm outta here."
8272,Bart,want to melt it with a hose?
4628,Bart,"aw, cheer up, lis. you got a good grade without even reading the book. that's win-win."
433,Bart,milhouse. you can come in and drop the charade.
1610,Bart,wowww!!
11040,Bart,"he's right, these underwater speakers are amazing!"
10664,Bart,"hey dad, you remember when you said if flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?"
11706,Bart,christmas eve. the one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he can't. i can't have another cocoa.
1753,Bart,show business sucks. i'm outta here.
9574,Bart,"hi, nikki. i'm bart. this situation, it's nuts, right?"
11696,Bart,no. this ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life. and i'm gonna wreck it. because he scarred me forever!

4654,Bart,all right! here comes the implosion!
1639,Bart,eep.
5248,Bart,"he's dead, isn't he?"
10727,Bart,huh. didn't know they still ran those trains.
53,Bart,"don't take that tone with me, young lady, or i'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
887,Bart,"mom, can otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? he sure can!"
1222,Bart,can't sleep... clown'll eat me... can't sleep... clown'll eat me...
4062,Bart,"we're natural born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down with a family..."
4193,Bart,me. i smell a museum.
2919,Bart,"hmmm. maybe if i stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
4606,Bart,fat guy number three?
7963,Bart,"bye-bye, take care, watch your step, eat my shorts, have a good one..."
9779,Bart,"here's my uniform, since i won't be needing it any more!"
4494,Bart,"wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter."

11769,Bart,recommended by a kid i used to know.
3506,Bart,"thanks for trying, guys, but sideshow bob wants me dead, and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine."

3908,Bart,"okay, milhouse, lets try out the new cup."

823,Bart,santa's little helper! it's you! aaaggghhh!!
5165,Bart,"... then i said ""i have the power"" and the bucket came off!"
11093,Bart,whoopee...
4803,Bart,"say, how's tomorrow for you?"
10837,Bart,"man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps."
7808,Bart,"c'mon, dad, we got a long way to go. you can't stay mad at me the whole time."
5538,Bart,k. the c.?
11933,Bart,"well, i could pretend i'm a regular dumb kid. you know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. you know, see what makes them tick."

6040,Bart,our bitter fights are now history!
10975,Bart,"well, if i look at your face, i get sick."
11794,Bart,'stead of the stuff we've got...
7994,Bart,"well, i've got a confession to make. this right arm... it's not mine."

4677,Bart,she's right! homer's done a ton of crap that never made the papers.
4173,Bart,what are they doing with our forty-five cents?
4413,Bart,ow! ow! ow! ow!

4326,Bart,"no, i haven't, lisa. because i went out with a camera and did a different kind of story."
4339,Bart,"well, if i'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much. i'm bart simpson."
9336,Bart,i can't believe this is how pilgrims lived.

1510,Bart,what are we all laughing about?
4329,Bart,some say the ducks went to canada. others say toronto. and some people think that joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. but it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
6620,Bart,the only way to be cooler than him is to do exactly what he does. i've gotta steal me a hood ornament! but how?
2072,Bart,hell-o. first born within earshot.

742,Bart,it's a date.
8707,Bart,martin?! what's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
7641,Bart,you think that's traumatic.
10296,Bart,well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so i can't see the board.
2529,Bart,yeah. she said you'd fold faster than superman on laundry day.

2893,Bart,gotta hide.
8567,Bart,"well i've got a valentine's day story! it's about musicians from a simpler time. the era of the brady bunch, donny and marie, and..."
931,Bart,"samantha and milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!"
253,Bart,"joe's taxidermy. you snuff 'em, we stuff 'em."
7384,Bart,"milhouse, if you tell anyone, i'll tell the world you wet your pants watching harry potter."
9692,Bart,"welcome to chaos corners, the pleasure patch, satan's triangle...the one place in town no cameras can see you and no laws can touch you!"
3122,Bart,well... i wasn't the one who solved the problem and neither was lisa. there's something unsettling about that.
10516,Bart,"dammit, she knows! okay, how do we buy your silence?"
324,Bart,"hey, lis. change the channel."
8118,Bart,"we sure are far from the rest of 'em. funny how that happened, huh?"

7817,Bart,i've learned so much in my three hours here. i don't have to play pranks to feel good. i can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
374,Bart,"those fingers through my hair / that sly come hither stare / that strips my conscience bare / it's witchcraft - gimme three fingers of milk, ma."

6246,Bart,thanks guys.
3514,Bart,"i won't be happy until i find out what you're up to. wherever you go and whatever you do, i'll be there watching and waiting."
9224,Bart,milhouse... we ruined edna's life. maybe we can get her job back.

3350,Bart,"heh. nudist colonies are everywhere these days. i'd love to go, but i... i can't get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!"
1509,Bart,"no, really, i can't. it's a serious problem."
12142,Bart,"oh. too bad. well, i certainly had fun vacuuming. maybe now i'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub."
3425,Bart,"hey, i'm not gonna get fired. is there any gold in this mountain?"
2205,Bart,but your father said...
3553,Bart,"oh, i'm a baby, huh? well, then i'll act like a baby."
3973,Bart,could it be...?

9855,Bart,"c'mon, man, leave me alone."
1339,Bart,"oh, it isn't fair. i'm ten times the krusty fan you are. i even have the krusty home pregnancy test."
3669,Bart,"okay, watch this. watch. do a back-flip, laddie!"
6842,Bart,"yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day."
126,Bart,"no, not today. i need the dime."
2753,Bart,"any time, chummmmm...p."
6997,Bart,but not today. i think i'm just gonna hang out at home.
10167,Bart,this is our house. there's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams!
10305,Bart,"how is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time?"
12810,Bart,"i love you, dad."
9636,Bart,"bart, i'm not thrilled either. but one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. want to help me with my ant farm?"
10986,Bart,but grampa...
1544,Bart,"take him away, boys."
2031,Bart,don't turn on that light!!

6335,Bart,"i had no idea, dad. i just assumed with all the stranglings, you know..."
12901,Bart,"man, i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules."
973,Bart,"no, sir."
10832,Bart,he's alive!

6754,Bart,"wow, she looks like a background character in a hanna barbera cartoon!"
10337,Bart,"yeah, just have fun -- dad would."
837,Bart,"that's right, aunt selma. your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown for armed robbery."
11540,Bart,mother's day?!

5863,Bart,"bottle rockets, frog-launchers, weeping mommas... tijuana toilet crackers!"
789,Bart,i will.
6954,Bart,"what is that, a quarter?"
12354,Bart,"so long, sucker."
10883,Bart,it's hopeless. i can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. i need two days!
5110,Bart,peace out!
566,Bart,who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
7160,Bart,"because i'm ""it."""
7533,Bart,"when i raged against the machine, money poured out."
9581,Bart,"dad, i know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school i kind of like."
9778,Bart,so what? we won.
8106,Bart,"they just can, okay."
798,Bart,"sorry if i betrayed your trust, principal sucker."
12353,Bart,what can i say? i got a weakness for the classics.
13116,Bart,i can't take your scholarship! it's going to my sister. it would break her heart.
9657,Bart,i don't even remember if dylan's a boy or a girl.
9210,Bart,uh-oh. do you think we went too far?
10604,Bart,"want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!"
1911,Bart,"i thought i'd be jumping for joy the day skinner left, but now all i have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
5275,Bart,i wasn't gonna gamble. i just wanted a bloody mary.
8294,Bart,i am going off to explore the crevices of lagrimmar.
3844,Bart,and bingo was his name-o!
4637,Bart,"hey, mom, look what i got."
125,Bart,"here you go, apu."

4458,Bart,are you as excited as i am?
9923,Bart,huh? i thought you said you didn't want a tree.
112,Bart,no.
1330,Bart,yeah.
10548,Bart,"isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?"
1764,Bart,obnoxious fad?
7291,Bart,"i'm still a kid. and what do kids love? kid stuff, like this."
6113,Bart,but she might say no.
2400,Bart,australia.
2855,Bart,"where have you been, granny? did they freeze you or something?"
6988,Bart,just do it.
1257,Bart,"wow, dad. you really know your monorails."
6805,Bart,"you do? cool, a blank check for mayhem."
10188,Bart,"i dunno. it's one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers?"
7532,Bart,not for long -- i'm saying goodbye to scammer and z-dog. i've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
12512,Bart,"both arms, ma'am."
6414,Bart,and you learned that a woman doesn't need a forty-eight inch chest to be beautiful.
2548,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i'm done failing the test. can i please go to the nurse?"
12757,Bart,i don't know! i don't know why i did it! i don't know why i enjoyed it! and i don't know why i'll do it again!
7148,Bart,"yeah, i agree. i mean, you are pretty annoying."
12525,Bart,"no, i mean it. you can't hold me back. i swear i'm gonna do better. look at my eyes. see the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. as god is my witness, i can pass the fourth grade."
5648,Bart,what's that? you want the pee bucket on your head?
7142,Bart,"so, mom and dad are going to atlantic city...but their luggage isn't. and homer's getting the low-fat meal."
7133,Bart,wicca's a hollywood fad!
9271,Bart,"mom, you can't fight that guy."
9288,Bart,right. like we agreed.
1762,Bart,"uh... i never thought i'd say this, but shouldn't we be learning something?"
7219,Bart,there's an open house next door. they're giving out cookies and business cards!
9148,Bart,"milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?"
11500,Bart,i didn't mean to make her pregnant. i just hate art so much.
5908,Bart,"i just like it, is all."
7627,Bart,"yeah, and i could really use your help."
6852,Bart,no.
6779,Bart,no.

11613,Bart,"just like you taught me, captain. over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch."
2063,Bart,"oh, well i guess that explains everything."
9515,Bart,"then they should've called it the ""above-ground normal-road."""
4256,Bart,"i can't bail on a friend, even if it is ralph."
7591,Bart,"...then father sean quoted eminem in his sermon. and in art class, we painted saint joan burning at the stake, and mine was the grossest! catholics rock!"
2984,Bart,"wow, look at all the colors, man!"
3812,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, i'm sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, i was born without taste buds. let me demonstrate."
9573,Bart,"um, this is the last seat, so..."

11403,Bart,"my dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows. so if you're gonna laugh at nelson, laugh at me too."
10534,Bart,"c'mon, dad. you made me mad so i got back at you. how was i to know parents had feelings?"
12184,Bart,right.
12875,Bart,i'm livin' it but i ain't lovin' it.
6890,Bart,because we're kids. kids! maybe that's the answer.
6768,Bart,"but i miss being a regular kid in the real world, gettin' a hug from my mom..."
9835,Bart,hm.
2576,Bart,how much of the hundred thou do i get?
4066,Bart,"thanks for dinner, mom. i love you."
4075,Bart,"thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, dad."

1808,Bart,"no way, josé !"
8537,Bart,i'm not sad. i have nothing to be sad about. nothing!
2820,Bart,"you're right. the only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force willie into a final showdown. you stay awake, and if it looks like i'm in trouble, wake me up."
2259,Bart,"well, i could use a new pair of hockey skates."
11230,Bart,"no, you're wrong! you're all wrong!"
6955,Bart,i'unno. the boogeyman?
4176,Bart,we're watching the tv.

992,Bart,"all right, that's it! i've been scorched by krusty before. i got a rapid heart beat from those krusty brand vitamins; my krusty calculator didn't have a 7 or an 8; and krusty's autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. but this time he's gone too far. we want krusty! we want krusty!"

4828,Bart,"see you in hell, ""god bless this house."""
3161,Bart,"no!! they'd kill us! look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. all we need is money, food, and a way to get home. follow me."

8729,Bart,i hear lou mooing in my head!
9653,Bart,"do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? or let her die in captivity, like grampa?"
5185,Bart,"oh, milhouse, this is my fault. i'm so sorry."
2908,Bart,it's the coolest video game ever!
5615,Bart,dad?
9796,Bart,"so which of these ""bored lames"" shall we play? taffyland?"

5328,Bart,"hey, lis. i need a favor."
5400,Bart,mom! lisa's growing!
9973,Bart,"i go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy."
11392,Bart,"absolutely. we're talking about lisa, right?"
1473,Bart,a pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared on a playing card.
8232,Bart,"yeah, right -- i bet you've got a bunch of ""learning"" games. why don't you go online and look for a boyfriend while i take a nap?"

12064,Bart,"what do you mean, mom?"
10677,Bart,"what?! without awards shows, how would i know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""glee"" is a comedy?"
11860,Bart,"look, dad. it's santa's little helper."
7625,Bart,"well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so i can get away."
4679,Bart,"good evening, adults."

4611,Bart,"aw, cheer up, dad. you make a great hippie."
4585,Bart,not if i know cartoons!
12144,Bart,"is, too."
5011,Bart,"whoa! hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing!"
554,Bart,"dad, aren't you coming?"
10933,Bart,when do i get a krusty suitcase?
7701,Bart,"mom, please. i'm playing a video game."
1265,Bart,"yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
8997,Bart,"a different religion? do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that you're different--"
11877,Bart,eat my shorts.
4014,Bart,she's going around the other side. now get her!
10428,Bart,"""fatso goes nutso!"" and post to youtube with the following key words ""fat,"" ""stupid,"" ""classic simpsons,"" and, just to be safe, ""baby rides kitten rides penguin."""
690,Bart,aaah!
7560,Bart,you heard nothing!
2625,Bart,death to shelbyville!
6125,Bart,this day just keeps getting better and better.
1605,Bart,"hey, it's morning, and mom and dad aren't home yet."
3053,Bart,how about krusty the clown?
149,Bart,there's a reason.
4223,Bart,these syrup stains are the worst.
11130,Bart,"yeah, it's tough being man of the house. you left some big underpants to fill. i didn't know they made underoos in size fifty-two."
10620,Bart,upgrade!
1005,Bart,"an' oi'll talk like 'is. bob's yer uncle, mate."
8018,Bart,hmmm.
2684,Bart,"the similarities are subtle, but many. for example, radioactive man has his famous catchphrase ""up and atom"" - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun..."
2827,Bart,good-bye lis. i hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for fifteen minutes.
8604,Bart,"gentlemen, someone i thought i could trust is a rat."
4743,Bart,"hysterical, but i traded my turn to lisa for her dessert."
7992,Bart,"i was a great drummer, and now i'm nothing! just like phil collins."
6501,Bart,"dad, do you plan to get in shape?"
7856,Bart,help! she's grooming me! she's grooming me!
3006,Bart,"whoa, man."
3,Bart,are you guys gonna beat me up?
138,Bart,mrs. glick?
6622,Bart,"hey, check out this hood ornament i stole."
7729,Bart,what? um... uh... i just shoplifted this bad boy. housewares never knew what hit 'em.
17591,Homer,"do i ever! it's five years later and i still think i'm a chicken. i'm a chicken, marge."
39577,Homer,"then you've heard. oh, god. what are we doing to do? the lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!"
37919,Homer,woo hoo!
19274,Homer,"bart, where are you?! come on! i have to be up at six a.m. to swipe flanders' newspaper!"
24914,Homer,who are all these oddballs?
34934,Homer,"mr. burns, why'd you come to see me?"
29932,Homer,"man, i'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. although to be honest, i did enjoy lying down."
37026,Homer,"this could come in handy. but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home. dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
40767,Homer,not to me there isn't!
36495,Homer,can i just trim the hem?
34407,Homer,whuh?
21362,Homer,"hey. wait a minute. i'm on the top. i actually did it. i climbed the unclimbable mountain! bow down before me, everyone! for i am your king!"
21110,Homer,"quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. it goes all the way to the president."
18595,Homer,then what are you dressed like that for?
23839,Homer,electric needle room?!
35488,Homer,"i know, i know you're not comfortable with all the guys edna's seen around town."
23739,Homer,i'll show you.
34442,Homer,they have malls on land?
28801,Homer,"who loves ya, baby?"
27173,Homer,"huh? oh, right. can you hold it?"
14934,Homer,"kids, wait in the car. i want to talk to your mother about this play thing."
39935,Homer,four.
13398,Homer,gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband.
22174,Homer,"geez, flanders. you're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
38749,Homer,"okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
33663,Homer,i will never... know... the score!
32476,Homer,then it was all a dream. i never became a hideous monster.
33643,Homer,what the?
30762,Homer,"i'm comin', boy!"
31758,Homer,e-z blo...
18755,Homer,"okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. i know a much better way to get attention..."
13486,Homer,where is it?
41468,Homer,what do you know?
27748,Homer,hello!
35857,Homer,"""bloody harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! now, i'm gonna show these boys downtown springfield."
31969,Homer,"so daddy saved apu and moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson."
14416,Homer,buffalo's gonna win. lisa hates me!
29217,Homer,"shrink ray? oh, there's always something else to buy."
20540,Homer,woo hoo!
36864,Homer,what? no one judges my wife's thunderbags! well maybe i was wrong about these people. who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
20885,Homer,"from now on, i'm gonna be just like krusty and tell it like it is. marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs."
39275,Homer,santa?
17941,Homer,my ears are burning.
33407,Homer,"honey, i'm home! where are the kids?"
29096,Homer,it felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.
39627,Homer,lisa!
39819,Homer,"motel, i guess."
24561,Homer,"hello, wife! hello, children!"
21877,Homer,"yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. the point is, i'm a grown man, and i deserve a middle name."
19112,Homer,uh... to work for you?
38255,Homer,no penalty!
32489,Homer,my what now?
23759,Homer,"uhh. is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? is that what this is, lisa?"
17003,Homer,"hee, hee, hee, hee. that is funny."
14823,Homer,"oh, goodbye, old girl. we've had a lot of great memories."
22896,Homer,"no, i'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. you'll always be the artist in the family."
39812,Homer,why you little --
25994,Homer,"hi, formico."
32143,Homer,"stop saying ""security""!"
25032,Homer,let's see how this plays out.
28268,Homer,"i couldn't sleep, because i thought there might be a sign of my mom in one of these articles. they never did find her body."
26098,Homer,"so, how was your day? did anything unbelievable happen? phone calls, things of that nature?"
19794,Homer,"hey, boy, wake up! your old man found some deer!"
29686,Homer,"okay, i'll do it. because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. ha-ha, now we're even!"
19622,Homer,oh?
29986,Homer,why is everyone looking at me?
23377,Homer,doin' what now?
40617,Homer,there's gotta be something i haven't tried. huh? hey! what's this? fugu!
19885,Homer,ka-blammo.
17578,Homer,"hee hee hee! i can see everything. and they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
34903,Homer,"marge, i'm watching a rerun of an important bowl game."
25734,Homer,"sure, knock yourselves out, and call me homer."
14574,Homer,i am? whoo-hoo!
13241,Homer,"""levi's."" hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
18993,Homer,"oh, it makes no sense. i haven't changed since high school and suddenly i'm uncool. i've been kicked out of paradise."
27152,Homer,"kids, kids, you're both right."
28170,Homer,ow! i'll reap! i'll reap already!
34624,Homer,i got marge!
22215,Homer,one betting disk please. watch and learn.
20227,Homer,wowww...
41580,Homer,miss viola? isn't she cuckoo?
31369,Homer,"is it our anniversary? no, we don't have one this year. hmmm..."
28388,Homer,"i did a lot of stuff today. i went to starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
38157,Homer,"are they, marge? if you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
20528,Homer,you should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. and i know just the place.
15436,Homer,thank you.
40387,Homer,"keep your left arm straight, bart... rotate your shoulders..."
21339,Homer,"well, yeah..."
19941,Homer,can lenny have it?
36140,Homer,pay for your genius!
17443,Homer,ooooookay.
21382,Homer,"uh, yesss... but now i have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
18221,Homer,forty seconds? but i want it now.
35678,Homer,"pine needle... sorbet... pine needle sorbet!! my kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!"
27619,Homer,"maybe i should hook up with you guys. after all, how long do any of us have to live?"
17056,Homer,i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
23238,Homer,maarge. i think bart's gone crazy!
26701,Homer,woo hoo!
20012,Homer,he did.
27923,Homer,those poor hats.
38415,Homer,more?
39871,Homer,"yeah, but what about bart?"
37166,Homer,but i just did that!
25736,Homer,that is the darnedest thing!
13835,Homer,"slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. end of monster. heh heh heh."
31165,Homer,cancellations require twenty-four hours no-tice.
34555,Homer,"marge, how hard can it be? we're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. it's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a mexican prison."
26505,Homer,it was the end of the trojan war. clever odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the trojans once and for all...
37949,Homer,and now to moe's.
20691,Homer,"no i don't, i think they're bad / they're fake and phoney and totally wrong."
28361,Homer,"bart, we made her the same thing!"
24616,Homer,wait a minute! we haven't heard from me yet. the nut with the dynamite. the phone company is bamboozling you!
33894,Homer,"well, at least you can't nag me anymore."
40918,Homer,find a husband? which one's selma again?
39452,Homer,marge!
23261,Homer,i'd sure hate to be him.
34195,Homer,"...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!"
15216,Homer,"now, marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak english. ah, tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
31262,Homer,hmm... let me mull that over.
21256,Homer,do we want old man patterson here with his finger on the button?
29204,Homer,flanders? kill me? you never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
28603,Homer,"oh, the beer's gone. i'll have to suck it out of the shag."
32611,Homer,happier!
41076,Homer,"no, my cookie!"
13253,Homer,"no, she's mine!"
39827,Homer,"uh... mr. burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, i'm no lover-boy."
30554,Homer,"no, but i swam in it."
23625,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you can trust me."
14000,Homer,"ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, i'm sold."
27050,Homer,"good morning, everybody! what's for breakfast, cutie?"
17841,Homer,we left at 1:30 p.m. monday. what time is it now?
23135,Homer,"listen, gibson, i'm tired of hollywood pretty boys like you and jack valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. you see this?"
32790,Homer,i was having the most wonderful dream. i always wake up just before the good part.
32496,Homer,that's how they getcha!
34515,Homer,"hey, chief. i uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket."
30398,Homer,"that's ridiculous! no woman would want to have sex with that loser! and, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. good stuff."
38301,Homer,is there no end to your fault-finding?!
27309,Homer,they're not for dudes!
17552,Homer,"you see?! you see?! ""i"" just left ""my"" first session and ""i"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
33222,Homer,nooooooooooooooooo!
32026,Homer,i wanna get us all in the picture this time. closer.
18220,Homer,i got it! madman moe's pressure cooker!
17597,Homer,"aw, thanks, lenny. when am i gonna be initiated?"
39388,Homer,"""dear family: i am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. by the time you read this, i will be in my watery grave. i can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'stand tall, have courage and never give up.' i only hope i can provide a better model in death than i did in life. warmest regards, love homer j. simpson."""
22948,Homer,"woo hoo! look at me, i can juggle!"
22448,Homer,"get used to it, honey. from now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters."
20358,Homer,sorry.
37968,Homer,as long as we keep drinking this.
29359,Homer,woo hoo!
16807,Homer,"wow, thanks. now i have four children. you will be called ""stitch-face."" wow, flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
38581,Homer,can you be more specific?
31653,Homer,floor it!
40225,Homer,"but you do get to express yourself. in the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
17663,Homer,listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show. it was a tumultuous time for our nation. the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
41310,Homer,"yes, sir."
20686,Homer,"wait, wait, wait. here comes lee marvin. thank god. he's always drunk and violent."
30045,Homer,"okay morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard."
21714,Homer,but i look so youthful and hunky.
25212,Homer,"ah, you saw our bus ad."
35793,Homer,and kiss.
29571,Homer,go to hell.
18322,Homer,mmm... unprocessed fish sticks.
36787,Homer,"dohhh! sauce, cheese, topping!"
35005,Homer,i'd give anything to bring you back.
39529,Homer,"no, no! not like that! like this!"
21962,Homer,"eat, eat! you're nothing but skin and bones."
35034,Homer,this is late for marge. i assume. i've never been home at this hour.
25184,Homer,uh-huh.
16865,Homer,"""gomer upsets sergeant carter."" ooooh, i'll never forget that episode!"
17797,Homer,that's the spirit. never give up.
14345,Homer,"huh, they both make a good case."
41356,Homer,"calm down, homer. calm down."
22096,Homer,wha?
35016,Homer,fit tony took his cousin's place running the springfield mob.
23570,Homer,any questions?
38249,Homer,you're a funny one to tell me about deception.
33934,Homer,don't look at me. don't look at me!
38041,Homer,excuse me. i have to make a call.
30145,Homer,makes sense.
14423,Homer,"money comes and money goes, but what i have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
35727,Homer,i'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
30037,Homer,neither. i'm both.
36987,Homer,"aw. uh, listen, i've gotta know. you're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?"
38353,Homer,whoa. that's a bit of a woo-hoo. indeed.
19180,Homer,wow! i've never been in here before!
21055,Homer,me?
22001,Homer,"hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!"
32685,Homer,none.
33646,Homer,"i'm gonna say this for the last time: bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
28633,Homer,keep me focused.
30169,Homer,what's this? goodbye springfield...
13963,Homer,that baby changed our lives.
40187,Homer,why you little --!
25915,Homer,we're free! your mother set us free!
29873,Homer,"mine. oh, move your hand. i get this!"
41065,Homer,"well, you bought all those smoke alarms and we haven't had a single fire."
28704,Homer,"that's right. i love you marge, and i realize now i should show you more often. the end of your book was the wakeup call i needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
20579,Homer,we do?
29408,Homer,act like burns!
13594,Homer,shut up.
25699,Homer,orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... lighting candles!
14973,Homer,looks like we have a new champion.
17806,Homer,i'm not krusty.
41290,Homer,what the hell are you doing?!
33805,Homer,there are no flights to london till five!
34020,Homer,she couldn't possibly do worse!
14786,Homer,"that's better. hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
34543,Homer,"oh. well i'm not crawling back to big electricity! from now on, the simpsons are living intermittently."
39016,Homer,"fine. we'll both go. and if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
35626,Homer,don't tell my wife.
40581,Homer,"hey, hey, guys. knock it off. it's just my wife."
13605,Homer,those kids don't know what they're missing.
36841,Homer,"""t-rex?"" even their names are cool! this is, umm... ice cream, bungee jump, and... viral video."
41499,Homer,i'll watch it later.
29177,Homer,stupid women helicopter pilots.
35699,Homer,the experience begins!
36775,Homer,"will you kids pipe down! i'm trying to get ""churro-chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. what country is mexico in?"
14074,Homer,"nah... marge, i'm too upset to eat -- i think i'll go to moe's. ."
21381,Homer,"mmmaybe... but you don't know lisa. i mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
41263,Homer,"i'm a big four-eyed lame-o and i wear the same stupid sweater every day, and..."
20858,Homer,"bill gates? billionaire computer nerd bill gates? oh my god, oh my god! get out of sight, marge! i don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!"
16902,Homer,"well, that was under our old price structure. under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
38999,Homer,"ha-ha! stupid eagle! it wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! marge! preheat the oven!"
27624,Homer,this can only be good.
20452,Homer,"come on, guys. we can't play without bart. he's the heart of this team!"
20261,Homer,war! hunh! good god y'all! / what is it good for? / absolutely nothin'! say it again! okay!
38322,Homer,all that's left are clever last words.
37069,Homer,"i got it, dad."
13564,Homer,"hey, chief."
20721,Homer,hmm...
34366,Homer,"seatbelts, kids!"
38488,Homer,eat your broccoli.
22395,Homer,yup. right down to the scarf.
39810,Homer,"i-it's meaningless, marge. don't even attempt to find meaning in it. there's nothing between me and princess kashmir."
29218,Homer,"hold on, maggie! daddy's coming!"
26972,Homer,"speed it up, ugly."
41254,Homer,"mental note: ""the girl knows too much."""
15603,Homer,pigabar? what the hell is pigabar?
25850,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna enjoy this."
32527,Homer,six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend i actually got home at three a.m.
23666,Homer,"man, the last nine months sure were crazy."
27239,Homer,maybe i could wuther your heights?
37656,Homer,"strong man, moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. leave my trailer forever!"
32165,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
24245,Homer,...and only then do we find out that professor gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over international perfume and wine.
24179,Homer,"well, ak, it's because god is powerful, but also insecure, like barbra streisand, before james brolin. oh, he's been a rock."
35664,Homer,i need a nap!
16069,Homer,i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart. s-m-r-t...i mean s-m-a-r-t.
35807,Homer,i'll handle it. i always do.
23920,Homer,"jimmy is such an ugly word, marge. unless you're talking about jimmy smits."
21290,Homer,"yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. you're blocking the food."
25916,Homer,woo hoo!
21056,Homer,"ooh, comfy."
28893,Homer,"all right. for you, i will give up all clear liquors."
17800,Homer,"and now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""starsky and hutches."""
29763,Homer,"sorry, marge. we've got the power now. and you can't turn us off!"
30662,Homer,i hope i never hear that god-awful nutcracker music again.
41226,Homer,uh-oh. i don't understand a word he's saying. why doesn't he just let me bat? i wish i was home with a big bag of potato chips... mmm potato chips.
37236,Homer,hey flanders. can i borrow some sugar?
15162,Homer,"all right, marge. i swear to you, the next time he does something wrong i'll punish him and make it stick."
39684,Homer,"oh, marge. the guys at work are going to have a field day with this."
31940,Homer,i can't! that fire siren could sound at any moment.
25769,Homer,yes!
13341,Homer,"bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
22729,Homer,"hey, bart, watch me run down this old lady."
24508,Homer,"hello, mister lobster."
21265,Homer,"yes, i gotta work hard, honey. daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
30095,Homer,wait for it... wait for it...
40787,Homer,hel - lo.
14373,Homer,all right!
14630,Homer,"marge, i've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
34383,Homer,"hey, it floats!"
25519,Homer,"dear god, what have i done?"
41141,Homer,"all right family, i want the truth. don't pull any punches. am i just a little bit overweight?"
16059,Homer,... it was the most i ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
21470,Homer,"well, yeah, kinda..."
14257,Homer,they get donuts?
38646,Homer,"we'll have to set a trap, bait. i mean, bart."
27562,Homer,why you little...! why you little...!
33699,Homer,"moe, this was a great thing for you. you went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. and sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. and that means someone can love you again. and that'll make you smile."
16256,Homer,your point being?

37340,Homer,the minister's wife? what are you here for?
24120,Homer,"umm... it's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary."
26390,Homer,"goodnight, honey."

20394,Homer,"freeze, bad guy!"
37840,Homer,let me handle things. just go upstairs and shut the door. there are some things only a boy should see.
19201,Homer,"aw, c'mon, i'll make a fortune for one night's work! we could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
17139,Homer,"that's because i've loaded it with sugar!!... marge, our ship has come in! i found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that i'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. and all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."
28447,Homer,you're on!
21039,Homer,you're a disgrace to this family and its proud naval tradition!
16538,Homer,you broke a promise to your child.
36161,Homer,i wet the bed! the one embarrassing thing i've never done!
17054,Homer,i told marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.

34780,Homer,"well, it was rhubarb."
22226,Homer,"hey, smooth move, flanders!"
20067,Homer,i wish our special guest tim conway didn't have to leave so soon.
36580,Homer,i guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
23550,Homer,"oh, marge, i'm sorry. i can't make it."
31209,Homer,"sleep tight, my angel!"
15276,Homer,how someone someone abuse their body that way?

15272,Homer,"thanks, that means a lot to me."
27417,Homer,"in retrospect, yes."
39758,Homer,so you'd know it's from me!
35482,Homer,"um... uh... so uh, joey, is wikipedia accurate when it says ""walk this way"" was inspired by ""young frankenstein?"""
13475,Homer,"i promised my boy one simple thing: lots of riches. and that man broke my promise. well, i've had it! bart, take a letter."
33506,Homer,"don't worry, marge."
17768,Homer,i can't get the... i can't get the door closed. somebody's going to have to get out.
22164,Homer,hey! how did churchy la femme get half price?
31431,Homer,love you!
32164,Homer,"marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. that's why i've decided to go to the plant and beg mr. burns for my old job back."
18600,Homer,welcome aboard. it wasn't any easier.
13571,Homer,pancakes... football... boobies...
24437,Homer,arizona smells funny.
28223,Homer,"hey, the bathroom's a block away."
24660,Homer,"hey, maybe we could. but we'll need some liquid persuasion."
19419,Homer,stupor pooper.
31931,Homer,zombie file grievance.
39403,Homer,that's okay. i'll just assume you said what i thought i heard you say.
23317,Homer,people will think what i tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
29276,Homer,uh-oh.
31684,Homer,why do you sound so shocked? this is our fifth take.
40590,Homer,"isn't there anything faster than a microwave? four, three, two, one, ping!"
26890,Homer,i've made my choice.
19989,Homer,that was fast.
30142,Homer,"come on flanders, doesn't that ""bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? why won't you love me?"
17371,Homer,they wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
17024,Homer,i was bluffing.
38165,Homer,"okay milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
27581,Homer,do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
17482,Homer,"son! my dear son. from now on i'm going to be a good and attentive father. and for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
39261,Homer,that's an ornament.
22058,Homer,forget what?
36094,Homer,by the box lady herself!
27394,Homer,you've been living like a king on my dollar... super unleaded gas... silver bullets?

41021,Homer,"oh, great."
38472,Homer,"oh lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. why i could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. that's why i never plan more than four seconds ahead."

20812,Homer,i have not been brainwashed. kill the girl. kill the girl.
15314,Homer,so remember...

14567,Homer,"please, please, please, i want to make the team. clemens, did i make the team?"
17863,Homer,"all right, let's not panic. i'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. i can get by with one."
36900,Homer,oh my god. i forgot to feed my jackass!

37983,Homer,"glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant i can afford."
20846,Homer,ever heard of a little thing called the internet?
21689,Homer,why is this taking so long? bart was born in about five minutes.
35448,Homer,xbox.
13733,Homer,"aha! cigarettes, just as i thought."
18435,Homer,"i'm gonna have to shut it down myself. fat, don't fail me now."
39108,Homer,what albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. he knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
28608,Homer,pretended.
16479,Homer,mmmm... foot long chili dog.
20476,Homer,i understand. yoink. wow...
26877,Homer,"you know chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
27048,Homer,"running after the car, huh? let's see if you can follow this."
35630,Homer,"can't, marge. i'm fighting for my professional life here."
29655,Homer,woo hoo! that's been my dream ever since i heard it existed right now. what do i get?
25934,Homer,"it's only the milkman. hey, maybe i should be a milkman."
39596,Homer,"oh, noooo!"
18067,Homer,they're butchering the classics. could that bassoon have come in any more late?
29192,Homer,"""all my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. i may be her father, but when i grow up, i wanna be just like her. except still a dude."""

25442,Homer,"so? i can stop. and i will stop. i'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
37967,Homer,why you slimy little...!?
33042,Homer,bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. what's his angle?
30196,Homer,"how can we afford any of these private schools? they're all so expensive. if we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get grampa that new pacemaker?"
20212,Homer,ohhh. so hottt.
33018,Homer,"i can't believe flanders dumped me. marge, do we have any more of your extra-long twinkies?"
39578,Homer,"oh. me, too."

38905,Homer,"captain's log, star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. after successfully conquering the rigelians..."
14802,Homer,"oh lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
41191,Homer,"marge, you don't understand. i can't do it because... you're trapped. if you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! all right! i'll take her. lousy brain."
26509,Homer,"if i'm laughing at what i think i am, it's very funny. anyway... ""as night fell, the greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
28787,Homer,"ooh, well, i am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. and the wager only sweetens the deal."
31396,Homer,"and we went to the ""vermont teddy bear"" factory. look what we got! hm? hm?"
18632,Homer,and for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
38539,Homer,none.

19070,Homer,"come on, you stupid fish! take the bait! don't make me come down there!"
33045,Homer,"eh, he won't get far. not on the crappy breakfast i made for him."
15793,Homer,you talk better than you fool.
15224,Homer,are you kidding? i work like a japanese beaver.
29875,Homer,"ray, will you help me fix my roof?"
29979,Homer,"eine fliegerstaffel hinterher / alarm zu geben, wenn es so war / dabei war da am horizont / nur neunundneunzig luftballons"
18042,Homer,"i'm with you, marge. lisa, get in here! in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."
30571,Homer,we throw those out anyway.
28819,Homer,don't tell my kids i'm going to jail! tell them i've joined the blue man group! i'm the fat one!
17184,Homer,i was doing my best to resist her...
26490,Homer,huh?
19919,Homer,"geez, that dog has more education than i do. he's some kinda super dog. hey, where'd he go?"
41526,Homer,you know these ikea foam futons do velcro together.

22183,Homer,let's do it.
23771,Homer,get her! she's doing something!
24604,Homer,what really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
38067,Homer,don't interrupt! i just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
36017,Homer,which one do you want?
40255,Homer,rub it in.
22955,Homer,"gee, i feel bad. if people knew the real monty burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
18870,Homer,i won't tell anybody.
13580,Homer,"thanks a lot, michael. you really helped me get through this. if you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
38212,Homer,"lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."
35047,Homer,time to punch in.
36687,Homer,i was alive when my dad knew you?
25691,Homer,"oh, why not? everybody's doin' it."
28876,Homer,"well, what i did was..."
13708,Homer,flanders is in debt? are you sure?
27466,Homer,'mornin' kids! i made your lunches. they're on the table.
31736,Homer,how could my dad go out with selma? don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?
40962,Homer,herbert. herbert powell. great! where can i find him?
15646,Homer,liar!
17908,Homer,"i was ashamed, marge. i failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, i was a b-plus dog. i'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
29663,Homer,"that's it, mister. i am disgruntled. and up until now, i was relatively gruntled!"
29937,Homer,that's a given! there's something else. something much more else.
29400,Homer,"well, i'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
21700,Homer,"this is legal, right?"
28662,Homer,"hospital, eh? wow, everyone's goin' there tonight."
16519,Homer,"you've gotta improvise, lisa. cloves, tom collins mix, frozen pie crust."
33151,Homer,yeah. i missed her like five times.
16758,Homer,it's beautiful. it's the most awe inspiring sight i have ever seen.
17111,Homer,"it's cool in here, boy. for the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator."
34374,Homer,"you're halfway home, lady."
39993,Homer,"ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
34054,Homer,but i have to get back to marge.
32649,Homer,like which kid's their favorite! it's lisa.
23139,Homer,shuut-uup...
38775,Homer,i'll never have a per diem.
38948,Homer,ew! gross!
27628,Homer,"lisa? is this what i've come to? fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? mister, i'll take that car."
15333,Homer,"oh, what am i gonna do?"
31520,Homer,has the boom been lowered?
14912,Homer,"you see, marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
29410,Homer,"wow, a wooden plane. it's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks."
15035,Homer,"ho-mer, ho-mer, ho-mer.."
35480,Homer,shut up.
21427,Homer,"but marge, the gilded truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
27676,Homer,stained with the blood of american patriots.
23853,Homer,"... yeah, so because of me, all the dorms now have security phones."
27108,Homer,i'm so despondent.
35038,Homer,right... neither am i.
16343,Homer,"well, here we are at the brad goodman lecture."
25030,Homer,"'course he did, son. he's a filthy crook. now, let's all hit the hay."
32020,Homer,move it!
41298,Homer,"okay, homer. this is the moment of truth. you've gotta tell marge you really don't want another kid."
23960,Homer,you too.
18041,Homer,i know. and this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. it just keeps going faster and faster.
13789,Homer,all right.
20644,Homer,"lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. what the hell's goin' on?!"
18989,Homer,alright. yeah.
16254,Homer,mmmm... convenient.
39181,Homer,"marge? some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else."
21313,Homer,"ranier wolfcastle! oh, i love your movies and your power sauce bars and your taut, rippling--"
31379,Homer,this vibrating massage chair feels great!
34799,Homer,ever wonder what she thinks about?
18114,Homer,"herman, your beef is with me. leave the girl out of this."
30730,Homer,"boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
19390,Homer,beer! gimme some beer!
36631,Homer,"well, i expected a little argument."
28567,Homer,"here comes my commercial. in six, five, four..."
31862,Homer,"sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
23187,Homer,"i don't get it, mel. how can you be so calm and cool? my stomach's full of vomiting butterflies."
25257,Homer,what on earth are you doing?
24596,Homer,"what am i, a tailor?"
29303,Homer,open.
17470,Homer,ow!
40684,Homer,"i pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when i say ""give me a ticket"", just give me a ticket."
28872,Homer,"but you do believe it, right?"
33864,Homer,"thank you, friendo."
35919,Homer,"great question. i know you children have never seen your father cry before... marge, do we have any more gravy?"
19627,Homer,you can supervise me.
23786,Homer,quit it! must wash eyes! j--
14408,Homer,it's a date! so... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread?
28670,Homer,here in my car / i am hosing off blood / some of it's mine / but most of it's not / here's marge...
19837,Homer,"did you see that, marge?"
18995,Homer,uh-oh.
26170,Homer,a grizzly bear with a chainsaw. now there's a killing machine!
33919,Homer,"me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? then i get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then i see the driver is a chicken?"
36938,Homer,what flavor?
28192,Homer,let the baby have her bottle.
32347,Homer,have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
25926,Homer,you're right. it's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
19076,Homer,oh no. aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... oh my god! lyndon larouche was right!
14221,Homer,they'll call him screwy louie.
21222,Homer,"you'll never silence me! i'm the last angry man, patterson! a crusader for the little guy!"
27132,Homer,"oh, yeah... when you've been in as many as i have, you can sense them coming."
17748,Homer,...and then i sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
19943,Homer,"oh, yes! gather 'round, my son, and i shall tell you a tale..."
20694,Homer,"see? all this singing scared him away / if we just talked like normal, he'd probably stay."
39300,Homer,"find any winners, son?"
39951,Homer,don't be ridiculous. my wife worships the ground i walk on.
17319,Homer,"it was, marge. admit it."
31475,Homer,"and i hate the cutesy way you make jack-o-lanterns! i like scary halloween, not funny halloween!"
32632,Homer,i live in that place!
23912,Homer,and the bed never needs to be made. check it out.
23681,Homer,"she's no liza, but it works."
16769,Homer,"yeah, maybe i do have the right... what's that stuff? anyway, thanks, marge, lisa."
22867,Homer,he must be a hundred feet tall.
33700,Homer,"well, i'm glad they suspended milhouse. he's a bad influence on you."
39503,Homer,arrrgh!

20569,Homer,"okay, okay, don't panic. marge, stop panicking. we need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. bart! strip down to your skeleton!"
26839,Homer,"well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
14090,Homer,"you just lost yourself a customer, moe!"
40136,Homer,"ooh, a vortex."
28184,Homer,y'ello?
27539,Homer,i guess i learned something here. god is capable of great anger and great mercy. but mostly great anger.
17752,Homer,there's that word again.
18644,Homer,"oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to bush."
35524,Homer,but what if the weathergirl--
25625,Homer,give me back my thumb!
20116,Homer,"hey! i'm not a bum... thanks, but i don't need... okay, if you insist, but... spare change, lady? lousy cheapskate..."

20652,Homer,"lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!"
34840,Homer,she does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
33352,Homer,guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
27305,Homer,"now bob, i know you're concerned, but don't worry. i have operatives working the crowd."
28150,Homer,"uh, no, that was me."
14770,Homer,i hear ya. come on boy.
29071,Homer,"please forgive me, talking llama."
38432,Homer,"i'm sorry she rejected your ""i'm sorry,"" cake, but in a way, i'm not. i guess what i'm trying to say is i like cake."
32340,Homer,you don't owe him anything. moe was in the hospital for three weeks and i didn't visit him once.
30227,Homer,"welcome to the jungle, kevin!"
19869,Homer,huh?
27931,Homer,no! i wanted to die choking on food!
28332,Homer,"okay, i'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool."

14017,Homer,"i like our chances, son."
14471,Homer,hello... i'd like the department of missing babies.
18590,Homer,but... but...
34792,Homer,"we had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
33521,Homer,"oh, flanders, i promise i'll never abuse our friendship again."
34079,Homer,a female that gives birth to alcohol.

28441,Homer,bart! you're not hitting hard enough!
26696,Homer,"while i wait for my family, i'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss."
15107,Homer,but the car is okay?
15223,Homer,i'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... tibor... i never thought it'd be my own wife.
37758,Homer,"good game, everyone. i never dreamed a night where you'd discovered i was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note."
31867,Homer,"oh, that's long gone, baby. long gone."
17253,Homer,"hmm. i don't agree with his bart-killing policy, but i do approve of his selma-killing policy."
29759,Homer,it's a deal! woo hoo!
14403,Homer,"don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
25123,Homer,"and they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
15445,Homer,not funny.
25608,Homer,"here, little fella."
14308,Homer,mmmmm. chocolate.
38440,Homer,"marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. the fourth of july is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into america's car window. god bless her."
32697,Homer,"hello, you've reached the snug bug. what do you mean my car's ready?! well you can keep it, 'cause i'm never giving up this one. now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love."
34979,Homer,well... back in my keister you go.
18935,Homer,and i'm not registered!
20672,Homer,there's only one way out. we've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
33153,Homer,and i suppose you and maude will be coming along as well?
21460,Homer,"at your service, milady."
17872,Homer,"uh, could i just get a look at that?"
39729,Homer,"lay off the boy, marge. he's a good kid. quit givin' him the third degree."
28854,Homer,yep. your mother and i have become a legendary party couple. like scott and zelda munster!
31276,Homer,thank you honey!
35060,Homer,"bart, son, if i bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it."
14069,Homer,"well, it's called a ""flaming..."
30274,Homer,"of course i have call waiting, you idiot! i just never learned how to use it!"
25326,Homer,don't listen. it's a trick!
32190,Homer,your hair streaked with sun-light /
15463,Homer,"i made an ""h""."
32736,Homer,"hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
13870,Homer,"i'll have you know, i wrote it down."
33626,Homer,how'd you check?!
37137,Homer,knock yourself out.
34929,Homer,we're gonna go out for breakfast / we'll go out to eat / it'll be any place you choose / as long as it's run by jews / 'cause they don't think this holiday's so great.
14994,Homer,"don't worry, sweetheart. if i'm wrong, i'll recant on my deathbed."
33711,Homer,"i know, i know."
23228,Homer,"he's gone from goofus to gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills."
39317,Homer,"wait a minute, you little cheater. you're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
16228,Homer,"take that, vile fiend!"
15943,Homer,"now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. you can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out."
22797,Homer,can you?
14819,Homer,herb?
31781,Homer,"okay boy, do something annoying. but leave yourself room to build."
24960,Homer,sixty cents?! i would've made more if i'd gone into work today!
38395,Homer,teach him not to pee during parades. he'll get more work.
29517,Homer,stupid internet... whole world laughing at me...
32677,Homer,even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. why can't this be the tunnel of hockey fights?
18402,Homer,"""decalcify calcium ducts?"" well, gimme a y. gimme a--"
22299,Homer,i have a problem.
27938,Homer,uh-oh! we forgot to empty the mini-bar!
15812,Homer,"this is a trap. it's going to catch us our dinner. come on, boy."
14401,Homer,"believe me, marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
22585,Homer,is there anything that guy doesn't know?
36202,Homer,mom?!
36602,Homer,just appreciating how lucky i am to be with you.
14575,Homer,yes.

33647,Homer,"what's fun about fire ants? they're-- oh, you're being sarcastic."
31000,Homer,"uh, gimme a second, i'm in the bathroom."
31680,Homer,"stop it, winston!"
34612,Homer,you can help me take out those cameras.
32656,Homer,but marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.
23181,Homer,"great idea, mel. now it's my turn."
31679,Homer,i will! i will be rich! i'll own a football team and a basketball team and i'll make them play baseball!
30000,Homer,"i don't miss meat at all. this portobello mushroom eats like a steak. a rubbery, fungus-like steak."
14885,Homer,"i don't see your name on it, boy."
38144,Homer,"now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. nudity. 2. holograms. 3. something terrible happening to jesus."
26355,Homer,uh huh.
37636,Homer,"ooh, mix-ins!"

15143,Homer,just promise me you'll try to be good.
33063,Homer,"well marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
17349,Homer,"wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. to think of all the time i wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... i love you."
28458,Homer,"please welcome my newest panelist, disco stu."
38315,Homer,"oh, right. i mean, this looks like a dress from a local springfield store. all is forgiven. let's have dinner."

38660,Homer,but we bowled together.
40238,Homer,"well, okay. it all started on ""nuclear plant employees, spouses, and no more than three children night,"" down at springfield stadium."
29083,Homer,"it was years ago, when i was ten. back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
21914,Homer,marge. not in front of the hippies.
40564,Homer,"mr. burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
22428,Homer,"and it doesn't stop in the bedroom. oh no, i'm taking charge. kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the max power way."

30053,Homer,"kids, wanna go to the mall?! they're baking fresh cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
35596,Homer,"okay, stupid flanders, first i want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave homer simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
19368,Homer,"oh, lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting springfield."
31248,Homer,mmm... extra-virgin...
13612,Homer,"marge, you have a nice body. and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
35324,Homer,let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
39262,Homer,"ah, son, you don't need all that junk. i'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. hey, i couldn't afford lunch. gimme a bite of that donut."
30545,Homer,"today marks a new dawn for springfield. this salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" and those eggs are ready to hatch!"
22568,Homer,i don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
27480,Homer,mmm... farfetched.
29550,Homer,"flanders. eh, i guess you've got some late night problems too."
38419,Homer,"because... oh. oh, okay, okay. what should we do?"
13853,Homer,i didn't wake up. it's all a dream. it's just a dream!

21201,Homer,"siddown, honey. the men will clear the table!"
26962,Homer,"oh, i'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now i have to sleep them off."
40989,Homer,"herb, allow me to introduce my family. this is my wife, marge..."
28766,Homer,"your mother's right, honey. katie couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
24035,Homer,"son, go get me a trash bag."
33971,Homer,i couldn't help it! she knew my one weakness -- that i'm weak!
22748,Homer,"this is red barclay's shipment. on time, as always."
17242,Homer,"die, bad robots, die! with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero."
19961,Homer,"in that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. lousy god."
31382,Homer,"seriously moe, i think you have a gift."
32904,Homer,i just wish she hadn't died thinking i hated her.
16624,Homer,we'll dig our way out!
36736,Homer,huh? what?
39686,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
22758,Homer,looks like god made you out of my sexiest rib.
17554,Homer,"tell me the truth! don't tell her i raised my voice. don't. happy family, happy family."
35933,Homer,only one hundred percent?

21639,Homer,awdammit!
13549,Homer,the boy! this isn't fair! how can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
36494,Homer,wow. wow. this is like the night hillary won the new hampshire primary.
18826,Homer,all right... wait a minute. for what?
34408,Homer,"i'm sorry. it's just that these tours are so exhausting. you're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
26638,Homer,now you know what i've been goin' through.
29632,Homer,"yeah, ""bride of the monster."""
25172,Homer,"man, that was a good apron expo."
31691,Homer,"uh, this is eduardo, my pool boy. he thinks he's an angry rich man."
22700,Homer,aren't you gonna say bye?
29779,Homer,"bring back our children, you cyprus-splitting jerks!"
21956,Homer,i'm way ahead of you.
24644,Homer,"those rich, snobby indians."
19618,Homer,"you know, mr. burns, you're the richest guy i know. way richer than lenny."
35072,Homer,that's great.
36972,Homer,don't worry. i am very good at keeping secrets.
37655,Homer,"trying to kill moe so we'll get his emerald. by the way, i haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
18779,Homer,i know. i'm taping it. i want to get to mr. burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
19763,Homer,"no i'm not, marge! they're embarrassing me! they're embarrassing america! they turned the navy into a floating joke! they ruined all our best names, like bruce and lance and julian! those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
32878,Homer,that's where the food sleeps!
34706,Homer,lucky.
18280,Homer,"oh, lisa, i was looking for you. i wanted to apologize. i don't know exactly what went wrong, but i know it's always my fault."

34506,Homer,"clancy, i haven't seen my family in days. would you mind if i went home now?"
16077,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
40205,Homer,"you know, i was just telling the wife that if i was governor, i'd do things a lot differently."
34916,Homer,i'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
36851,Homer,"no, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. that's terence's parenting style--"
25629,Homer,but i have finger insurance!
28510,Homer,that's not true. i cared what you thought once you found out.
38992,Homer,it's good to be back.
30647,Homer,"i am the gayest super-villain ever! beware my scented candles! oooooo, scented!"
38952,Homer,ask for boogers on bart's half!
18885,Homer,there. done and done.

30331,Homer,"i, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
20984,Homer,"oh well, thanks, honey. remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a simpson and a success."
24090,Homer,ned does everything with class. whether he's punching in his atm code...or keeping clean in the shower...
16561,Homer,"lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
13345,Homer,"i've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but i've never had the nerve."
14435,Homer,i love you very much.
34417,Homer,ned's run off into the desert!
22165,Homer,senior citizen? flanders?
37582,Homer,you're so beautiful when i cut you off in the middle of a question.
21284,Homer,"yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
20641,Homer,"okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
29846,Homer,"hey marge, why are you with krusty? these kids are too old for clowns."
18313,Homer,hello? can anybody hear me?
14754,Homer,"gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, i'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
31243,Homer,"oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
41055,Homer,"y'ello, hi, lisa, what's wrong? the mumps? oooh, the kissing disease! my little girl is growing up."
33842,Homer,s'open!
17244,Homer,that's better.
15132,Homer,bus-ted!
38339,Homer,"son, can you put me in 3-d for a second?"
33996,Homer,then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
24139,Homer,south pacific?! i didn't agree to...
31394,Homer,i love these covered bridges. it's like driving through cute little houses.
19326,Homer,"ooh, that's tough, pal. but it's never going to happen to me."
37363,Homer,the brain is so stupid.
40635,Homer,so you're going to die... 
35738,Homer,the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
32696,Homer,uh-huh.
30978,Homer,oh baby...
29318,Homer,"marge! i figured out a way we can get in on this quimby lawsuit! bart, go ahead."
13501,Homer,"uh, uh i-i guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
25682,Homer,"relax. it's a ""controlled burn""... uh-oh."
36974,Homer,"honey, everything's fine. there's nothing to worry about."
41556,Homer,"well if you feel that way, maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to europe during the summer."
23272,Homer,what's wrong with it?
24909,Homer,but i don't know anything. at least i don't think i do.
20749,Homer,"cooder, spud. get off that hog. you're coming to stay at our house."
34011,Homer,woo hoo! an unattended tap! like takin' beer from a baby!
17956,Homer,"okay! wait a minute. that's bad! look, i know i'm not witty like that critic guy. but does he know all the words to the oscar mayer song?"
20870,Homer,now that's a fight i wanna be a part of.
27948,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll build you a new treehouse. one so grand it'll be an affront to god himself."
26925,Homer,"oh, well... heh, heh. hm... oh, i'll... no...."
14761,Homer,"whenever marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, i take a walk. i go to a bar, i down a few, and i stumble home in the mood for love."
26361,Homer,"gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... swings in the old battin' cage."
29639,Homer,"if anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
14021,Homer,"okay bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. so, i'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
31644,Homer,avenge me. in flamboyant impractical fashion.
40307,Homer,who'd've thought it? a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game. every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand.
26394,Homer,but knowing about it would make you want to go here.
37086,Homer,maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
33146,Homer,"well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside boggle?"
29277,Homer,blood for creme! blood for creme!
38902,Homer,what's that?
34434,Homer,messiah says !
33181,Homer,"exactly. you're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?"
21329,Homer,"yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
15354,Homer,"mr. plow, that's my name. that name again is mr. plow. our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
27026,Homer,lisa!
34990,Homer,my neck is kind of itchy.
31337,Homer,"man, you've got an awesome voice."
30055,Homer,"oh, big surprise. the fat guy's eating garbage."
20953,Homer,woo hoo!
23639,Homer,"well, all i care about is that my little girl loves me. and we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
18810,Homer,"i'm transferring a call into you, mr. burns."
28697,Homer,what are you doing here?
35317,Homer,"not bad, not bad. marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?"
19587,Homer,"hey, fat tony! you still with the mafia?"
33232,Homer,"marge, i installed all the low energy bulbs!"
34118,Homer,do you guys know funky town?
23461,Homer,i bought these shoes from a hobo.
31836,Homer,i'm open! i'm open!
29232,Homer,"boy, when god closes a door, he opens a window."
21283,Homer,"yeah, it's somethin', all right."
13639,Homer,"bart, are you ready to go to... i'll room service you..."
26428,Homer,"oh, he just wants to make friends."
19181,Homer,you used to be a boxer just like me?
26112,Homer,"oh, that's better..."
17730,Homer,"this was the happiest time of my life. i'll never forget you guys. especially you, joey."
33134,Homer,marge?!
36393,Homer,"hey marge, here's something that'll make you happy!"
37848,Homer,"someday soon. as in, what are you doing this friday?"
33227,Homer,"dear lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. sorry, he told me i needed a hundred and forty-four letters. what was my point again? oh right. bouvier or simpson, i cherish you."
25759,Homer,"hang on, everybody. three, two, one... blast off!"
36288,Homer,i'm doomed!
34410,Homer,"but he is buried here, right?"
17020,Homer,"hey, barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side."
27596,Homer,"finally, someone explains it to me in words i can understand. look, boy. i know i did wrong and i am truly sorry."
18100,Homer,"c'mon, we're family."
34939,Homer,sh!
33870,Homer,be cool or you're grounded!
24798,Homer,"well, why do i have to do the lindy hop?"

32732,Homer,"c'mon, boy. all the nerds are doin' it."
33528,Homer,i finally feel like part of a family!
23745,Homer,"you and me, chopper to chopper."
30644,Homer,opera? they have that here too?
32671,Homer,"ah, the tunnel of love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy."
18265,Homer,it's just a little slimy! it's still good! it's still good!
26391,Homer,no. the olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
32574,Homer,see? that's where my memory stops. who the heck is that guy?
26263,Homer,it was dinner.

19401,Homer,"what about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
26850,Homer,"...so i threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
15629,Homer,i'll take him! do you have him in blonde?

32740,Homer,"son, while your mother and little mother are out, i'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
34756,Homer,...then pete rose plowed into his friend ray fosse...
34865,Homer,"don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
25862,Homer,and a blue oyster cult medallion.

35701,Homer,"i guess i'll get started before my family gets here. how much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
40486,Homer,"'cause if you don't, i'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
26710,Homer,"always drawing your old man, huh? you must think i'm the greatest dad in the world."
36955,Homer,"sh, sh. shhhhh. soon you'll know peace."
16900,Homer,"marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money."
20535,Homer,"come on, elephant. put me down! hey, everyone seems upside down."
35271,Homer,"well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!"
22622,Homer,wha?! i heard a yell. did you touch a wire?
17412,Homer,under the sea / under the sea / there'll be no accusations / just friendly crustaceans / under the sea.
17760,Homer,"of course i'm right. if i'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
29058,Homer,do i get two paychecks?
19979,Homer,"i'd like the phone book for hokkaido, japan, please."
19399,Homer,because humans are obnoxious sometimes. humans hate things.
36334,Homer,and where will i watch tv?
31863,Homer,but to get that dvd i had to become a pbs subscriber! now i'm paying for crap like american masters!

17404,Homer,y'ello?
39180,Homer,"you got yourself one hell of a show, marge. one hell of a show."
20441,Homer,"not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, flanders?"
35136,Homer,he didn't know that!
33438,Homer,"i'm not in good hands! i'm in no hands! like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
14509,Homer,"look, we're past that. marge, maybe i do curse a little, but that's the way god made me. and i'm too old to stop now."
38612,Homer,magical nonsense.
22993,Homer,"hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. i'm gonna read it just as soon as i finish what i'm doing here."
28839,Homer,and it's a perfect time... i just got fired again.
29249,Homer,fine.
26042,Homer,"i'm sorry i shot you, moe."
18356,Homer,"no. it would only worry her. if you want to add to her worries, go ahead. i guess i'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
35295,Homer,why you little...?!
22857,Homer,"and finally, my thing de resistance, ""attempted birdhouse i."""
31343,Homer,are we that stupid?
38221,Homer,"what do you think, sweetie?"
19383,Homer,"hope you like it, neighbor. we didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
29949,Homer,turn the television to what channel?
14151,Homer,"fit, damn you! fit!"
21109,Homer,"not spy, squeal. i've got no choice."
27940,Homer,"quick, find the master log! there's always a master log."
19759,Homer,you! i should have known!
32407,Homer,"hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of ocean spray? oh boy -- forget that. how about some... cap'n crunch? uh, seven seas italian dressing? no, no! uh, chicken of the sea tuna? billy ocean cd? the history of atlantic records?"
16982,Homer,what does deadlocked mean?
32852,Homer,"maybe i can finally meet jim jarmusch and ask him who he is. hey, that's him!"
16619,Homer,no kidding.
39726,Homer,just a statue? is the statue of liberty just a statue? is the leaning tower of piza just a statue?
22138,Homer,"okay, mr. burns, fat tony, what's-his-name... fat tony?!"
25602,Homer,"now he's just a stinking flight attendant! hey, where's my pillow?"
36203,Homer,just like my hair.
23931,Homer,and i looked so good on that box.
21969,Homer,"take that, pinchy."
33397,Homer,"debbie, i forgot i have an english paper due on monday. would you read ""to kill a mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how boo radley fits into the southern gothic tradition, that would be great."
13161,Homer,uhhhh... ummmm...
13756,Homer,"uh-huh. it's as fat as a phone book! ""congratulations on your purchase of a fissionator 1952 slow fission reactor. get to the point, man! ooh, what's this?"
30891,Homer,you take forever to say nothing.
15929,Homer,"we're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course."
18178,Homer,"oh, never you mind..."
28343,Homer,"boy, she's good. if she were a hundred years younger... and i were a hundred years older..."
38373,Homer,anything else?
14609,Homer,"well why didn't you tell the rest of us? why did you keep it a secret??? if you were seventeen, we'd be rich! but no! you had to be ""10."""
26017,Homer,beautiful.
14589,Homer,maaarge... the dog doesn't count as a kid.
41339,Homer,"no cops in sight. if i'm gonna save that clerk, i'm gonna have to take the law into my own hands again."
26025,Homer,i told them it was a benefit. they think they're saving the rainforest.
23803,Homer,"i guess, or one of her friends."
13962,Homer,apu. you can take this job and re-staff it!
15739,Homer,i think i've lost weight.
29426,Homer,"oh man, i need something to settle my stomach."
15187,Homer,i wish i could retire.
30861,Homer,"you're right, lenny. i..."
41064,Homer,bart!
19089,Homer,"america, take a good look at your beloved candidates! they're nothing but hideous space reptiles!"

25936,Homer,"she lives in a houseboat? wow, she is so cool."
36023,Homer,"hm, the french have gotten into the wine game. good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
33262,Homer,the power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
22736,Homer,"thank you sir, may i have another?"
33695,Homer,"oh maggie, i love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. god bless your mother for making you with me."
36103,Homer,"the only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. now in three... two... one..."
40954,Homer,bart!
28874,Homer,she's not coming anymore.

17452,Homer,"no, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. i imagine i'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
28496,Homer,i'm upside down so much!
13488,Homer,"bart, have you seen the letter?"
22799,Homer,"look pop, i'm planning some expert home repairs, and i need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
21556,Homer,half my life gone! and i'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
23543,Homer,"heh, heh. i'd hate to see the look on ol' burnsie's face if he knew i was just gettin' in. hee hee."
35209,Homer,dave?
39168,Homer,see what i mean? always an argument.
20164,Homer,"hey, everybody, look! armin tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
18243,Homer,hey flanders!
37620,Homer,"when i release it into the a. c. system, it'll stink up the plant forever."
29342,Homer,"okay, you go save lisa. i'll stay here with the women."
37461,Homer,i don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
27005,Homer,"oh, how to explain this to a child... hm... future daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- get 'im!"
35465,Homer,"okay, time to go back in the... night-night... this is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... i thought we had a deal, man!"
13560,Homer,bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--

37540,Homer,"oh, uh, i'd better take this. y'see, moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
36040,Homer,"it's fun, but not as fun."
33480,Homer,he saved our ass!
27703,Homer,dr. hibbert? you're the teacher?
25313,Homer,who pays for that wedding?
21194,Homer,"you guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! yeah, i'm talkin' to you! you trash-eatin' stink bags!"
15594,Homer,come to homercles.
38752,Homer,"buddy, buddy. think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night. you just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
22308,Homer,let's see. ten percent off carpet cleaning. ten! two pizzas for the price of one at doughy's.
35171,Homer,"hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
40479,Homer,"he's got us, marge. there's nothing we can do. he's as good as dead."
27874,Homer,"maybe it is. i used to look at marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see rip taylor. but now, i don't know what's gonna happen. c'mon, let's dance."
32766,Homer,and a very wise fish he is!
40794,Homer,allouette jaunte allouette / allouette jaunte...
29431,Homer,no cameras?
30173,Homer,"um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, i want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all..."
16490,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
15476,Homer,uh... some dog could do the operation.
27158,Homer,the status quo.
17385,Homer,"see, she's having the time of her life."
21508,Homer,"used grease is worth money? then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. i'm rich, apu! rich, i--!"
16683,Homer,everything really wrapped up nicely. much quicker than usual.
26163,Homer,i think this tree could use an angel.
22163,Homer,"ten dollars?! what is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
39683,Homer,can i have some apple sauce?
36470,Homer,"you really put on a great reception, marge. it's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller."
14551,Homer,"yeah, just watch."
21583,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, lenny. but here's one that's even more spellbinding. once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison. and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph..."
41428,Homer,i'm here to take my life back!
37482,Homer,"give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
29659,Homer,"sorry, boy. this is the only place that's two hundred feet from lisa but still on our property."
23807,Homer,"c'mon, eat, you lazy fish."
21652,Homer,no! we both lived in another man's shadow. this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache.
38494,Homer,you did that on purpose! you lick this table clean!
30908,Homer,i thought it was about her boobs.
30746,Homer,"leave your ass, homer. leave your ass."
20073,Homer,"if, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
39534,Homer,"and if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. that little doozy's been a simpson trademark for generations."
19319,Homer,that doesn't sound like something i'd say.
25192,Homer,my back!
16997,Homer,"great, marge. i wanna hear all about it."
15088,Homer,didn't even pull the string that time.
13873,Homer,i dunno.
19013,Homer,"anyway, get ready, beer belly! we're gonna show springfield what we're made of!"
21210,Homer,apologize for that remark.
29372,Homer,it's el flanderito! run him down!
16446,Homer,"yeah, good."
18259,Homer,"i've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection."
28900,Homer,dressing room? uh oh.
19744,Homer,right...
40057,Homer,"good morning, springfield! good morning, mr. and mrs. winfield!"
17026,Homer,"so, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. as usual, i'm winning and not realizing it. and lenny says that i'm uh... get this... ""a little slow."""
26995,Homer,noooo!

37115,Homer,i do call this living! living the way kids in india can only dream of!
37679,Homer,what the?
19117,Homer,all right.
20309,Homer,"oh, i'll kill myself if portugal doesn't win."
20946,Homer,hmm... this could be useful...
38375,Homer,let them ruck the night away!
23953,Homer,what have you done with my party guests?
25328,Homer,"well, look who's here. you two are goin' down."
32305,Homer,and all the transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. the end.
29762,Homer,that's a lot of places.
18974,Homer,you make me feel like dancing...
31348,Homer,"oh my god, i just remembered. it's chinese new year!"
19276,Homer,i don't care if he was filling in for mel zetz! he's my son and i don't want him --
35950,Homer,"it was all a dream! oh marge, oscar madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!"
17827,Homer,i'll never be able to do this trick... never.
39272,Homer,"come on, son. let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- thirteen bucks? hey, wait a minute!"
19870,Homer,"it is silly, marge. and look at all the money i'm making!"
32829,Homer,"ooh, laughter house! with the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy."
20090,Homer,"so you lost my car, eh? well, that's just grand. i ought to punch you in the nose, but i have to pick up my kids at school."
17057,Homer,oh yeah. she's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
26741,Homer,homer mad! homer smash! get revenge on world!
15453,Homer,"okay, okay. we need forty-thousand dollars. now, how much do we have in the checkbook?"
40692,Homer,"hey, burns! eat my shorts!"
25989,Homer,teenage vandals smashing the bar! moe's gonna kill me.
20562,Homer,that's a typo.
17504,Homer,thank you!
18264,Homer,it's just a little dirty -- it's still good! it's still good!
22277,Homer,"oh, it's a great team, kent... never gave up hope... i want to thank jesus... and say hi to my special lady marge... we did it, baby! wooooo! woooooo!"
21038,Homer,"get back here, boy!"
25050,Homer,i missed one of jerry's zingers. now i'll never catch up.
37778,Homer,my other baby mama!
27630,Homer,damn right honey. you're number one on my menu. now super-size it!
21010,Homer,there's a question that's crossed out.
18430,Homer,pressure too high?
18217,Homer,"hey, marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
20388,Homer,sorry.
17435,Homer,"oh, that man is sick!"
16512,Homer,no!
36551,Homer,why should--
40791,Homer,femme.
19585,Homer,"thanks, moe."
29878,Homer,next song. / that's what i meant. / absolutely.
33447,Homer,"i mean, nooo!"
40056,Homer,"uh, i'd like to charge that dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?"
13804,Homer,"hey, if you don't like it, go to russia."
22497,Homer,sweet mint julep... i'll be at moe's.
31296,Homer,beer-battered germans...
13484,Homer,"oh, marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. y'know, i finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
39279,Homer,what?
14731,Homer,"oh, that's hot. there isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. well, g'bye."
26200,Homer,"no! i will never... oh wait, it's blatz."
16219,Homer,it was the boy!
38983,Homer,- parked! i hate stack parking! wait! where am i? this isn't the circus! it's an amusement park! the furthest thing from a circus!
26212,Homer,"of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst."
24232,Homer,"hey, moe. beer me!"
15897,Homer,"maybe so, lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
25261,Homer,that seems about right.
35228,Homer,what the?!
35883,Homer,airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
35498,Homer,"time the cameras just right,"
30422,Homer,"wow. a robot kid would be a blast. we can confuse him and make his head explode. ""this statement is a lie. but if it's a lie then it must be true. but if it's true, then it must be..."" kaboom!"
15752,Homer,i hope they kill that iron yuppie. thinks he's so big.
29173,Homer,he tosses a paper and yells out the window.
17603,Homer,"hey, have you ever noticed that the ""crossing the desert"" is a lot like ""the unblinking eye"" and it's exactly like ""the wreck of the hesperus""?"
14045,Homer,"wow, infotainment."
39241,Homer,"thanks, moe."
39368,Homer,you're right! i gotta get where the action is!
34355,Homer,bart!
36756,Homer,here it comes...
17932,Homer,"i didn't do it for them. i did it for you, marge. i'd kill for you. please ask me to kill for you."
17864,Homer,how am i going to tell marge we're broke? i need a miracle.
16682,Homer,that kwik-e-mart's a real... .
17740,Homer,"it's wonderful! it's magical! oh boy, here it comes - another mouth."
23988,Homer,"look, lisa. it glows. oooo."
33525,Homer,"no, i'm gonna see it first!"
35838,Homer,now i hate him too.
35560,Homer,so much violence on the surface world. i'm going back.
19082,Homer,you heard me -- they're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
17737,Homer,"hi honey, how are you?"
14687,Homer,bye lurleen.
16161,Homer,"two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun..."
31795,Homer,"see marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
29584,Homer,y'ello?
39497,Homer,unortho what?
15004,Homer,leave me alone!
22023,Homer,"""apes-a-poppin'!"" oooh, the airline version!"
34976,Homer,can i have any of the steaks?
21384,Homer,lisa?! lisa?! li-sa?!
34881,Homer,you can race pigeons?
33983,Homer,marge simpson reporting for duty!
39782,Homer,how can i eat it? she made it. it's all i have left.
28784,Homer,the wild dingleberries?
18352,Homer,"hey, wait... ""hyper-obesity."" ""if you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
33906,Homer,"eh, they can go to hell. bart?"
29605,Homer,"let's see, ""name"" ""homer simpson""."
20095,Homer,"new york is a hellhole, and you know how i feel about hellholes."
26708,Homer,ow!
19578,Homer,you could call 'em whitey whackers.
31757,Homer,"oh, i get it. these are those trick candles you can't blow out."
31452,Homer,"marge, let me explain: i had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
38508,Homer,"ooo! swab, swab, swab--"
28031,Homer,you see? i'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
20745,Homer,"i was trying to, but the opportunity never came up."
14175,Homer,nobody loves you...
35320,Homer,"when we get home, the peaches will be gone."
40641,Homer,"ah, watch the sunrise."
15087,Homer,woo hoo!
23825,Homer,yes! yesssss!
31053,Homer,"those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
34262,Homer,how about bromance?
29519,Homer,i know why you're here. you wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. well fine.
22603,Homer,"go ahead, sweetie."
25615,Homer,look out for the reach-around!
35606,Homer,but i guess i should find out a little bit about you.
40829,Homer,"boy, what's this world coming to?"
36435,Homer,i already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
17536,Homer,"marge, it's three a.m. shouldn't you be baking?"
22907,Homer,"they picked springy! in your face, patty and selma!"
23860,Homer,he-- what the?!
14289,Homer,and not a day goes by that we don't thank god for all three of you.
18893,Homer,"oh, bad dog! bad dog!"
18117,Homer,"oh, marge. you saved my life! i'm sorry i teased you. you're a really good cop. i'm proud of you."
19727,Homer,what happened?
14186,Homer,"actually, bart, i threw up more than your mother. ... it all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
37741,Homer,"okay, okay, no worries."
19932,Homer,you gave both dogs away?! you know how i feel about giving!
38931,Homer,"oh! finally! the business call i've been waiting for! hello, this is--"
29238,Homer,turn that down!
36560,Homer,"and if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero."
20111,Homer,stupid city! what the hell is this thing?
24299,Homer,is there any other st. louis?
28075,Homer,"i'm gonna treat marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
28906,Homer,i believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
40287,Homer,you mean -- ?
26774,Homer,he already knows. let's tell krusty.
20068,Homer,"well, that's all the time we have. so this is the simpson family saying: ""as you walk down the road of life..."""
36003,Homer,"i'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his springface profile picture to a shot of a monkey. get that, marge? a monkey!"
28967,Homer,"son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""
36741,Homer,"no, i don't want to."
21890,Homer,"okay, if i'm gonna be a real hippie, i have to learn from the master, mr. bob ""flower child"" hope."
33467,Homer,"fine, mr. skeptical. give me back your beads."
27203,Homer,"oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling."
40658,Homer,"does a father have to explain? let's just share your gift, okay?"
13408,Homer,"hi, honey. uh, oh. how's the marriage retreat going?"
26280,Homer,"come on! give it! i know, i'll try reverse psychology. i don't want that stupid map."
40768,Homer,you ignoramus.
13522,Homer,"wait a minute. if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
32612,Homer,oh right. just leave! but kick like a rockette!
40253,Homer,"let's go now... sa-winggg, batter!"
35643,Homer,"that's it! that's it! my nightmare is over! oh flanders, you are my personal savior!"
30952,Homer,hindu. what do you call the moisture on your hin?
16095,Homer,i'll write it on my hand...
22150,Homer,oh.
32822,Homer,see ya!
33653,Homer,"i'm not sure what happened. i was kidnapped, then tortured, then i fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. when i awoke, i felt refreshed. then i was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn."
25965,Homer,woo hoo!
40257,Homer,"me, sir? oh, no. not a chance. only idiots drink beer."
22848,Homer,"look marge, they're advertising my show in ""art in america."" it's the first time i've been mentioned there, that i know of."
21505,Homer,"hey, this hot dog tastes different."
31247,Homer,"uh... like all manly men, i have a vivid imagination."
25377,Homer,smelson! it's funny 'cause you smell.
19958,Homer,"oh, i hope you learned your lesson, lisa. never help anyone."
26384,Homer,why? so i can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? i don't think so. good day.
28025,Homer,public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. i guess i'll walk.
20571,Homer,"""the end will come at sundown."" heh heh heh heh. hey, wait a second. i don't like the sound of that."
38226,Homer,i believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one d would disagree with you.
35241,Homer,tell him how you feel.
29489,Homer,what's a cuckold?
31839,Homer,so... i thought it went real well. until i swallowed the whistle.
36659,Homer,i'm not superman.
30288,Homer,we'll say it's all our birthdays!
35863,Homer,see you next christmas!
21682,Homer,"all right, young lady. i want you to march yourself directly to the kwik-e-mart and get me some chips and a beer."
41154,Homer,marge!
22815,Homer,"yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... why doesn't mine look like that?!"
20896,Homer,to marge. and all the blissful years i've spent hiding from her in this bar.
33107,Homer,"a really fun party? full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? doesn't seem like your kind of thing, marge."
30521,Homer,then what protects you if we crash?
23669,Homer,mine tasted like strawberry.
28003,Homer,"look, he's misspelling words."
29107,Homer,what about now?
26075,Homer,"well, this is my house. ah--"
38721,Homer,i'll take those.
37930,Homer,"you know what, judge apatow... i do have something to say. these movie people may say i'm a pirate. but i'm just a man. a man who loved hollywood too much. so i made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
27131,Homer,"baby, baby, baby, baby, baby... uh-oh."
35625,Homer,up or down?
23005,Homer,don't look! don't look! don't look!
17293,Homer,"but that was just one little insignificant mosquito. that can't change the future, right? right?"
18596,Homer,"""they made us!"" that's loser talk! you gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! nothing's gonna stop us now!"
35518,Homer,"charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
16967,Homer,"well, i'm off to work."
16917,Homer,"that wasn't part of our deal, blackheart! that wasn't paaaaart!!"
41068,Homer,"well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth."
36848,Homer,"honey, i'm not cool. i was never cool. i didn't go to college. every cd i have i bought at a carwash. black-and-white films make me angry. i can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" i only know david cross from the chipmunks movie. not only do i like van halen, but i think they keep getting better..."
31990,Homer,"now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! look at him eyeing me -- he knows i taste best."
22099,Homer,the pig is in the poke.
29144,Homer,who are you?
21699,Homer,"woo hoo! marge, they found a donor! i'm saved!"
37751,Homer,"um... i don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--"
27473,Homer,marge?
40923,Homer,hey! why should she have a better husband than you do?
37708,Homer,one more ride?
40713,Homer,all right. stop it! cut it out!
14640,Homer,"oh, you mean tonight."
14454,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. nummy, nummy num."
22112,Homer,milking room? i hope you cows are decent.
30506,Homer,"i'm sorry i made you feel bad, honey. but i'm gonna show you just how much i care about your feelings. one adult and one baby, please."
14629,Homer,chub? i don't even know what that is!
18909,Homer,"oh, i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year."
41237,Homer,"little do they know, i'm ducking out early to take the duff brewery tour."
29565,Homer,"where's the remote! this is not a drill, people!"
13394,Homer,would this be a good time to be honest?
29670,Homer,"son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters."
18000,Homer,ooh la la.
15270,Homer,"so i says, ""yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause i don't know where it is you baloney..."" you make me wanna retch..."
17316,Homer,new glasses?
37259,Homer,just what do you want?!
29801,Homer,well... i don't know.
14594,Homer,you'll never guess what happened marge! are you ready? i... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
38051,Homer,where's... my... mon... ey?
28756,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you're getting into that school!"
40173,Homer,aag!
24724,Homer,i said i was sorry.
35310,Homer,"oh, that's ridiculous. how could two people from the same family need therapy?"
31364,Homer,"dudes! wanna make some extra spending money? get a free pair of boots? hey baby, you like obstacle courses?"
18519,Homer,"bart! bart! time for your sunday night bath, boy!"
29582,Homer,this'll be the worst thanksgiving dinner ever.
14018,Homer,this is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
24737,Homer,have a good time at your hippie club.
34642,Homer,uh... i do.
38251,Homer,it was pity-fridged!
21752,Homer,"no, that would make me a great father."
14824,Homer,boring.
40240,Homer,"sure, we get a nice mix here."
15174,Homer,"i know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but i can't go back on it. you're welcome to watch anything you want on tv."
35581,Homer,"how did this happen? last thing i remember, i was decorating the house for halloween."
30395,Homer,trucks are like big cars.
35261,Homer,"come on, party pooper -- bust a move!"
17157,Homer,oh sugar!
35183,Homer,go ahead.
34923,Homer,whose turn is it to cry?
35629,Homer,this is terrible. what am i gonna do?
21499,Homer,why don't you take a picture? it lasts longer.
30209,Homer,"all pancakes aside, i really came here to talk about my son."
17556,Homer,"why, you clattering clank of.... my dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. d'oh the pain! d'oh the pain of it all!"

29775,Homer,bart! pull over!
17103,Homer,"wait a minute! wait, that's it! i know now what i can offer you that no one else can. complete and utter dependence."
38435,Homer,"dad, is that story really true?"
19964,Homer,"it should, but it doesn't. now who's going with daddy to the dump?"
20690,Homer,"no i don't, i hate to rhyme."
35873,Homer,don't argue in front of the airport line. strangers are judging our marriage!
17562,Homer,what should we do until you get back?
30067,Homer,"begat. uh, do you have any books on the rapture?"
16832,Homer,"more. no, no, keep comin'. more... more... right there! let her go!"

21751,Homer,i promise you kids lots of things. that's what makes me such a good father.
14813,Homer,"marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
28118,Homer,how come lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
40649,Homer,"nooo, i just want to have a heart-to-heart talk."
23837,Homer,howdy. and thanks for not recoiling in horror.

37858,Homer,"oh, i don't know. it won't seem like christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in january."

39767,Homer,"ahhh... ahhh... oh, how was bowling?"
15509,Homer,bart!
19066,Homer,"right. bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
17668,Homer,"simpson ten, terrorists eight."
19282,Homer,"oh, no?! well, if homer simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then homer simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! that's..."
28423,Homer,he must be following this thing. well i'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
29345,Homer,"chief, my daughter's up there. you're a father too."
15338,Homer,"well, why was it wrapped in foil?"
27445,Homer,"it's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
22591,Homer,"oh boy, am i glad to see you guys."
19191,Homer,no one.
37777,Homer,tell me what a cow says!
26837,Homer,"oh no, i crushed that horrible bug. what should i do?"

18019,Homer,"don't worry. as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. believe me, i know."
33408,Homer,"uh, yes. that must be it. this is the best of all possible worlds. blah, blah, blah."
16338,Homer,and i feel that you hear my shame.
35033,Homer,"ion. hmm... no. ""irene ryan is tv's granny."""
19678,Homer,not till you're fifteen.
36564,Homer,i turned it off.

18366,Homer,any time i want.
18867,Homer,"what?! how dare you! if i find out who this is, i'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to iran!"
24285,Homer,"hey, vinnie, how's about a pizza? i got-a no job."
17414,Homer,"it didn't blow over, marge. nothin' ever blows over for me."
21021,Homer,no.

29437,Homer,"that's it, a plane!"
30214,Homer,"uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
26664,Homer,all right. i'll do it for my kids.
36894,Homer,"and the lord saw what he had made, and it was good."
19068,Homer,"lookin' good, son."
32664,Homer,"and one moonlit night, i finally had fun at a mini-golf course."
32699,Homer,"yeah, i can't believe all those years i used to drive that old piece of... what the?!"
13926,Homer,"fine, i will. there's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
32837,Homer,"behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!"
34377,Homer,and the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
30669,Homer,"oh, it's just what i wanted. here, marge, this is for you."
32148,Homer,"we're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. the company wants you and me to take the private plane to new york for the premiere! so meet me at shelbyville airport in an hour."
36759,Homer,"okay, what else... free tibet! you heard me! free him now! thank you. oh, my luck has changed!"
36838,Homer,"okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. i've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, i assume -- so don't screw it up."
30031,Homer,"hey, come back! i'm calming down! we'll have family fun! family funnnnn!"
31393,Homer,"hey, thanks for the heads-up! we'll see ya when we see ya!"
24275,Homer,huh?
40814,Homer,i gotta get outta here.
34931,Homer,now nothing stands between us and sunny hawa...
36691,Homer,holy moly.
29822,Homer,the guards are sadistic and cruel!
19583,Homer,"you're my last hope. i've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. your help could make all the difference in the world."
26953,Homer,in one car? with no air conditioning? and the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
36077,Homer,yeah. non-jerks!
34679,Homer,oh my god.
34484,Homer,that's some big underwear.
27390,Homer,"that's right, honey."
25205,Homer,"patent pending... patent pending... patent pending... hey, who's this guy?"
35594,Homer,"you forgot patty and selma. oh, wait. that hasn't happened yet."
16448,Homer,hey! we haven't watched tv in awhile.
38487,Homer,eat your broccoli.
18194,Homer,communication. gotcha.
33707,Homer,"marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. that's the most a parent can do."
40785,Homer,"ooh, lost a few. oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. uh-oh, a zit. no problemo."
20511,Homer,"oh, no you don't."
29057,Homer,i already work for you.
41278,Homer,keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
38745,Homer,we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. we are now a cover band. and we shall be called... covercraft. because we play covers and this is our craft.
20072,Homer,"well, i'm sorry if you heard ""disneyland"", but i distinctly said ""military school."""
31914,Homer,mm-hm.
39353,Homer,"well, i guess we don't have to do that."
24556,Homer,did you see that? i did the deed! open up!
30475,Homer,i can't believe marge hasn't called me. maybe i should go home.
15704,Homer,like what?
33811,Homer,that's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
37621,Homer,just like when i smell up the toilet.
25692,Homer,stupid grill!
39457,Homer,why?
39533,Homer,and there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
14353,Homer,"c'mon, c'mon! don't you realize this is costing me money?"
18369,Homer,"i was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- honey, i'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
18412,Homer,free sample of fabric softener? woo hoo!
22286,Homer,last night?
31404,Homer,i'm the king of goofing off!
38912,Homer,"no, please! all i'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!"
35415,Homer,"aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life warren beatty lived in ""shampoo."" and now it's time to pay you back..."
39922,Homer,"oooh, premium -- wait a minute. why?"
36709,Homer,"come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?"
35939,Homer,huh? who's there?
26614,Homer,"we'll get to that. right now, i think we need some time apart--"
37016,Homer,how can that be? i took every last can of gas!
30614,Homer,a mcdonald's where you can get booze!
18255,Homer,"look, kids! i just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
16194,Homer,"oooh, pure genius..."
39938,Homer,wait a minute. bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
14452,Homer,"sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...and went far, far away..."
41515,Homer,friends forever?
41332,Homer,don't be the boy. don't be the boy.
22142,Homer,nooooooooo!!!
16052,Homer,"maybe you're right. i did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
14736,Homer,"that's great, honey. say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
23668,Homer,yeah. it looked just like that.
31884,Homer,"oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
37957,Homer,not a word.
36304,Homer,closer than you think!
29872,Homer,"wow, it's been so long since i've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig i am."
16585,Homer,no burning leaves without a permit!
30574,Homer,"oh, that poor woman. i am gonna find her a friend! someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh."
39648,Homer,"and remember not to act afraid. animals can smell fear. and they don't like it. besides, there's nothing to be afraid of."
24402,Homer,look out for what?
25621,Homer,nobody's gonna tackle you.
20074,Homer,they sure are.
18547,Homer,"'tis the season, marge! we only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
29255,Homer,"thanks, marge. i can't wait to read about ""sport fishing with sonny jurgensen."""
32464,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. why don't you take some time to savor the front?"
15980,Homer,now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.
17712,Homer,man. it's windy as hell out there.
27510,Homer,"marge, he's way the hell up there."
39682,Homer,"avenge me, son. avenge my death."
35908,Homer,i am homer simpson.
36125,Homer,wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
40410,Homer,oh my god! he's enjoying it!
28846,Homer,i drank this much!
18271,Homer,"marge, tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like i do every morning."
17133,Homer,hard to the left!
20574,Homer,"ahh, i love these lazy saturdays."
23106,Homer,"yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too."
28054,Homer,"i say ""of course i can -- screw you!"""
25399,Homer,"so, how's that new block i got you?"
16057,Homer,"katharine hepburn's ""me""?"
27895,Homer,"so, she didn't hate me. she married me because she loved me!"
18902,Homer,"looks like bad news for the... ...""impson"" family."
15409,Homer,"bart, there's someone in here who wants to meet you."
30700,Homer,"hey guys, we found the treasure! when i get to shore, i'm bringin' it right to the bar."
39965,Homer,...and i've made reservations at the chez paree.
16550,Homer,woo hoo!
21519,Homer,"yeah, but your mom paid for that."
19327,Homer,'cause marge and i have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
25143,Homer,stop that! the fire inspector would be appalled.
21968,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!"
41178,Homer,"yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow."
31164,Homer,"oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock."
31293,Homer,"ooh, teenagers... no! today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them."
29468,Homer,just made it!
36766,Homer,"sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache."
22572,Homer,"don't worry, kids. i know just what to do. jumanji! does anything from the movies actually work?"
21693,Homer,that is one vicious baby bird.
23276,Homer,still not clean! still not clean!
37684,Homer,and together we are.
14446,Homer,"for your information, i can take care of my --"
13472,Homer,"this is some way to show your gratitude. no gold. no diamonds. no rubies. not even a lousy card. wait a minute, there was a card. that's what got me so mad in the first place."
31649,Homer,camera's broken!
30536,Homer,that's more like it!
34943,Homer,fifty bucks?! that used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
24562,Homer,who's up for a merry jig?
29920,Homer,"wow. my subconscious is a genius. well, that's all very convincing, and..."
29784,Homer,"marge, you're taking this pretty well."
20589,Homer,"well, i bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
25007,Homer,i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
31818,Homer,nothing.
18465,Homer,i'll kwaanza you!
30362,Homer,"where's lisa, boy? this book's gonna solve all her problems."
26830,Homer,"aw, the poor thing's in pain. what he needs is a visit from kindly old dr. foot."
22616,Homer,"finally, a company that understands my needs."
27790,Homer,"lisa, what's bumming you out? they cancel a test or something?"
31561,Homer,queer strange or queer gay?
39140,Homer,'cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. the dirty dozen? all guys. twelve angry men? men! the x-men? mostly men.
36115,Homer,no backtalk! in the cage! now!
40264,Homer,c'mon! all we need is a grand slam.
35961,Homer,what? my emotions were so powerful...
19036,Homer,"well, i have been eating more..."
31351,Homer,"bring it on, chumps!"
26547,Homer,why didn't you call me?
27651,Homer,droll.
34608,Homer,later. later.
31947,Homer,"marge, when you see me next i'll be a soggy, smoky hero. mmm, soggy, smoky hero."
29015,Homer,i'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! the only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
31886,Homer,a common problem. try this.
18257,Homer,"but all normal people love meat. if i went to a barbecue and there was no meat, i would say, ""yo, goober! where's the meat?"" i'm trying to impress people here, lisa. you don't win friends with salad."
41413,Homer,"you watch your mouth, you little smartass."
33929,Homer,but you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
17212,Homer,"don't worry, i've got an ace up my sleeve."
30406,Homer,gladly.
38599,Homer,ha! i gotcha!
28682,Homer,"so, how much bleach did you drink? not a talker, eh?"
36810,Homer,grampa?!
25865,Homer,i couldn't agree more. perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
28048,Homer,"yes, i strut down the boulevard / burning off my excess lard..."
34291,Homer,oops.
39155,Homer,eight million?
25359,Homer,"38! that's roughly my age! marge, after a lot of thought, i've decided to run the springfield marathon."
41149,Homer,bart!
40849,Homer,the lad has a point.
15104,Homer,ooo.
19495,Homer,"wow, marge, you really do understand me. see, i thought we weren't soul mates because..."
30033,Homer,someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
22542,Homer,you drive. i eat.
22347,Homer,"aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. wally and i have all the tickets we need."
18139,Homer,woo-hoo!
25395,Homer,you sold my little girl a shoddy eiffel tower.
27945,Homer,a lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
31602,Homer,"i shouldn't be here, i was framed!"
30705,Homer,that is so sweet.
20459,Homer,so...
38678,Homer,"aww, i will treasure this forever."
40608,Homer,"oh, okay. hello!"
18835,Homer,"you know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? why i heard..."
33205,Homer,"and when you win, i win. i'll explain that to you on your deathbed."
23862,Homer,"oh, that's it. you're through, dean!"
14125,Homer,"ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
40529,Homer,i was watching that.
39706,Homer,"oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
27805,Homer,"don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?"
13178,Homer,what is it you want from me? money? weed?
20464,Homer,"hello, son."
24883,Homer,"and who's selling the uranium to the terrorists? montgomery burns. now, we wait."
19647,Homer,"oh, marge i just had a couple of beers."
16989,Homer,room service? send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.
30880,Homer,that's just the product i've been coveting! pick us! pick us!
20509,Homer,"jasper. gladys. beatrice. lookin' good, hattie. asa. hazel. hazel! hazel!"
23564,Homer,why won't they come over? i'm so lonely.
37480,Homer,it's no use. we're perfectly matched.
18105,Homer,lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
28368,Homer,"mmm, moses."
13227,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's!"
35799,Homer,"my job is my wife. loneliness, my mistress. despair, my sex buddy. angst is a chick i met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy."
14706,Homer,"well, i was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now i feel kinda guilty about it."
31790,Homer,i wanted to remember my place in the book i was reading.
35225,Homer,better shut up / cheech is really mad / i wish that i had gone with cho-ong...
31417,Homer,"why, doesn't he need it? oh, right."
40433,Homer,"okay, out you go!"
39305,Homer,it is?
41450,Homer,"wish me luck, dad."
15820,Homer,"oh, marge, what if i wind up as some vegetable, watching tv on the couch? my important work will never be completed."
31481,Homer,"okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night."
28543,Homer,uh... is it despair?
40894,Homer,"now, c'mon. take all this, and this, put it in the closet."
32493,Homer,sometimes i think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
22840,Homer,"astrid said the key to my art is anger. but you know me, i'm mister mellow."
21013,Homer,nice fella. i wonder if he's gay?
20119,Homer,"hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?"
26473,Homer,that was a d.w.i.
19133,Homer,umm-hmmm...
36194,Homer,i know this dream! it's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!
38337,Homer,just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...
15260,Homer,fine. i'll look it up.
38058,Homer,sit. sit. sit! sit! sit!!!
41107,Homer,"i can't tell you how sorry i am, dad."
30478,Homer,he looks tough.
32752,Homer,i know you ate my jerky. just like i ate your earthquake supplies!
13409,Homer,"marge, you don't know what this fish means. this fish represents a better life for both of us. this fish makes me a champion and a hero."
15264,Homer,woo hoo!
20280,Homer,"good night, losers!"
23086,Homer,this sucks. what else is on?
24693,Homer,there.
30019,Homer,"don't worry honey, the song i wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""moon river"" sound like a farting orangutan."
28218,Homer,that's why i don't listen to my brain. and away we go!
15313,Homer,"shut up, boy."
15838,Homer,"over there."""
18660,Homer,trouble it is.
14572,Homer,"no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
15185,Homer,"oooh, give it here."
22749,Homer,"well... the last time i saw him, he was in a big plastic bag."
29546,Homer,i don't know. it's a lot of pressure. do many people watch the super bowl?
40166,Homer,"marge, she's right."
26692,Homer,my father and i were never really close.
30943,Homer,a cow took my ipod and i punched it!
39315,Homer,we got one?
36128,Homer,"hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
19580,Homer,"aw, looks like mr. pretzel man is doing pretty well for himself."
15808,Homer,"ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god."
18325,Homer,oops.
33285,Homer,what about the bridge?
18323,Homer,"man, this place looks expensive. i feel like i'm wasting a fortune just standing here. better make the most of it."
37716,Homer,"so that's it? all my dreams, lived?"
18320,Homer,my stomach sticks way out in front and my...
24955,Homer,step right up! see the magic boy! witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!
22586,Homer,"oh, i'm sure of it!"
23882,Homer,woo hoo! go s.u.!
19002,Homer,"""stay in school. your hero, homer."""
23177,Homer,they are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
34638,Homer,lousy--
15111,Homer,to the book depository!
28519,Homer,unloved by al? noooooooo!
23578,Homer,"well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do i read from the sheet labeled ""jokes"" or ""answers?"""
37508,Homer,we don't get together to share our emotions. we get together to escape them.
21077,Homer,"mr. moe, prepare to surface."
22680,Homer,didn't i?
40961,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, well, i wish i could help you but we're looking for my brother today. can you tell me his name?"
24423,Homer,...gonna try to...
20107,Homer,"oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
19487,Homer,"a machine? earl's a machine. oh, that's just perfect! homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! oh, wow!"
21710,Homer,there. now no murderers can get in... or out.
38032,Homer,no need. everything's fine.
41248,Homer,don't panic. just come up with a good story.
34075,Homer,"now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm."
26661,Homer,"although, wow!"
34786,Homer,"yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
24501,Homer,...m-e-r. okay.
33142,Homer,"coming, marge!"
20062,Homer,"but, marge...!"
34730,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. don't you realize what just happened?"
31513,Homer,do you think that's the same grumple from the ice show? because i do.
38620,Homer,everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr. burns gets five thousand dollars!
24708,Homer,"yeah, i'm watching, honey. nice cannonball. anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'cause over-thinking is... what were we talking about? ooh, a clown."
13749,Homer,"here's good news. according to this eye-catching article, sat scores are declining at a slower rate."
17770,Homer,"wait a minute. we all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. that's you, flanders."
24601,Homer,"i'm not gonna stand for this. i'm gonna call the newspapers, the tv stations, the gas stations, everybody."
39023,Homer,um...
34870,Homer,"and so the bloody hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
30663,Homer,i told grampa we'd be away
23123,Homer,i will now.
23247,Homer,"so i gave up tap for jazz, and i've never regretted it. and here's why..."
23215,Homer,"geez, what's the big deal? look, i'll even eat some."
19849,Homer,"at first i thought prohibition was a good thing. people were drinking more and having a lot more fun. but without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
30454,Homer,i call the red one!
17451,Homer,"oh, here we are. the ""utility room."""
29908,Homer,oh thank god. where is he? tell me!

14379,Homer,"my daughter, that's who!"
17411,Homer,"marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. now go upstairs and pack your bags. we're gonna start a new life under the sea."
33517,Homer,"honey, don't cry. it could be worse -- at least it's not raining!"
30766,Homer,"wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
20529,Homer,"ahh. is this the life, or what?"
26580,Homer,"ooh, they look like skittles."

40322,Homer,crabgrass? what are you talking about? where?
13497,Homer,"what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
29234,Homer,i need a mouth hole. and some other holes too.
38996,Homer,"this means war! boy, bring my toupee!"
29967,Homer,"lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. c'mon, everybody get in here. hurry."
23421,Homer,really? but you've never given anyone a free beer.
37739,Homer,"who's president now, alexander hamilton?"
26086,Homer,what about the wiener? a guy on tv lifted a can of paint with his.
36268,Homer,fine. don't get your circuits in a bunch.

29874,Homer,"ray, you know me better than anyone. how can i get my wife to love me again?"
13737,Homer,see? it was all your imagination.
21456,Homer,hmmm...
38596,Homer,safety first.
33294,Homer,flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
31131,Homer,look at that ugly old man.
21986,Homer,"sorry, marge. pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. but don't worry. i put him in a nice hot bath."
31402,Homer,"rich maple color, good swirl..."
33994,Homer,i can't make sense of that muncher talk!
21816,Homer,imagine films.
13437,Homer,are you?
30779,Homer,how long is this commercial anyway?
37833,Homer,"hello, boy. at times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."
14497,Homer,the hell with this!
30715,Homer,listen... i wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.
20519,Homer,"when i get old, marge, i want you to promise you'll put me in a home. it's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
22918,Homer,"boy, lenny, you sure look hungry. have some nuts."
40571,Homer,will that hold up in court?
40953,Homer,"i'm going to find my brother. i don't care what it takes. if i have to move heaven and earth, i'm going to find him!"
15696,Homer,"where's your science fair project, boy?"
17190,Homer,"oh, baby."
24672,Homer,somethin' wrong with your legs?
19146,Homer,eh... i... no.
31670,Homer,"it's a tragedy, a real tragedy. i mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?"
31875,Homer,sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.
19657,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... i'll give up the civil war re-creation society i love so much."
37294,Homer,when we got married i promised you a life full of romance. now here it is.
18171,Homer,careful now.
26323,Homer,"well, i don't know. the demolition derby is next month..."
36664,Homer,you take that back!
29153,Homer,yes.
25439,Homer,"yes, that is an important story. but so is this!"
29223,Homer,"bah! has science ever kissed a woman, or won the super bowl, or put a man on the moon? this is what i think of your precious science."
35690,Homer,fun dad is a foodie now!
22078,Homer,"yesss, tickling."
27972,Homer,"god no, it sucks."
25619,Homer,"reattach a thumb? this isn't ""gattaca."""
40865,Homer,"yeah, friday night. you want to come over?"
41543,Homer,"apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up."
35875,Homer,"yes, but i never use that kind of toothpaste!"
34892,Homer,a shrink who takes kids and pets?
25848,Homer,"die, you monster!"
15975,Homer,i stuck him somewhere.
33317,Homer,"hm, i'm not sure. let me check."
37408,Homer,"they're like a wedding ring, i can't take them off anymore."
36784,Homer,how long have i been playing?
19670,Homer,okay. question two -- who was your last employer?
15024,Homer,"you know, i have a feeling there's a lesson here."
20308,Homer,"yes, yes, oh god yes!"
24744,Homer,"i'm sorry, i wasn't listening. i was lost in your eyes."
18151,Homer,"oh, you're a dead man! oh, you're dead! you're dead burns!"
39456,Homer,"oh come on. that cornball routine. ""i love you, daddy."" give me a break."
39974,Homer,"son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo."
20413,Homer,flaaaan-ders...
22596,Homer,"well, marge?"
29667,Homer,i'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
39179,Homer,"nice. you know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. tell me about one."
35587,Homer,ow!
21162,Homer,just the monkey then.
36145,Homer,"really, anyone? what about the hulk riding a rhinoceros? would you stop him from laughing?"
22088,Homer,never!
25511,Homer,get her outta here.
21293,Homer,i agree. let's surrender.
27414,Homer,it's full of cigarette butts. so is this one...
32726,Homer,"c'mon, pick up, pick up! i know you're there."
27868,Homer,"marge, please. let's not fight in front of the kids. just secretly hate me the way you always have."
13950,Homer,i don't know. how long do horses live?
25244,Homer,"ah, geez. how come they never call traveling anymore?"
37253,Homer,"oh yeah. i say ""union"" you say ""power""! union..."
39174,Homer,revue...
35951,Homer,"lisa, you were right! i'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!"
20293,Homer,"nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
25618,Homer,"sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, marge!"
39270,Homer,arrgh! -- damn it to...
36426,Homer,"it was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. of course she fell for me and of course i wanted no part of her. now, the only one who can help us is stradivarius cain."
18124,Homer,"now, marge, you can't blame all of bart's problems on your one little speech. if anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. and let's not forget your little speech..."
40469,Homer,oh i can't watch.
26246,Homer,okay.
40402,Homer,"come on, bart. remember what vince lombardi said: ""if you lose, you're out of the family."""
20482,Homer,"o-kay, here we go..."
38552,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, i'd like you to meet... mother hubbard standee."
15423,Homer,my heart is just fine...
31397,Homer,"oh honey, don't cry. they're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!"
22381,Homer,"there's ""the laughter family."" that's animated. networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
34996,Homer,ohhhh!
27456,Homer,"wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! isn't it, kids?"
16918,Homer,piece of cake. all we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
40525,Homer,take that you dumb squirrel.
14980,Homer,and what if we picked the wrong religion? every week we're just making god madder and madder.
34502,Homer,oops.
22802,Homer,"no, no, i'm into chicken."
29790,Homer,make it seven!
40624,Homer,"""try something new, homer. what'll it hurt you, homer?"" i never heard of a poison pork chop."
15221,Homer,you can't take our donuts!
24645,Homer,woo hoo! flood from water!
26642,Homer,i said wiggum!
27065,Homer,"oh, what have i done?"
14407,Homer,"well, c'mon, we can still watch the super bowl together. can't we? eh? huh?"
20889,Homer,don't you hate pants?
19532,Homer,we were sitting in barney's car eating packets of mustard. ya happy?
34050,Homer,"hey, it's not like i want to go. go, go, go!"
34201,Homer,i did it! i'm gonna make it!
33587,Homer,lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
32219,Homer,no problem.
14041,Homer,"i talked to flanders about parenting. i'm a perfect father. hold on, son, i'm-a coming!"
25111,Homer,"you mean, like, medical testing?"
16684,Homer,and we've all found happiness... every one of us.
39327,Homer,this lunkhead?
26789,Homer,this is going great.
37783,Homer,it's true. even the other guy in the elevator. he's right here.
23146,Homer,"sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. mel's movie really stinks."
19451,Homer,who said that?
18732,Homer,"ah! well, if you kids believe in me that much, i'll give it my best shot."
26990,Homer,anybody else? come on...
19338,Homer,"look -- ""mostly madrigals."" hey, that might be good. ooh, ooh, ""an evening with philip glass."" just an evening? ""voices of the elderly poor."""
34006,Homer,who's an unproductive worker now?
32369,Homer,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
24220,Homer,"oh, moe. there's lots of people uglier than you. like, you ever been to white castle?"
41377,Homer,"whoa, he's getting serious. is this what i really want?"
29190,Homer,i can still hear her. i'd better do something.
32088,Homer,"yeah, but i'm on a plane, idiot."
16501,Homer,shhh. i'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
16434,Homer,me too.
20462,Homer,"i'm feelin' kinda low, apu. you got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? you know, ""skittlebrau""?"
32862,Homer,you stupid kid! what if i walked in here barefoot?
29524,Homer,"honey, i bet you're wondering why daddy's not at work again. the answer may surprise you. i have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player."
39248,Homer,prancer...
18341,Homer,"yeah! especially your big fat... oh, wait."
37157,Homer,"boy, you're pretty pushy for a book i just met."
31054,Homer,"see that ball of fire? that's the sun. it goes by many names: apollo's lantern, day-moon, old blazey. the important thing is never to touch it."
26387,Homer,"artie, thanks for saving my life. now, i believe there's a little matter of the million dollars..."
24347,Homer,i could do a lotta things if i had some money.
38863,Homer,stupid kid! you ruin every trip!
38037,Homer,woo-hoo! i tried! okay.
18434,Homer,i gotta call the plant and warn them!
18718,Homer,"they have beer and gum, right?"
34857,Homer,why did burns make us all come here?
19363,Homer,will you two shut up?! people are trying to sleep!!
31844,Homer,i said foul on twenty-three!
27622,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. i can't be here tomorrow. it's the last day the ribwich is in san francisco."
32138,Homer,"well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... i lied. i didn't get the job. you see when i got there..."
36913,Homer,"oh yeah, baby, i'm drinking you down to your knees."
17174,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
30027,Homer,fired... me?
34288,Homer,"marge, you're really good with your left hand."
13318,Homer,would you have to do extra work?
36004,Homer,right. status update: homer... is... watching... the...
39005,Homer,um...
30750,Homer,shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
36352,Homer,"okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
40933,Homer,"heh heh heh. here we go. boy meets beast. principal skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, selma."
40711,Homer, ... on tape... 
30560,Homer,"uh, well, my son is here too. let's meet him now."
38717,Homer,this place is great. just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
35212,Homer,my time being wasted was not wasted!
37164,Homer,sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.
30621,Homer,nooooo!
32910,Homer,"aw, ma. you always knew just how to make everything all right."
20981,Homer,"oh, lisa's right. we're nothing but a big bunch of losers. show's over, folks. go home."
21504,Homer,"yo, apu, gimme the usual."
15700,Homer,"i gotta think of a lie, fast."
20789,Homer,"na na na na na na na na fish-ing / na na na na na na na na fish-ing / fish-ing, fish-ing--"
13727,Homer,"hey, look what i got. a genuine official police badge... calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
20303,Homer,"c'mon, give us some candy. don't pretend you're not home!"
32140,Homer,"um... um...c'mon, say ""you're hired""!"
33949,Homer,i'm so cold.
16013,Homer,go home.
23313,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""shake"" and ""bake."""
13295,Homer,"mmmmmm, donuts."
17128,Homer,not everything. there's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
20551,Homer,i'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
29300,Homer,i thought you two broke up.
21008,Homer,would you be proud of me?
13450,Homer,how many hairs on my head? without looking!
40316,Homer,"so that's it. the costume's buried now. as my son would say, i'm one sad ape-like dude."
37854,Homer,"oh, you know what this means, kids?"
38356,Homer,"why are you doing this to me, booze? i drank every kind of you!"
32774,Homer,i thought you might have trouble with this. that's why i'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. someone you'd never expect.
26766,Homer,"nothing, nothing. there's nothing eating me up inside."
15117,Homer,"show's over, shakespeare!"
20645,Homer,"yeah, you're right, moe. you're always moe."
24779,Homer,"well, sir... you see, sir... i've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well..."
20028,Homer,"see. and my son, bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
25041,Homer,but skinner got shot!
29175,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to dance on his grave."
40477,Homer,springfield gorge? i thought we settled this daredevil junk.
24101,Homer,"so how'd you do tonight, romeo?"
35707,Homer,marge! this isn't a food restaurant! it's a meth restaurant! a meth-taurant!
35483,Homer,"don't you mean ""neighboreeno?"""
39967,Homer,oops.

22686,Homer,it's you! you're him! you're tony randall!
28279,Homer,but i'm up two hundred thousand dollars! give me my money!
30570,Homer,"ladies. marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
20277,Homer,"hmmm, two bucks... and it only transports matter? umm... well, ah... i'll give you 35 cents."
21234,Homer,"quiet, you! i know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. but i also know you care about the race for sanitation commissioner. so, let me give ya the 911..."
20726,Homer,fry up some cheese?

32781,Homer,"not keys, cigarettes!"
34394,Homer,"ned, i'm an american tourist. i'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my carolina panthers credit card."

16609,Homer,"well, no matter what the paper says, i still have a job to do."
35026,Homer,"been a while since our wives got together, huh?"
26948,Homer,"i've been driving all night, hand's wet on the wheel... there's a voice in my head that drives my heel... it's my baby callin' on the telephone... i got some pizza and i'm bringin' it home..."
23254,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. daddy's got it covered."
30448,Homer,what was that for?
39644,Homer,"well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
27275,Homer,"mmm, steamed gentile."
19058,Homer,"fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."

26368,Homer,"oh no. if marge marries artie, i'll never be born!"
21233,Homer,"hellooo springfield! it's me, homer!"

38172,Homer,"honey, there's something i wanna show you."
28611,Homer,"not so rough, bart. daddy can't handle so much love right now."
31442,Homer,"what the hell do you kids want? oh right, ice cream."
23027,Homer,"come on, lisa! monkeys!"
29253,Homer,"of course not. why would i want to look at a nude woman i'm not even married to? i mean, i wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
18506,Homer,yeah.
26810,Homer,that is called parenting. i'm going to moe's.
18605,Homer,"mr. burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that..."

33202,Homer,i want you to put it all on my little girl. and parlay with the asian kid.
17994,Homer,"so this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh hugh?"
35815,Homer,"well i, uh, found that contact lens i was missing. lemme just screw her back in."
38015,Homer,is she having an affair?
24465,Homer,"what are you talking about, professor frink? they're clearly in the ""on"" position. see? ""on."""
32749,Homer,who could have done this?!
36028,Homer,"you know, i heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
27900,Homer,"that's it, i'm writing a christmas carol. if i can make my own clothes, i can do anything."
19528,Homer,"no, i'm sorry."
29556,Homer,"but then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide!"
22371,Homer,"well, it's about time."
34773,Homer,"o-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
31403,Homer,"oh, jemima!"
37873,Homer,"oh right, we're still doing that."
24254,Homer,"well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? lisa?"
26833,Homer,are you sure god doesn't want it to be dead?
40526,Homer,where do they get their ideas?
38898,Homer,oh who am i kidding? i couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. i'm going back to save them.
22419,Homer,i'm begging you. i'm a human being. let me have my dignity back.
30456,Homer,hmmm. i suppose i could use a little toning.
17883,Homer,"well, good luck finding it because i'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
34456,Homer,there's always a catch.
20368,Homer,"listen, if it'll make you feel any better, i'll put the safety on."
15953,Homer,"rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""achy breaky heart"" was seven years away. something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop..."
33603,Homer,"moe, something terrible has happened! the irish have become hardworking and sober!"
37172,Homer,...thimble from monopoly game...
32580,Homer,your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!
14384,Homer,i used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. now it's the smell of victory.
15042,Homer,"heh heh heh... oh, lisa, this isn't real. it's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
23408,Homer,"you're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
39274,Homer,but...
25201,Homer,yeah... in fact...
26846,Homer,"thank god. i'm out of matches. oh no, here's another one."
30405,Homer,"well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!"
16996,Homer,"well, marge, it was horrible. everyone was against me in that jury room. but i stood by the courage of my convictions and i prevailed. and that's why we had chinese food for lunch."
14462,Homer,maggie?
21091,Homer,"what is it, sweetie? did you see a scary picture in your picture book?"
40384,Homer,"read that back to me, marge."
15675,Homer,sold!
15017,Homer,"fire! what do i do? what do i do? oh, the song! the song! when a fire starts to burn / there's a lesson you must learn / something... something, then you'll see/you'll avoid catastrophe!"
30435,Homer,no toys!
35093,Homer,why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?
37603,Homer,hope it pays off for youuu...
25544,Homer,yoink.
39454,Homer,"bart, please. five bucks for a kiss."
29644,Homer,"dad, where's your base?!"
16502,Homer,"i got a job at burns' casino. as you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer."
16305,Homer,oooh! the springfield men's shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
36521,Homer,it didn't feel like success.
30216,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. no matter what i did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
28915,Homer,you just don't understand boys. he's stupid.
25277,Homer,"ohhh, well that's bad news for dingbat charlie. he's gonna be crushed."
27573,Homer,attaboy! we just won the world series! you and me together! yeah!
23835,Homer,"oh, thank you good sir."
29919,Homer,there has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like flanders and bart... wait! the bartender at knockers.
21568,Homer,no.
33411,Homer,"oh, i get it. you're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?"
27196,Homer,"with the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup."
31040,Homer,when will marge remember us?
17159,Homer,like what?
28627,Homer,affirmative.
14582,Homer,"so what're you gonna be, boy?"
31541,Homer,i've never seen marge like a dvd about a place so much. i'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her ipod.
27995,Homer,"to me that says ""i love you."""
37275,Homer,"flanders, i've come to forgive you."
19745,Homer,"ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! i danced with a gay! marge, lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. promise me!"
38399,Homer,"because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four."
16175,Homer,i think i'm blind.
34413,Homer,your parents made you?
36543,Homer,lisa! do you have a stray dog down there?
39597,Homer,"my game! my game! i coulda beat the boy! marge, how could you? i was so close."
41039,Homer,"get in, dad. i'll explain on the way home."
39781,Homer,starving.
40522,Homer,"hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?"
15611,Homer,bart's not mad at me.
19361,Homer,woo hoo! two dollars! it's working!
22704,Homer,"oh, yeah? my left arm says different."
33706,Homer,"oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name."
35862,Homer,"dad, these are your great-grandsons."
20002,Homer,"hiya, stretch! what's the good word?"
34879,Homer,"is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken i played, lost to, and ate at the state fair?"
23913,Homer,wasteful and practical.
40749,Homer,uh-huh.
18442,Homer,mr. burns... can you make me thin again?
41354,Homer,a million dollars -- now i'm really glad i didn't die!
27419,Homer,now what are you gonna do? you can't shoot all of us.
15133,Homer,are you kidding? lisa turned out perfect. i won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing lisa!
23793,Homer,i want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
13290,Homer,why you little...
25957,Homer,very little.
17533,Homer,where? where?
18982,Homer,"you're not going to school today. today, your classroom will be the capitol city amphitheater. your teacher? four dozen rock bands. so get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. woo hoo!"
20978,Homer,everybody hates birds! ...right!
17526,Homer,"so marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
20007,Homer,"so how's it going, grimy?"
13218,Homer,i don't know why i ever sold you to him.
18821,Homer,will do.
21974,Homer,"feel that, marge? he likes you!"
35726,Homer,we're taking down kids who read.
28736,Homer,"but marge, it was all for you. to buy you all the nice things you deserve. the flowers, the earrings, the bob seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
20568,Homer,you damn well better!
30572,Homer,"hey, good looking. wanna snuggle with ""tyrannosaurus sex""?"
35200,Homer,back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. which was about three times.
32313,Homer,here's your nose. daddy's putting back your nose.
22176,Homer,fire in the hole!
21269,Homer,patterson was right. i'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...
17999,Homer,"you know what's great about you english? ""octopussy."" man, i must have seen that movie... twice."
25005,Homer,you've just won 10 million dollars from that publisher's cleary-dealie!
14371,Homer,"me too, honey."
37794,Homer,"hey, oh oh oh! now maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
41391,Homer,more sugar! more sugar!
40168,Homer,don't play dumb with me. we found your book.
40769,Homer,"no, you..."
33215,Homer,"well, sweetie, daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. you'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. i hope you're not mad."
39260,Homer,"so, what do you think kids? beauty, isn't it?"
31815,Homer,you guys are right -- i should get back in the game. but i threw away my camera.
30526,Homer,"did i hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'cause heeere they are!"
35461,Homer,"little help... little help... flanders, little help?"
14806,Homer,forbearance is the watchword. that triumvirate of twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
18316,Homer,hey!
39136,Homer,"marge, which can makes me look cooler? the drizzler or mr. drip?"
31962,Homer,"look at me, guys!"
18399,Homer,"and nobody's gonna take it away from me! you never had faith in me before. but let me tell you, the slim, lazy homer you knew is dead. now i'm a big fat dynamo. and where's that cake?"
35112,Homer,what has she done?! i feel like i'm married to richard gere!
21841,Homer,"oh, it was so great. i didn't have to fake it with them. i was actually excited to hear about their day."
24788,Homer,"i'd like to buy a mint condition ""spider-man number one,"" please."
32550,Homer,"really? well, that's great, dad. how can i ever repay you?"
26472,Homer,you? no way. it's too dangerous.
13311,Homer,"it's true. now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, lisa. there's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. oh well, maybe i can't explain all this, but i can fix your doll house for you. at least, i'm good at monkey work. you know... monkey. you know what i mean?"
14369,Homer,"uh... somewhere in the back. the point is we had a great time today. and to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. okay?"
18353,Homer,yes i can.
35874,Homer,"marge, do we really need all these feminine products?"
26228,Homer,woo hoo!
22634,Homer,"you're on! lisa, you play winner."
37767,Homer,where's hoju? where's hojuuu?!
22411,Homer,and that big yellow flower.
29198,Homer,"hey flanders, have you seen my frisbee?"
23916,Homer,i'm drunk!
29481,Homer,you do?
27810,Homer,what? are you sure?
24716,Homer,"stupid game! now, what were we talking about?"
38213,Homer,when did you come up with the idea? you must've worked on it for days.
16293,Homer,"it's marge! she's become a crazed criminal, just because i didn't take her to the ballet."
15882,Homer,true.
40480,Homer,"oh, that never works. he's a goner."
33948,Homer,you just said both those things to me.
30789,Homer,i'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
27092,Homer,bor-ing.
40545,Homer,"yeah. if i wasn't so spineless, i'd march into mr. burns' office right now and..."
26979,Homer,"i'll take it from here, fake-o."
17230,Homer,parents island?
31093,Homer,what about him?
24536,Homer,the simpsons are going to delaware!
38768,Homer,what? so you can also get famous and bail on us? you're out of the band!
28619,Homer,i just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
36062,Homer,"hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
21933,Homer,"not so fast, pig! we're making a stand. a freaky stand! you can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!"
18055,Homer,"lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?"
40754,Homer,oh.
14171,Homer,let me ask you something. does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
25527,Homer,in the cart.
30035,Homer,"his name isn't cameron anymore. he's now ""johnny rainbow."""
15249,Homer,"heh heh, i know what you mean. just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
31687,Homer,"just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish."
28339,Homer,"my lord, we americans love queens, be they homecoming or dairy. this woman, however, is an imposter."
14616,Homer,uh... hitler's dog... and that dog nixon had... whassisname... uh... chester.
19083,Homer,"oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
36323,Homer,totally scripted.
20092,Homer,throw it away! nothing good has ever come out of new york city!
28709,Homer,"all i know is the guy who played mozart was also in ""animal house."" now there's a movie with good music. animal house house house... / nobody ever went to class... / then we saw donald sutherland's ass... / animal house house house... /"
24643,Homer,woo hoo!
19568,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. when are the pancakes coming in the mail?"
24061,Homer,then i insist on walking you home.
13330,Homer,do we have enough gag ice cubs?
24147,Homer,me homer. me hiding from pbs.
32619,Homer,"i think i'll miss you most of all, captain corndog's schnitzel palace. no tears, homer."
24443,Homer,who said that?
24721,Homer,i have a plan.
17933,Homer,call off the debt?
34802,Homer,"okay, okay. if a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
27697,Homer,shot down on valentine's day. that's supposed to be a gimme. everybody's gettin'some but me.
37025,Homer,and it still works!
36224,Homer,"so, what's on the agenda?"
40701,Homer,marge! marge!
39478,Homer,when will i learn? the answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. heh-heh. they're on tv!
35425,Homer,morning.
17487,Homer,"some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! but now, i've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
39755,Homer,what? no...
32522,Homer,eat hobo remains!
29332,Homer,"oh honey, her life can't compare to yours. you've got three kids, a tv tray from expo sixty-seven, and you're married to king stink!"
27580,Homer,"of course, because you wouldn't want to... i paid for your splendor, you...!"
17018,Homer,woo hoo!
41366,Homer,"you have regrets, mr. ""i get to see the weathergirl from the side?"" i made the worst financial decision of all time. oh, i can't think about it, i won't think about it, i don't want to think about it..."
14096,Homer,stupid moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
15226,Homer,i've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
33560,Homer,told you there was no way i would do it.
17735,Homer,thanks for giving me my old job back.
26320,Homer,"okay, you pick one out and i'll punch it to death."
14001,Homer,"well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. how much do you see your son?"
40987,Homer,herb?
18499,Homer,"okay, so we can't go over the fence."
37215,Homer,"if i can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then i've failed as a son."
23012,Homer,"houston, we have a problem. a sexy problem."
16639,Homer,"it's okay, son. who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? you're doing what you want to do with your life. nothing else matters."
19782,Homer,but what would turn bart into a man fast? you have to think for me!
15719,Homer,my name is homer and i'm just here because the court made me come.
26220,Homer,talk about what? sports? bigamy?
16441,Homer,"well, this is my floor."
14854,Homer,nah.
38968,Homer,"i'll eat in bed. not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... oh, and tv would be on. loud."
14820,Homer,what the hell are you two...
15579,Homer,suggestion noted.
29975,Homer,"how much is got, wolfgang schmuck?"
17921,Homer,"stupid driving test at the stupid dmv where stupid patty and stupid selma work. sometimes i think god is teasing me, just like he teased moses in the desert."
30430,Homer,"here, make me a kitty!"
19407,Homer,where? to the big annual what?
28113,Homer,people will do anything a sign tells them.
26497,Homer,only in public.
20926,Homer,"they're showing ""hail to the chimp!"" oh, i have time to see one little movie!"
37820,Homer,"now get up here, boy! we're gonna do the super bowl shuffle."
33993,Homer,how do i know you're not a muncher?
30753,Homer,i'm gonna double kill you! and then i'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. then i'll dig you up and kill you again! that's the beauty of a shallow grave.
18646,Homer,"oh, man, i've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those breakfast balls..."
29272,Homer,but win the contest?
24553,Homer,... gotta find a good deed.
37611,Homer,and they also gave me an alcohol detox.
33374,Homer,woo hoo!
24687,Homer,"yeah, it's hopeless."
39817,Homer,"aw, i knew you'd come to your..."
37940,Homer,and tell your friends it was great! buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
39349,Homer,p.u. when is this over?
19779,Homer,"ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! the whole world's gone gay!"
26145,Homer,"i have eyes, don't i?"
41349,Homer,no book is gonna make my daughter sad. time to do what i do best: lie to a child.
37867,Homer,the pillow acted as a girdle.
31401,Homer,"hmmm... maple syrup. sleigh on the label, very good."
17741,Homer,marvelous.
31112,Homer,my mind is always open to new ideas.
25297,Homer,"well, good for you! anyone i know?"
41473,Homer,c'mere!
38109,Homer,i'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
26192,Homer,cooperate?! this is one family that doesn't swing that way.
41422,Homer,not again.
19786,Homer,it just does! name me one gay indian!
40904,Homer,"yeah, at the worst possible time."
17004,Homer,"marge, please. old people don't need companionship. they need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
18234,Homer,no.
31780,Homer,the clown on this cereal box is just a person!
39032,Homer,"come on, i want cream! give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!"
39718,Homer,"now i've seen everything. black marbleized with a liquid center. the ""stealth bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
24860,Homer,they can't sue me if they don't know who i am. i'll just call myself mr. x.
16569,Homer,"marge, we're responsible adults and..."
41094,Homer,no.
34852,Homer,look what maggie got!
30367,Homer,i forgot to floss this morning!
26852,Homer,my pleasure.
37668,Homer,"hello, bear stearns? i'd like to sell all my apple stock so i can buy a fancy bowling ball. you heard me. technology is a fad. heavy blue balls are the future."
40388,Homer,"look, son, all i'm asking is that you try."
38991,Homer,why you little...?!
37387,Homer,"son, i'd love to, but... i'm a deacon now. my butt's place is in my pants."
31897,Homer,"wrong, wrong, wrong!"
33148,Homer,"you're just as bad as me. and you used to be better, so that makes you worse! i don't think we can ever trust each other again."
37723,Homer,"majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness."
23896,Homer,or else what?
32398,Homer,"is ""beautiful"" a color?"
18159,Homer,"me! me! me, me!"
26640,Homer,wow. wow. god does so much for me. and he doesn't ask anything in return.
20191,Homer,and we never did.
23278,Homer,"great. now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
18745,Homer,"well, nice talking to you."
40481,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll try."
13891,Homer,"ha ha, you love me."
41054,Homer,yeah.
30543,Homer,"oh, i hate press conferences."
37476,Homer,"all right, this is it, carl's family home. twenty-two..."
18521,Homer,aha!
25534,Homer,the customer's always right. that's what everybody likes about us. now mush!
28439,Homer,now calm down. i'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
30812,Homer,i figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. money which we could use to pay for bart's operation.
34779,Homer,it was poisoned.
32836,Homer,"the real reason we americans put up with sports, is for this..."
39773,Homer,nothing.
24582,Homer,intelligent italians? something's wrong.
39223,Homer,oh! big jar this year.
40915,Homer,"oh and that sauce, barney. i could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! no barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
40602,Homer,no.
19712,Homer,"well, at least i liked it. didn't i?"
31074,Homer,"marge, i realize you've made up your mind, and i want you to know that i deeply respect your boo!"
19872,Homer,won't.
30425,Homer,"wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!"
25593,Homer,"i mean i knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez."
32332,Homer,"an hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. with my free time i can finally work on my ""superman"" novel."
17724,Homer,"yeah, a raise! i've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. but i'm damn good at this one. that's it! i'm gonna march right up to al and say..."
31480,Homer,woo hoo! marital sex!
32555,Homer,"this is great! i'm finally gonna find out how i ruined my family! strap me in, nerd!"
17306,Homer,this is gonna cost me.
31547,Homer,"i didn't say ""stop."""
41559,Homer,i just want a tentacle.
25647,Homer,"linguo, dead!"
39407,Homer,privately?
30459,Homer,"yeah, sure. whatever you want. ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
41520,Homer,"marge, i need both hands for this game. can you feed me nachos while i play?"
32448,Homer,"you guys gotta help me! if marge leaves i'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make."
18081,Homer,"aw, thanks, honey."
33418,Homer,i guess that would be nice.
27156,Homer,they're gonna be in the same class as each other?
33881,Homer,"stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more / by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis... uh, to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow... today's tuesday, so that would make it friday, and then, uh... shakespeare!"
29362,Homer,"hey, just 'cause i'm not working doesn't mean i can't gripe like you guys. don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?"
16819,Homer,can't talk... see flanders... later sex.
30958,Homer,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
28213,Homer,i wish! look at this headline.
20069,Homer,"you've really done it this time, bart! you're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
27522,Homer,"look, this church is our only option. don't you kids want to live here?"
32375,Homer,"don't worry, son -- i've got a plan to save your space doggy."
25287,Homer,"so barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and i'm like ""not even."""
23207,Homer,some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
33505,Homer,"ew, that's gross."
17843,Homer,"oh, yeah, this is the life. boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in orlando, florida?"
39728,Homer,yeah? why you little...
20886,Homer,"you too, bart."
31650,Homer,"oh, i can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson."
25329,Homer,did you hear that? she said we're goin' down!
26836,Homer,"oh fine, i'll go back to the beginning."
24148,Homer,here you go. knock yourself out.
21236,Homer,"ow! oh, bono! help me!"
27399,Homer,i look just like elvis!
32413,Homer,"oh marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?"
31398,Homer,no one makes my daughter sob and run.
31858,Homer,lisa's mad at me and marge is mad at him.
20030,Homer,wow.
24855,Homer,"ooh, a dancing jesus. de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. if there's a better use for the internet, i haven't found it."
14198,Homer,"wow, what an ending? who'd have thought darth vader was luke skywalker's father."
24181,Homer,"look, the point is, i want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. what you need's a little razzle dazzle. qtoktok, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
40363,Homer,"no, not you. i'm talking to the boy. keep your head down. follow through..."
21982,Homer,"relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. enjoy your day at the beach! ooh, look."
18330,Homer,"oh, there's so much i don't know about astrophysics. i wish i'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
34392,Homer,he's going for the record! he's going for the record!
23915,Homer,now i'm ready to hit the town.
23403,Homer,the sun? that's the hottest place on earth!
39239,Homer,gimme that!
21018,Homer,"gee, thanks guys. this is just like ""the deer hunter."""
32315,Homer,thanks to her!
32711,Homer,i'll bet no man would touch you.
27649,Homer,me too.
28707,Homer,"all right, we're back to square one. put on some coffee."

19648,Homer,eww.

32751,Homer,flanders! you ate my jerky!
26463,Homer,who told you?!
35751,Homer,"but the trolls were the best part! do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""

17192,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. love isn't hopeless. look, maybe i'm no expert on the subject. but there was one time i got it right..."
17196,Homer,sure.

29614,Homer,"hm. well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. what's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
23526,Homer,take it!
23856,Homer,i'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
19993,Homer,now that's religion.
39700,Homer,catch it! catch it!
38743,Homer,"that sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music."
26967,Homer,what the...? it made another me! how cool is that?
28168,Homer,what? it's not... my hand! what's happening?
37784,Homer,"goodbye, homer junior. i guess you're the man of the house now. and never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
16884,Homer,"now i've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."

13297,Homer,"bart didn't get one vote?! oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. what are you so mopey about?"
28954,Homer,"okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my lois lane comics, buy some jimmy olsens, and stop edna from making a terrible mistake!"
20759,Homer,it took me years to forge that groove.
36105,Homer,onnnnnnneee...
39443,Homer,gotcha!
16656,Homer,this shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
32986,Homer,and you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
28092,Homer,"look at me, i'm brian epstein!"
39885,Homer,"oh, she's just jealous. she'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her."
24464,Homer,"i didn't think, i just acted."

35777,Homer,"i am really enjoying this, but, um... hello! meeting with the mayor?"
22746,Homer,woo hoo!

30464,Homer,"hello, domino's? what do you mean, you're not open? no, you call me back during business hours! i'll show you who's a recorded message!"
16404,Homer,it's better to be safe than sorry. sorry.

36749,Homer,"i'm in an abusive relationship with life. it keeps beating the hell out of me, and i'm too cowardly to leave it. maybe i could drink myself to death."
27830,Homer,the only dangerous amount is none!
17277,Homer,"television! teacher, mother, secret lover."
32499,Homer,more ribs for me?
24098,Homer,"oh, wake up, ned. you think maude isn't dating in heaven?"
13723,Homer,"hello, jerry? homer simpson. remember last month, when i paid back that loan? well, now i need you to do a favor for me."
20055,Homer,i'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
38982,Homer,"bye, bart. stay ten forever."
28212,Homer,"marge, wake up! the newspaper is talking to me!"
29976,Homer,fifty dollars? what about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
20676,Homer,the hell it is!
38137,Homer,kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
28502,Homer,"gorgeous, huh? and quite the bargain."
26091,Homer,"hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! well i can fantasize too."
32919,Homer,"to spare, eh?"
34616,Homer,cartoons! everybody be quiet!
16257,Homer,"marge, i know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. that's why i had the fireman write me a note."
20065,Homer,i want candy!
23792,Homer,you missed all the fun.
27620,Homer,you monster! why did you expel boogerman?
30139,Homer,she'll be fine here under the watchful eye of grandma shark week.
33131,Homer,this is all going so fast.
18507,Homer,relax. what is mind? no matter. what is matter? never mind.
23188,Homer,"okay, that's it. let's get ready to meet our public."
29337,Homer,"all right. but while i'm gone, boy, you think about what you did."
16991,Homer,"jump, free willy, jump! jump with all your might!"
20406,Homer,"ahh, you got lucky, flanders! and fix that hat!"
31510,Homer,"you're getting a cab, old man. in fact, i believe i see it now."
28085,Homer,"now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to marge!"
26014,Homer,suckers!
19097,Homer,"oh yeah, that's right. let's watch this."
39950,Homer,"hey, turn it up. i love hearing those whack-os."
33356,Homer,"hey, vance?"
39393,Homer,"kill myself? killing myself is the last thing i'd ever do. now i have a purpose, a reason to live. i don't care who i have to face. i don't care who i have to fight. i will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."
16816,Homer,"aw, uncle homer. ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, i want you to get to know my family."
31631,Homer,"oh, right -- revenge!!"
25906,Homer,why not? kids are very visual these days.
30895,Homer,"yeah, that's how i feel about notre dame football."
13368,Homer,they're holding it at catfish lake. they couldn't call it catfish lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
41062,Homer,here's your magazines. how many of these guys are named corey?
14339,Homer,"okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
30881,Homer,are you kidding? take a look at my dvd.
38409,Homer,question. it says here the murderer is admiral wainsworth. who's that?
19422,Homer,"hmmm. a bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. heh, heh, heh."
22531,Homer,oh no you don't!
20305,Homer,i don't know.
34633,Homer,"marge, this is crazy!"
20210,Homer,you do that.
33062,Homer,"oh, you look great."
30420,Homer,of course i do. the only thing i can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
19073,Homer,"i suppose you'll want to probe me. well, might as well get it over with."
39707,Homer,it's good! it's good! it's good!
22117,Homer,"kids, i don't want you drinking any more milk. ever."
23559,Homer,practice ball! practice ball!
40158,Homer,hey! get a load of that spread.
15403,Homer,"patience, my pet."
31386,Homer,"ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?"
29547,Homer,"uh... uh... oh man, i have no idea what i'm going."
34600,Homer,"hey boy, whatcha doing?"
24575,Homer,"oh, that's all you got? huh? huh?"
15082,Homer,that's good.
35709,Homer,now that's my kind of foam.
32501,Homer,"next time a commercial comes on, i'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as i can."
39867,Homer,"oh, hello principal skinner. i'd get up but the boy crippled me."
18796,Homer,mr. burns?
34807,Homer,have you seen these kids?
41118,Homer,"yes, i do."
31871,Homer,"i hate shopping. i'm bored, my feet hurt, i'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
22620,Homer,"hey, this is pretty comfortable. that andy capp was onto something."
26262,Homer,"well, well. if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
27062,Homer,lousy family...
39803,Homer,"sorry, buddy. you got me confused with fred flintstone."
24227,Homer,"oh, you dear, dear man. you're one of us beautiful people now. and your new life begins today."
30857,Homer,oh my god!
40899,Homer,"oh, sure, sure. be my guest."
26256,Homer,wait a minute.
16112,Homer,absolutely. now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
32510,Homer,i don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
38441,Homer,"marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, i will. i've mapped it out."
24131,Homer,the hooligans!
25396,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
18324,Homer,"ow! watch it, coney."
28671,Homer,"ooh, typed!"
27363,Homer,"oh, what have i done? children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
33370,Homer,the ballot box?!
35759,Homer,you switched the drives?
24197,Homer,"oh, my god."
14842,Homer,i'll take it.
15110,Homer,spare my family. take me. take me!
29306,Homer,"and lisa, what have you learned?"
30911,Homer,"god, we have fun."
31252,Homer,"look, i'm sorry you're upset. but if we tell the truth now, i'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. then you won't be married to a man. you'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the florida keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. you don't want that."
41214,Homer,oooh.
34866,Homer,where's the other girder?
33801,Homer,but that makes no sense!
32403,Homer,"because if i do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
26624,Homer,"but isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"
13969,Homer,"okay, i will. i will."
35715,Homer,"all right, you can each have one toy."
28686,Homer,"well, then maybe i will."
15991,Homer,but we were about to learn an iron law of show business: what goes up must come down.
13763,Homer,"ooh, a side."
23260,Homer,ooo... pointless nostalgia.
32349,Homer,"out of my way, mystery skank!"
17670,Homer,"woo hoo! this is it! with this single glorious check, i'm finally completely out of debt."
22081,Homer,are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? it's full of nerds.
32126,Homer,how many of those have private planes?
33334,Homer,"oh, i get it. here's ten bucks."
37229,Homer,"you grandson-ruining fiend! look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
38303,Homer,"nope. now, how's that drink? can i temple up that shirley?"
28133,Homer,"yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. she--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
13997,Homer,i'm also fat!
34489,Homer,aw dang! i lost track of time! i'm gonna be late for work.
41174,Homer,marge! i'm two-thirty-nine and i'm feeling fine! look! i'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
40298,Homer,"sorry, honey. i'm just a little nervous."
35314,Homer,y'see? you see how that boy pushes your buttons?
35433,Homer,or maybe i just found them on the ground.
20192,Homer,brilliant! i have absolutely no idea what's going on.
23975,Homer,good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.
33090,Homer,"c'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it."
19806,Homer,i've been tenderized.
16179,Homer,"maggie, i know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!"
24003,Homer,good horse. here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
31678,Homer,"thanks, boy. hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while i sing public domain songs out the window?"
24768,Homer,"get him, sheeba!"
36068,Homer,do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
28673,Homer,two hundred and eighty-six pages!
25438,Homer,...thank you for coming. the proof that the isotopes are moving to albuquerque is right behind this door.
20628,Homer,"oh. oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap."
36348,Homer,"i'm sorry, sweetie. it's just a strandie discussion group. yes it is! we discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
28643,Homer,i had a car!
23713,Homer,"you can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the cobras."
15063,Homer,"is that lisa? ooh, i gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!"
23956,Homer,"oh, bless you!"
40725,Homer,she's right! she's right!
16841,Homer,"humph, your car. boy, what are the odds, huh?"
18733,Homer,"you su-diddily-uck, flanders! gimme that!"
24305,Homer,"well, forget it, guys. i am not barney!"
36537,Homer,"boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!"
41242,Homer,wait a minute. is he coming on to me?
38855,Homer,come on! start this thing! i'm not impressed.
36870,Homer,"parenting? let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! it's nature's way!"
31249,Homer,"of course i can make a credenza, whatever that is. just give all the details to my secretary shirley."
31320,Homer,i'm proud of what i achieved during my rioting.
13536,Homer,"lisa, you like homework. could you fill out this form for me?"
18222,Homer,"ow! help me. why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
20226,Homer,oooh.
16944,Homer,"woo hoo! we're rich! bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. we want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
15902,Homer,just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. like that day i hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. remember that?
29833,Homer,"oh, right. separated."
24728,Homer,"so, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?"
16534,Homer,"hello, floreeda."
13875,Homer,no.
33049,Homer,"is that him? no, it's just a bush. clearly the work of wirakocha, the trickster god."
18705,Homer,he got to the green in one shot?!
21095,Homer,"shutup! shutup! if i don't hear you, it's not illegal. okay, i need some deductions! deductions! ah! business gifts!"
38573,Homer,the bed is lifting me! the elevator at work can't even do that! i demand you put me down right after the sex!
22260,Homer,"hello, little birdie."
31943,Homer,did i say any moment?
20346,Homer,"hey, it's a handgun! isn't it great? this is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
15781,Homer,i'm gonna resign. i don't know why they made me union president in the first place.
16696,Homer,really?
33666,Homer,"that's ridiculous. who's your daddy, maggie? who's your daddy?"
39956,Homer,"what? hey, barney, am i a pig?"
19681,Homer,you've changed me as well. i'm no longer the money-driven workaholic i once was.
39593,Homer,ha ha! i got you. don't try that. i got ya. i'll block you. and the crowd is on its feet as hurricane homer moves in for the kill.
32010,Homer,"hello, officer!"
24594,Homer,get it.
29233,Homer,i say when we're full. you don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
28938,Homer,unkink the hose!
20874,Homer,"yes! yes! oh, god yes!"
14448,Homer,good bye? where's my clean underwear?
39130,Homer,plant-watering guy.
16012,Homer,"is that so? oh, flan-ders! won't you join me in my kitchen?"
31987,Homer,"""to my wife marge -- in case i don't make it, here are my oscar picks for next year: best sound effects editing, the team from--"""
39840,Homer,"you see, i'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
24549,Homer,"st. peter! woo hoo! got to heaven before you, flanders!"
19696,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin'-- i don't sound like that, do i? oh, i don't like having such a hilarious voice."
32872,Homer,it's a medical condition!
26809,Homer,now go to bed!
38788,Homer,maybe a drink will help me with my driving.
37009,Homer,no! i want to help the people who didn't prepare!
40513,Homer,"because you said so, why?"
34908,Homer,you said nobody gets hurt. those were your exact words!
35164,Homer,"you got your wish, boy. i'm proud of ya. i'm sorry i took all the credit."
32467,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
34788,Homer,this proves nothing. roger could've been the one that killed them!
34396,Homer,if you say it like dracula i will.
30686,Homer,no... i said i work for a radio station. nine-eighty on the am dial but number one with our viewers!
16396,Homer,ohh... what does it matter? we're doomed!
37283,Homer,"okay! i'll pay for your damn band candy! what was it, seventeen hundred dollars?"
32997,Homer,evidence that i love my little girl.
37374,Homer,just looking for the bathroom.
19717,Homer,no i am not.
39324,Homer,oh.
21007,Homer,"you know lisa, i've taken a lot from this country. maybe it's time i gave something back."
31002,Homer,my keys!
36506,Homer,what's goin' on?
14795,Homer,what the...
24476,Homer,remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
14447,Homer,see? got her on the first bounce.
23813,Homer,oh yeah. you were way off.
20215,Homer,unless what?
21064,Homer,"damage report, mr. moe."
14603,Homer,hmm...
15302,Homer,i'm gonna lose my plow.
28612,Homer,"well, i've been busy, son. they really need me over at the nuclear plank."
15433,Homer,whew! i was afraid it was my transmission.
30128,Homer,superman did it.
38156,Homer,i don't know what you're talking about. hide the treasure!
32336,Homer,"chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!"
13893,Homer,mm.
19348,Homer,"i didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on tv. this one is for real. i want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like kirk and luann."
14768,Homer,billy beer!
38068,Homer,fine! but the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
15210,Homer,"it's in there. look, marge we just don't need the money that bad."
23714,Homer,oink! oink! oink!
23040,Homer,go on...
19761,Homer,no.
18404,Homer,"hey, miss doesn't-find-me-attractive sexually-anymore. i just tripled my productivity."
30364,Homer,"marge, we owe her the truth!"
40733,Homer,"hey, don't worry barney. it's a big school. there's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
23452,Homer,you little scamp.
29884,Homer,ray would high-five me.
36896,Homer,"well, if i've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore."
32310,Homer,we're free!
36329,Homer,what a great opening episode. and i'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
27057,Homer,"all right, time for my favorite show."
19873,Homer,"hey, boy, get crackin'! moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
40580,Homer,"moe, i wish he'd shut up."
26298,Homer,"that's it, we're outta here."
25374,Homer,"yeah, that's the look."
22132,Homer,"all right, fine. i'll take a cab."
25332,Homer,"comin' through... hey, hi otto... sorry..."
15922,Homer,"look, marge, i'll just talk to apu and i'm sure he'll be reasonable."
35868,Homer,"i love you, dad."
36204,Homer,"exactly like chandler, always criticizing."
16957,Homer,you idiot! he was the most talented one!
27814,Homer,can't help you -- all i got is gray. anybody working on a cement wall?
34315,Homer,i say this boy needs more homework.
15255,Homer,"but the sign said ""all you can eat."""
26240,Homer,you're a cinch to be world's fattest man.
18106,Homer,"i have nothing more to say to you, marge. i'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""i love lucy"" -- you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side."
23604,Homer,it's a glandular problemmmm!
19523,Homer,"yes. remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
40346,Homer,wait! wait! there's more...
40349,Homer,"too bad we don't live on a farm. let's go, boy."
35073,Homer,"son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work."
26841,Homer,lousy community service. meals on wheels! eat it up or i go to jail!
18645,Homer,i guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. heh heh heh.
14249,Homer,i quit! i quit!
37356,Homer,really? you wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
20732,Homer,"buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world."
25411,Homer,"oh, how clumsy of me? and..."
25542,Homer,where? over there?
23858,Homer,"oh, this is gonna be so great."
26961,Homer,now to spend some quality time away from my family.
27848,Homer,"it is to me! marge, i can't live like this! i'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
17395,Homer,"well lisa, remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
21985,Homer,wooo!!
15604,Homer,bart?... bart!
28155,Homer,"or worse, am i right?"
40583,Homer,"no, no, no. you think this is about money? well, it's not. it's worse, marge. i'm afraid that from now on when i look at you, i'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. i'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
32014,Homer,"i had to fight! lenny said his dad is hulk hogan, and i know he's not!"
31250,Homer,that shirley is quite a gal. we should fix her up with barney.
38400,Homer,"okay, sweetie, i'll call the van houtens."
39204,Homer,how many grades does this school have?
37150,Homer,and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year.
30918,Homer,you're a useless old man! name one thing you do for this family.
35652,Homer,little help?
21213,Homer,hey! woo-hoo! i won!
18926,Homer,"you know what, apu... i am really, really gonna miss you."
27916,Homer,"hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?"
36540,Homer,"i hope you enjoyed the show tonight. and if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of."
21792,Homer,"okay, fine. but i could do all kinds of stuff for you. i noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
31436,Homer,let me just put on some romantic music.
20864,Homer,"well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
30358,Homer,"now marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
17617,Homer,"oh, yeah. beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, aa meetings, beer night. it's wonderful, marge. i've never felt so accepted in all my life. these people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which i joined."
13799,Homer,"yeah, krusty, tell us."
37851,Homer,"marge, to that i say boo, humbug."
28802,Homer,okay. you have the right to remain sexy. anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. if you cannot afford a sex-torney--
30635,Homer,prego?
32741,Homer,i said secret.
15421,Homer,i hope you never say a word.
39508,Homer,"oooo, do i ever!"
15085,Homer,can i go now?
23910,Homer,nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
22608,Homer,good ol' government.
30968,Homer,"well, i'm just glad i'm not a god anymore. i wanna go home. how's chief wiggum?"
33633,Homer,"marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. i think you're becoming a... bridezilla."
15877,Homer,i see.
31426,Homer,you give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. god bless america!
13375,Homer,catfish lake.
19158,Homer,"well... thanks for everything, hank."
39558,Homer,well... eh... er...eh...
39399,Homer,proud. proud of what?
32472,Homer,you better not make me cry. 'cause i don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
15023,Homer,"well, that's just great."
27411,Homer,"okay, i'm coming right out the door. dammit! these windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
14377,Homer,"moe, twenty-three dollars on new york."
23165,Homer,we'll talk.
18526,Homer,"oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic."
26450,Homer,nice old man. don't break a hip.
23355,Homer,"when i think about ned, i can't help but remember the look on his face when marge drove over..."
22505,Homer,i used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
41388,Homer,"i love you, homer... i love you too, homer... oh, homer."
13971,Homer,"... expiration date: june, 1999... uh, 2012, yeah."
33096,Homer,i love kissing you. i never want to knock it off.
14084,Homer,"i'd rather have a ""flaming homer""."
17622,Homer,what? did i miss something?
37634,Homer,one random disorder free with every schizophrenia.
17756,Homer,all right!
38489,Homer,today's our draft! i've got to pick a good fantasy team! when i lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...

38327,Homer,"yeah, i can die all i want -- frink's got homers like the tuileries has park benches. huh? wonder where i picked that up."
26435,Homer,"no kidding? hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
30697,Homer,woo hoo!
38133,Homer,"you don't have children, do you?"
21518,Homer,woo hoo!
41372,Homer,except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.
26633,Homer,"which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. ever."
20104,Homer,oh. hi.
27675,Homer,"krusty, you've let everyone down. and even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
25427,Homer,"yes, sir."
35584,Homer,"squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. a real spider would get so mad if i did this! i wonder if this thing has batteries."
15542,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
33610,Homer,it was apt.
24946,Homer,wait a minute...
40483,Homer,bart! what are you doing?
15181,Homer,i'll get it son.
25447,Homer,don't worry. duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
18923,Homer,"yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular joes like you and me, apu."
19910,Homer,"marge, mail's here."
33798,Homer,geoffrey chaucer?! what are you doing here?
41089,Homer,"dad, the next time we see you we'll do something more fun."
16364,Homer,uh oh. something's wrong.
33353,Homer,tears of a clown.
23237,Homer,"hey, i had lenny's name on that!"
14601,Homer,"correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
25920,Homer,i admit it.
25027,Homer,huh? but that's impossible.
23520,Homer,"there, there. we had quite a scare today. but you're gonna make us millions. yes you are."
21405,Homer,"nah, i'll just walk it off."
18866,Homer,"hello, i'd like to speak with a mr. snotball? first name, ura?"
18077,Homer,"easy now, sweetheart. homie's here."
19545,Homer,"thank you, son. and do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
29866,Homer,my family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! they'll all be sorry when i invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!
32203,Homer,woo-hoo!
29781,Homer,noooo!
34611,Homer,"well, if you ask me, you were trying to play god."
22179,Homer,"you got that right. throw on the mesquite, bart!"
27268,Homer,perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
22778,Homer,"c'mon, eve. hurry!"
36626,Homer,uh-oh. i don't think i rewound the video the last time i was here.
27329,Homer,disney world?
36197,Homer,"oh, lighten up, marge. i take you to the disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the lost and found. well guess what? we're stayin' in this dream forever!"
41013,Homer,"ugh, oh boy."
13248,Homer,maaarge siiimpson.
17638,Homer,"you know, i think you guys are lettin' me win."
38994,Homer,it is!
13933,Homer,no.
26202,Homer,wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!!
17899,Homer,i'll have to trust you on that.
15711,Homer,i'm trying to knock you out.
28747,Homer,"joke's on me, is it...?"
31770,Homer,"oh, captain janeway! your mission ended too soon! too soon..."
31168,Homer,"marge, we've gotta get buck and tabitha back together. this is the most important case of our careers!"
24631,Homer,damnit!
18717,Homer,our savings?!
23747,Homer,give me back my wife!
23932,Homer,"havin' a party, moe. i'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
15630,Homer,pepi!
36438,Homer,...and lenny's story about cancun.
13964,Homer,oooooh! that's one clean tombstone.
39296,Homer,go! go!
21259,Homer,fifty cents? not likely.
25344,Homer,which one am i? serena or venus?
14057,Homer,could i get a beer?
24950,Homer,"gee, i wish i could, son, but we've already left the gift shop."
32291,Homer,oh my god... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
33273,Homer,i'm in!
38886,Homer,fondue? welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.
24751,Homer,"thanks for the beer, moe. but before lisa died, she made this tape that i think you should hear."
37991,Homer,"glasses, take me two minutes back in time."
18555,Homer,pfft. must have been a pretty slow century.
31253,Homer,he wants to grind his own corn. maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
33070,Homer,"talk louder? you bet. naturally, i threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. but then lenny said ""no, that was the new chair. that memo was two months old!"" so now i'm sitting on an orange crate. i never felt so--"
38241,Homer,i'm listening. and it better be devastating.
29367,Homer,i don't have an inside voice!
28400,Homer,but how will i find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
40859,Homer,whooo!
34431,Homer,"as you wish, but look not upon her with lust. and do not send her friendly emails. that's how it begins."
27517,Homer,can i borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
22630,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't frick and frack, jack and jill, fred and ethel, the three..."
35952,Homer,"yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?"
17645,Homer,"brothers, i've learned a wonderful lesson. helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. so instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
24051,Homer,my bad.
19771,Homer,well it's been two hours. how do you feel?
16551,Homer,"eh, that's no big loss."
13514,Homer,"okay, here's the plan. you can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. and i'll... die in a gutter. it's practical and within our means."
37506,Homer,"and when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. carl carlson leaves them in the fridge."
25636,Homer,i've gotta get to dr. nick's!
38885,Homer,i'd like rabbit. lots of rabbit.
34193,Homer,"c'mon, line, move! maybe it'll speed up if i make ""can you believe this"" noises. oh for goodness sake--"
16226,Homer,super fun happy slide!
34196,Homer,i'm almost there... i can see the church steeple in the distance...
27707,Homer,you know everything about me!
25946,Homer,so... it cost you nothin'.
23157,Homer,... we-shot-last-night...
20493,Homer,"okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um..."
38835,Homer,this party's great. but all i wish is that i was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
24736,Homer,"first comes love, then comes, um... dammit, i know this."
39536,Homer,"you, up in the tree! the tall gray­ haired kid! get your butt down here right now!"
20175,Homer,what a bad father.
41131,Homer,"so, have you figured out who gets the money?"
26866,Homer,"oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. from our point of view. financially."
31091,Homer,and her?
20027,Homer,"... and our beautiful baby. my daughter, lisa -- i.q. 156."
19139,Homer,oh.
36921,Homer,ever!
22029,Homer,now you're just tryin' to scare me.
29850,Homer,exactly.
33687,Homer,"man oh man, slap a ring on that!"
34904,Homer,i mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
38078,Homer,sideshow bob!
15233,Homer,"gonna run out the clock in florida, eh?"
28463,Homer,"duck, mr. lincoln!"
34485,Homer,okay. ever been to moe's?
13208,Homer,no problem.
19299,Homer,"yup, pretty much. except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
35439,Homer,hm. is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? maybe i can find the answer by texting.
31447,Homer,must jettison excess weight!
27835,Homer,yeah.
26191,Homer,"me. / right here. / oh, me too. / please."
15913,Homer,oh my juice loosener's never gonna come.
39560,Homer,thanks for knowing i mean well.
37167,Homer,"marge, can i get a subscription to highlights magazine?"
23151,Homer,they will if you set up that the dog is evil. all you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
16701,Homer,"fine. oh, i mean not good."
39329,Homer,oh.
30539,Homer,are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? i read an email that said there was.
28120,Homer,"boy, that's a big staff. and still he wasn't that funny."
27729,Homer,"mr. burns, i've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency."
26719,Homer,"stupid ""bart-toon""! bart-toon, that's clever. i'm gonna kill him!"
36282,Homer,i have some adjustments to make.
30883,Homer,i'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
15915,Homer,my name is mr. burns.
18419,Homer,"one for ""honk,"" please."
40698,Homer,"come on, barney, i gotta get home."
41418,Homer,"well, i traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich."
23389,Homer,i can still hear his voice on the wind.
18037,Homer,"marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
33008,Homer,"oh, you've gotta try it. this way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. then, bam!"
28064,Homer,"i've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but i never thought i'd hear it from you."
24277,Homer,"that lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!"
21080,Homer,woo hoo!
17905,Homer,you told!
13945,Homer,"marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it."
32680,Homer,wow. this is the kind of car you see in commercials! how much am i paying for this?
17565,Homer,"hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
37787,Homer,"sleep, sleep sleep sleep / sleep sleep / sleep, sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep!"
27685,Homer,"so kids, its valentine's day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching tv with the sound turned way up."
13949,Homer,yes sir.
25911,Homer,ow!
24811,Homer,"i mean, screw you!"
35984,Homer,draw the curtain.
19280,Homer,"uh, this isn't gonna be about jesus, is it?"
40243,Homer,"marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
33816,Homer,i feel like i've died and gone to hell.
15667,Homer,"uh, kind of. nobody makes a big deal out of valentine's day."
24514,Homer,why did i take such punishment? let's just say that fame was like a drug. but what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
27019,Homer,fine.
21146,Homer,but i can't leave the country! what about my wife and kids?
31577,Homer,"uh... sure we will, son. right, captain?"
16488,Homer,"yeah, yeah."
13202,Homer,but you let in homer glumplet.
28534,Homer,"get back to your bong, hippie."
24943,Homer,truly god's country.
36405,Homer,"...and now because it's afternoon, i can go to moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
19336,Homer,that's your advice?! go to bed!
28779,Homer,"well, marge, you can't say i never take you anywhere."
18111,Homer,"hey herman, i had to come out here to see what's so funny - a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! i'm gonna tell everyone! wait here."
41447,Homer,"eh, i think that's all of 'em."
32220,Homer,"and may i say i'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
23909,Homer,"well, that was a great night for us all."
40134,Homer,probably just the house settling.
31917,Homer,"what a wonderful night's sleep. thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as nappien."
16851,Homer,"stop it! stop it! stop it! how dare you talk about ned flanders like that! he's a wonderful, kind, caring man. maybe even more so than me. there have been times when i've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. but this man has turned every cheek on his body. if everyone here were like ned flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. we'd already be there."
26282,Homer,has everyone keistered their personal supply?
40673,Homer,huh uh.
33414,Homer,"oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce."
41252,Homer,think unsexy thoughts. think unsexy thoughts! think unsexy thoughts!
27973,Homer,"kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog."
28125,Homer,woo-hoo! pedal to the metal!
20422,Homer,wipe that smile off your face.
27067,Homer,where are you taking me?
34343,Homer,bart? bart who? i'm being cute.
19189,Homer,all right... ready... wait a minute... all right... wait a minute... just a sec...
28774,Homer,hit the red button!
25784,Homer,now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.
37744,Homer,"everything will be fine... um... oh you, uh, you like movies? this reminds me of that scene in ""alien."""
18843,Homer,"hey, look what i snagged, marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake."
29768,Homer,that was my woodstock!
36836,Homer,"really? i'm... ...cool? oh, can i man-hug you?"
17476,Homer,out.
15670,Homer,perhaps this might be appropriate.
39445,Homer,is it used?
29319,Homer,huh? huh?
27807,Homer,night... glorious night...
24201,Homer,"well, i may not know much about god, but i have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for him."
16951,Homer,that was the end piece. that's it! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. go to your room!
30840,Homer,aren't you gonna do something?
40159,Homer,smothered pork chops.
24584,Homer,"it was her, all right. take the one who wronged you."
16122,Homer,i'm gonna lose my job just 'cause i'm dangerously unqualified.
30504,Homer,"yeah, but i know how to win women back. i even won you back after i lost our wedding album in a bar bet."
16543,Homer,"you know, marge, for the first time in our marriage, i can finally look down my nose at you. you have a gambling problem."
41575,Homer,why you little!...
28407,Homer,"lisa, the point of moby dick is ""be yourself."""
23935,Homer,but i need that beer now.
38701,Homer,skunk canyon?
31710,Homer,look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
39427,Homer,mmmm! marshmallow!
36347,Homer,spoil-er!
24341,Homer,"i won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. i love you. let's not lose touch after graduation."
22056,Homer,"h-heyy, let me off this thing."
33001,Homer,i'm not convinced.
31445,Homer,"sorry, i'm all out of ice cream."
15939,Homer,with my...
33007,Homer,done for free
15619,Homer,"hey, boy! where you going?"
14236,Homer,"hey, why don't i apply at the nuclear power plant? i hear they pay pretty well."
28693,Homer,i knew it! and what about the romance between you and cyrus?
25864,Homer,"your honor, if i may sing a little bit of ""don't fear the reaper"", i think you'll agree that..."
17513,Homer,"ooh, my liver hurts."
33895,Homer,ow!
33846,Homer,"cup, m'lady? or would you care to funnel it down thy throat?"
37008,Homer,why do we have to shoot them at all?
22195,Homer,you mean lisa?
27125,Homer,can't you do it?
34187,Homer,"hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--"
18414,Homer,"washing my fat guy hat, honey."
41533,Homer,"okay, all right! time's up!"
22880,Homer,is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
18585,Homer,it's a 7-10 split.
23614,Homer,"lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
33499,Homer,fine. i'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!
22269,Homer,now it doesn't work.
38180,Homer,our cushion!
29703,Homer,awww. she likes my eyes.
22931,Homer,a hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. a hundred and thirty-five springs...
33242,Homer,"here's the plan, marge. you keep 'em talking. i'll be listening... and quietly judging."
32758,Homer,you're on your own.
34745,Homer,can you tell me when this is gonna be on? i'm thinking of having a party.
24054,Homer,"that's a damn lie, and you know it! gimme a shirt!"
27671,Homer,"it's just an expression, marge."
38345,Homer,body. to moe's.
36157,Homer,"hey, it's called ""karma."""
31642,Homer,or my wife!
22122,Homer,"oh my god, i killed the mayor. all right, stay calm. i'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""weekend at bernie's,"" and..."
30316,Homer,"rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! please, no rubes..."
36173,Homer,free? uh...
26297,Homer,everyone here has a six pack and i'm the only one with a keg.

35386,Homer,"well, i open a lot of crazy things when i'm drunk, but i don't think so."
17644,Homer,"brothers, brothers."
28825,Homer,"aw, it's no use, son. by the time i get out of here you'll be grown. turn around / turn around / turn around and you're a young man / and you're too big to choke."
18348,Homer,hello.
13872,Homer,number four and a half reed! whoo hoo!
21078,Homer,uhhh... it's my first day!
14302,Homer,there's only one can of beer left and it's bart's.

33640,Homer,i miss you so much.
36073,Homer,someone's downstairs!
28777,Homer,"marge, i've always loved you. bart, you were a worthy foe."
31605,Homer,i swear revenge on meaux! even if it takes me the rest of my life! can you loosen my arm so i can shake my fist?
13590,Homer,"stupid junk mail... ""you may have already won!"" yeah, win this... ""here's good news for homer simpsoy""... i'll see that he gets it. how dumb do they think i am?"

30882,Homer,they'll never let me near lake havasu again.
19114,Homer,yeah.
17643,Homer,couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
13477,Homer,"good. ""you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
31143,Homer,"now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till i say so."
15493,Homer,bed goes up. bed goes down...
27549,Homer,now he's got it.
16386,Homer,please not flanders. please not flanders. please not flanders.
36707,Homer,"i am turning my back, because i can't stand to look you in the face."
16457,Homer,then we're all happy.
28950,Homer,"string quartet, are you tuned up?"
22008,Homer,can't stop now. we're making great time.
15886,Homer,marge! i passed!
34380,Homer,"yeah, now that i look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
34216,Homer,oops -- the frisbee went into the bushes. why don't you go find it?
15560,Homer,i'm not pouting. i'm... mourning. stupid dead woman.
40930,Homer,"but if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?"
28174,Homer,"pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... take an dirt nap. feed the worms..."
40289,Homer,"that's right, ned."
25499,Homer,she will be.
18602,Homer,"aw, marge, we were so close to winning the championship. now thanks to burns it's never gonna happen. and i spent so much time building that trophy case."
13826,Homer,"ok, ok. i'll make a wish that can't backfire. i wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and...and! i don't want any zombie turkeys, i don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and i don't want any other weird surprises. you got it?"
35402,Homer,excuse me.
26956,Homer,"yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. and if you kill him, someone'll take his place. and that's pretty much the end of it. the town'll be yours."
14093,Homer,"ah, my new watering hole."
22926,Homer,but you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow! ta-daa!
23291,Homer,"there's the coffee mug from ""heartbeeps""!"
27159,Homer,"hey, you can't fool us. we're from the ""learn to fart"" state."
17498,Homer,"ah, come on, everybody. this bar is like a tavern to me."
39870,Homer,"sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months."
28559,Homer,you can't change the rules in the middle of the game! we never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. promises were made!
13283,Homer,"wow, this is soft..."
24362,Homer,according to this you're both idiots.
40691,Homer,"hey, barney, look. it was on my list, along with a lot of other things i didn't get to do today. hey, my boss!"
31101,Homer,woo-hoo! weapons!

41168,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
36846,Homer,"boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. it's not gonna win me back."
13200,Homer,int. lakeside mansion - kitchen - present
27804,Homer,i'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.
28599,Homer,i could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. why was i born a dad?
26816,Homer,against my wishes!
30234,Homer,c'mon broncos... you can do it...
18748,Homer,but you have proof! we could go get that confession out of jebediah's fife.
31524,Homer,yes we are.
18966,Homer,"hi there! been a while since i set foot in good vibrations music. where can i find the latest releases by ""bread?"""
39701,Homer,all right!
34134,Homer,"what the?! well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
40963,Homer,"oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. please..."
37108,Homer,"i've got a bone to pick with you! then, an apology to make. then, we exchange insurance information. then, more bone picking!"
24683,Homer,this watermelon won't know what hit it.
21563,Homer,"i've wasted half my life, marge. do you know how many memories i have? three! standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. thirty-eight years and that's all i have to show for it."
35265,Homer,"marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. has the joker taught you nothing?"
34576,Homer,shark week just got cancelled.
33649,Homer,just see that my fiancée marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
23104,Homer,"hello, i, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos."
25405,Homer,come on! why won't you go out with bart?
21081,Homer,"you can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."""
26055,Homer,stop that dog! it has my gum!
36583,Homer,cinnamon!
27001,Homer,"hey, so are the grammy judges. --"
27311,Homer,you saved my life!

38747,Homer,cover...
19224,Homer,so lazy.
14491,Homer,"marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
21657,Homer,that's my tommy.
34308,Homer,about virgil.
35672,Homer,"i don't want to think about food, i want to like it. why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different krustyburgers we can see from our house?"
34026,Homer,yeah!
27802,Homer,it's this new anti-crime dealie. the mayor turned the streetlights way up. my daughter lisa feels really strongly about it.
25673,Homer,"say bye, mr. flanders."
39611,Homer,no.
29202,Homer,what kind of bread?
38665,Homer,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? you bet i'd like one..."""
40409,Homer,"halftime, marge, halftime."
19501,Homer,omigod! the ship!
23485,Homer,shut up and kiss me.
36466,Homer,"why you little... they're both bad, and i suspect you know it!"
26807,Homer,flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex!
19288,Homer,"sure, we could tear this house down..."
14070,Homer,"moe, i haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
31614,Homer,i wonder how long this tunnel...
16150,Homer,"i think i'm so big. blah, blah, blah."
20314,Homer,"relax, marge. if someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
40992,Homer,what's to know? just dive in. catch!
18464,Homer,"hey, everybody, i've got a big surprise for you! presenting: my mother!"
18971,Homer,why do you need new bands? everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. it's a scientific fact.
27939,Homer,that's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
15211,Homer,marge have you seen my lunch box?
34341,Homer,must apologize. must apologize.
30525,Homer,son-of-a... questions? comments?
31883,Homer,"marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago."
26087,Homer,"oh, i know."
39610,Homer,you do?
24882,Homer,i love spying.
13456,Homer,"aw, old man burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some double-o-negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
33961,Homer,woo hoo! there's no better violence than self-inflicted violence!
24959,Homer,"i know, but which one?"
41437,Homer,"you're right marge, i could never leave you. not even for you. if there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much."
21333,Homer,"okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine..."
34221,Homer,"and now, marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. i'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
32591,Homer,"don't worry honey, i'll get you an ice pack. where's the ice pack?"
28225,Homer,"give me a hug, you."
13871,Homer,number four and a half -- stupid gum!
37711,Homer,"mmm, melon collie."
21125,Homer,"but mr. burns gave me my job. and he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one china syndrome. i can't betray him."
34747,Homer,"sorry, marge. the last time i stepped on a baseball field, i got tased."
15968,Homer,there was nothing in al capone's vault / but it wasn't geraldo's fault --
32566,Homer,"well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old homer."
20839,Homer,"water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice..."
40983,Homer,"that's okay, carry on. see the way i handled that, marge?"
17409,Homer,"awww, crap!"
30945,Homer,"oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk..."
18329,Homer,"help me! are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
37450,Homer,"and i'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. no one knows why."
18530,Homer,i'll take care of this.
17807,Homer,i am not krusty.
28952,Homer,and a one and a two and a...
29549,Homer,a church! maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.
38452,Homer,come on. let's go. i can't stand to see my family unhappy on america's holiest day.
40715,Homer,"i'm alive! i'm alive. and i couldn't be happier. from this day forward, i vow to live life to its fullest!"
38755,Homer,"guys, i really need your honesty here. at the squidport senior jamboree... was i too in the pocket?"
15937,Homer,i'll figure it out. i'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
17678,Homer,that's for employing me for eight years! ha ha.
39829,Homer,"well... uh... wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir."
29726,Homer,"don't worry. if i croak, you'll marry lenny. or moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game i invented. i got all the rules written down... up here."
37981,Homer,the rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
24688,Homer,"i said, it's... ohhh..."
24407,Homer,let's go!
28933,Homer,"don't worry, i've got a man on the perimeter."
21535,Homer,"wait a minute. the boy's right! i can't quit now. aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. emu farm... you're priceless, marge."
30961,Homer,"hmmm, let's see. you got the elephant man, johnny six-arms, papa smurf... these guys are pretty cool. maybe i am one of them. if only i had some kind of proof."
23820,Homer,jesus?
19922,Homer,who?
33926,Homer,"this life is the greatest. i get paid a fortune, i've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and i get to hire my friends."
37237,Homer,a little cream?
28708,Homer,i was so close.
13483,Homer,hmmm...
17117,Homer,"all right, everybody in the pool!"
31933,Homer,zombie montage:
13874,Homer,no.
23200,Homer,"hey, that looks like bart."
37875,Homer,"where are my keys? oh, right here."
18318,Homer,but i seem to be trapped in here.
19106,Homer,wow! my boss!
36715,Homer,in my business i try not be seen. i'm scary good at it.
18475,Homer,then why did she leave me?
36869,Homer,shut up with your names!
31712,Homer,"okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!"
37419,Homer,is it that obvious?
37586,Homer,and do you love lasagna... like me?
40776,Homer,"well, what's the good word?"
16855,Homer,"get lost, flanders."
14370,Homer,you bet.
22265,Homer,especially me.
17534,Homer,"lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
31071,Homer,oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
18487,Homer,thanks.
37213,Homer,no fatties!
17927,Homer,"well, i..."
26273,Homer,cool. should i take off my shoes?
34535,Homer,"yup, i al-gored it pretty good. where's my grammy for audio book narration?"
38116,Homer,"young lady, in my day..."
15382,Homer,it on a crooked '50's game show!
25644,Homer,"well, old friend, we always knew this day would come."
39045,Homer,i don't want to be with you anymore.
18205,Homer,"i love you, cletus!"
19570,Homer,ow! oh! call work and tell 'em i won't be in tomorrow.
16262,Homer,"what the... oh, i don't know... a little show called ""doctor quinn, medicine woman""?!"
40484,Homer,"you were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
39799,Homer,"ooh, look at him squirm."
39035,Homer,does that drone do date nights with the wife?
19017,Homer,"die? well, you don't scare me, doc. 'cause dying would be a stone groove. got any messages for jimi hendrix?"
23572,Homer,you've got a father. he's just a dud.
37516,Homer,i'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
14939,Homer,i mean it made me feel bad. the poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. at least that's what i thought. i have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
16536,Homer,marge! where are you?! damn this casino! damn this casino!
31437,Homer,"hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down."
34328,Homer,oh yeah? well .
35808,Homer,"mr. burns, i can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?"
40722,Homer,how's this?
34096,Homer,do i smell tarragon-crusted atlantic salmon?
29590,Homer,what shirt? i don't see any shirt.
36434,Homer,"well, i better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy."
35052,Homer,"check out my tolerance, marge. i'm going to use the men's room."
27882,Homer,"all right, all right."
37865,Homer,i thought they were just gonna watch me.
17532,Homer,not everybody.
37785,Homer,exactly. you always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
21687,Homer,sure it didn't.
29421,Homer,"i could just wear gloves. nah, they're upstairs."
15599,Homer,"what'd ya say, marge?"
35601,Homer,language.
27313,Homer,we're up so high. where could that shot have come from?
38801,Homer,maybe marge would forgive me if i won the lotto. give me a scratcher.
32698,Homer,"that wasn't us, that was the transmission."
15534,Homer,what if i talk like this?
22819,Homer,"well, of course. any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. it teaches them while they learn."
16603,Homer,hey!
37463,Homer,"i know, me too. it's the ultimate screw-over."
26873,Homer,i'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
23270,Homer,"we don't need no stinkin' ""e"". restaurant review... no. eatery evaluation... no. food box... go or no go? by homer... no. earl. no. bill simpson!"
14646,Homer,or... to put it another way... there is.
25349,Homer,sucker.
30118,Homer,i could.
36639,Homer,another thing that would be harder with four kids.
21873,Homer,good. good.
24523,Homer,who are you! i'll get you!
38923,Homer,"the circus? hmmm, i haven't been to the circus since i was a kid."
13649,Homer,"don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. marge simpson... president of the international we love flanders fan club..."
15462,Homer,must... sign... policy...
39679,Homer,praise the grizzles son.
39149,Homer,all gone. but in their place we have five hundred channels of television. all awesome. sit down and i'll show you.
36198,Homer,whee! i'm in me! / oh! / i love the down parts! here comes!
32750,Homer,this can only mean one thing.
22691,Homer,lousy drunks. i'll show them.
19953,Homer,it's all right. i understand. but we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
16217,Homer,sure did.
28921,Homer,"i'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. we're all out of triple a's, so i'm gonna whittle down a couple of these d's."
32838,Homer,"since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. what childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
22716,Homer,"relax, boy. we're ahead of schedule."
17583,Homer,"you'd better run, egg!"
33564,Homer,cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
14607,Homer,i've got so many tickets i can't lose!
28566,Homer,"you just leave everything to homer. and now, i believe you owe me half a sandwich."
41124,Homer,dad! noooooooooo!
37843,Homer,"look, you kill them, i get rid of them. that's always been our deal. but i do have one question: do you want the head?"
14228,Homer,hey! this marriage is gonna last forever.
35244,Homer,who are you?
35369,Homer,"you were right, marge. these people are not for us."
39194,Homer,i knew you had a vise! i knew it!
33460,Homer,no problem.
40823,Homer,who? oh.
35207,Homer,i can't do reefer comedy -- i'm drunk. two different animals.
25886,Homer,i thought i would hate working nights. but it's so peaceful. and there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
41287,Homer,you idiot! mr. fatso is you!
33803,Homer,"whatever happened to ""boo?"""
26561,Homer,i said forget it!
41199,Homer,"but you can tell, right? she looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""why me? what did i do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
22172,Homer,and you are how old?
39470,Homer,it's worse than you think. i just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
33194,Homer,who are you?
23410,Homer,"swim, my pretties."
20186,Homer,bart was feeling mighty blue...
14461,Homer,"heh, heh, heh."
19798,Homer,"attaway, son! you made your old man proud!"
30322,Homer,stupid best friend flanders.
26134,Homer,seems kinda pointless now.
24231,Homer,whatever.
16588,Homer,you're in. here's the sack.
28105,Homer,"marge, you were an excellent peace-time chief. but these times call for men of cruelty."
34298,Homer,"me neither. for once, the simpsons were in management!"
23322,Homer,chewy! that's inspired.
38650,Homer,"okay, so what are you?"
36498,Homer,"lisa, can you come down?"
26499,Homer,"oh yeah, i checked that out when bart was born. i was gonna read to him every day."
29877,Homer,to my new buddy. now all we need is an awesome theme song. whatever plays next on the jukebox.
40654,Homer,"oh, why you little --"
40863,Homer,"pass the pumice, please."
36212,Homer,"no can do, baby."
25856,Homer,"end of the line, boys."
21783,Homer,"well, i am a married man..."
18433,Homer,shut up!
37481,Homer,we did it!
29464,Homer,i had to! or moe's would stay closed forever!
38860,Homer,that's good.
36924,Homer,it doesn't make sense to me!
23943,Homer,"well done, mr. lenny. well done."
37694,Homer,"back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. i picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. we'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
40100,Homer,"bye, karl. i'm gonna miss you."
37793,Homer,"i wanted you all to be happy together, so i brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony."
23432,Homer,"hey, i'm not dead yet."
40504,Homer,"shut up, boy."
34462,Homer,uh listen... can i leave a little early tomorrow? my kid has a thing.
26989,Homer,anybody else?
36114,Homer,"why you little... i'm gonna get... no, homer. you can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. juries hate that. so instead, boy, i want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
21104,Homer,"no, sir. i'm really sorry sir. an older boy told me to do it."
14251,Homer,"i don't know, i don't know --"
38193,Homer,that proves the painting is mine! and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
24992,Homer,"yes, son?"
34446,Homer,woo hoo! i'm drinking my salary!
16392,Homer,"in a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
15022,Homer,"well, the picasso... my collection of classic cars..."
19777,Homer,has the whole world gone insane?
14360,Homer,whoo-hoo!
23030,Homer,"well, let's check the old bank account."
24675,Homer,"oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""pacman fever / a do do do do / it's driving me crazy."" look lisa, daddy's in the who!"
15635,Homer,i just press this button and the door opens like magic.
32327,Homer,i'm gonna make it! i'll be on time for lisa's thing!
27883,Homer,wait a minute... marge likes a little bit of stubble.
15706,Homer,no.
21640,Homer,"i thought i had a great idea, but i must've seen it on this poster."
19003,Homer,"homer simpson, smiling politely. you know, my kids think you're the greatest. and thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future i can't possibly provide."
17001,Homer,ooh.
21600,Homer,yes. thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
34682,Homer,"half an hour to show time, your ugliness."
20243,Homer,stupid frog.
18618,Homer,"uh, spray the boy."
28040,Homer,"thanks, mr. burns. i owe it all to walking."
22004,Homer,"what the heck is this, a tea party? somebody kill somebody!"
35962,Homer,it's not working... but why?
30675,Homer,mason fairbanks...
19905,Homer,mayday! mayday!
25372,Homer,i wanna go home now.
26858,Homer,"marge, i can't say no to a helpless old lady. they put spells on you!"
29062,Homer,i can't sleep. i keep thinking about the pie man.
27820,Homer,looks like you're missing a wife.
31497,Homer,"oh, greystash. greystash! oh, hello, lisa."
26123,Homer,"yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
36366,Homer,worth it to be ri-ight! worth it to be ri-ight!
27128,Homer,"test, test. check, check."
36437,Homer,game six of the 2011 world series...
32215,Homer,my pleasure.
30582,Homer,"marge, i did it! i found a woman to be your new friend! she's waiting in the living room!"
39496,Homer,wait a minute. these mallet things are padded with foam rubber. what's the point?
27568,Homer,i was told this would be televised!
34778,Homer,why do pie makers get all the girls?
13548,Homer,arrghh!
18238,Homer,"quiet, boy. i have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down."
16453,Homer,col. klink! did you ever get my letters?
41164,Homer,"woo-ooo! i'm a work of art! ""last supper"", eat your heart out!"
25659,Homer,"one tower of babel, and build it to heaven."
30639,Homer,"mr. burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties."
24301,Homer,the sugar cookies you speak of. are they real or symbolic?
35613,Homer,"thy will be done, lord vader. please don't hurt me. please."
37032,Homer,"oh god, my back! suckers! my discs are grinding! easy money!"
31810,Homer,and my own medicine!
13928,Homer,need money. need money.
13896,Homer,"excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
25203,Homer,"not ""trash can,"" son. dr. homer's miracle spine-o-cylinder! patent pending."
33083,Homer,no.
22007,Homer,f. murray abraham.
16824,Homer,"ah, for some reason, moe's is always closed on wednesdays."
17009,Homer,"dad, that will never work. if you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
22636,Homer,"hey, you're mad at me. that wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?"
13777,Homer,that four-eyes with the big nose? you don't need friends like that.
36264,Homer,we're the same temperature we've always been.
29848,Homer,much better.
35068,Homer,"marge, not in front of the refrigerator."
21678,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i'll get him. ba-art!"
41222,Homer,don't you get it? you gotta use a reverse psychology.
25059,Homer,"my car, your roof. it's only fair."
24691,Homer,"and now, the grand finale... ""get lisa's jammed tape out of vcr."""
24485,Homer,"don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. to finish off becky. then we'll have mommy back."
28191,Homer,"just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
28300,Homer,"well, we put up a flyer."
15227,Homer,he left his briefcase. hey! it's full of shredded newspapers.
28316,Homer,touch that mini bar and you're dead!
29116,Homer,because somehow you realized i was a good guy after all?
26671,Homer,"as a reminder, marge."
32926,Homer,"hm, what could i make from those two things?"
41519,Homer,"marge, come here."
22513,Homer,"and ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?"
39056,Homer,what are you doing?
33693,Homer,now what?
40129,Homer,wait a minute. let's see what the kids are up to.
17819,Homer,but wait. you can't kill me for being krusty. i'm not him. i'm homer simpson.
33047,Homer,"bart! where are you, boy?! don't worry, i won't strangle you."
16767,Homer,"oh, those golden grahams/ oh, those golden grahams/ crispy crunchy graham cereal brand new breakfast treat."
39352,Homer,"sorry, bart. your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some swedish meatball."
15290,Homer,"mr. president, those young people are about to get a dose of reality."
23987,Homer,i stand by my disappointed groan.
32913,Homer,no...
36079,Homer,"this is the outlands, boy. ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! power on!"
20451,Homer,"good, take this note over to the referee."
33288,Homer,that banner has really paid for itself over the years.
22090,Homer,"oh, how was i supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?"
22810,Homer,stupid lisa.
19335,Homer,"oh, i knew this would happen. our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
18038,Homer,lousy teachers. trying to palm off our kids on us.
16602,Homer,"dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. just stand around and don't steal anything."
39653,Homer,"bart? where are you, bart?"
32435,Homer,"yeah, i haven't decided what kind of new car to get."
25237,Homer,i can't decide. i throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
21737,Homer,"this little piggy went to kwik-e-mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--"
40393,Homer,heh heh... that crazy marmaduke...
39523,Homer,what? and violate the code of the school yard? i'd rather bart died.
39807,Homer,"man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
41565,Homer,"why aren't i happy? i'm the hottest grunge artist on mucous records, weird al is doing a parody of my song..."
15801,Homer,"whew! it's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or i'd have looked quite the fool. an april fool, as it were."
34930,Homer,"aloha'oe / aloha'oe... hurry up, kids! we gotta get to the airport!"
39802,Homer,"one glazed and one scratch-and-win, please."
32668,Homer,"good, 'cause i'm parking at it right now."
15070,Homer,i know.
24639,Homer,"hey, the tv man is talking about us!"
35003,Homer,"oh. well, uh... you wouldn't like it. it's not very good."
34864,Homer,"okay, burnsie, follow the carrot!"
33065,Homer,"lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals..."
28090,Homer,i never knew you were such a beatles fan.
38031,Homer,oh my god... marge needs this. it lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
33452,Homer,"so, plans for the weekend?"
21135,Homer,"no you don't. heh, heh."
28926,Homer,don't worry. your secret's safe with me.
22717,Homer,ten hours?! we gotta roll!
14415,Homer,"i had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and i ruined it."
27863,Homer,"you guys lead a fascinating life. like, why are you reading the new york times? you don't live in new york."
32246,Homer,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
40123,Homer,and... and?! what about loving me?
39969,Homer,"no. i said sampson, not simpson."
41467,Homer,"it was love at first sight, and you ruined it!"
23982,Homer,"no talking! no new crap! ""takin' care of business!"" now!"
30443,Homer,they look a little green.
15198,Homer,wait a minute...
21041,Homer,no!
29952,Homer,and what time? would be a good time to see it?
17105,Homer,"marge, look at me! we've been separated for a day, and i'm as dirty as a frenchman. in another few hours, i'll be dead. i can't afford to lose your trust again."
18719,Homer,poor aunt hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
36042,Homer,"yeah. we're like family to you. i'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
13858,Homer,uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
15933,Homer,woo!
27227,Homer,"marge, i'm still not sure about this."
26345,Homer,"hey marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya."
37042,Homer,...and i wish that mr. teeny gets a banana ... that the isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... i wish that wishing wells worked so i wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things i do ...
20382,Homer,i use it for everything! watch me turn on the tv.
22015,Homer,"excuse me, doctor. i think i know a little something about medicine..."
30044,Homer,flanders?
29284,Homer,good. that'll save us some time. okay... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed?
14290,Homer,"yeah!!! whoa! excellent, marge!"
25161,Homer,who wants lottery tickets?
35062,Homer,someday you'll understand that i'm just being a good dad.
36107,Homer,onnneee.
24598,Homer,"939?! what the hell is that? oh, my life is ruined."
27875,Homer,tennessee williams?! but how did he survive in the world of theater?
41281,Homer,bo-ring.
21845,Homer,"hmmm... she may not be famous, but she's right. those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. i did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... and i've still got a car full of their crap. crap, eh...?"
20780,Homer,uh huh. and how much does it cost?
35692,Homer,fun me... fun me... fun me...
39722,Homer,are you?
36930,Homer,"wait. wait. there's one part of the story even grampa didn't know about: a few months later, i went to rescue bongo..."
36387,Homer,that's what she said!
29839,Homer,there's a dvd player but it doesn't work.
16644,Homer,"oh, something stupid like bart would say. bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. something like that."
28723,Homer,"you don't have to tell me, i was number three. listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?"
33959,Homer,"great. go nuts. but remember, we never had this discussion."
29257,Homer,"there it is, nice and smooth. i'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job."
31830,Homer,do i have to?
22621,Homer,"just pretend it's a tree, honey. or as we say at omnitouch, a progress tree."
31525,Homer,"marge, i have no idea what you were just thinking about. why would you think i did?"
21796,Homer,i can't read.
38578,Homer,"why is it always me? i work twelve hours a week, you know!"
39547,Homer,"all right. hey, hey!"
36022,Homer,"well, your arms are lanky. it's kind of a long trip down there."
37604,Homer,weird thing under a tarp.
27541,Homer,i was going to tell you on my deathbed.
24612,Homer,why you little...
35377,Homer,wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
34880,Homer,way ahead of you.
37966,Homer,what's going on here?
32304,Homer,all is well. goodbye forever.
26749,Homer,hi-yo!
21496,Homer,"no, that was not the thing."
21868,Homer,nuclear power.
27109,Homer,but i like it...
27099,Homer,really? you really think i'm better than you?
29371,Homer,"screw the market, we're going to mexico!"
18040,Homer,"well, it's always in the last place you look."
18299,Homer,mmmm.... sprinkles.
34119,Homer,"oh, i love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
26199,Homer,"oh, no! the roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
27033,Homer,so you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.
22133,Homer,"oh, i get it. you're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?"
38617,Homer,"laundry. homework. pranks. poop, poop and poop."
15407,Homer,little lisa. i've already started you a college fund at lincoln savings and loan.
21071,Homer,oh my god! we're all gonna die!
17510,Homer,"here, puff! here puff!"
39161,Homer,"guys, thanks for bailing me out. but i still have a huge problem."
36188,Homer,"hey, guys! whatcha doing in my dream?"
33399,Homer,"a lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. may i have this dance?"
30655,Homer,no tip till they bring back hagar the horrible!
26825,Homer,"guys, i just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond."
15241,Homer,"mmmm, shrimp."
34882,Homer,"hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
38231,Homer,"ah, brazil. i couldn't stay afraid of you forever. the only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. that is a deal breaker."
25910,Homer,because i... ow! you--!
28714,Homer,"you know, marge and i have an anniversary coming up."
29635,Homer,and please let thy holy spirit open the heart of my wife. amen.
14941,Homer,"yeah, like when i pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
25591,Homer,and not just monkey feces either.
14788,Homer,it doesn't matter.
21143,Homer,"take that, uncle sam!"
29076,Homer,"wherever injustice shows its ugly face, i will be there! for i am the pie man!"
27949,Homer,only if it's an affront to god.
38354,Homer,sit down.
32424,Homer,"hazel! your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw i ate after we first made love."
33495,Homer,why you little...
29718,Homer,hmmm. seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. i'll keep one.
27068,Homer,you can't just leave me out here! there's not another woman for miles!
31265,Homer,and i promised these guys money i don't have! and they're gonna be so mad!
41409,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
25165,Homer,i'unno. must be sumpin' i wrote before moe fixed me.
35399,Homer,when i look at you -- all i see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! foibles! foibles! foibles!
22354,Homer,"gentlemen, i have an idea."
31327,Homer,woo hoo! where do i sign?
33109,Homer,"no, get two of your own."
25874,Homer,bo-ring.
18425,Homer,"i'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! what happened to my bird?"
17859,Homer,"hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
34859,Homer,or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
33612,Homer,"but i ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on expectant mothers drink free night?"
40208,Homer,"where are we going, sir?"
16009,Homer,yeah.
25221,Homer,so many flavors! all those tasty memories flooding back!
37162,Homer,"sure, what do i care?"
16085,Homer,"in there, guys."
29649,Homer,woo hoo! no pressure!
39962,Homer,"one, please."
33759,Homer,"if marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! help me, mayonnaise!"
38205,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
27292,Homer,"ooh, someone's coming!"
13174,Homer,snake!
25060,Homer,"well, yeah."
20070,Homer,"no, no! your room is full of toys. you're going to the, uh, garage!"
15543,Homer,i locked my keys in there. get a rock.
35387,Homer,"just call me ""homer fingerhands."""
39893,Homer,"see these? american donuts. glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. now how's that for freedom of choice?"
38978,Homer,change back to what?
36969,Homer,it's based on nothing!
13319,Homer,"and is this martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
22677,Homer,must eat beef... must defeat guy i just met...
29748,Homer,"no, i spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. i need a castle where i can be king!"
22785,Homer,the pie shall be cut in two. then each man shall receive... death. i'll eat the pie.
41185,Homer,"just a popularity contest?! excuse me, what's more important than popularity? now, bart, do you really think you can win?"
23868,Homer,what? i can see fine.
21464,Homer,"sorry, guys. marge and i are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast."
40457,Homer,series?!
23041,Homer,"maybe you're right, ned. maybe you're right."
34909,Homer,"well, bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
34946,Homer,since when is all this against the law?
39058,Homer,i saved us seats!
13471,Homer,"all right, there's no check, just a card. but don't panic. i'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""dear bart... thank you kindly for the blood. yours truly, montgomery burns."" it's just a card!"
21539,Homer,mmm... i knew i should have attached those somehow.
21791,Homer,you shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the gersh agency. you should let me do your shopping. i know where i can get you some great muffins.
35299,Homer,what the?!
37143,Homer,this calls for decisive action -- like l.b.j.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act.
20988,Homer,i'm gonna try the sex education computer!
15506,Homer,and lisa...
38154,Homer,"yes, they sold it to us. so now it's our painting. we can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep."
17083,Homer,"don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
18599,Homer,"look, guys. it's not that simple, he's my boss. i'll tell you what: i'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
29352,Homer,"i've been reading this magazine for years, but i never dreamed my son would be on the cover."
26385,Homer,"we said ""good day""!"
19893,Homer,poor wiggum.
23934,Homer,"huh? if you can't sell beer, what are lenny and carl doing here?"
33394,Homer,...debbie pinson.
34828,Homer,woo hoo!
16061,Homer,"relax, a photo can't make any difference."
39441,Homer,bart! lisa! maggie!
36622,Homer,"okay, good, we're talking..."
14483,Homer,"you found my baby. oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
37885,Homer,"bye bye, money!"
16237,Homer,"all right, but remember it's mine."
13542,Homer,dog on fire! dog on fire!
29612,Homer,"but i'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
18057,Homer,"well, it's like the time that your cat, snowball, got run over."
39663,Homer,shhhh! just watch.
17654,Homer,"but marge, knightboat. the crime solving boat."
26594,Homer,"hey, bart. how many more places do we have to search?"
14309,Homer,mmmmm. chocolate.
32646,Homer,"oh, the patriot act is so terrible! the government might find out what library books i take out. what's next -- finding out what operas i go to?"
16908,Homer,"so, your bid is zero."
14989,Homer,no. they moved to phoenix.
31705,Homer,"relax, baby. while you were dreaming of me and calling me ""james,"" i took care of everything."
21899,Homer,right on.
26874,Homer,what? it goes right by our house.
25888,Homer,"oh, son. you know that's none of your business. say, is that our house?"
35551,Homer,fine. i am being held somewhere in the springfield area. turn the card.
39207,Homer,"what? why? oh, yeah. hello patty, hello selma. how was your trip?"
36365,Homer,and here's the worst part: i never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
28879,Homer,i am a lineman for the county your call is important to us. please continue to hold. and i drive the main road there are... eight... calls ahead of you. and the wichita lineman is still on the li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-line!
33484,Homer,"i'm back, baby!"
31702,Homer,"relax, marge. i wasn't gonna kill him."
14742,Homer,is there anything you need?
29115,Homer,i sure did. i kept it right next to my ibm stock... king.
14701,Homer,"well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. but she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
37475,Homer,how do you know about carl's family?
16736,Homer,"hello, is this president clinton? good. i figured if anyone knew where to get some tang it'd be you... shut up!"
32440,Homer,a makeover!
16185,Homer,box...
16719,Homer,i'unno.
32298,Homer,i thought we were friends! i was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
38679,Homer,"good night, friend. you'll always have a special place here with us."
23440,Homer,lousy show-offs.
36929,Homer,"and then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the santa part."
22399,Homer,"gentlemen, i bid you--"
15074,Homer,will you remember this the next
32908,Homer,a donut from the future!
34175,Homer,you can't win us back with mere donuts.
31114,Homer,this is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
19898,Homer,i filled the balls with a funnel.
40487,Homer,"i mean it, boy."
41219,Homer,it's a deal!
21578,Homer,"and these hardy boys books are great, too. this one is about smugglers."
21723,Homer,... show you...
13247,Homer,i tried the broccoli again.
36511,Homer,"aw boy, i feel for ya. nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
14433,Homer,what should i say?
37511,Homer,"fine, i'm going home."
37158,Homer,"gotcha! candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see..."
39347,Homer,"don't stifle the boy, marge. we're supposed to encourage him."
17428,Homer,"oh, gotta go. innocent!"
28582,Homer,i'm confused! which is it?
19725,Homer,"aw, nuts. hel-lo? china? little help?"
17519,Homer,"but, i keep tellin' ya, i'm not a pilot."
18427,Homer,explosion imminent?!
31234,Homer,"okay, now you do me."
26148,Homer,"super. now if you'll gather around, i'd like to say a few words. all nerds clear the launch area."
17744,Homer,"a girl! oh marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
38880,Homer,"well, we haven't heard from maggie yet."
36873,Homer,"stupid town... at least i've still got moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going..."
38047,Homer,do you have my money?
29162,Homer,"now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. i'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop."
14458,Homer,"all right, but just be careful."
13841,Homer,"i love you, son."
25253,Homer,i'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
34012,Homer,helllp me!
18413,Homer,"hmmm, i can feel three kinds of softness."
37531,Homer,"marge, i am focused on this like a laser. ""laser."" that's a funny word. it's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" and speaking of losers, i've lost my train of thought. oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
27338,Homer,who will take home the rampy?
30348,Homer,"okay, marge. but don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
27959,Homer,"heck no, the amish did it. who knows more about electricity than the amish?"
33508,Homer,i'm using you!
15874,Homer,"bart, lisa i have something to tell you, and i'm not proud of it."
13848,Homer,how hard can it be?
35645,Homer,"congratulations, roz."
17672,Homer,don't worry about homer j. i've got a plan. a plan that'll fix you good.
38196,Homer,prove it.
31600,Homer,"i didn't write that! even if i did love england, i'd play it cool. wait for it to come to me."
38592,Homer,wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. what's going on?
40651,Homer,"shut up! bart, this is good stuff. i want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. number one, ""cover for me."" number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" number three, ""it was like that when i got here."""
36957,Homer,real matuuure!
38728,Homer,what the rock?
14253,Homer,i will send you every cent i earn for the baby. but you will not see me again until i am a man.
40671,Homer,"never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other."
16268,Homer,"man's best friend, indeed."
15120,Homer,oh no. i'm not making two stops.
28392,Homer,marge? maggie?
26340,Homer,"aw, looks like a little angel. now to save me marge."
18049,Homer,"kids are so naïve. lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""do not feed the bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
14755,Homer,lousy snitch.
23536,Homer,did somebody say num num?
37757,Homer,mothers are so awesome.
33491,Homer,"who is this ""dad"" you speak of, lisa simpson?"
26657,Homer,"so my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on tuesday the seventh..."
19907,Homer,"give me that! bart, this is your father. do you know where the remote is? i looked all over the house."
24912,Homer,"all right, whatever."
36221,Homer,"you're outta here, drug-o."
23812,Homer,it's the bread of astronauts.
35304,Homer,"how many more, sir?"
34320,Homer,oh my! a child who doesn't enjoy school? hello? hollywood?! you want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? a million dollars? deal! now i have to write it.
40652,Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. there and there. don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. now, some aftershave."
13236,Homer,"so whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye..."
17378,Homer,what dat?
40252,Homer,"hey, burns! hey, ""rag arm""!"
31171,Homer,but i wanted to do it with you.
23340,Homer,but it was worth it to get back our super sugar crisp cereal.
13624,Homer,wowww -- a shoehorn! just like in the movies!
16126,Homer,"look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. these guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
16060,Homer,"thanks boy. now, for the crowning touch..."
27396,Homer,you'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
36088,Homer,"true, true."
14688,Homer,y'ello.
41026,Homer,all right you eggheads! i want a place in this car to put my drink!
25746,Homer,it knows you're afraid.
36891,Homer,holy moley! he's already made a clearing! let's go for a glade!
14103,Homer,"cough syrup. nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
24272,Homer,"oops, sorry, honey."
20915,Homer,mmmm... me.
23404,Homer,"oh no, rosie o'donnell."
41207,Homer,"ah, good evening, zohar the adulterer. my wife sends her warmest regards."
19094,Homer,promise not to laugh? i always wanted to own the dallas cowboys.
22811,Homer,you gotta build fast! cement drying!
40127,Homer,"to me."""
40002,Homer,"we're so sorry, we're so sorry."
21806,Homer,i'll get it! i'll get it!
24703,Homer,"dear lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about krusty? whoa, man! i mean, i knew he was a player, but geez, a kid?"
25130,Homer,"hey, flanders, headin' for church? well, i thought i could save you a little time."
14338,Homer,why did you do that?
25816,Homer,"hey, that's me. and that's you."
17576,Homer,"oh, okay. have it your own way, marge. i'll be back in a minute. i'm going outside. to stalk... ... lenny and carl."
21943,Homer,woo hoo!
29069,Homer,the dalai lama!
25011,Homer,so we're under arrest for fraud?
17150,Homer,"never! never, marge! i can't live the buttoned-down life like you. i want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. oh, i'll never be the darling of the so called ""city fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this homer simpson."
30314,Homer,manatees -- defend!
27391,Homer,"you did it! lisa thinks i'm the greatest. i might even put you to work on bart and maggie, go superdad on all their asses."
25079,Homer,"oh, baby!"
37267,Homer,"you may be the sweater man, but homer is the better man."
31413,Homer,nooooo!
31310,Homer,"hey boy, where's your mud buddy? i have a little job for him."
20114,Homer,"they expect me to sit here from nine to five?! that's how many hours? ten, eleven, denominator... oh, where's lisa when you need her?"
41104,Homer,"hey you kids, stop kicking the seat!"
31748,Homer,nooooooo...
28982,Homer,there's a first class?
25763,Homer,"'cause the thing is, there are no bad kids..."
15885,Homer,"all right, brain, you don't like me and i don't like you. but let's just do this and i can get back to killing you with beer."
31020,Homer,"well, uh... uh... honey, you're just as smart as a man. sometimes when i'm with you, i feel like i'm doing it with a dude."
39568,Homer,let's hear it.
17080,Homer,"but, i learned my lesson. it'll never happen again."
15525,Homer,it's my life-long dream.
22129,Homer,"oh, don't worry about that, boy. he's already out on bail. well, i'm off to work."
20297,Homer,i'm gonna chop you good!
16306,Homer,oh my god!
13598,Homer,"""well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- ain't it the truth."
29514,Homer,"boon chacalacala / / in your face! / my son flips frogs like a girl, yeah! a-boom! a-ba! a who's your daddy?"
19710,Homer,well? what did everybody think?

15896,Homer,woo hoo! the greatest day of the year.
13272,Homer,moooooe... you killed meeeee.
25432,Homer,"well, okay. but you can't silence homer simpson. i'm the friend of the downtrodden. and i'm not gonna forget what i saw here today."
29016,Homer,nope. just lookin' for that golden ticket.
23735,Homer,"now don't worry. i am gonna search high and low for your mother. but just in case i don't find her, i want you to contact this agency."
27446,Homer,"don't worry, i'll set fire to the hive."
26206,Homer,"give it to me, baby."
36163,Homer,"not just the laundry... that would be weird, and you might ask questions. i wanna do all the chores!"
26824,Homer,oh.
23453,Homer,absolutely. this is our big chance. the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
39237,Homer,"well, let's see."
15831,Homer,uh... mr. burns... i need to borrow some money.
27006,Homer,"hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?"
26264,Homer,i was hoping we could do that together.
29944,Homer,and this is on the radio?
35921,Homer,"oh marge, don't worry. people know i'm doing a character, like stephen colbert, or newt gingrich."
22934,Homer,can't we go home yet? my feet hurt. all this fresh air is making my hair move. and i don't know how much longer i can complain.
41436,Homer,"marge number two, how would you win my whoopee?"
15775,Homer,"you know, you could have just called me."
21673,Homer,i rolled up all the socks.
13244,Homer,"aw c'mon, serious homer, let me out! we'll get a monkey drunk and push him down the stairs."
23259,Homer,"if he's so smart, how come he's dead?"
33406,Homer,"how you doin', dad?"
37378,Homer,since when?
39345,Homer,but i'm not a genius. why should i suffer?
41525,Homer,"with you, baby, top ramen tastes like cup o' noodles."
19916,Homer,"hi marge, hi santa's little helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not santa's little helper."
15666,Homer,woo hoo!
38475,Homer,"your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
17100,Homer,a bouquet of po...
13557,Homer,"no, that thing with your feet."
38943,Homer,no i'm not.
24648,Homer,it's ringing.
27537,Homer,"oh, wet and wonderful god, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. surely this has proven whatever point you had."
27490,Homer,"no that's not it. he's got some secret. and i'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes."
29532,Homer,"all right, all right, i'll work it out."
28103,Homer,"hey, treadmill! how do you like this incline?"
23685,Homer,"please, mr. kidkill, look into your heart. i know these babies have a lifetime contract. but what if i put together an even better act for you? something sensational!"
17743,Homer,hello. aw. it's a boy... and what a boy.
29948,Homer,on the radio?
27168,Homer,let's hear it.
34176,Homer,that is the most amazing donut i've ever tasted.
34039,Homer,"stupid carl... ""update the phone list, homer!"" ""you put my contact lenses in backwards, homer!"" i'm sorry, honey."
30101,Homer,"moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
37343,Homer,oh marge! come to the ga-rage! you know it'll be good 'cause i'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!
14436,Homer,"and uh... later tonight i think you and i should uh, snuggle."

23262,Homer,"hey, i smell cake! cake that says ""farewell"" and ""best wishes""!"
34005,Homer,"well, well, well."
13271,Homer,a ghost!
36422,Homer,"i got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation."
23755,Homer,where are the refreshments?
40755,Homer,"well, what interest does she have that i could make common?"
27029,Homer,wait'll moe sees how wasted i got without him. he's gonna plotz.
23302,Homer,i've given out my share of bad reviews.
33283,Homer,"boy, don't blow up this mall! it has the cookie store that gives free samples!"
20088,Homer,"shut up! it's my car, and i say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
26699,Homer,kathleen turner!
20796,Homer,"wow, a free movie. thanks! outta my way, jerk ass."
27403,Homer,you're charging how much for a room?
19206,Homer,"okay, homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
39192,Homer,is it even cheating?
21794,Homer,"yeah, you owe me that much."
30534,Homer,"no, she's not."
26048,Homer,"well, i knew that before i came in here. a guy outside told me that."
35406,Homer,right.
14495,Homer,stupid lumber...
39793,Homer,"no, my supervisor."
17087,Homer,why didn't i take a picture? i had ten years to take a picture.
19791,Homer,well... but... wait a minute. bart's not fixed yet! he hasn't even --
36404,Homer,"man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
22109,Homer,"so, how'd you get the nickname ""legs""?"
26208,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. liquors drunkened me."
30997,Homer,"catch me, flanders!"
40822,Homer,sure.
14321,Homer,"don't worry, son. just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. i brought you your krusty doll..."
14730,Homer,let's hear it.
39465,Homer,"look at that, kids! no fighting, no yelling..."
31332,Homer,"aw, no, daddy's just teasing. of course you could. you could keep it under a hundred. yes, you could."
30998,Homer,woo hoo! it's almost new year's! ten... nine... eight...

31778,Homer,"okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
16275,Homer,you kids do need a baby-sitter.
22236,Homer,"but ginger, honey, i am not the catch i appear to be."

39220,Homer,"what is it, flanders?"
35755,Homer,kansas city.
35042,Homer,can we at least drink beer or something?
24900,Homer,"stop it, apu. you're scaring me."

34455,Homer,okay.
29170,Homer,"okay, three bucks."
27808,Homer,i wish god were alive to see this.
16036,Homer,"c'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot."
28481,Homer,"oh yes, i am... your present is right in the other room."
15470,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best jew... but i rented ""fiddler on the roof"", and i will watch it. anyway, can i have forty-thousand dollars?"

19223,Homer,"wow, that's really lazy."
41485,Homer,"i know the woman i loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense."
40288,Homer,it's not that simple. i've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
29984,Homer,"now, everything's perfect again."
37196,Homer,"high-five me, marge!"
15417,Homer,"goodnight, honey."
17699,Homer,mmm... urinal fresh.
25930,Homer,"well, we tried all those other tools."
29501,Homer,"marge, i just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on moe, here's my card."
35460,Homer,awww...
19450,Homer,"aw, i hate this place! why am i here?!"
19829,Homer,"take it like a man, boy. and do everything your little sister says."
29666,Homer,really? then why do you still work here?!
36572,Homer,now you're sure i bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?
22836,Homer,"woo hoo! look, marge, my first sale! in your face, jasper johns!"
35528,Homer,"wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but i think you're awesome."
14661,Homer,political!
18822,Homer,"aw, nertz."
34147,Homer,i have a column i'd like to submit. pay me whenever.
16573,Homer,put this in your pipe and smoke it.
17838,Homer,"oh, he'll agitate ya. ho, ho. he sure will. what can we do for you?"
21435,Homer,"oh. no. no, i'm the guy. i'm supposed to, uh..."
26581,Homer,"now lisa, it's not as bleak as that. can you fly me over town to look for him?"
15636,Homer,because it's a stupid piece of junk!
19844,Homer,look at me! i'm the prime minister of ireland!
40485,Homer,"look, i know i can't stop you. the only thing i can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
23088,Homer,ignor-- what?
28122,Homer,"ooo, a hotdog!"
40149,Homer,an ancient indian what...?
24269,Homer,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.
16664,Homer,bee? aah!
39006,Homer,"okay. bart, think of a name. make it great. insanely, unbelievably great!"
38162,Homer,homer looks into marge's eyes.
34479,Homer,"shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything."
14282,Homer,"oh, college boy, eh?"
15173,Homer,i like stories.
28897,Homer,where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?
41132,Homer,"if i take you, will you two shut up and quit bugging me?"
28087,Homer,"only teasing. we've flown in the finest busboys from france... i mean, america!"
31199,Homer,"hey, if i poisoned them, would i be doing this?"
26232,Homer,oh my god! wow. now that's a goiter.
20031,Homer,"yeah, that's me all right. and the guy standing next to me is president gerald ford. and this is when i was on tour with the smashing pumpkins. oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
13613,Homer,where do you think? this baby never steers you wrong. and it was free. free!
30346,Homer,"exactly. now, what has two ears but can't hear?"
39715,Homer,i hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
29301,Homer,"oh, what's the big deal? bart didn't like his presents. so what? it's not like he gives us such great gifts. remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? what was that? that was crap."
37629,Homer,all good.
26149,Homer,"now all we need is our astronaut. bart, where's america's newest hero?"
33772,Homer,"sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the continental congress. dolphins swim in cliques. those are my two examples."
24343,Homer,"hi, kids!"
16347,Homer,this is great. i can finally look like i want and not get hassled by the man.
19077,Homer,no! no! what are you spraying me with!?
35008,Homer,i understand. i loved him too.
22747,Homer,"ten-four, dead buddy."
27331,Homer,"wait a minute... i know where we're going... oh, it's horrible..."
39928,Homer,and he had a big nose.
27118,Homer,here you go. front and center.
38758,Homer,oh...
17126,Homer,"but why? she's such a fox. i mean, what's on fox tonight? something ribald, no doubt."
40907,Homer,oops.
21830,Homer,"all right, i'm gonna let you guys in on something. but you've got to keep it much more secret than i did."
24283,Homer,"well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find."
26918,Homer,people with heads?
31007,Homer,or will ever do.
37610,Homer,they taught me something i found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. this t-shirt lied to me!
16101,Homer,"i got it! we wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
21118,Homer,barney? that was me! and i'd do it again.
17996,Homer,"marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. i never realized how much i missed it. listen to the murmurs in the next room. the house is full of life again."
16570,Homer,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
24898,Homer,"real news is great, son. but i'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-a bull plop."
22633,Homer,"hey, that looks like fun."
22766,Homer,branch monster.
32943,Homer,pee?!
27494,Homer,"well, since i don't have the remote, i can just get up and change the channel."
22059,Homer,"well, back on land, my name was homer simpson. and i guess it is here, too. i promised my dad one of my kidneys, but i chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
34727,Homer,let me just grab one more shrimp.
30247,Homer,"all right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house."
17988,Homer,"you can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom i built. remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
36529,Homer,"all right, i'll spring for a cab."
18006,Homer,i found them on the night stand this morning. i guess they weren't his cup of tea. don't worry about it.
34040,Homer,"leave me alone, you two!"
27692,Homer,"mm, funky!"
29199,Homer,"people's deaths, eh?"
40836,Homer,cable. it's more wonderful than i dared hope.
15144,Homer,thataboy.
18703,Homer,woo hoooooooooo--
29413,Homer,"spill it, super-boss!"
14261,Homer,marge?
40900,Homer,"oh, no."
25133,Homer,"yes, nelson?"
36133,Homer,"look at me, i'm mr. fatso! it's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."
18820,Homer,"oh, why can't they just take the gun?"
14314,Homer,aww...
24456,Homer,didn't you ever go to camp? the ol' vitamin barn...
38495,Homer,come on. lick it!
21546,Homer,"well, here goes..."
41008,Homer,i dunno.

30086,Homer,"no, flanders. it's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. you wouldn't be interested."
32744,Homer,"thanks, son."
27993,Homer,"marge, they're just hams, okay."

14543,Homer,"come here boy, i want to show you something."
38652,Homer,oh. my. god. he's telling the truth. i have to take you to our civic leaders.
25628,Homer,"marge, over here."

16113,Homer,i got it! we're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
13709,Homer,"uh, there's a store where..."
18045,Homer,"well, i've had just about enough of your vassar bashing young lady."
37910,Homer,you!
39649,Homer,a rattler!
17492,Homer,you know what?
23661,Homer,"now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy."
40549,Homer,"w-well... it's a v-very generous offer, sir. but... his medical bills alone..."
25258,Homer,that's tennis?! then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
13935,Homer,no! you can't see... come on!
19371,Homer,"oh, i'm sure i'd be a third wheel."

14009,Homer,but you can use me. i'm good. i've built a lot of things around the house... the spice rack... the birdfeeder... the gymboree.
20852,Homer,"fine. it's not important. what really matters is my title. i think i'll make myself vice president. no, wait... junior vice president."
21638,Homer,"see? it's just a regular chair, but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your..."
23768,Homer,"hey, it is christmas. we'd better get home."
33025,Homer,"well, you'll never take me alive!"

32806,Homer,get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
19599,Homer,"i think i won, mr. burns."
13887,Homer,"marge, if i spend any more time doing these girl things, i'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. no, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. let's see, quick fix, quick fix. ah, i'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
20666,Homer,"well, the boy told us. but that was after we filed a phony police report."
25782,Homer,"why did you rat me out, kids? was it because i showered love on those other children while ignoring you?"
33784,Homer,"attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. my son and i are going to build westminster abbey!"
37342,Homer,"i think i could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. bob's your uncle."
34474,Homer,community service? but... that's work! what about jail?
31236,Homer,what's the point? we're all slowly dying.

24657,Homer,no problem.
21684,Homer,i'unno. drug lab?
30956,Homer,outsourcing!
39150,Homer,"he's called ""the bachelor."""
30529,Homer,"so, sweetie, am i your hero again?"
21937,Homer,freedom...
31110,Homer,"sorry, flanders. but when you get in, you can use my audio tour. narrated by melanie griffith."
17569,Homer,"hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
25166,Homer,"huh? oh, you want a hug. well that, i know how to do."
23887,Homer,"oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, marge?"
32569,Homer,right.
29102,Homer,she wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
35570,Homer,"bart, i wanna ask you about something i read in a magazine. are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
14088,Homer,"i said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
36167,Homer,why can't i cork my wang-wine?
23235,Homer,ray j. funny... or o.j. funny?
23347,Homer,hey maude! look who's helping me clean the chimney.

33709,Homer,"yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
22495,Homer,"mornin', apu. still in hot water with the squaw?"
31155,Homer,"hey tabitha, great show. i like that part where you mentioned springfield. did you know that's where you are?"
33728,Homer,"ooh, lemon. that'll stop the cherry."
23226,Homer,"well, if you want one, they sell 'em at..."
18079,Homer,nothing. i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
33997,Homer,better call dr. hibbert.
32906,Homer,"i mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? does she know i feel bad about things i said?"
32458,Homer,"no, i had my stomach stapled!"
18421,Homer,i could sit in the aisle.
15580,Homer,"marge, i'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
15616,Homer,hit me.
24560,Homer,oh no!
29994,Homer,but it's my burger.
38820,Homer,flanders? what are you doing here?
24001,Homer,"when the race starts, run really fast!"
31676,Homer,"yeah, how 'bout that?"
36600,Homer,"what about... you know... ""stinky""?"
30282,Homer,"does the pizza guy take a check? if so, where do we keep the checks? and lastly, how do you write a check?"
30818,Homer,"now to begin ""operation: slight edge""."
34805,Homer,"boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is."
38000,Homer,ow!
26555,Homer,maybe the red one...
37703,Homer,do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
20380,Homer,"here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
22149,Homer,the force?!
20865,Homer,"well, well, well... if it isn't professor know-it-all. 'scuse me, marge."
28800,Homer,sorry. i forgot i bought the soundtrack album.
24918,Homer,"oh, they drugged the tea. they knew my one weakness."
33963,Homer,maybe.
38201,Homer,"oh, great. the painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. and when marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
25288,Homer,i'm getting to that.
40547,Homer,"nice to meet you too, sir."
29470,Homer,"but i don't wanna take care of the kids... um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? bart sleeps in the microwave, right?"
19851,Homer,now don't say that! alcohol is a way of life. alcohol is my way of life. and i aim to keep it!
38108,Homer,"gentlemen, i've been thinking. my glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, i will be old."
37484,Homer,what the hell is this?
35107,Homer,"ow! ow! huh, mmm, not bad. just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours."
38423,Homer,it might be easier with maggie. she's always getting letters from the daycare center.
21042,Homer,nu-cue-lar. it's pronounced nu-cue-lar.
20019,Homer,do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
37688,Homer,"look at me, i'm afraid of dying!"
18347,Homer,"hmm, probably better that didn't hit me."
34830,Homer,the march of progress.
26941,Homer,even dessert?
35309,Homer,what?!
23227,Homer,the boy's still studying?
21537,Homer,"dear lord, i know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. but if you help us steal this grease tonight, i promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
41457,Homer,so... uh... i feel that... fellow wildcats...
35147,Homer,more for me.
17725,Homer,"steve -- i mean al, i think i deserve a raise."
32954,Homer,"the one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. son, we are getting that coin!"
14307,Homer,"hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!"
23761,Homer,"now, let's see. this will make three christmases i saved versus eight i ruined... two were kind of a draw..."
41236,Homer,"""special day?"" oh, what have i forgotten now? now, don't panic... is it bacon day? no, that's crazy talk... she's getting impatient, take a stab at it."
33629,Homer,chocolate.
29646,Homer,"welcome to sprawl*mart... pimple cream in aisle five! buenos nachos -- ask about our señor discount. hey, rabbi, jesus loves ya. just kidding."
30180,Homer,when are you gonna stop poking me? will it be soon?
26726,Homer,"oh, i am..."
39910,Homer,wow!
20248,Homer,you should be.
20875,Homer,"take that, marge!"
20048,Homer,you wish.
22724,Homer,you'll never believe what happened. i fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
30630,Homer,"i always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""
25803,Homer,i'll meet you in wilmington.
33758,Homer,aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
32309,Homer,maggie!
37445,Homer,"you like this now? what about ""planet jackson and the earth brigade?"""
35315,Homer,"son, you and i are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist."
30344,Homer,"you see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
25595,Homer,so like us...
13899,Homer,half a million dollars?!
33908,Homer,some hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!
14534,Homer,why you little...
22159,Homer,"aaah, what's the rush? might rain next week."
39216,Homer,who's this?
18345,Homer,"stupidity, eh?"
37268,Homer,i didn't know you were left-handed.
17434,Homer,and ted koppel is a robot.
18620,Homer,"hey, i never noticed this place!"
32317,Homer,right... tomorrow.
35325,Homer,i want my pot of gold!
40523,Homer,twenty million women in the world and i had to marry jane fonda.
14772,Homer,"boy, some of the best times i've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
24012,Homer,possessions are fleeting.
37813,Homer,you want me to take care of your dolly?
32633,Homer,he's got my vote.
26907,Homer,"marge, doesn't lisa have a human face?"
22762,Homer,"no, you're too kind. and wise, and righteous... i can't believe you don't have a girlfriend."
16322,Homer,that's the last i'll see of mr. trampoline.
27051,Homer,"what? wait a... that can't be right! wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?"
26711,Homer,lousy minor setback! this world sucks!
13502,Homer,"well, i'm still gonna run!"
30601,Homer,a lamborgotti fasterossa? that's the car i think about when i make love to my wife.
26647,Homer,"whoa, whoa, one question at a time. yes, you?"
32938,Homer,how am i ever gonna take on all those guys?
28523,Homer,i just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. it was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at christmas. and get this: he learns a lesson!
21526,Homer,all right. we'll try it your way.
31856,Homer,you said it -- enjoy me while i last.
34527,Homer,"hmm... alternative energy expo. where there's expos, there's free frisbees! let's roll. but we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out."
14600,Homer,i've never been so sure of anything in my life. i am going to win this lottery.
35998,Homer,are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
16128,Homer,"hmmm, true."
17185,Homer,"but at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
41264,Homer,silence you fool! it can be ours.

21995,Homer,"come on, come on, come on. start, damn you. start!"
22045,Homer,i could live at sea! the sea forgives all. not like those mean old mountains. i hate them so much.
25379,Homer,kids... how would you... like to go to... blockoland?!!
20605,Homer,seat belts?! pfft! they kill more people than they save.
17888,Homer,"well, lisa, i managed to solve a little problem today. and to celebrate, i'm going to tilt my chair."
19809,Homer,"y'know, bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
14769,Homer,"oh marge, i went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
38732,Homer,"this is embarrassing to admit, stig, but i hadn't even thought about gels."
20861,Homer,"this is it, marge. i poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! we're rich! richer than astronauts!"
38382,Homer,"hey, i know that horse! it's sudsley! sudsley brew-right!"
25009,Homer,"thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... is that everyone?"
24776,Homer,that's the sneeze guard. you have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
14110,Homer,it's not fair!
29911,Homer,"ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!"
40269,Homer,m-- me? a mascot for a bush league team?
37730,Homer,eduardo? eduardo! eduardo!
27299,Homer,right here.
34731,Homer,"you got to enjoy that bag for nothing! we can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
13757,Homer,who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
26331,Homer,marge? marge is gone! but at least the demolition derby form is...
37806,Homer,"um, he likes it if you tickle his toes."
27151,Homer,mmm... feed...
20461,Homer,"well, bart, looks like it's just you and... ohhh."
25235,Homer,"aw, now, be nice, moe. this guy just got out of the hospital."
19513,Homer,"no time for you, old man!"
37765,Homer,i think i'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
35497,Homer,just in time for my lunch break / got my fork and spoon
39820,Homer,"look, barney. see the row of tiny lights up there? the middle one is my house. someone must have left the porch light on."
14739,Homer,yes i am.
28497,Homer,"oh, if i buy this, i won't have anything left for a christmas tree..."
16447,Homer,"let's have a little quality time together, just you and me."
30772,Homer,"marge, i ripped my pants! the only pants that understand my complex hiney."
18946,Homer,"hi, everyone. if i could just say a few words... i'd be a better public speaker."
34813,Homer,"well, nobody loves his kids more than me!"
16444,Homer,uhhh.
31134,Homer,"ooh, iced tea!"
40041,Homer,"okay. the colors of the italian flag are red, white and what?"
13917,Homer,"that's for the courts to decide. marge, she loves me."
38063,Homer,but it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
24454,Homer,"yes, dear."
23396,Homer,and there's nobody guarding it. let's go!
27725,Homer,"i finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. well, time for work."
25269,Homer,wow. how do you come up with such witty remarks?
31241,Homer,"marge, the coast is clear."
27910,Homer,ned's a stupid name! he's worse than frankenstein or dr. no.
39543,Homer,the den! great idea!

28663,Homer,why don't you admit i know it's around here somewhere?
24394,Homer,"they called you a pig, sheriff."
24532,Homer,what?! what's she doing here?
25908,Homer,"hey, shut up."
17681,Homer,"hey barney, any chance you can get me a job here?"
24311,Homer,"oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
41032,Homer,you're fired! what is my brother paying you for?
17577,Homer,all i have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
35239,Homer,we'll deal with all that later.
25273,Homer,"hey, check it out! i'm surfing the net!"
35898,Homer,woo hoo! i'm famous again!
16312,Homer,and i can just haul it away? free?

26310,Homer,mm hmm.
40898,Homer,"no... no i... it wasn't me... it was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... i would never..."

23908,Homer,"what's that, sonny?"
25772,Homer,i almost had a straight!
21480,Homer,it hasn't changed since that magical evening when i knocked you up.

41493,Homer,huh? hm? what the--
23416,Homer,"will you duel, or are you a coward?!"
25366,Homer,how many lives must you ruin?
28129,Homer,"look, maggie's in the paper with moe. how cute."
37440,Homer,to me it's legs versus boobs.
21978,Homer,"pinchy, i made you some risotto."
27455,Homer,"why you little... oh, hi jesus. i was just..."
23708,Homer,"you know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles."
37519,Homer,"yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. and i promise each anniversary will be better and better..."
38877,Homer,this isn't a happy thing!
38083,Homer,i like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
26992,Homer,now to make sure this hammock never troubles anyone again.
24069,Homer,"yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""i love you,"" or ""you're special."" you know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."
19176,Homer,yes!
21839,Homer,"oh, how could alec and kim just cut me out of their lives?"
23826,Homer,"help us, virtual doc! look at me! i'm on my knees!"
27484,Homer,huh?
23047,Homer,"well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund."
29694,Homer,i finally get this play!
31636,Homer,revenge!
25744,Homer,see for yourself.
23557,Homer,really?
38547,Homer,dammit!
25338,Homer,"now lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. let's just say i'm replacing you."
30230,Homer,"face it, marge -- catholics rule. we've got boston, south america, the good part of ireland, and we're making serious inroads in mozambique, baby!"
38453,Homer,"hey, super mario. don't you tell me about america!"
21344,Homer,"so nobody believes i can do this, huh? well, my son does. and i'm not gonna let him down. i'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
36970,Homer,"i'd slash my wrists! but how, without my electric knife?!"
38065,Homer,what's he doing?
33156,Homer,i hate other people's love.
31051,Homer,why you little...
36722,Homer,classic.
16193,Homer,"well, we didn't get any money, but mr. burns got what he wanted. marge, i'm confused. is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
14778,Homer,"now boy, we spent a lot of money. so you better get real good real fast or pow!"
22744,Homer,we'll get past that barrier somehow. ol' blinky here will find a way.
15979,Homer,we had fame and fortune.
27694,Homer,but it's st. valentine's day! god wants us to do it.
27009,Homer,"you mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?"
31806,Homer,can't i even have privacy here?!
17334,Homer,i mean my little girl buddy.
36413,Homer,sometimes marge says i turn it into a trashcan.
23618,Homer,"where's mag-gie? where's mag-gie? hey, where is she?"
40606,Homer,no!
39792,Homer,"no, no, marge. it's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
24608,Homer,that's my number!
24525,Homer,"where is the rent? / i must have the rent! / dollars, dimes and nickels / i need them all right now!"
38522,Homer,absolutely not.
25502,Homer,"okay maggie, put it down."
24661,Homer,"c'mon, bart. we're gonna bring back the who."
25268,Homer,and how about that stephanie the weather girl?
17766,Homer,an hour! i can't wait another hour. what's keeping that stupid comet?
39814,Homer,"what are you saying, honey?"
32714,Homer,not quite.
37929,Homer,no.
16157,Homer,right. that makes sense.
13946,Homer,"i'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then i have ten minutes to spend as i please. then i'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
33882,Homer,conrad birdie? coming here to sweet apple?!
17997,Homer,keep it down in there!
15914,Homer,woo-hoo!
24962,Homer,i told you! i find them boring.
31967,Homer,"moe, i think we may have perverted..."
38910,Homer,"but, wait a minute! that's my job!"
30295,Homer,you lost that first game to hustle me!
26706,Homer,stupid lawn chair!
25341,Homer,everybody's been dumped but me. i'm undumpable.
37257,Homer,flanders?! how'd you get in here? this place is a highly-sensitive area.
22379,Homer,"oh, i can't wait. look, marge, i had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
30192,Homer,go nuts.
40714,Homer,what are you talking about?
33118,Homer,these fish died for nothing!
23351,Homer,"aww, she missed it."
14205,Homer,don't worry. this castle is impregnable!
36207,Homer,why you little...
31109,Homer,"wow, this 3-d is amazing! you can actually feel the vase!"
39845,Homer,"look, i'm here because i want to apologize for treating you like an object."
38627,Homer,marge? why didn't you sign?
24791,Homer,little help?
31811,Homer,"so long, anti-clotting agent!"
30170,Homer,last-diddily-ast? he's gone! and it's all someone's fault!
33057,Homer,i was gonna bet it on the dogs!
22466,Homer,sure you can. buncha no-good do-gooders.
22673,Homer,"whoa, look at that car burn! does it get any better than this?"
36305,Homer,sure. what's your name?
19700,Homer,"oh, i don't get the job, do i? well, boo-hoo, i don't get to be a cartoon dog."
18666,Homer,it's time to hit him where he lives.
22710,Homer,wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? watching all the people come and go. you could have a different best friend every day.
40751,Homer,"thanks, pop."
25507,Homer,"yeah, but this is me talking. look, i already encased the telephone in concrete."
38571,Homer,stupid blood. asking me for a favor.
38669,Homer,who is that?!
17043,Homer,"nothing for me, today! i've got a class to teach!"
22202,Homer,i think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
33535,Homer,"hmmm, this is good."
16391,Homer,"wrong again, flanders."
31885,Homer,"let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels, and you can play swim-up blackjack with abraham lincoln! it's the land of sleep. and your passport: a simple mattress."
25656,Homer,what the hell...?
19839,Homer,"what's the matter, marge? i thought you loved jello shooters."
36555,Homer,nope. / not me. / do we even still have that thing?
14714,Homer,a friend bought it for me.
21743,Homer,"hello-- oh, great. mormons."
37078,Homer,wait! what about that couple? they look pretty cozy.
35410,Homer,there's only one way out -- i'm committing barbicide!
18794,Homer,except... i killed mr. burns.
29553,Homer,"yeah... you help me, and i, in turn, am helped by you."
41578,Homer,a hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
25241,Homer,"oh, the whole deal. coffin. tombstone. anti-stink spray."
21760,Homer,"well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies."
41561,Homer,fine. cohiba me.
39957,Homer,"oh, no."
31820,Homer,i want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!
27523,Homer,"the dog's on board, too."
29585,Homer,oh yeah? send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
33850,Homer,listen... i got a place down the hall.
35598,Homer,"hey bart... i mean, jesus. hey son, you want flanders to kill anybody? he's totally in my power."
24192,Homer,woo hoo!
31192,Homer,"uh, it fell off a truck. you know, a truck-truck."
35075,Homer,"hmm, if this were a tv show that would be a helluva act break."
16632,Homer,"marge, i have some horrible, bone chilling news."
36076,Homer,nooo!
20199,Homer,wait a minute... she's right!
19703,Homer,you? but you're a lady.
31804,Homer,"he's trying to make me look like a bad father. maggie, take the wheel!"
29817,Homer,marge! how did you get in here?
38184,Homer,"so, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
21050,Homer,thank you.
38055,Homer,what? did you owe me some money?
28470,Homer,"you can't leave, i'm your ride home!"
38421,Homer,woo-hoo!
23170,Homer,"oh, crap! here they come!"
26662,Homer,"oh, i could have smoked that pot. and worn that hair."
24752,Homer,read it!
21180,Homer,what do you want? his cholesterol's through the roof.
24665,Homer,"wow, the who!"
18128,Homer,"you kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this."
24406,Homer,look. this is our chance.
40351,Homer,but i got it in the middle!
15484,Homer,"hey, i'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
19765,Homer,homer storms out.
31898,Homer,"yeah... something has changed, but i can't figure out what. our mattress! i traded it to the lovejoys!"
31721,Homer,"no, no. this place is too expensive. i saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
15821,Homer,marge!
17542,Homer,"every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. well what about me, marge?"
30342,Homer,"oh, and that dr. hibbert was so boring... ""homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... homer, we must discuss your test results... homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
20706,Homer,oo! oo! i want to see lobster boy and shrimp girl!
19947,Homer,"hey, why don't you try the old folks home? they practically live in their own filth!"
22514,Homer,"will you stop it?! it's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame apu. he's makin' us look bad!"
13793,Homer,what are you talking about? of course he does.
29774,Homer,don't worry about the suvs. there's a gentle curve up ahead.
36807,Homer,who do you think painted the word on the tree?
24178,Homer,"well, not the unitarians. if that's the one true faith, i'll eat my hat."
14035,Homer,"name your son's hobbies. building a soapbox racer... ""name your child's friends."" martin... martin! i'll curse that name 'til the day i die... huh? ""who is your son's heroe?""..."
16208,Homer,no.
27803,Homer,"i'unno. what am i, superdad?"
31779,Homer,"okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. you're gonna help me ambush them. look at this place. imported beer? seedless grapes? chewing gum?"
40622,Homer,"oh, i couldn't possibly."
29325,Homer,"oh come on, marge. the only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
23599,Homer,"i can't believe it, moe. the greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
22646,Homer,"it's true. i'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em."
26611,Homer,"hey, cut it out! put her down!"
23608,Homer,that's great. even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
40811,Homer,"one of each, please."
23175,Homer,"movies aren't stupid! they fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""lethal weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
35067,Homer,bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but i didn't think it was the right thing to do.
14765,Homer,come again?
29802,Homer,"well, i would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. i've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. okay, you've found your snitch."
36963,Homer,"well, i've taken eight months off. it's time to get back on the horse."
36513,Homer,"hey, it's me."
29956,Homer,on the radio.
29415,Homer,"dammit! i would've been perfect as rachel's irish cousin. so you're all doing each other, are ya? well, who's going to put out for old seamus?"
24816,Homer,"hey, what happened to...?"
24848,Homer,"oh, yeah... perfect. now then..."
34299,Homer,"good point, bart."
28924,Homer,"hey, take it easy on skinner. he's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
37282,Homer,i don't like the sound of that funeral march.
29294,Homer,"oh, i love to see my man eat."
24787,Homer,woo hoo!
25398,Homer,"hey, any friend of marge is a friend of mine."
34084,Homer,"marge, please. you're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
16571,Homer,"okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. now we need code names. i'll be ""cueball."" skinner can be ""eightball"", barney will be ""twelveball,"" and moe, you can be ""cueball."""
40554,Homer,well... i dunno... you and i might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
14932,Homer,babies.
18675,Homer,do i ever!
24410,Homer,there's no good place!
26113,Homer,here you go.
26380,Homer,"this job'll be perfect. i'm gonna leave this world the way i entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman i love."
33011,Homer,there he is!
32267,Homer,i think it goes here.
15031,Homer,"no, tell me now!"
32210,Homer,"thanks! you know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! no wait, i forgot about that other guy. sorry, you're third."
30996,Homer,nooooo!
13838,Homer,"good night, son."
18162,Homer,no. no. no. ewww. why is this on the floor?
13239,Homer,"yeah, falls'll getcha."
25819,Homer,good as new.
26268,Homer,"well, good work, blue-hair 'n' brocko-witch. okay, that was mine."
40979,Homer,"okay, brother! grab the next plane to springfield. we got a couch that folds out..."
16760,Homer,"hey guys, look what i smuggled aboard."
29894,Homer,don't worry -- ray'll be back any minute.
15878,Homer,"all right. but if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar."
39301,Homer,"oh, no you don't. no. no. get away from me. uh-uh."
23489,Homer,"brace yourselves, everybody. you're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. you might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
39050,Homer,when you're sixteen i'll drive you to cincinnati. and you'll see what there is to see.
18440,Homer,wait a minute! there's probably a --
30540,Homer,hmmm. i will run for mayor!
35969,Homer,leave her alone! that's my only talking daughter!
41398,Homer,"you okay, daddy?"
17614,Homer,everything lasts forever.
23711,Homer,"i'm the president and the decision is mine. we're hell's satans. besides, i've already made our club jackets."
29182,Homer,"oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
35834,Homer,they were so childless and miserable.
29793,Homer,"stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. everyone gets a prison job but me. all my best friends are guards. they think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
20821,Homer,i've never been so happy.
21677,Homer,"well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. where's bart?"
38954,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
19400,Homer,"c'mon, flanders. there's got to be something you hate. what about mosquito bites?"
39245,Homer,"oh, i certainly do."
32701,Homer,so you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?
36358,Homer,what happened to my mini-pool table? i was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
34130,Homer,"marge, my brain is like a computer, and i file away grampa's stories in a very special place."
37444,Homer,no.
36657,Homer,"i've had it for a long time. i was just about to throw it out, and then this happened."
14153,Homer,huh? what?
18138,Homer,sorry.
25274,Homer,"come on, marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: john rocker, o.j. simpson, dorf..."
31696,Homer,i just thought for once i could be the cool guy in your movie. but all i am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
25003,Homer,let's dust a few fossils.
20266,Homer,a c... a coffin!
35476,Homer,"oh ned, i never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
20412,Homer,flaaaan-ders... flaaaan-ders...
25314,Homer,"you're right. but just to be safe, maybe i should chain him up."
16713,Homer,"marge, that's what i bought it for!"
15243,Homer,my hammock! do you understand? mine! don't look that way.
31307,Homer,"bart, there's something i have to tell you father to son. i passed out on your turtle and killed it. someday you'll thank me."
40101,Homer,no.
36428,Homer,"no... not you... next... big fan but no... cleatus the football robot, you're my only hope!"
21372,Homer,hope this stuff holds.
22806,Homer,"there, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?"
17468,Homer,"ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?"
22161,Homer,"hey, that's great."
31130,Homer,nine volt! double a! d!-d!-d!-d! cordless drill!
32318,Homer,think. think.
28272,Homer,"aw marge, i bet you've gotten that out of your system."
21278,Homer,"sure i can, honey-kitten."
27350,Homer,more free samples.
19193,Homer,nothing.
13860,Homer,"whew! just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
15925,Homer,mmm... pie.
26035,Homer,"all right turkey. where are you? turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
29135,Homer,"son, i've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. don't rock the boat. don't even get in the boat."
31217,Homer,and then today at lunch lenny and i went to the park and rented a rowboat. carl sketched us from the bank. summer days.
18500,Homer,"i'm sure they're fine, honey."
39658,Homer,"the first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness."
35491,Homer,"there's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
34325,Homer,"hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
19667,Homer,did you say mary pop--
41220,Homer,tell a lie. tell a lie.
37287,Homer,"son, if there's one thing i've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! it's so frickin' boring! run, boy! i'll create a distraction!"
16103,Homer,and then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
37271,Homer,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
29379,Homer,www.nuclear-secrets.com.
17442,Homer,"marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but i promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex."
31920,Homer,mood swings?! mood swings. mood swings!
26471,Homer,semper fi.
29961,Homer,"aw, my little boy's in love."
31446,Homer,marge's show!
30538,Homer,what can i do? i'm only one man.
13905,Homer,i-i'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
18525,Homer,"oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane!"
37717,Homer,"well, we've gotta do it! i never leave a job unfinished. it's as true now as that week i worked on the high school yearbook. so much infighting. i had to get outta there!"
40807,Homer,"i was afraid you'd cancel our date so i stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... i hope."
21721,Homer,"i'll show you, hair!"
33559,Homer,"oh no, oh no, ohhh no. there is no way homer simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun."
31116,Homer,"i love it when you're not into it. oh yeah, baby. oh yeah that's it ignore me. i'm not even here."
36326,Homer,"well, islands are always entertaining, from gilligan to iwo jima."
19836,Homer,"you know, honey, when i think of all the good times we've had together-- aaagh!"
27984,Homer,"kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog."
29592,Homer,you leave maggie to me.
23048,Homer,"a little late for ""could've's,"" marge."
15235,Homer,mmm... no.
17993,Homer,great. there's only one thing i ask in return.
36416,Homer,"okay, i'll make a stranger love me forever."
22635,Homer,"oh, honey, you missed a great race. bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and i won!"
24746,Homer,"oh no, lisa's gone! and nothing will bring her back. unless..."
26236,Homer,"ooh, here's a good one: the world's most overrated saint."
18051,Homer,"man, these are primo seats. i could really go for a hot dog."
27587,Homer,"yeah, i make up words too. anyway, i was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so i can be a hero to my boy again."
26717,Homer,what kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
39638,Homer,will somebody help her?
40922,Homer,okay.
15639,Homer,"well, there's... jerry, the cowboy. and that big dipper-looking thing is alan... the cowboy."
35472,Homer,just the opposite of real life.
18728,Homer,"don't let krusty's death get you down, boy. people die all the time. just like that. why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. well, good night."
25471,Homer,"so hard to resist. mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... wait a minute, those are southwestern ingredients!"
13634,Homer,lousy cheap country...
15985,Homer,"well, you haven't heard the last of them."
22666,Homer,"okay, i'm ready to get out now... yoo hoo! hippie lady! hippie lady?! hey! hippie lady!"
31518,Homer,"don't worry, i make six of those a year."
39160,Homer,what the?
22425,Homer,"yes, briefly."
15193,Homer,"hand me my patching trowel, boy."
27660,Homer,it was an application to open a cinnabon stand.
27570,Homer,that's right! crawling on your knees!
21837,Homer,"come on, ron, we're not wanted here."
38831,Homer,what are you doing here?
24951,Homer,what the hell is that?!
41151,Homer,"ooh, the glutimus maximizer."
36086,Homer,forget it. we don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
31486,Homer,angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of headmaster greystash...
16697,Homer,you?
21197,Homer,"that was yesterday, moron!"
34313,Homer,what the... you're a month behind on homework?!
29126,Homer,to date!
19269,Homer,"oh, i don't know how to punish you! what does marge usually do?"
23698,Homer,"it's mine. finally, i've won the respect of my fellow... get away from it!"
28109,Homer,it's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
41027,Homer,hel-lo? hel-lo einstein? i said a place to put my drink. you know those super slakers they sell at the kwik-e-mart? the cup is this big!
22415,Homer,it better have.
28293,Homer,i'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! you can't go to that school!
34707,Homer,i would kill for that.

40276,Homer,"helen, i'm in a caribbean mood tonight. how 'bout giving me ""baby elephant walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?"
32473,Homer,"i don't want to live without you, marge."
17445,Homer,"hey, marge! this guy looks like apu!"
27307,Homer,"phew, just italians."
40213,Homer,"i hope burns and i can count on your support, honey."
26649,Homer,we have a kitchen?!
24130,Homer,mm-hmm.
21566,Homer,"oh, all right. maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong."
22742,Homer,i'm keeping a promise to an american roadmaster.
34021,Homer,"of course i do, marge. can you still love a man who's half-beer?"
29320,Homer,i sawed you on the television.

40674,Homer,dad!
26421,Homer,would a u.s. dollar change your mind?
31956,Homer,"yeah, we're awesome. this'll make a great toilet seat!"
41288,Homer,"that's right, numbskull! your son's made a fool of you in front of the whole town!"
16859,Homer,"son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. it's how drunk you get."
37310,Homer,i like that picture of the sneaker with wings. i'm gonna flee!
20208,Homer,ah so.
14734,Homer,uh... i gotta think about this.
36902,Homer,"oh, right."
13725,Homer,"it's all here, and it's all backwards. that's right."
24170,Homer,"oh, really? well, if you'll excuse me, i've got some civilization to spread like butter on the english muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies..."
23903,Homer,wha...?!
13354,Homer,so i said: i must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.

35968,Homer,"u.s. of a! great song, ted. when's our next gig? are we goin' to new york, or--"
40990,Homer,"... and our three children, bart, lisa and maggie."

16864,Homer,"are you mad, woman? you never know when an old calendar might come in handy. sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? and these tv guides... so many memories."
37622,Homer,"hey, hey, it's not what you think, lou. lou! lou! lou! lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
31838,Homer,could someone bring me another barf cone?

37317,Homer,hm. would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
40022,Homer,"burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? go get 'em."
33775,Homer,"see, it works. and un-sults are just the beginning. there's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?"
20501,Homer,"okay, gotta run. apu, i'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before marge yells at you again."
35523,Homer,"look, i'm not weird or anything, i just like to feel like i'm friends with everybody."
25559,Homer,just like jimmy carter.
25610,Homer,"ooo, can i have a brownie?"
41573,Homer,"at least we know there'll never be a president worse than bill clinton. imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit. that's the worst sin a president could commit."
32605,Homer,oh no! he's talking to that mailroom guy.
37671,Homer,i'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
31142,Homer,sorry i'm late! i was just gathering my counseling equipment.
13695,Homer,"hey, flanders. is everything okay?"
15060,Homer,"boy, when lisa comes in, i want you to make a big fuss over how she looks."
21857,Homer,"okay, i'll stop."
39756,Homer,"i wanted to surprise you. i couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could i?"
25260,Homer,"and finally, make sure the net is tight and springy."
14042,Homer,"do it for your old man, boy!"
21097,Homer,"okay, marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, lisa's a clergyman, maggie is seven people and bart was wounded in vietnam..."
38640,Homer,what the hell was that?!
21925,Homer,"aww, you're just saying that."
26721,Homer,leave me alone!
34590,Homer,mmmm. good mac and cheese.
16702,Homer,"apu, if it'll make you feel any better, i've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish flanders was dead."
24772,Homer,"marge, your posture looks terrible."
13414,Homer,we're back!
37458,Homer,"the power of friendship is so amazing, i don't feel at all suspicious of carl."
38870,Homer,to earth!
27912,Homer,his wife is dead!
33376,Homer,yes! i'm senior class president! i get a parking spot if the assistant principal isn't using it!
34031,Homer,"oh, well... i didn't know that."
20173,Homer,disco duck and fleetwood mac...
34991,Homer,huh?
31188,Homer,just get the money.
33621,Homer,"marge, this time i'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. let's get out of here!"
31611,Homer,and decrepit.
21139,Homer,is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
21198,Homer,"good news, everyone. i got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service."
34978,Homer,please! let me have it! come on! give it to me right in the mouth!
38634,Homer,killdozers.
28820,Homer,plead the fifth amend-what?
34816,Homer,woo-hoo!
28021,Homer,"that reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in shelbyville."
27259,Homer,"yeah, but... okay... oh..."
30921,Homer,"lisa's right! it is a cool, super sport!"
15451,Homer,spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
40916,Homer,remember? who could forget?
32450,Homer,uh-huh.
13274,Homer,"wait a second! i'm in jail because of you! you were my friend, and you betrayed me."
16756,Homer,"you're right, marge. just like the time i could've met mr. t at the mall. the entire day, i kept saying, i'll go a little later, i'll go a little later.' and then when i got there, they told me he just left. and when i asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. well, i'm never gonna let something like that happen again. i'm going into space, right now."
19933,Homer,"there, there, shut up, boy. we'll just get you a new dog."
24457,Homer,"look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
20518,Homer,yeah!
35111,Homer,"sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims."
31531,Homer,"for your information, since i bought it i put on a ton of weight."
24208,Homer,"good work, everyone. we're sure to be first in line for duff days."
30182,Homer,like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
36842,Homer,check out my new look!
38016,Homer,why isn't she having an affair?
20976,Homer,"oh. but... you run it, right?"
40997,Homer,will you kids shut up?
26115,Homer,"hm, twelve... well, i remember i used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. with these two guys."
21660,Homer,"all right. one for ""resident""..."
18654,Homer,i'm going to punch george bush in the face!
14136,Homer,what? i sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
25465,Homer,who are you?
27017,Homer,flanders?! a perfect vacation ruined.
19999,Homer,i didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
25555,Homer,woo hoo!
15654,Homer,that's right. and who might you be?
16107,Homer,ow! why you little...
17131,Homer,"hm, i'm gonna need a bigger drill."
22430,Homer,"max power / he's the man / whose name you'd love to touch / but you mustn't touch / his name sounds good in your ear / but when you say it, you mustn't fear / 'cause his name can be said by anyone..."
25342,Homer,my tennis stick!
38240,Homer,why so quiet?
18615,Homer,"come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors."
17625,Homer,oh. sorry.
22888,Homer,great. i'll do the pony while you do the lions.
38183,Homer,"what you need, my friend, is a canadian duff. beauty, eh?"
31834,Homer,"what'sa matter, buddy? the american flag not good enough for ya?"
39219,Homer,"what do you think, kids?"
37542,Homer,"boy, oh boy!"
22201,Homer,i don't think so.
18967,Homer,oldies?
16526,Homer,"bart, i don't want to alarm you, but there may be a boogeyman or boogeymen in the house!"
40034,Homer,whoo hoo! all right!
22376,Homer,door?
26141,Homer,two... one...
20184,Homer,"now, son, on your first day of school, i'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
23549,Homer,okay.
37853,Homer,snow?! snow!!!
31560,Homer,dammit!
13940,Homer,i'm your man!
21242,Homer,can't someone else do it?
31853,Homer,that's a red card. you're out of the game!
41552,Homer,kingdom of numb / closet of hurt / feelings are dumb / kisses are dirt...
29890,Homer,"one, two, three, four -- i declare a nail war!"
37460,Homer,"guys, i think we might need a new song. four best friends who ne-ver quar-rel"

27885,Homer,margarita... that's mexican for marge. i'll take that as a sign!
24566,Homer,whaddaya think? do you love it?
31814,Homer,all because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
15468,Homer,"oh yeah, that's the stuff."
38359,Homer,"oh, everyone does, son. that's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
23624,Homer,"hi, honey!"
35105,Homer,drive my kids to school?! never!
31930,Homer,zombie kill.
17085,Homer,"oh, good, reverend lovejoy will make marge take me back. he has to push the sanctity of marriage or his god will punish him."
18204,Homer,"no! i've gotta pass this class for my kids. son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
23362,Homer,who is this?
14262,Homer,marge!
39681,Homer,"nice grizzly, nice grizzly."
18892,Homer,"okay! go, boy! go find help! go find help, boy!"
23397,Homer,i can't believe i destroyed the earth.
32056,Homer,"well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. that makes us friends, right?"
41086,Homer,type! type!
13562,Homer,okay. five times nine.
24225,Homer,"okay, now do moe."
22266,Homer,i'm going to warm up the car.
14565,Homer,no.
24193,Homer,"now, over here i've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. it's mostly dristan and holy water, but it does the job."
30524,Homer,safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
17497,Homer,this is gonna to be great.
23144,Homer,sweet.
22329,Homer,"it's a deal. hey, moe. wanna come with me and wally to the super bowl?"
32500,Homer,"finally, some service. now listen. we wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- michigan or better."
28869,Homer,"oh my god! if i get one more d.u.i., they'll take away my license. and what will i leave when i rent rollerblades?"
25118,Homer,but i've had thousands of head x-rays. how come no one ever noticed it before?
31697,Homer,i'll pay for most of this!
33488,Homer,"yeah, you'd treat her right."
25815,Homer,owww!
29498,Homer,uh... ice?
22750,Homer,"well, son. i guess it's time to go home."
30498,Homer,"oh, it's heartfelt. there's no escaping that. thanks, honey."
32902,Homer,she said i didn't suck?
25239,Homer,"get that one! faster! you got half time for the other ones. oh, good. oh no, that one's slowing up! oh, good. oh, that one's wobbling! oh, up... you got that before i even said it."
37907,Homer,"i now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""cosmic wars episode seven""."
34907,Homer,"all right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
32963,Homer,"yeah. i'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. do you have change for a nickel?"
36581,Homer,"now, before we start, what's the safe word?"
34644,Homer,i don't know.
37863,Homer,fine. i'll drink alone.
14055,Homer,"what's the matter, moe?"
21127,Homer,"uh, i'm homer simpson, your trusted employee."
23977,Homer,"i.d.? man, charlie didn't ask for i.d. when i fought at la choy and chun king. i saw my best friend's head explode at margaret cho."
33037,Homer,"thanks, marge."
24223,Homer,"well, it's time to get some closure. extreme closure."
40274,Homer,"oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
31612,Homer,"oooh, the the! but why are you helping me?"
23378,Homer,"that can't be true, honey. if it were, i'd be terrified."
14316,Homer,"hey, what's up?"
36486,Homer,you wanna honk your jazz tube?
28246,Homer,how do you figure?
22079,Homer,"well, i'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial."
14026,Homer,ow.
26733,Homer,must suppress rage.
33639,Homer,"just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
32348,Homer,"now all i have to do is think of a clever line before i pull the trigger. oh, that's a perfect one. but i don't need to say it out loud, 'cause i'm by myself."
40374,Homer,because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. and i'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
40037,Homer,"dear god, give a bald guy a break. amen."
13914,Homer,because she stopped loving me.
33066,Homer,"get out here, boy! i wanna punish you before i get drunk and merciful!"
19756,Homer,"there's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. and bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
24180,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? the truth is, i'm no missionary. i work in a nuclear power plant."
32162,Homer,"and now, to taxi to the terminal."
32839,Homer,what could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
22944,Homer,i don't know. just give me the dollar.
18384,Homer,eight fifty-eight. first time i've ever been early for work. except for all those daylight savings days. lousy farmers.
19890,Homer,"oh, well... fun's over, but i still have my wonderful money."
35428,Homer,maggie!
19332,Homer,"as you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and i think your mom might not be happy with me."
13898,Homer,"now lady, i'm buying this pony for my little girl, and i don't care what it costs."
32157,Homer,"hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?"
13469,Homer,"it's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
34827,Homer,drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... i'll show 'em -- i'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
29087,Homer,"oh, this is so confusing. i'd like a brief recess."
18584,Homer,"lemme set the scene for you, marge."
21397,Homer,these are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
28274,Homer,woo-hoo! woo-hoo!
31927,Homer,"okay, here's the solution -- i want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so i can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
37182,Homer,how many kids will jazz corrupt?
19405,Homer,"hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
38007,Homer,this is a violation of our human rights.
36546,Homer,maybe.
35816,Homer,"so, everybody good?"
24836,Homer,that does it. i'm getting a computer! as soon as somebody lets me outta here!
17584,Homer,"why don't people like me, marge?"
22549,Homer,will do!
39012,Homer,"and now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg."
17840,Homer,"all bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to australia?"
29879,Homer,i think that means six more weeks of autumn.
37742,Homer,what the?
17759,Homer,"what's everyone so worked up about? so there's a comet. big deal. it'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
30735,Homer,"i bet they're from massachusetts. you know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
22808,Homer,"oh, yeah. that's a fine looking..."
34227,Homer,um... your cut of what?
31129,Homer,bart! hand me that sack of batteries!
21623,Homer,and now you're ready for a night on the town.
39229,Homer,"oh, yeah my christmas bonus. how silly of me. this'll be the best christmas yet. the best any family ever had. heh-heh."
26784,Homer,you might hear from your friends or co-workers that apu isn't living at home anymore.
38464,Homer,what's on tv?
39447,Homer,"bart! no! no! no, no! oh no, bart, no! don't! noooo!"
23480,Homer,time to give mother nature a little goose.
13485,Homer,where's the letter?
33075,Homer,"for your information, the ""daily growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
37053,Homer,what women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
14404,Homer,"look lisa, i bought you a malibu stacey chinchilla coat."
17925,Homer,"nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
13868,Homer,"please, you've got to open that store."
13275,Homer,exactly. exaaaaactly.
13936,Homer,no!
26672,Homer,y'ello.
33061,Homer,i don't want your pity booze. i'll pay for it myself.
30676,Homer,his hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
39539,Homer,"not now, marge."
29760,Homer,"welcome, welcome. if my wife asks, you're here for a boz skaggs concert."
29136,Homer,"just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. but don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy."
33257,Homer,i saw them unloading dynamite!
28504,Homer,why do the things i love always burn?
25820,Homer,"well, i... there. right as rain, there."
27839,Homer,"no, the voters will decide that in november. i was talking about this."
26198,Homer,"look, gabriel. we're learning to work together."
16255,Homer,"they'll grow back, right?"
41503,Homer,"wow! look at me, er uh, mom! i am, 'er uh, president kennedy!"
21469,Homer,"um, no time like the present."
14922,Homer,fine. i will!
14841,Homer,"dammit, i said full power!"
34209,Homer,"now, what should i buy first? hitler's baseball? a mirror that gives me advice?"
34290,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
33150,Homer,i wish i'd never met you!
36253,Homer,"ah, here it is: hydraulic systems flush... eeprom bios autoboot... conversation mode? they can talk?!"
33799,Homer,anne of cleves!
24110,Homer,finally.
18538,Homer,woo hoo! ow!
36983,Homer,"hollywood has taught you well, my son. now let's push ""play."""
32516,Homer,oh yeah!
14199,Homer,"marge, you're as pretty as princess leia and as smart as yoda."
27547,Homer,"see, bart. i saved you."
25226,Homer,don't worry your spiky little head. i've got it all planned out.
39642,Homer,shut up!
15620,Homer,have a good time! wait a minute.
18393,Homer,you dragged me all the way from work for that?
32234,Homer,"before you go, could you hire your own replacement? but make sure she's not crazy like you."
13615,Homer,ooh... and miss? just one more question --
18227,Homer,"bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and moe-balls!"
24659,Homer,we've got the who playing here tonight.
21921,Homer,b-b-but the poncho...

16248,Homer,promised marge...
27208,Homer,woo hoo! i got skybox tickets! and with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. life is...
20344,Homer,"close your eyes marge, i've got a surprise for you."
35230,Homer,eurocentric! when do we have wacky adventures?
35557,Homer,cold. so cold.
16403,Homer,flanders! snap out of it!
36652,Homer,"open file, click and...invested! hey lisa, check out your college fund!"
18109,Homer,hmm... i wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
17029,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i am slow..."
32335,Homer,"what?! oh my god, my sweet margie! okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero."
38277,Homer,i will when you open your mind to change!
27263,Homer,if we formed a club we could serve drinks.
30257,Homer,"honey, please, just listen to what i have to say."
20099,Homer,and that's when the chuds came at me.
14141,Homer,cuz... i...
31338,Homer,"can you say ""side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""
37177,Homer,licking the wrapper.
29363,Homer,"oh, i see what's goin' on. you can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence."

38881,Homer,what the? pfft. gibberish! pure gibberish!
21923,Homer,"aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. i just don't have the discipline to be a hippie."
39949,Homer,ahhhh!
30613,Homer,"wow! i've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."

29330,Homer,"good news, marge!"
36196,Homer,woo hoo!
28097,Homer,i'll do it!
32864,Homer,don't you dare post that review.
15803,Homer,mmmm... beer.
26237,Homer,i've used up all these records.
29608,Homer,it brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. photo mouse pads for sale out back.
18301,Homer,bart?! is that you?
39766,Homer,"all right, we're clean. now we'll... put maggie to bed."
40813,Homer,"oh, isn't she great? hail queen marge! woo woo! long live the queen!"
14970,Homer,is that what i think it is?
14400,Homer,"look, what's the problem? the kids are happy, you smell like meryl streep, and i've got that foot massager i've always wanted."
31877,Homer,"well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? it works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs."
15788,Homer,woo hoo!
23847,Homer,"remember my love affair with ali mcgraw? she used to call me ""preppy."" then she died."
18441,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. it was pretty scary up there. but... for a while i feared for my life."
38582,Homer,"there's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you."
40302,Homer,wow.
17992,Homer,me and bart'll take hugh out on the town this afternoon.
26432,Homer,"look bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason."
27055,Homer,"oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
17426,Homer,but those shows all look so crummy.
38558,Homer,"well, family, we should be proud. we took on corporate america and broke even."
32048,Homer,"i like that. but i'm on a bit of a health kick, so i'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: snickles, gooey bears, charlottesville chew, nice 'n' many, kat kit, herschel's smooches, mrs. bad bar, and milk dudes."
16694,Homer,this isn't very convenient.
25510,Homer,"of course you are. marge, i've finally discovered the reason god made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. and i've got to share that gift with the world."
18331,Homer,help! i don't have much time!
24281,Homer,especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
22207,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll figure it out. this isn't rocket science."
40932,Homer,excellent.
26481,Homer,in real life he would die.
28571,Homer,they live in fancy houses in other places.
35227,Homer,hmm?
14284,Homer,"ahh, bart. daddy's little angel."
15657,Homer,this is even more painful than it looks.
32439,Homer,marge! marge!
15278,Homer,"but marge, alan thicke is throwing knives at ricardo montalban."
35120,Homer,"well, i don't know... it's a lot of work."
17380,Homer,"now, this is going to take all my skill."
39328,Homer,nine hundred and twelve?
37054,Homer,that is the stupidest...
41512,Homer,bom bom bom bom
30514,Homer,"okay, lisa. time for daddy's big surprise!"
29905,Homer,did you make enough for ray?
33725,Homer,"well, at least i can eat again!"
17382,Homer,"see you in hell, candy boys."
18686,Homer,what's the point of going out? we're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
18977,Homer,forever... forever... forever...
39416,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
38380,Homer,not like that. it's like this. ...smithers ... ...mr. largo... ...danny kaye... what? everyone knows.
40788,Homer,it helps me study. heh-heh-heh.
23498,Homer,who cares what it is? it's growing! i've saved the farm!
26357,Homer,"and by funny stuff i mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any john woo film--"
19349,Homer,wait! i want one last chance to enjoy single life.
22506,Homer,"we sold it, didn't we?"
25753,Homer,"yes, but then i discovered the joys of raising children."
35163,Homer,"i was born a rollin' eighty, and i'll die a rollin' eighty."
22718,Homer,"uh, yeah. i need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
41052,Homer,"look at that get-up. heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... assassins!"
40138,Homer,hey! pretty slick!
27806,Homer,aw... my baby's first words.
16119,Homer,"exam?!? oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
39752,Homer,"whoop! don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. beauty, isn't she?"
40181,Homer,ouch! censer..
24830,Homer,let's just say lisa gave me an early christmas present. the gift of dignity.
34375,Homer,"no! if you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
29772,Homer,"my rv is gone! it was more than a motor home. it was a car i could go to the bathroom in. hey, a note."
33943,Homer,i'm right here! i've been here all along!
32442,Homer,"um, so... tell me about your day."
41360,Homer,judi dench?!
35305,Homer,these are my keys.
26567,Homer,and in february... it's hot?
26500,Homer,stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. piece of crap...
33289,Homer,"oh no, no bees? oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?"
17822,Homer,benedict arnold!
16953,Homer,my secret shame.
19447,Homer,"this is 'cause i kicked you, isn't it?"
23569,Homer,"thank you, bart's teacher. you know, kids, my teachers said i would never amount to anything. and until last week, they were dead right. but now i've achieved perfection."
19091,Homer,"marge! i've got a new job! it's with globex corporation. i get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. and they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
25300,Homer,"yes, darling?"
23201,Homer,"hi, marge. it's me, homer."
25650,Homer,"i'm sorry. i thought he was a party robot, like in that play i wrote."
15101,Homer,did i mention she was dead?
25183,Homer,"oh god, my back! it hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
22296,Homer,"okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."
15172,Homer,"no, it's true. you know, when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher's mitt. but, my dad wouldn't get it for me. so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. the doctor thought i might have brain damage."
23271,Homer,well -- what do you think?
23819,Homer,"sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? he hit her again."
33263,Homer,gotta prove the genie was right...
25085,Homer,that motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. like this...
41408,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
36536,Homer,go where?
25162,Homer,we were what what in a what what?
24980,Homer,"no, no. don't protect him. you'll work off that cake in the acid mines."
35925,Homer,"take that, centers of art and commerce. and this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. that's right, i'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!"
19738,Homer,"oh. i'll just be another minute, john. have a seat."
14752,Homer,pfft.
25322,Homer,"no, of course not. now aim for your mother's heart."
26277,Homer,i'm only doin' this one more time.
39692,Homer,oh no.
39966,Homer,"it matters not, mon frere. and after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the off ramp inn."
32570,Homer,"kids, your mom is with another man, and i need you to help me find out who he is. hm... is this really something i should show you kids?"
41007,Homer,"hi'ya, team."
28200,Homer,why was i born?
22600,Homer,they know i'm kidding.
23738,Homer,that's more like it. i'm looking for...
22474,Homer,"so, trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
31768,Homer,i'm going with the cologne i wore on our first date.
15615,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah."
24199,Homer,because you're all terrible sinners.
24194,Homer,"so have fun everybody. and who knows? maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise."
27498,Homer,"die, monster!"
38381,Homer,now where's she going?
32410,Homer,where is it?
28478,Homer,"see you in spring, toes!"
22391,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
23156,Homer,piece o' cake. now where's that kid with my latte?
19949,Homer,you mean maggie?
14214,Homer,"oh, i wrote down what i was gonna say on a card. stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
13433,Homer,are you?
37185,Homer,"sure, they could be here. who knows?"
16492,Homer,"well, maybe i want to. but then i think about marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. sometimes i'd just like to..."
23384,Homer,but i was gonna loot you a present!
19067,Homer,we think we saw hugo at the airport! he was boarding a plane to switzerland and... oh.
27934,Homer,/ let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... wind should be coming in from the south... time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
28217,Homer,"all right, i will."
30749,Homer,boy! push down on the bumper! then i can back the car up and save myself.
30852,Homer,"marge, toot-toot and her son escaped!"
14756,Homer,i am not.
28342,Homer,"ohh, and a very manly one, if i may say so, m'lord."
22479,Homer,"just try it for two weeks. if you're not completely satisfied, you can be busty st. claire."
33338,Homer,"oh, that. we were actually just going out for brunch and i got lost. but don't worry, officer. we'll definitely have a talk with the boy."
21297,Homer,"oh, stop it!"
37455,Homer,"yeah, that's probably what happened."
36337,Homer,we've had stupider!
31672,Homer,actually... that was me.
36112,Homer,aw... i mean arrrgh!
34378,Homer,look at that.
19329,Homer,"""dear homer,"" aww. ""sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. i left you hot dogs for dinner. they're thawing in the sink."""
15157,Homer,"all right. all right. bart, go to your room."
41277,Homer,just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
29483,Homer,can i learn it at a happy place?
14325,Homer,"uh, could you edit that last part out?"
17269,Homer,"gimme the bat, marge. gimme the bat! gimme the bat! c'mon, gimme the bat. gimme the bat ba-bat!"
17369,Homer,"sorry kids, but this is one event i want my darling wife by my side."
21647,Homer,"oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like thomas edison, jr. you know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. oh, and later, he raised turkeys. that was on his turkey farm."
28490,Homer,thank you! freak.
33670,Homer,"impossibly high. now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!"
13815,Homer,"oh no, wait, it was over there."
14610,Homer,"dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
31515,Homer,christian charity? what does a porn star have to do with this? he's gotta go!
18060,Homer,i blew it again.
37358,Homer,"and you know, marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
30761,Homer,i miss bart! i can't leave him in that awful camp!
19410,Homer,"hey, marge, you don't smoke!"
31724,Homer,why are you telling me? he's your father-in-law.
30533,Homer,this looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
23168,Homer,"how old are you, anyway?"
37010,Homer,"don't be silly, ""mary ellen."""
28350,Homer,"sweet freedom, here i--"
40089,Homer,the key!
26140,Homer,"this is launch master homer, counting down. five, four, three..."
19575,Homer,"hey, what's all that commotion outside? why, it's one of those pretzel wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
28421,Homer,that's funny.
16449,Homer,hello hotline? i am very tempted by another woman.
19484,Homer,the loneliest man in the world! he'll understand me!
27670,Homer,i guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
38534,Homer,"oh marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. man, if only you could do that with bart."
22453,Homer,uh-oh. here comes lorne michaels. pretend you don't see him.
23329,Homer,pedestrian.
32273,Homer,"uh, that's still too sexy for my wife."
30898,Homer,"there's this guy that got killed -- i think it was in miami? so c.s.i. miami investiga-ted-ed it. then a family said how much they loved the olive garden. then i fell asleep. when i woke up, letterman was talking to alias."
39418,Homer,"i can't do it, mr. burns."
30809,Homer,"oh, why did i lead you down here to find those stupid coins?"
39243,Homer,wow. can i do that?
37860,Homer,but christmas is a special time. and i like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.
17665,Homer,i was at my work station when suddenly...
18638,Homer,"hey, what's the big deal? it's just some new guy moving in!"
23651,Homer,"hey apu. sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?"
23978,Homer,"why should i? did my country give me a parade? no, man! they spat at me and..."
21695,Homer,"if anyone wants me, i'll be eating alone in the basement."
26068,Homer,no problem.
38830,Homer,"man, you are a nutcracker. but i've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on christmas? well, being without them is worse. can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
23852,Homer,one million times...
34795,Homer,bankers away!
27083,Homer,here you go.
25999,Homer,"look, buddy, i don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
20051,Homer,"barney, where's my car?!!"
15645,Homer,"come on, bart. we had our fun. remember when i used to push you on the swing?"
33077,Homer,"all around the something world,"
32457,Homer,"kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
37523,Homer,"kids, i've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. sir, i need this train!"
34751,Homer,woo hoo! underpants dinner!
22965,Homer,good. good. one more.
23696,Homer,oh! i need a dance partner! what about you?
15320,Homer,cutting my nails? brushing my teeth?
32039,Homer,"oh god, my gums! they hurt so much!"
20764,Homer,"i've got a proposition for you, cooder."
27188,Homer,"that's not true, lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song."
38741,Homer,"great practice, guys. what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
23424,Homer,coming through... challenge... duel... hi lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...
26218,Homer,"ah, the sweet couple of seconds before i remember why i'm sleeping on the lawn."
38610,Homer,authentic italian food.
37897,Homer,"guys, guys, i saw the radioactive man movie! here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. number nine--"
36768,Homer,"so, which do you prefer, m'lady? tom selleck, rollie fingers or pringles man?"
21068,Homer,all right. i can't waste any more time. people's lives are depending on me. mr. sulu -- make a left!
15114,Homer,"barney! not you, too!"
41564,Homer,"razorblade of apathy / shave me with your irony / shave me, shave me..."
38683,Homer,a haircut? let me see!
31621,Homer,"monsieur meaux, i would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment."
23305,Homer,okay.
23717,Homer,they printed my photo of our gang!
23563,Homer,woo hoo! i'm ten pins away from perfection.
23802,Homer,i don't know.
24496,Homer,"honey, i'm home! the boss is coming to dinner and i need a clean shirt."
28247,Homer,you're right. people should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
32804,Homer,just sit still in my lap!
27583,Homer,"so, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?"
33420,Homer,"thanks, guys."
31919,Homer,how is that possible?
26275,Homer,count fudge-ula? i thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
22541,Homer,"oh, no let me out! let's get outta here!"
28786,Homer,"how 'bout ""diet coke -- the movie?""... ""president air bud: tail to the chief?""... ""my big fat greek salad?"""
13752,Homer,huh? noise. bad noise!
18640,Homer,why did he have to move in on my territory? look at him. thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
18014,Homer,"my ""best of ray stevens featuring the streak"" album! so it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
22685,Homer,oh yeah? what do you know about it? y--
33835,Homer,the heat is off. the hissing from the radiator is a snake.
21260,Homer,"hey, ray. cleanin' out the old office, eh?"

35554,Homer,"oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. think, geniuses."
23066,Homer,"hey, you know, i once knew a man from nantucket."
33320,Homer,"don't worry, lisa. where else are they gonna go?"
19574,Homer,"hey, pretzels!"
28899,Homer,so many shoppers. ow! damn this... ow! resilient economy.
25634,Homer,"well, i really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... although i do like the occasional beer..."
22624,Homer,"come on, lisa, try and see this from the omnitouch corporation's point of view."
36368,Homer,and the ocean'll do all of the work!
31487,Homer,"lisa, wake up! they're taking angelica to mount purgatorium."
36683,Homer,i can't believe my dad never told me he had another wife. the man i looked up to my whole life.
40595,Homer,"shut up, boy."
27693,Homer,"hey there, little red riding hood. i ate your granny and now i'm in the mood for love."
21308,Homer,"hey, these power sauce bars look pretty healthy."
38093,Homer,"if it's important, they'll call back."
21771,Homer,"ooh, look at it go."
35924,Homer,"you all know i'm a big fan of american meat. although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
29383,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"
24329,Homer,"well, if it isn't little miss ""i'm not wasting my life anymore."" which he is."
32306,Homer,"okay, we've got time for one more."
27636,Homer,"i know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. there's the tongue-kissing festival... cinco de ocho... the hobo oscars... days just made for lovers. not widowers, lovers."
41301,Homer,"there he is. the fat, pathetic slob i'd be with four kids."
34698,Homer,"uh, the long island ice teas?"
17156,Homer,nooooooo! my sugar is melting! melting! oh what a world!
35832,Homer,only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
22715,Homer,i bet ol' red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
15796,Homer,god bless those pagans.
32687,Homer,wanna take a ride with your old man?
13715,Homer,why not?
28759,Homer,"oh, maggie will do just fine. she'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
35764,Homer,"c'mon, just pick a popular song."
30553,Homer,a little.
24853,Homer,hmmmmm.
23336,Homer,"oh, lisa... you saved me! and after all the bad things i said about you."
21712,Homer,"come here, you little--"
37553,Homer,"my only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; i often go online to see how lindsay wagner's looking now - fabulous; and i once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. but it's no secret how much i love my margie."
24646,Homer,you're right. we've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
23725,Homer,"caps and frisbees, sir."
27529,Homer,we'll just see about that.
16686,Homer,"hey, he's not happy at all. he lied to us through song. i hate when people do that."
40099,Homer,"well, thanks, karl. i don't know what to say."
35253,Homer,hey! mr. burns needs our help!
29148,Homer,to love our country is no chore...
19783,Homer,"hunting, eh?"
34854,Homer,"hurry up, boy. we have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid."
41090,Homer,"stop it, both of you. grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital."
16985,Homer,"where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free hbo - oooh, ""free willy!"""
27218,Homer,don't worry. we'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. the time will just fly by.
24916,Homer,"so, who brought us here?"
28807,Homer,oh yeah. that monkey got america through some tough times.
38384,Homer,beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
36917,Homer,"that's short for ""rrright you are!"""
30550,Homer,"now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!"
22790,Homer,"hey, look! oh, they're out of hot dogs! and the cole slaw has pineapple in it! german potato salad!"

37870,Homer,what? i'm saving them from the struggle of life.
25859,Homer,i'll bring the car around.
30786,Homer,"well, it did its job. everyone's wearing blue pants now."
16279,Homer,done.
24228,Homer,yeah!
38177,Homer,"""you have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" ooo, a support rock!"
34965,Homer,"uh, what's my name again?"
29743,Homer,"you can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?"
33668,Homer,look marge! it's just what you want. me spending the day with muggsy.
23580,Homer,flavor of the month? me?
21193,Homer,hey wait! stop! i have garbage!
38561,Homer,"keep your pants on, marge. it's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" and parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
22440,Homer,tie good. you like shirt?
38130,Homer,"circle ""other."""
33221,Homer,"lisa, sweetie... please, look at your daddy."
33123,Homer,i'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
29270,Homer,"hey sweetie, is mom winning?"
22298,Homer,bo-ring. go back to that infamy guy.
38825,Homer,because jerk-ass homer has become ass-jerk homer.
15647,Homer,stop it. stop it. stop it!
23533,Homer,i think so. the bone stopped the bullet.
25098,Homer,yahoo!
26686,Homer,and you wanted to take him to the hospital.
19038,Homer,"""wel-diddly-elcome simpsons."" oh, geez. he actually wrote ""diddly."""
20919,Homer,why all the pearls? why all the hair? why anything?
36518,Homer,"you're dead, j.j. get yourself buried!"
18509,Homer,we may be the best parents in the world.
40743,Homer,simpson.
21152,Homer,nice to meet you.
40784,Homer,"bart, pay attention. you may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
15234,Homer,mmm... no.
40423,Homer,this place is depressing.
13925,Homer,"marge, lisa loves me, the pony stays."
18812,Homer,"hello, mr. burns? this is your mother."
25780,Homer,i'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
26994,Homer,"yeah, it's a good group."
16648,Homer,how do you figure boy?
35900,Homer,yes. yes! got it!
30707,Homer,wait. can we have a moment in private?
34609,Homer,"you see, ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
17722,Homer,we're doomed!
22016,Homer,so... you're saying i don't need a new muffler?
21359,Homer,"my dad's a disgrace, just like bart's dad. me."
14569,Homer,like what?
19736,Homer,do i know you?
18010,Homer,i rode the teacups! then i got a little sick and i had to sit down. but then i rode 'em again!
18015,Homer,oh my god! he's got the precious cable tv cable!
24741,Homer,"well, moping won't make it better."
19293,Homer,take it off!
33208,Homer,just be yourself.
36335,Homer,and where will i walk?
21538,Homer,"all right, screw it. let's roll."
14477,Homer,"listen, marge, uh, how would you feel if i told you the dog ran away?"
25786,Homer,teamsters.
15327,Homer,"flanders, i thought i was your plow man."
17239,Homer,my hair! you chopped off my hair! oh god i'm ugly!
13795,Homer,he's talking funny talk.
17828,Homer,hey! i'm doing it! i'm doing it! i'm the greatest clown in the world!
36136,Homer,shut up! i'll fix you!
31634,Homer,wow. that had what i really like in a story: an ending.
38139,Homer,"yeah, these seem great. oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."
13837,Homer,ouch!
21296,Homer,time out... t... time out...
34812,Homer,"whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
32030,Homer,nothing's gonna ruin this one. the timer's a tickin.
39376,Homer,"you'll get that punk someday, moe."
25570,Homer,"yeah, it's like the allman brothers!"
17296,Homer,"hey, what the hell is that geek flanders doing on tv?"
39255,Homer,"yeah, well, merry christmas."
33196,Homer,"wow, so this is what this is."
31410,Homer,ice cream man! ice cream man!
28172,Homer,never mind. i'm death now.
22359,Homer,"oh, we're never gonna get out of... psst, cleaning lady. would you let us out of here?"
20079,Homer,marge? you got that? marge?!
34692,Homer,"now that i have all this free time, i thought i would do you a huge favor."
30076,Homer,a week? that's...seven days from now!
15650,Homer,hey!
14029,Homer,"dr. hibbert, lisa needs a. you! homewrecker!"
37570,Homer,to texting!
26572,Homer,wow. it's like he's on the dashboard of the entire country.
13221,Homer,"well, let's just say i hate crime."
38626,Homer,glad i could be of help...
32480,Homer,"now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. we're just gonna get a camera battery and go home."
23287,Homer,"marge, shh! it's important that no one know that i'm a food critic."
23117,Homer,"aww, movie tickets! that hardly seems worth destroying a car."
28716,Homer,i don't wanna go home! i'm not done talking to me!
30492,Homer,"oh, can i come with you? i know i can't."
17302,Homer,this time i'm not gonna touch a thing.
23721,Homer,okay.
21331,Homer,huh?
21065,Homer,enough of what's out! what's in?
13827,Homer,"hey... hmm. not bad. nice hot mustard... good bread... turkey's a little dry. the turkey's a little dry?! oh foul, accursed thing! what demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"
38690,Homer,"hey, there's always room at buzzard's roost."
19623,Homer,"use it wisely, my friend."
28270,Homer,"i-m-o--,i-m-o--,1
91096,315,285,homer simpson: --k. get it? ""i am ok."""
40660,Homer,"gee, the fun never stops at the flanders house, does it?"
36154,Homer,"well sir, before i do anything i stop and ask myself, ""what would jesus and mr. burns do?"""
39772,Homer,marge?
37207,Homer,that's insane! my dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. my gay dad is gay for gays.
18741,Homer,"yes, that'd do."
38020,Homer,marge is in therapy?
38859,Homer,what the? this isn't halloween.
19411,Homer,you're nuts. i gotta get some fresh air.
35842,Homer,"wow, i can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!"
37301,Homer,uh-oh.
34818,Homer,nooooo!
31527,Homer,"well, i guess i'll have to wait for marge to show some backbone and-- you again?!"
13534,Homer,"honey, do me a favor. fill out this form."
40331,Homer,"all right, knock it off!"
36679,Homer,one more time.
16215,Homer,hmmm... business deal.
31986,Homer,i don't have any holders!
27527,Homer,"i was made for loving you, baby / you were made for loving me..."
24242,Homer,you're going to die in a skydiving accident.
38304,Homer,"uh, yeah, help me out here. what is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?"
24258,Homer,bleh. this virtual fudge tastes like crap.
32058,Homer,the happiness swept me away!
38140,Homer,i don't know. how 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
37443,Homer,did she really say that?
41369,Homer,finally. time for the big bump-into.
34618,Homer,"sorry, honey. i wasn't listening. and i won't be listening now."
26822,Homer,right.
25968,Homer,maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
22136,Homer,do you have a table for the mayor?
15108,Homer,all right then.
40496,Homer,"goodbye, son."
16778,Homer,"not flanders. anybody, but flanders."
27374,Homer,how did you know?
40245,Homer,"oh, that's okay. the baby's name isn't important. let's go, marge."
39013,Homer,"mmm, raisin detra."
30546,Homer,"now, i will take your questions."
35445,Homer,but there's so many buttons!
18437,Homer,"get away, dammit! run for your lives!"
34270,Homer,great curling reference.
16784,Homer,"why do you mock me, oh lord?"
27974,Homer,hmm... needs beer.
33035,Homer,make it life and you've got a deal.
25267,Homer,"hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
24100,Homer,he sure is!
16435,Homer,"foul temptress! i'll bet she thinks ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
25222,Homer,"son, i know it hurts. i still remember my first lifetime banning..."
26020,Homer,barkeep!
27613,Homer,that sounds like a magical family moment. i'm sorry i won't be there.
29131,Homer,"oh, homer, stop it!"
28830,Homer,"man, even i think movie popcorn has gotten too big."
37062,Homer,"were you worried about me, boy?"
21767,Homer,life jackets?
15539,Homer,the wicked witch.
20249,Homer,"blankets, radio... oh, a gary larson calendar. i don't get it. i don't get it. i don't get it. i don't get it. i--don't get it."
20776,Homer,right. that'll work.
25401,Homer,those bullies are gone now!
40132,Homer,"motivated seller, marge."
20910,Homer,"if you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car."
15431,Homer,"come on, come on!"
38572,Homer,"ooh marge, that was fast. yeah, that's it, baby. grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
39395,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"
36914,Homer,gonna drink ammonia / 'cause it tastes like cheese / wonder what will happen...
31617,Homer,ew! silver!
28541,Homer,pathetic flanders. thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.
19692,Homer,"yeah, hi, roy. hey, they're having open casting for the voice of poochie."
23342,Homer,guess i forgot to put the fog lights in...
35213,Homer,yes! will i get to meet dave?
38321,Homer,two at a time! heart exploding.
14986,Homer,well... kind of... but...
35946,Homer,nerds! you want i should mess 'em up?
24385,Homer,"now, this is living!"
30718,Homer,you made that tv show really mad.
37649,Homer,"but won't you be jealous, my love?"
20673,Homer,"oh no, there's that angry mob again."
18312,Homer,i'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
21935,Homer,"look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man."
13323,Homer,"sleep well, maggie. ah, three for three."
26612,Homer,"oh, thank god you're okay."
23878,Homer,it's not to scale.
41585,Homer,i'm-not-hungry-anymore.
22365,Homer,"hey, it's the beer copter!"
18814,Homer,"you really blew it this time, smithers."
37319,Homer,searchy? where can i find brake fluid?
41453,Homer,"come on, baby. the only math you need is you plus me equals forever."
19272,Homer,"now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. it's called responsibility."
28530,Homer,"and i filed down all the sharp corners. see, your eye is completely safe."
17852,Homer,what kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
38451,Homer,my boy's having a bad night. we should get the show on the road.
29089,Homer,why? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life? that's still one more than you.
35493,Homer,i'm waitin' for ya.
14456,Homer,let go!
34387,Homer,i can't! latkes aren't as good as american pancakes.
35555,Homer,"hey, hey! what are you doing?"
13430,Homer,are you?
22599,Homer,"yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad."
17270,Homer,heh-heh. scaredy-cat...
25777,Homer,no! no! no one is taking my kids from me!
38793,Homer,"okay, okay!"
37329,Homer,you're all i have left. i trust you completely.
39544,Homer,do you know where my keys are?
21164,Homer,"enfeebled?! oo, i know just the guy! be right back."
41061,Homer,"okay, flanders, you're the boss. heh, heh, heh."
19927,Homer,"i'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
22268,Homer,"""hitler is a jerk, mussolini..."""
34992,Homer,"tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
31762,Homer,or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
37367,Homer,"ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!"
40810,Homer,"you wish, dondelinger."
26013,Homer,i believe i had a hat.
30001,Homer,"marge, i'm giving birth to a food baby."
39339,Homer,the hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
15994,Homer,"hi, kids... i love"
28230,Homer,"cora, is there a back way outta here?"
14298,Homer,limited?!
22534,Homer,"if you won't stop, then i'll stop you!"
13975,Homer,how much?
13421,Homer,no.
27768,Homer,"look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. i f..."
28699,Homer,"flanders, i'm gonna do something i shoulda done a long time ago."
36443,Homer,"ooh, nice and roomy. our lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool."
26066,Homer,"yes, mr. burns."
28068,Homer,"sorry, i got a lot on my mind."
15628,Homer,"ehhh, maybe this was a mistake."
22442,Homer,when trent steel bought me some.
17736,Homer,i've never been so miserable in all my life. but i can't take it out on marge and the kids. i've got to carry the burden all by myself.
32925,Homer,"wait a minute... mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. mom! you used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
26412,Homer,"that i do, sir."
19940,Homer,"oh, okay."
37520,Homer,but somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
17102,Homer,my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
15552,Homer,i'll take that.
37687,Homer,"once again, cats have it better."
14982,Homer,maarge... come to bed marge...
17848,Homer,"hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers i've heard so much about."
16430,Homer,barney. that is so insightful. how did you come up with that?
29097,Homer,whuh-oh.
20112,Homer,"come off! come off! oh, all right, you!"
27774,Homer,"hey, honey. sorry i'm so late. i had to lay off twenty-seven robots. don't tell me they can't cry."
15624,Homer,"how would you like me to take it? ""go ahead, bart, have your fun, i'll be waiting for you?"" i'm sorry, i can't do it."
20115,Homer,come on! pick up the pace!
24430,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to represent myself. drunken hicks of the jury..."
35600,Homer,"yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
26853,Homer,and i can ride my bike real fast.
31935,Homer,oh my god! what have i done?!
17901,Homer,"but... yes, ma'am."
30476,Homer,did she say anything else?
18823,Homer,which one's itchy? the car?
19598,Homer,"hey, that's the fire alarm!"
24224,Homer,"hurry, hurry up! i have to pee!"
38334,Homer,"oooh, ""goody gobble""!"
14647,Homer,and i'll be right here watching tv.
27418,Homer,i'll just hide here.
28865,Homer,"okay, okay. remember the rules for drinking and driving. drive slow but not too slow. drink some cola to keep yourself alert."
29475,Homer,bonded?! how many times?
25567,Homer,"i've got more bones than that guy. if you're trying to impress me, you've failed."
33984,Homer,"uh, moe, i have a confession to make: i'm just homer dressed as marge."
35025,Homer,hm.
27771,Homer,"well, i have to work, but give the monitor a kiss."
35973,Homer,i make my own turnoffs.
25106,Homer,"all right, first item: i lost our life savings in the stock market. now, let's move on to the real issue: lisa's hogging of the maple syrup."
32911,Homer,it works on so many levels.
30946,Homer,"okay, apu said his cousin kavi could help me out."
37439,Homer,"oh marge, when you hold me like that..."
16192,Homer,"but mr. burns, it's not my bear. it's maggie's."
21433,Homer,yeah. seems like the thing to do.
14459,Homer,"go to sleep and goodnight/ da da da / da da da da da da da da/ dee dee dee / dee dee / may your christmas day be nice. goodnight, my little pork chop."
18969,Homer,"there can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the us festival."
29344,Homer,"okay. i'll run as fast as i can, but i'm full of potato salad."
17394,Homer,"c'mon, i'm a decent guy..."
15344,Homer,kiss my asphalt.
34498,Homer,"hey, ralph's a good kid. and he should be, he's got a great dad."
23119,Homer,"mel gibson is just a guy, marge. no different than me or lenny."
18479,Homer,any undelivered mail for homer j. simpson?
25871,Homer,"oh, this punishment is so cruel."
30808,Homer,"well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!"
23364,Homer,"dear god, it's homer. if you really love me, you'll save my life now."
17008,Homer,"if he marries your mother, marge, we'll be brother and sister! and then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
27656,Homer,i'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.
24554,Homer,bingo!
24874,Homer,"oh, i don't know, carl. he might be closer than you think."
29443,Homer,"one... two... eh, i'd rather die."
19652,Homer,"now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. i'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. just like my hair!"
19546,Homer,"that's my boy. well, if you believe in me, then i'm not going to give up. i'll prove i'm right. this friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
25325,Homer,babies.
25247,Homer,what?!
17824,Homer,"but, i've never been able to do the..."
23764,Homer,hah! if i had a nickel for every time i've heard that...
27178,Homer,"hey, why would i want purina when i've got fancy feast right here?"
29813,Homer,deal!
38386,Homer,"we're not lost, boy. not by a longshot. we just have to set the mood."
28522,Homer,thank god! there's still four more days 'til christmas. i have time to reform my ways!
25914,Homer,why you little...
32388,Homer,"hm, i thought i was killed by that magic spaghetti!"
36595,Homer,umm... no thanks.
37749,Homer,"yeah, wow, that does feel good. oh no, i think it's coming. i haven't even picked a name yet!"
27102,Homer,"wait, don't go! i wanna keep on rockin'. c'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
40427,Homer,holy moly! that's the biggest... one of those i ever saw.
26466,Homer,"sure, i said i loved him. but never that i was ""in love"" with him."
41150,Homer,get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
31477,Homer,"son, we all have to do things we don't want to. like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be mr. funny all the time -- you think i wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? like some ancient pagan! just dancing around playing the pan flute! and here we are!"
28071,Homer,you mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
34595,Homer,golf ball-sized hail!
18782,Homer,uh... they all won.
28718,Homer,five bucks? i don't need your sharity! i'll dance for my money!
19808,Homer,amen to that.
23134,Homer,"and i've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
32995,Homer,something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. a new chemistry set.
21887,Homer,"my head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. i'll do it!"
32384,Homer,"shh, shh, shh, shh, shh..."
32429,Homer,"oh yeah, marge, i love these business trips of yours. the tv remote isn't nailed on. my whole life, i've never been in a hotel that trusted me."
38001,Homer,stop!
31127,Homer,"tickets, thirty dollars! big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
20183,Homer,"oh, well, it all happened in 1990. back then, the artist formerly known as prince was currently known as prince. tracey ullman was entertaining america with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. and bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."
13722,Homer,i said do it!
22702,Homer,"that's more like it. so long, suckers!"
18976,Homer,"no way, man. we're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever..."
21991,Homer,"hey, i'm trying to drive here!"
23885,Homer,lisa? ham hock? tri tip?
25107,Homer,point of order: i didn't lose all the money. there was enough left for this cowbell.
26564,Homer,then it's settled. the simpsons are going to brazil.
27996,Homer,"aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
16928,Homer,i'm alive! i'm alive. and i owe it all to this feisty feline.
29805,Homer,"that's right, an unauthorized tattoo. i came here right away."
15020,Homer,"my magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone."
40677,Homer,"well, gee, dad, if i wasn't on such a tight schedule--"
13403,Homer,"okay, fish, you're probably wondering why i'm still here. catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
17017,Homer,"woo hoo! three hundred fifty dollars!! now i can buy seventy transcripts of ""nightline""!"
23081,Homer,"oh, i'm sick of doing japanese stuff. in jail we had to be in this dumb kabuki play about the forty-seven ronin and i wanted to be oshi, but they made me ori."
36230,Homer,then there's champagne in me! what am i gonna do? it's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. maybe i can sweat it out.
16913,Homer,done.
21635,Homer,really? you think it's a good idea?
35036,Homer,great. that's great. but i have to get to work in the morning.
14120,Homer,that'd be great.
35745,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid! we forgot to create a fake author!"
23292,Homer,let me see.
30449,Homer,"aw, i can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
20786,Homer,"so, i beat the system."
39918,Homer,"he needs me. hey, boy."
39193,Homer,"i don't get it. football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. why can't i just remember which cards have been played?"
32495,Homer,sold!
27301,Homer,"marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."
30207,Homer,you've transformed breakfast into dinner. it's a miracle!
30016,Homer,let daddy go talk to the man.
20165,Homer,"all right, all right. so, he's a fraud. i don't care! his mom doesn't care! do any of you care?"
25893,Homer,since when?
14032,Homer,sorry.
13698,Homer,"you were swindled, my friend. twenty bucks. take it or leave it."
33490,Homer,we live in a house that is trying to kill us.

21383,Homer,lisa!
19054,Homer,sweet merciful crap! my car!
30712,Homer,"now, why don't you stay for dinner."
40512,Homer,because why?
38286,Homer,"marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
38637,Homer,wait... i finally get what you're saying. fracking is great. but the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
24578,Homer,comin' up!
32239,Homer,and i know something much more fun i can do on my back.
34368,Homer,hey boy.
41416,Homer,"what are you, cavemen? turn on the lights!"
19604,Homer,"hmmm. your ideas are intriguing to me, and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but i think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
31290,Homer,son! let me have a lick at you.
15236,Homer,"wha... hey, moose! shoo! go! talkin' to you! get off my lawn! now!"
31314,Homer,"hey, i'm not done dancin'! this bulletin better swing!"
23198,Homer,thank you for getting me out of work.
24633,Homer,no problem.
20590,Homer,woo hoo!
21615,Homer,"first, my all-purpose electric hammer. ""for all your pounding needs."""
16716,Homer,and we can't watch fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in syria.
19520,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, when i came to, i was covered with a sticky translucent goo! explain that!"
36492,Homer,"hey lisa, come on."
14511,Homer,do i have to pay if i hit my hand with the hammer?
38271,Homer,"oh, are the kids with you?"
32422,Homer,"/ when happy they sparkle, when sad they cries"
28849,Homer,yes you do.
35401,Homer,i'd like to see you try.
18537,Homer,"well, you'll be happy to know i don't work very hard. actually, i'm bringing the plant down from the inside."
38699,Homer,"look, i really need a campsite. my wife is making sandwiches!"
25276,Homer,"do-i-have-cooties? no. oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
36684,Homer,"well, it's a good thing i didn't because i'd be pretty devastated right now."
34765,Homer,"yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
28166,Homer,"ooo, this robe's pretty soft."
22199,Homer,"relax, i called her from the gas station."
31771,Homer,"here i am on the space shuttle, orbiting earth."
31420,Homer,he was following my design.
15124,Homer,"please marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
38426,Homer,"well, lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is gus frickin' huebner!"
41082,Homer,"you do? ha ha, ha ha ha!"

19228,Homer,"oh, all the time! have you ever heard of this kid milhouse? he's a little wiener who..."
36781,Homer,what would you have me do? one basket for each egg?

39616,Homer,i swear it bob.
14054,Homer,that's it. i'm outta here.
20887,Homer,"you didn't have to tell it like it is, marge."
14663,Homer,"who's that guy?... what did that guy say when i said, ""who's that guy?"""
16058,Homer,i suck.
22533,Homer,i am so sick of that damn code!
21028,Homer,i like you.
34014,Homer,while turning gay the other day / a thought occurred to me...
17525,Homer,"come on marge, i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. i want to explore the world. i want to watch tv in a different time zone. i want to visit strange exotic malls. i'm sick of eating hoagies. i want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. i want to live, marge! won't you let me live? won't you please?"
28410,Homer,"gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
27705,Homer,aren't you gonna chuckle?
20037,Homer,"wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. you're crazy, marge. get off the road."
37781,Homer,"but you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
13553,Homer,doesn't ring a bell.
32641,Homer,"no, no. this candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous."
25156,Homer,moe szyslak?!
33269,Homer,"so... now that we're alone, um... death to america, right?"

13442,Homer,"hey, what's all the --"
28387,Homer,"marge, please. i'm too upset to talk about it."
24539,Homer,"eh, too much baggage. oo, my horoscope. taurus: ""today you will die."""
33502,Homer,i have come from my workshop in the north pole to say: don't evict the simpsons!
14248,Homer,"handle first, handle first..."
13828,Homer,"yeah, but i gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... yeah, that's what it is. wanna try it? heh, heh, heh."

37234,Homer,"he's taking on mean man monty! go get him, honest abe!"
25176,Homer,"relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
17006,Homer,not at all.
37507,Homer,"aww... thanks, flanders. gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much."
32826,Homer,"okay, they bought it."
14762,Homer,"hey, wiener boy... where do you think you're going?"
29160,Homer,simpson.
24663,Homer,"huh? oh, right."

37577,Homer,"uh, i'll pass on the pork."

19857,Homer,"heh, rex banner. what a dope."
24081,Homer,"now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of maggie being born that i couldn't get rid of... anyway, enjoy."
41044,Homer,no! stay away! this is not for you! this is homer food.
22309,Homer,"yeah, but there's two!"
18592,Homer,"ah, ha, ha, ha, god-boy couldn't get a strike."
33652,Homer,"i miss you. i miss the kids. god help me, i even miss your sisters."
23295,Homer,"look, marge, i'm making a difference in people's lives!"
27930,Homer,"all right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble native americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
18778,Homer,lousy two-legged pants.
24333,Homer,the call is from heroism. will you accept the charges?
39815,Homer,but where will i sleep?
17784,Homer,hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
16667,Homer,"no, don't kill me! i didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! i was unaware! i was unawaaare!"
24132,Homer,bingo!
24240,Homer,dr. winslooooow...
28688,Homer,"i'll have to read marge's book. and i swore never to read again after ""to kill a mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. it did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
33705,Homer,"look, man, i don't want any trouble. c'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. leave me alone, okay?"
22193,Homer,"in the impulse zone. if you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. like this."
20397,Homer,"okay, don't shoot!"
33789,Homer,ant poison? why do i always read the labels after?
21037,Homer,bart!
20510,Homer,"oh, the hell with her. hester. emil. prudence. lemuel. increase. dad."
15873,Homer,"marge, i have my pride. i'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!"
24082,Homer,"single women of springfield, your prayers have been flanswered."
34561,Homer,hm. we need a better idea. we'll have to find the town's smartest men.
18753,Homer,"no, it's homer."
13213,Homer,i lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat. but i found a kitten.
31309,Homer,what's goin' on?
40592,Homer,"yum. i've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, lisa."
16590,Homer,i 'unno. coast guard?
31845,Homer,well i'm throwing you both out of the game!
35878,Homer,"now, if i fart, that's 'cause i'm so relaxed."
22394,Homer,"mmm, who knows? maybe i'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference."
30714,Homer,"hey, this one's cold!"
36899,Homer,i don't know -- the back yard?

25637,Homer,"where's marge?! that is so rude. i know, i'll hitchhike."
21172,Homer,"marge, can i get a duck?"
35463,Homer,little help...
37070,Homer,"oh yeah? the tornado was more of a father to me than you! okay, how about my brother? he's rich."
32300,Homer,is louie keeping you prisoner here?
38403,Homer,oh. thank you. why was that on the military history channel?
32350,Homer,hey! now i don't get paid!

15199,Homer,uh huh?
35706,Homer,this better be dinner theater!
24762,Homer,fine. you want passion? i'll give you passion.
23875,Homer,i can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. do it for me.
16871,Homer,okay.
36822,Homer,"no, no, nothing, nope."
35125,Homer,"marge, marge, put down that broom. you've got nothing to be afraid of from them. i'm a wingman. part of a great tradition including val kilmer from ""top gun,"" wedge antilles from ""star wars,"" and me, from now. and you know why i'm a great wingman? because i have the confidence that comes from knowing i get to go home to you."
36048,Homer,i mean a thousand-year flood!
40368,Homer,your putter's name is charlene!
39915,Homer,"ouch! watch it! hey. ow, ouch!"
35675,Homer,"all the food in those pictures is poop by now. minds blown, you're welcome."
25086,Homer,"see? now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
37286,Homer,all too well.
29751,Homer,"hey, i couldn't leave you kids. you're like my own family. now check this place out!"
18294,Homer,hello? yes? oh! uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... flanders has it. just smash open his house.
41167,Homer,what a family.
18492,Homer,"oh, yeah... but what i'll mainly remember is the laughter. i wonder what he's doing now?"
14362,Homer,"uh-oh. you see, lisa, daddy's friend moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the dolphins won the game."
22817,Homer,"well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here."
13591,Homer,huh? a check?
36751,Homer,"aw, come on chief, i've had a rotten day. can't you help me out?"
25551,Homer,"and on my free african safari, i want to do everything on this box."
22111,Homer,hey! i called that! i saw it first! come back here!
15665,Homer,happy... valentine's day!
34280,Homer,hm...
17702,Homer,"i was in heaven. if horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
21348,Homer,"hey, deng xiao-ping died."
16958,Homer,"can i keep him anyway? huh, huh?"
27560,Homer,"why you little...! um, i'm sorry, judge. that's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."
24115,Homer,"eh, how're they gonna find me?"
15012,Homer,"apu, i see you're not in church."
41479,Homer,i've traveled through space and time to make marge settle for me because she doesn't know better.
25487,Homer,noooo!
33669,Homer,"marge, you're not naggy. you just set the bar impossibly high."
16121,Homer,whatever. either way is good...
19925,Homer,"wow, tv's kent brockman."
18118,Homer,"he's gettin' away! you blew it, marge!"
17432,Homer,you're both right.
29212,Homer,everything's comin' up homer.
39474,Homer,"you know, moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me. she said, ""homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, god bless her soul, she was really onto something."
27897,Homer,that is the best kiss i've had tonight.
23891,Homer,"wait! wait! i got a float too! listen up, 'cause i gotta explain a lot of it!"
15149,Homer,bart! why are you doing that?
14092,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
23861,Homer,"oh, real original. who did this?"
32989,Homer,no problem.
40855,Homer,"oh. hm, look at it this way. when you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?"
28146,Homer,"yeah. you know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."
22737,Homer,"oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
39988,Homer,"you know, marge, this is just like when we were dating."
13674,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow.
26358,Homer,"this round's on me, moe. i got a big payday comin'."
41474,Homer,"stupid kid. steals my future. well i'm going to...ice cream, with cookie dough?!"
14297,Homer,hm... bart's birthday's coming up.
15932,Homer,"honey, i don't know what you're feelin' right now. so i don't wanna push anything. we can just hold hands... or sit and talk..."
33717,Homer,"ooh, chicken-kebab!"
27095,Homer,i got 'em!
35429,Homer,"well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. this is from a gas station men's room. they put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. these are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
22752,Homer,thank you.
41441,Homer,"forget it, doc! what if that's my marriage in there?"
31182,Homer,"sorry, marge, can't hear ya!"
23311,Homer,mm.
22914,Homer,woo hoo! my springs! they finally came!
25550,Homer,africa? they're bound to have food there!
20841,Homer,you liar. you don't have a home business. why would you make up a lie like that?
26648,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, i've got news for you. i just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""yes-i-cannabis."""
34810,Homer,"back off, you unholy dreamboat!"
14645,Homer,"oh, marge! there is no such place!"
28677,Homer,well what?
30174,Homer,"don't worry, i'll straighten things out with coach clay. we're good buddies. we play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" and he always lets me win!"
31098,Homer,"oh, he ain't gettin' married. he has commitment issues!"
30708,Homer,"as i lay dying on the ocean floor, i remembered everything you've done for me. to hell with that stupid dna test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and i love you."
24941,Homer,bad dog.
29038,Homer,"not so fast, old-time liberal."
19884,Homer,"what, dear?"
40308,Homer,"oooh, red hots."
31953,Homer,"lousy burns so ungrateful, i hate him so much..."
30306,Homer,you know everything.
39230,Homer,"oh. i love you, marge."
22555,Homer,shut up! screw you guys!
26847,Homer,please don't kill me! i won't tell anyone about the skeleton. and i could bring you more victims. like lenny! he'd go great with wild rice.
37911,Homer,"superintendent chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same hawaiian shirt to that luau!"
35471,Homer,"don't panic, son. we can bust up teachy and preachy. here's what we do: i'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother."
18467,Homer,you remembered.
26229,Homer,"a library selling books? if i don't want 'em for free, why would i want to pay for 'em?"
18154,Homer,"kids! kids! kids! as far as daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
30354,Homer,"learn to drive, boy!"
19980,Homer,thank you. may i please use your phone?
37274,Homer,i think i have an idea.
16249,Homer,hello? can i get some help? snack related mishap!
31751,Homer,spooky.
13540,Homer,look at him!
38278,Homer,eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? it's all about the money with those firemen.
21467,Homer,"if there's anything more exquisite than queen anne's lace, i haven't found it."
25925,Homer,"you know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. and you don't even have to say ""bad."" it could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
16971,Homer,"yes, deeply concerned."
24112,Homer,"well, why didn't you say so?"
14317,Homer,"yeah, that timmy is a real hero."
27492,Homer,"so that's all it takes, a little prayer."
29734,Homer,uninsurable?!
21686,Homer,"oh, man. this is the most exciting thing i've seen since haley's comet collided with the moon!"
27611,Homer,i have eaten the ribs of god.
32998,Homer,"marge, i brought you some flowers! a full dozen this time! no tricks!"
29661,Homer,"i've never worked all night, never! and i worked at an all-night diner for three years! i slept on the grill."
18385,Homer,"""to start, press any key."" where's the ""any"" key?"
36010,Homer,witty.
24026,Homer,"son, don't ask why, but you have to lose the big race."
40356,Homer,luck.
21475,Homer,"hello, everybody."
40217,Homer,"and some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
39943,Homer,"yes, sir."
31041,Homer,jogging?!
28931,Homer,"whatever. the important thing is to get skinner to that altar. because once a union has been sanctified by god, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
37212,Homer,"just admit who you are, and you can find new love."
21083,Homer,"boy, i guess i was wrong about that earring. it saved us all."
17446,Homer,yes. and i am pursuing my interest in...
38838,Homer,"oh, well, i've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best."
35989,Homer,sweet!
41538,Homer,i've never heard that noise before. are you sick?
33195,Homer,"marge, i'm getting' out of the break-up business and i don't know if i'll ever sleep soundly again."
19259,Homer,all right. just wake me up.
41093,Homer,"absolutely. our third sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. where's some place fun we can take grampa next time?"
25574,Homer,quick! into the river! hippos hate water.
36190,Homer,my brain's fine! in my dreams i'm an intermediate skier!
27932,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
27682,Homer,you call this a bicameral legislature?
30081,Homer,"here's one -- revelation 6:13. just before the rapture, ""the stars will fall to the earth."" so all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
35478,Homer,"ned, i have a confession to make: i may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. but now, from the bottom of my heart, i wish you and edna the best."
20741,Homer,no. he's bart.
31419,Homer,"well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
17906,Homer,sorry marge.
14606,Homer,"take a hike boss, i'm running things now."
41579,Homer,"where are we going, daddy?"
32975,Homer,flanders!
37353,Homer,what size batteries.
21371,Homer,aha. there's some glue.
17211,Homer,"ah, the interstate. fasten your seatbelts, kids. we're on our way to itchy and scratchy land!"
35521,Homer,want a ride?
41523,Homer,"oh, this is wonderful. i love you, atari."
24891,Homer,"hey, guys. how's it goin'?"
24921,Homer,that's impossible. all my stories are bull plop. bull plop!
16773,Homer,"i love you, homey. heh, heh, heh. i don't need her at all anymore."
15169,Homer,"yummy, yummy, yummy/ i've got love in my tummy/ and i feel like lovin' you..."
38904,Homer,don't you people realize your queen is dying?
23538,Homer,"oooh, where's waldo?"
24491,Homer,"then we figured out we could park them in front of the tv. that's how i was raised, and i turned out tv."
36867,Homer,fine. keep 'em. but you have to give back... lisa?!
35537,Homer,he said it.
13343,Homer,go to bed.
31352,Homer,"fingers, fingers, fingers!"
16921,Homer,"son, you're okay! and you've led us to the precious ivory. and of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
40468,Homer,"here you go, bartasaurous."
28995,Homer,"oh, right."
38111,Homer,"oh, when does the exercise start?"
35983,Homer,unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
28006,Homer,"i dance, i dance, i dance / around a mexican hat / i dance, i dance, i dance / and that's the end of that / or is it i guess i'll keep singing / my cell phone appears to be ringing..."
34170,Homer,do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
15631,Homer,"son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now."
29766,Homer,i seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
41581,Homer,okay. how long till we come back and get him?
17002,Homer,"or, if not then, christmas."
28732,Homer,"yeah, you heard your mother."
37426,Homer,"the way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
25279,Homer,"okay, honey. i can see this means a lot to you. i'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
14528,Homer,step aside everyone. sensitive love letters are my specialty.
34278,Homer,"oh, a pork bao, a shrimp bao, everywhere a bao bao / homer simpson wins a gold / sliding rocks on ice... bao bao!"
25103,Homer,"oh, i hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
19540,Homer,"no, i can't. this is my cause. i'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. what was his name? apollo creed?"
22031,Homer,"yeah, i guess."
32351,Homer,now i'm mad!

24937,Homer,"if i know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch."
35259,Homer,"oh, that's right! i hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city."

36524,Homer,look at this place. things have certainly changed since our ancestor fievel came here.
24326,Homer,ta-ta.
26511,Homer,forget it. sacrificing animals is barbaric. now have the slaves kill the wounded.

27746,Homer,hello!
20959,Homer,i have frozen myself so i may live to see the wonders of the future. thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. p.s. please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
37100,Homer,"marge, this has been great couples time. the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
21910,Homer,"hey square, expand your mind! the doors of perception are open for business."
28022,Homer,i didn't want them to know my size.
29557,Homer,but there was one righteous man: noah!
22131,Homer,what? there's nothing to worry about.
17575,Homer,"well, something did."
26632,Homer,i didn't. but now daddy's special medicine...
14114,Homer,homer simpson here.
32004,Homer,"this is our life now, milhouse. we're dumpster folk."
18998,Homer,how do you figure?
31581,Homer,do you think your mother will ever remarry?
20439,Homer,"son, you can do anything you want. i have total faith in you."
40286,Homer,phfft. you'll make new and better friends.
14683,Homer,your song touched me in a way i've never felt before. and which way to the can?
29773,Homer,"oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! they've stolen a car and they're home alone."
24316,Homer,but you've got me. who have i got?
13155,Homer,"all right, how should i get there?"
37351,Homer,"thanks, honey. so you're not cool with any of the toys?"
17853,Homer,"you sold us out, conover!"
21817,Homer,"a, uh... division of, um... homer-co."

24330,Homer,"oh, no! that's bart and lisa!"
16308,Homer,"oh no, you don't! that trampoline is mine."
16037,Homer,"why? oh, right. the sideshow bob thing. sorry, boy."
36500,Homer,"i cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. so, honey, what do you say?"
39838,Homer,"so what should i do, marge?"
37245,Homer,i didn't know you were left-handed.
27879,Homer,"yeah, like you and allan sherman."
21045,Homer,we have orders not to fire on anybody but greenpeace.
33135,Homer,marge? is that you?
27384,Homer,i thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
22067,Homer,"i'm sorry, dad. the way i behaved was shameful. i guess fear made me run away. but love made me come back."
17539,Homer,"now marge, ""dear abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""hero."" ""fearless."" ""alive."""
20705,Homer,ding! ding! ding! ding!
24037,Homer,"yeah, she's the best. ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
36765,Homer,virtual stapler!
29356,Homer,"you know what, mr. burns? i'm never comin' back. my son's making so much cash in the t-shirt game, that i don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as i age."
27013,Homer,"marge, you were like a wild beast. so voracious and prowly."
21550,Homer,"wait a minute, there's no angus maccloud in north kilt-town. why you're not from scotland at all!"
24948,Homer,he's very good.
22352,Homer,"excuse me, uh, mr. scalper, sir. have i told you that i love you?"
29260,Homer,"get lost, crook!"
31532,Homer,their drunken singing is ruining st. patrick's day!
37609,Homer,"i missed my flight so i got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. they wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, i had the ass."
24825,Homer,"the answer is no, mr. burns. not for any amount of money."
33808,Homer,i h-8 this?
23319,Homer,"i don't need lisa to write a good review. ""the food at the gilded truffle really..."" uh... what's a good word?"
19099,Homer,thank you! come again!
15075,Homer,time i wreck your life?
38698,Homer,"compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
28062,Homer,"marge, you're trying to hurt me!"
23478,Homer,wait a minute.
14112,Homer,"ooh, that's a lot of money."
33162,Homer,"marge, i don't want to die with us mad at each other."
34673,Homer,"uh yes, i'd like... um... how do you say taco in mexican?"
41410,Homer,i cleaned out the garage and lost fifty pounds!
17772,Homer,"no, no! shut up! shut up! stop it, stop it! i can't take this anymore. i can't let that brave man out there die alone. i'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. especially his children. i'm goin' out there."
34018,Homer,so find yourself a man who'll want you in the sack
35004,Homer,"no, no, i oversold it."
17489,Homer,dad wasn't even around on christmas morning when i actually got to meet santa claus. some father... wait a minute.
21934,Homer,"seth, munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""uptown girl / she's been living in her white-bread world..."" come on, guys... uptown girl..."
20154,Homer,"or ""crapweeds""."
34421,Homer,good luck surviving without me!
15360,Homer,homer is what grown ups call me. call me daddy.
22605,Homer,we're gonna go see marmaduke?
17070,Homer,"marge, you'll never guess what. my whole class is here. they're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
23704,Homer,"quiet, marge. the motorcycle and i are trying to sleep."
33363,Homer,so there's a chance i actually won! i've got to dig up that ballot box!
28419,Homer,"hey, you're not mean. it was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. we're not so different. give me a hug."
30988,Homer,"hey, i've been driving drunk since i was twelve! but first...who's gonna help me pee?"
34709,Homer,how easy am i?
15602,Homer,what am i supposed to do?
40697,Homer,"i love you, barney."

22387,Homer,"don't confuse daddy, lisa."
21522,Homer,"oh, you'll miss plenty. i have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives."
17387,Homer,"nobody's blaming you. hey, could you take the wheel for a second? i have to scratch myself in two places at once."
22618,Homer,"it's called caring, marge."
26550,Homer,"free service, here we come."
27495,Homer,wait a minute. i'll do what flanders does.
34906,Homer,hey!
20271,Homer,marge! kids! you're alive!
31881,Homer,knock it off! he's just a kid!
36655,Homer,on a poker site!
29196,Homer,"oh, there's the frisbee."
20751,Homer,"now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh marge?"
27712,Homer,yes!
36390,Homer,"honey, it's me again. i can't work knowing that you're mad at me. i just wanna hear your voice. and i'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then i go to moe's, then i rush home to you."
34835,Homer,"hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. sooner or later, everyone meets their ""homer."""
28574,Homer,i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you. i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you.
39197,Homer,i'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. they're just playing the game by the rules!
38816,Homer,any uplifting holiday movies?
27478,Homer,"yeah, well, nachos are nachos."
27956,Homer,"well, two can play at that game."
27306,Homer,"america loves its kings, from george the third to larry."
35071,Homer,"and if you do it, son, you'll get the same."
23052,Homer,c'mon!
34450,Homer,uh... this is my lunch.
14702,Homer,"marge, you make it sound so seamy. all i did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
17232,Homer,thank you!
24542,Homer,"ow! oooh! paper cut, paper cut!"
17431,Homer,thank you!
35021,Homer,can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
30935,Homer,woo hoo!
17946,Homer,"oh, that should..."
14437,Homer,"look marge, i can tell something's bothering you. but if you come out of that car, i promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. please, honey?"
30292,Homer,"she, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner."
28598,Homer,"robot, i command you: do something cool!"
38536,Homer,"what are you doing here, freezer stealer?"
19227,Homer,"yes, sir. i do."
34520,Homer,flanders! wake up! take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.
20872,Homer,i still don't get it.
26879,Homer,can't you do anything? surprise witnesses? evidence tampering? play the race card. play it.
38789,Homer,i'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
26175,Homer,"oh, we'll see about that."
41481,Homer,"for an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall. food, fun and fashion -- the mall has it all!"
37013,Homer,so we'll take these supplies back to springfield where they're needed most.
34987,Homer,"well, i guess i could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette."
13930,Homer,"liberty bell... two liberty bells... come on, come on, come on... oh. yes! whoo-hoo! three liberty bells! that'll be ten thousand dollars, apu."
29690,Homer,"i've heard of these guys. you can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
33867,Homer,why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
29674,Homer,my thingies!
22821,Homer,i'll never get rid of it. it'll follow me to the ends of the earth!
40464,Homer,"not now, lisa."

31153,Homer,like i always say: compromise is the key.
29293,Homer,"oh, homer, you're wasting away to nothing. you simply must eat something. well, you're the boss!"
26195,Homer,"here's how it's gonna go down. as a family, we drive away. we cover for each other -- as a family. it's what gabriel would have wanted."
25466,Homer,why do you look like cesar romero?
15005,Homer,where are we going?
16846,Homer,"neddie, neddie... let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
39666,Homer,get 'em off me! get 'em off! aaah!
21029,Homer,maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
32471,Homer,my implants feel itchy.
27958,Homer,"son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. it really restores your faith in helpful weirdos."
16616,Homer,"actually, it wasn't me. it was my dad, grampa."
36450,Homer,thou sayest it!
37064,Homer,stop being blasé!
17332,Homer,"ah, the mysteries of life."
22194,Homer,we're going to break the bank at the monty burns casino!
30155,Homer,"yep, and nobody's tellin' him. not even his good buddy god."
23444,Homer,'cause i'm trying to think! what would zorro do?
25796,Homer,whoopsie.
36229,Homer,a surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
21186,Homer,oh-ho yeahhh...
20307,Homer,woo hoo!
26691,Homer,don't you have criminals to catch?
30006,Homer,"and she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. oh, thank you for this angel, lord!"
30284,Homer,it was hard enough gettin' you in there. i'm not lettin' you out.
21989,Homer,"uh-huh. pinchy would have wanted it this way. my dear, sweet pinchy. no more pain where you are now, boy."
34151,Homer,beware of marshall goldmannn!
16666,Homer,"it's true, it's true. we're so lame."
28034,Homer,"now now, honey. we all appreciate what you do. but real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. you could get in a lot of trouble with the livery commission."
26897,Homer,"oh, no! they're stealing the tire fire!"
26440,Homer,can't keep it in...
38094,Homer,that man can't remember anything except our number!
27364,Homer,"good morning, honey. did you cry out all your angries?"
32095,Homer,"no! if i leave the plane, i'll be just like everyone else!"
37576,Homer,that kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
21750,Homer,"oh, i was having the most wonderful dream. i had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
26483,Homer,"give me those keys. do you have any idea what you put us through? i called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... okay, this isn't about who i called."
39083,Homer,i am big.
39086,Homer,"marge, kids! tonight was a turning point in my life."
18372,Homer,i've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or i gotta face another day at work.
37514,Homer,"you have a great day, ma'am."
39898,Homer,"come along, adil."
15836,Homer,"does a father have to explain? let's just share your gift, okay?"
20042,Homer,"oh. design your own power plant, eh? this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am."
16097,Homer,we're gonna go out and par-ty!
30887,Homer,i'll bet the twist is he's gay.
40070,Homer,huh?
15983,Homer,oh man.
27738,Homer,"no, i think this calls for something a little more cerebral."
23469,Homer,"and for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... i'm down."
38104,Homer,have you seen how he treats my grampa? never visits him. never even acknowledges his existence.
27627,Homer,"welcome to the real world, hippies!"
15205,Homer,hey! then i could follow my dream. living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
20856,Homer,can i have some money now?
18576,Homer,"burns never gives money to anybody. just last week, i asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
27052,Homer,"if i was that drunk, i would remember it."
36553,Homer,i am nature's perfect choking machine!
17655,Homer,it was bart.
40059,Homer,"good morning, everybody!"

38797,Homer,"yeah?! well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!"
33515,Homer,how could this have happened?

36854,Homer,"oh man, my goatee has barely come in. why does my hair only grow in twos?"
21848,Homer,"only 5, no wait 10 dollars. you heard right, 20 dollars."
40183,Homer,"-- thy god hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!"
32704,Homer,i'll have you know i love this car as if it was my own child.
32098,Homer,i came to relax -- you think of it!
14063,Homer,in my haste i had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
35447,Homer,blimp assassin three.
39900,Homer,cheese!
24263,Homer,you should've thought of that before you dropped out of the devry institute.
38691,Homer,"excuse me, but grass is poking through."
26729,Homer,very well. i'm not gonna be angry dad for one day longer. i'm giving up anger forever!

16230,Homer,you have to kill the head vampire.
37952,Homer,but why pick me?
35801,Homer,"another round, kid?"
15938,Homer,he'll tell us what to do.
24368,Homer,"see?! and these quizzes are never wrong, marge. they're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business."
37037,Homer,"stay with me, man. stay with me."
20354,Homer,"learnin' somethin', marge?"
29995,Homer,fine. i'd rather die.
31024,Homer,screw you! i'm never gonna pay!
19557,Homer,"good work, son! we did it! we did it!"
13721,Homer,"flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
36875,Homer,"oh, marge, it's bad."
37934,Homer,i'll sign with whoever can convince channing tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
18309,Homer,they got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
26763,Homer,that giggle is none of my business. or is it?
32075,Homer,true -- but there's room for the truth in this household. do you wanna hear something really bad kent told me about the fox network?
19285,Homer,"i was trying to punish him exactly like you would. so, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. this is your mess and i'll be damned if i'm gonna clean it up!"
40919,Homer,"oh yeah, yeah, yeah. but i thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched."
35363,Homer,sorry.
32770,Homer,okay.
22177,Homer,"okay, no more gasoline."
28925,Homer,"what are you trying to tell me, skinner?"
25028,Homer,uh-oh.
16076,Homer,"marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. and unless movies and tv have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
18711,Homer,bull-honkey! i don't care about joining this stupid club.
37005,Homer,"marge, when i started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
29361,Homer,it's awesome. you know what i've gotten into? sleeping 'til noon.
29225,Homer,"marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
21490,Homer,"oh, we're surrounded, marge. maybe we should give ourselves up."
35140,Homer,"i legally forced him to say ""semi""."
35769,Homer,"the last thing i understood in that was ""pants."""
31553,Homer,"oh ma-arge, we have a surpri-ise! come to the win-dow! and look down at the stre-et!"
29092,Homer,"think, homer, think."
14077,Homer,homer simpson.

13417,Homer,"i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!"
38847,Homer,"ooh, spot!"
23577,Homer,"yes, kent?"
15034,Homer,wow.
32819,Homer,"yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
22141,Homer,oh no. wait... maybe i didn't do it right.
38693,Homer,poking through.
29393,Homer,"sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. if i turn this dial..."
15605,Homer,whyyyyy?!... howwwww?!... whennnn?!... whichhh?...
36890,Homer,"finally, a woodcutter that will do what i tell him."
30470,Homer,"excuse me, mr. bartender sir, may i have a sugar-free ginger ale? and uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds."
28985,Homer,"boy, it's great being here without those children of yours."
18833,Homer,"well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... so to answer your question, i don't know."
16511,Homer,"no! please, please, please, please, please..."
16949,Homer,how come bart gets to do that and i can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside chef boyardee's house?
24356,Homer,my way is easier.
22553,Homer,huh?
24669,Homer,"that's right. and i implore you to move your concert to our town. don't play olde springfield, or as it is sometimes known, sun city."
33233,Homer,disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
23331,Homer,i didn't say stop!
19658,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. i saw mrs. doubtfire. this is a man in drag!"
16320,Homer,"hey, krusty! i'm bringing back the..."
29797,Homer,"squealin'? no, i just wanted to help him."
22651,Homer,"oh lisa, honey, i won't ever let that happen."
30484,Homer,"marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world."
35876,Homer,try to catch one on your tongue.
36182,Homer,"kids, there's something i have to tell you -- your mother and i are wetting the bed."
33128,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but... stupid flanders."
41342,Homer,mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all?
18834,Homer,"yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
30632,Homer,"yeah, i tell marge everything! not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such."
38052,Homer,"where's my money? do you have my money? where is it? you know, if you had the money, i'm right here. do you have the money?"
35245,Homer,"oh, okay, wait, let's start again."
14722,Homer,i'm sure lurleen will love it.
19879,Homer,i said forty-two!
39131,Homer,all right.
22499,Homer,"goood dog! good doggie! ""tax hike approved""? bad dog. bad, bad dog."
29112,Homer,that's not true! i thought about that girl every day of my life... until i met you.
32650,Homer,things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
22485,Homer,"hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" eh."
18252,Homer,ham?
15513,Homer,"oh, andy capp, you wife-beating drunk."
23014,Homer,"no, no. it's just our basement."
28135,Homer,"i said, pipe down, amtrak."
19019,Homer,nope.
26515,Homer,"thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. guys?"
20810,Homer,"all i had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
33052,Homer,"stupid shopping list, turning food into work. bart!"
26430,Homer,he's a good doggie!
30237,Homer,because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
30355,Homer,uh... this is all i could find.
13144,Homer,i got it!
24303,Homer,hey? how did i get out here?
27858,Homer,"what's the deal with this place? it's so manly, yet scented."
24217,Homer,"aw, maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in."
31484,Homer,"oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. broken, lonely grownups."
26125,Homer,this is it. this is the old quarry.
36341,Homer,"ooh, that's great! can it wait another hundred and four hours?"
25680,Homer,"hey, how 'bout that?"
39065,Homer,stop fearing me!
36770,Homer,the old stupid moustache'll win him over.
13668,Homer,yesssss! oh yessss! read it and weep. in your face. i've got more chicken bone!
29059,Homer,but i promised my daughter--

29700,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.--
22771,Homer,usually a mink massage makes me feel better. but something's missing now.
22643,Homer,great. maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
16523,Homer,huh? wuh? lisa? what's up?
25151,Homer,"it's bill pullman, you fool!"
38879,Homer,what the?!

21552,Homer,"bart, please. the groundskeeper and i are trying to settle this like adults."
30379,Homer,...fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
37555,Homer,"oh baby, that's all i needed to hear."

23438,Homer,"ah, screw it."
14882,Homer,yeah. i didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
29845,Homer,oopsie.
41568,Homer,i paid for her dreams / she taught me to cry / like watery knives / like rain from my eyes / i can't believe you're not mine / i can't believe you're not mine...
25778,Homer,"run, children! run!"
22922,Homer,"don't answer yet. watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of god's greatest creation, the spring."
17115,Homer,i understand. let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
21668,Homer,ooh. ball one.
24865,Homer,get out! who told you that?
30593,Homer,"oh, well... i try to have a good time."
37650,Homer,"dear, i am not the jealous type. and from you, i have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
13300,Homer,"hey, just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't understand."
29256,Homer,what man would want you now?
36637,Homer,"you're right, marge. i don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids."
19474,Homer,"that coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but marge doesn't understand me at all. maybe we're not kindred spirits. we don't have anything in common..."
32917,Homer,why you little...
35279,Homer,"yeah, strangling. i mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! right? anyway, i said ""bart""..."
16395,Homer,"oh pardon me, mr. let's ration everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? don't you know the poem? ""water, water everywhere/ so let's all have a drink."""
26946,Homer,"all right, fat tony. your little game is over."
32585,Homer,my life's flashing before my eyes.
23223,Homer,got my whole week in there.
21950,Homer,hurry up. my hands are getting cold.
33251,Homer,"okay, i'll apologize."
32294,Homer,"okay, i made a mistake. why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?"
14453,Homer,"so, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. just you and me."
35999,Homer,"man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
33660,Homer,"i will, when it's not sports season. i just want to know how the game ends."
35152,Homer,"oh okay, uh, lenny, hit me with that chair."
36135,Homer,what? no! it can't be!
15294,Homer,i'll take it!
40306,Homer,"well, i get up, i dance, i spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of baby elephant walk."
24221,Homer,caveman brow...
17749,Homer,"yeah, except i forgot to go to work."
14398,Homer,"but marge, she never loses. she's got a gift. aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
23033,Homer,"ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, i'll get us the money. even if i have to get a second job."
14278,Homer,"no, you listen! this is my wife and this is my kid, and i'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
25795,Homer,"oh, this'll be good."
38554,Homer,"marge, have you ever seen pants do this?"
33625,Homer,"did you hear that, santa? she said yes! yes! now, back to your cold, airless tomb."
17461,Homer,yeah... where are my pants?
27528,Homer,"i can't get enough of you, baby..."
16041,Homer,"ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
19674,Homer,"ooh, she is tough."

20113,Homer,ow.
40874,Homer,"look, look, marge. i can't afford it. when i can afford to pay for it, i will. but i can't, so i'm not going to."
30317,Homer,"marge, i'm always amazed you chose me."
17486,Homer,b-but i'm using my whole ass.
29625,Homer,"marge, i'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister patty."

18463,Homer,i'm sorry.
39471,Homer,"no, no. i want to be alone with my thought."
13188,Homer,kids? no way! you'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
22124,Homer,a-- wait a second. i'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
34517,Homer,"we're not gonna get whacked. because you're chief clancy wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this."
14204,Homer,really? it must be the champale talking.
25825,Homer,let's make sure he's a leprechaun. sing us a song of the emerald isle.
20596,Homer,"oh, yeah. i'm a real expert."
13233,Homer,"at the end of a hard day, there's no better feeling than comin' home to the people you love."
20321,Homer,"i couldn't agree more, marjorie. you deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."

33475,Homer,goodbye.
38394,Homer,you monster! my knees will be in my throat!
15337,Homer,i thought there was chocolate inside.
25844,Homer,"mm, unexplained bacon."

30633,Homer,"all right, bob. we won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car."
19864,Homer,"yeah, suck like a fox!"
40216,Homer,"ah... great toast, marge. hmmm. oh, by the way, the night before the election mr. burns is coming over for dinner."

23579,Homer,"dream on, drunky!"
37736,Homer,it grows on threes!
32600,Homer,"and when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here."
16823,Homer,c'mon! we've been here for fifteen minutes. can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
25981,Homer,oh! whoa! hemorrhage-amundo!
14220,Homer,"marge, we can't do that! all the kids'll call him larry fairy."

34724,Homer,"come on, marge -- let's hit the buffet."
38059,Homer,"i don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
41394,Homer,goodbye!
14875,Homer,"now listen, boy. we have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. i don't think i'd be any kind of a father if you got d's and i let you go to kamp krusty."

38008,Homer,"okay, so let's see what we can see!"
19760,Homer,"look, john, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. just stay the hell away from my family!"
14697,Homer,"lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
27215,Homer,perfect.
37761,Homer,"wow. so now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m."
40458,Homer,"oh, good, unfinished. this shouldn't take long."
26849,Homer,"eh, you're the shut-in."
14067,Homer,"hey moe, you got any cough syrup?"

36409,Homer,what the? am i losing my marbles?
16858,Homer,"i'd love to honey, but daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
26304,Homer,stop the madness! start the movie!
15637,Homer,"well, i'd better get you home."
17396,Homer,"that's right, we all thought it was hilarious. but it turns out we were wrong. that alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
24668,Homer,that's right.
37891,Homer,"hey... they tricked us! that's a commercial! if i wanted to pay for commercials i can't skip, i'd sign up for hulu plus!"
22569,Homer,"don't worry, honey. daddy will fix that broken animal."
39776,Homer,"oh, sorry... ouch!"
19258,Homer,"you know, i don't know."
33857,Homer,why can't i have it now? you got your present here. basic fairness dictates... ...oh!

27181,Homer,"well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. goodnight!"
26205,Homer,"oh, it's the woman i married in vegas!"
18032,Homer,mainly your mother.
16210,Homer,"but i'm so sweet and tasty. well, time to go to work."
18028,Homer,ooh... this time... ah...
38505,Homer,i finally got over my sea sickness.
39284,Homer,who's tiny tim?
19924,Homer,crowds give him gas.
33869,Homer,"c'mon, boy! be cool!"
27261,Homer,no more reality shows for us. let's watch some quality scripted television.
23595,Homer,what was that about?
16147,Homer,i mean... you know... mr. burns... is so... old...
32900,Homer,"oh, this just gets worse and worse."
40597,Homer,"okay, okay, okay, okay. where do you want to go?"
40928,Homer,what is it this time?
26047,Homer,"ah. and now to read my fortune. ""geese can be troublesome."" what the hell is that supposed to mean?"
29321,Homer,i believe it was the school's tuba.
24125,Homer,"i'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please."
34667,Homer,"all right, sideshow. i'm gonna do to you what you shoulda done to my son a long time ago!"
18069,Homer,we're outta here!
28960,Homer,would you marry me again?
34753,Homer,"sorry marge, i gotta call bullcrap on that. the '69 mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about ron swoboda's wife and kids? not me -- and, i assume, not ron swoboda!"
31608,Homer,now i have nothing.
19942,Homer,now i can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
26653,Homer,"we gotta get out and stop that initiative. marge, i'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos."
20229,Homer,"eh, works for me."
41037,Homer,"gee, herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. i can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if i'd never come into your life."
22607,Homer,"this is all your fault for trading away your turn. just for that, no dessert tonight!"
15734,Homer,hm. alcohol fueled car.
30914,Homer,plus i designed a state-of-the-art stadium. we'll fund it with corporate naming rights. it's the duff beer-krustyburger-buzz cola-costington's department store-kwik-e-mart-stupid flanders park!
23085,Homer,shimatta baka-me!
27213,Homer,because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
29227,Homer,there's a whole rack of 'em over there. i only ate two.
26650,Homer,look at shemp! he is so high!
16232,Homer,stupid tv. be more funny.
17751,Homer,"lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. just like that rain forest scare a few years back. our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. didn't they?"
14080,Homer,you're my kid's teacher!
39877,Homer,"goodbye, bart."
21060,Homer,"all right, all right, mellow out, everybody. the captain'll know what to do."
15876,Homer,"oh, you have a job?"
39730,Homer,"well, maybe i am a little responsible."
36882,Homer,they're finally necessary!
37300,Homer,"maybe it's time for a visit from wally, the kissing walrus."
20139,Homer,"just a minute... everything's under control... yes, i'd be upset, too..."
18420,Homer,what are you talking about?
20294,Homer,"well, we were lucky this time. but it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with."
35196,Homer,cheech and chong are coming back to springfield?
38989,Homer,"you know, boy, i'm not sure i can strangle you anymore. i'm gonna try something new."
32779,Homer,don't worry. i have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
13358,Homer,"no, i didn't... i... oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
36278,Homer,"axels to axels, rust to rust, amen."
38644,Homer,"we'd better send the dog down. come on. here's your chance to protect us, boy. come on."
18450,Homer,"i don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. what do you have in that secret government file, anyway? i have a right to read it."
25394,Homer,'scuse me.
32490,Homer,"c'mon, lisa! the tv's been off for five whole minutes!"
28528,Homer,you're welcome!
21157,Homer,"oooh, the gum with the cracker center. mmm."
36647,Homer,"i put it in the bank. that place is great! on their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
19458,Homer,"look, just gimme some inner peace, or i'll mop the floor with ya."
40686,Homer,wait! i can't call marge. it's our last day on earth together. i can't drag her into this mess. i know! i'll call barney.
20097,Homer,all i had to do was walk a few blocks from the port authority bus terminal to my train at penn station...
13260,Homer,stop that crying!!
37773,Homer,excuse me.
31703,Homer,"all those years i was dreaming of other things, i was actually doing what i really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"
27237,Homer,perfect.
39934,Homer,"oh, definitely number... heh heh..."
19636,Homer,"stay back! i have powers! uh, political powers!"
21247,Homer,"well then, can't someone else do it?"
16622,Homer,it's mine!
15610,Homer,"i know you're mad at me right now, and i'm kinda mad too... i mean, we could sit here and try to figure out ""who forgot to pick up who"" till the cows come home. but let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that."
30725,Homer,"oh yeah?! you're going to that camp, 'cause i'm gonna drive you there."
23286,Homer,whatever. i'll be at moe's.
33326,Homer,"okay, honey. if it's that important to you, you said it."
18365,Homer,woo hoo! four more pounds and my dream comes true: working at home...
15609,Homer,"hey, bart, son. here's my way of saying, ""i'm sorry."""
29630,Homer,why you little...
17300,Homer,these wieners will give me the quick energy i need to escape.
22854,Homer,now you're making sense. good night.
17612,Homer,you're jealous.
29925,Homer,"nope, just you, marge and yogi bear. kidding!"
14323,Homer,"why, you little --"
19372,Homer,i would make it my business to be a third wheel.
25638,Homer,"oh, why isn't this working?"
33847,Homer,foam wasn't spilt in a day.
29867,Homer,a sign!
14587,Homer,good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
37497,Homer,"the carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
19312,Homer,you can't keep blaming yourself. just blame yourself once and move on.
30848,Homer,i fell asleep before the monkey.
38178,Homer,just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
29758,Homer,are you crazy? let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
39901,Homer,"well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. you have to admit that."
35739,Homer,but why?
13206,Homer,"when i grow up, i'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. how many wishes do i have left?"
24849,Homer,computer... kill flanders.
19395,Homer,past instances in which i professed to like you were fraudulent.
37898,Homer,shut up shut up shut up!
38331,Homer,"bonk! bonk! bonk! ooh, corner! ba-donk!"
22602,Homer,"we did a lisa thing last month. and i'm glad we did, but now i think we should do something normal people would like."
16370,Homer,"marge, don't discourage the boy. weaseling out of things is important to learn. it's what separates us from the animals. except the weasel."
13667,Homer,okay. ready.
27398,Homer,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. yes."
25369,Homer,"ah, it doesn't mean anything. it's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."
29724,Homer,"hm, where's the pain? there it is!"
19188,Homer,just a second.
26461,Homer,"not now, marge. i'm waitin' for the new xfl season. who will win this year's million dollar game? who? who?"
26560,Homer,no way. i still haven't lost the weight i put on from the last one.
31059,Homer,okay. all it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
40783,Homer,french. what a coincidence. just the subject i'm having trouble with.
19247,Homer,"you don't like it, call the cops!"
21903,Homer,"profits, profits, profits! what kinda hippies are you? peter fonda must be spinning in his grave."
29401,Homer,"oh, i doubt it. but we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out."
35470,Homer,"hey ned, can i borrow some hair?"
32264,Homer,"shut up! when you call in sick, who do you call?"
17282,Homer,can't. frozen.
29804,Homer,"say, is that a gang tattoo? i thought those weren't allowed."
16236,Homer,"marjorie, please. i enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. ahhh, ballet."
22656,Homer,absolutely not. my little girl's tummy hurts. do you have anything to stop her complaining?
33183,Homer,and you will again. because he isn't really dead. and now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
35787,Homer,"oh, well..."
28665,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah. i need some dinner, stat! and the kids need some cpr lessons."
14998,Homer,"yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and i knew that was special 'cause i usually dream about naked... marge."
28934,Homer,this is fat load. i'd like to request a new codename.
23500,Homer,"bup, no fighting, boys."
24291,Homer,"you wish. that's the stage we call ""professor barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. here's drunk."
15814,Homer,"oooh, ahh. ha! got him!"
32639,Homer,is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as i am?
19448,Homer,marge! thank god you're here! where's the car?
17688,Homer,marge...
39680,Homer,maggie! oh my little girl!
25992,Homer,"wow, well i i almost fainted, but then i didn't. what are you doing?"
16259,Homer,"marge, that's twice. i think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
37592,Homer,this conversation.
21493,Homer,"okay, i think i've figured this thing out. it can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
41551,Homer,pain is brown / hate is white / love is black / stab the night /
18469,Homer,"hey, mom, lookit me! look at what i can do!"
32793,Homer,"so i say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money."
16227,Homer,i guess killing will be fun enough.
33742,Homer,sure is hot back here.
31405,Homer,i thought we were playing cincinnati time-waste.
29292,Homer,see?
16327,Homer,"all right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
34252,Homer,"yes, but i have one more thing to show you."
17734,Homer,seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
39636,Homer,"well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
26129,Homer,"now do you believe dead rats float, lisa?"
17210,Homer,"okay, let's make a pact. this is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
24546,Homer,"nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. snakes: nature's quitters."
37598,Homer,in a breaking and entering kind of way.
40795,Homer,"i can't believe it, it's sticking. you're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! and it's all thanks to you. marge, when i see you forming the vowels and continents --"
25536,Homer,no you don't...
23171,Homer,"hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. we're not finished yet."
33580,Homer,hmm. probably a reminder to relax more.
25434,Homer,"oh, my head. how long have i been out here?"
27762,Homer,"sweetie, these things are gonna take time. i just found the door-shutting thing."
37403,Homer,now wait a minute. gotta make sure you're okay. who's the president now?
29991,Homer,i don't wanna.
22805,Homer,we can all burn evidence in it.
38448,Homer,okay. let's make some fireworks.
36526,Homer,"oh, geez. not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
34272,Homer,"olympic trials, eh?"
35802,Homer,uh... i got here after you did.
19171,Homer,the thing is -- oof! -- bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
19195,Homer,"gee, thanks, moe... what's this?"
27500,Homer,"o lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz."
24749,Homer,come i-in!
19605,Homer,"well, here we are."
31490,Homer,"lisa, i'm home! time for me to read to you!"
34697,Homer,watchin' hockey! watchin' 'em pass that puck! oh yeah!
15472,Homer,"no, but the rabbi gave me this."
26188,Homer,"look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. marge, bart, girl-bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. how i loathe him."
33558,Homer,"kids, i have to tell your mom i lost maggie."
23365,Homer,"okay, marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
33206,Homer,you what?
33346,Homer,"no, he's ten days younger."
18321,Homer,"hey, shut up!"
31246,Homer,listen... what would you say if i told you a woman did most of the work?
41405,Homer,those squeaks sound like couch springs. groovin' to the beat of love!
19946,Homer,"here you go, honey. that's about all the recycling i can handle today."
30981,Homer,she's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
37720,Homer,okay.
15689,Homer,"oh, shaddup."
34064,Homer,hey ned.
37700,Homer,i wish.
16932,Homer,mmm. caramel.
33718,Homer,"ooh, fire-kebab!"
40908,Homer,third time's the charm.
38985,Homer,ooh! i've missed you too.
35316,Homer,"pretty sweet, eh boy?"
30751,Homer,i'll kill you! i'll kill your whole family!
39589,Homer,"just try not to kill me too hard, son. heh-heh-heh."
32158,Homer,i'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
29823,Homer,you know what i missed in the joint? just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly... sleeping sweetly...
27154,Homer,me not pig.
23155,Homer,it was symbolism. he was mad.
19203,Homer,"well, i don't think it's that unlikely."
38569,Homer,which one's yours?
15206,Homer,"march 15... i wish i'd brought a tv. oh god, how i miss tv."
18482,Homer,"rhetorical, eh? eight."
18048,Homer,really? wow.
40808,Homer,she's with him.
35742,Homer,"yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript."
19033,Homer,"deal. see, flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
20506,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not... oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
35864,Homer,"to prove a point. everyone thinks their dad's a jerk and everyone's right. but when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
27225,Homer,"1895, forget it. we'd be too late to save lincoln and too early to save kennedy."
36314,Homer,easy!
37675,Homer,and while i'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
16733,Homer,"hello, is this nasa?"
34198,Homer,"tickets, please. hey, where's your ticket? leave me alone! why you little..."
23535,Homer,snooze... need more snooze.
21594,Homer,"at my age edison had already invented 203 things. ohh, i've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him."
41122,Homer,"a double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for god's sakes, hurry!"
17717,Homer,you're pregnant again?!
26244,Homer,but it's my banjo.
37789,Homer,"no. i'm exhausted from ""head, shoulders, knees and toes. knees and toes."" it's the ""toes"" that get ya, marge. it's the toes..."
18881,Homer,"y'ello, oak ridge? this is springfield nuclear. we need to order a... uh...t-437 safety command console."
25299,Homer,the name of bart's partner? i'm all ears.
14977,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no, no, no. well, yes."
29832,Homer,"oh, marge..."
27593,Homer,"you know, i could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home."
22302,Homer,"speak for yourself! bart, get down here! i'm gonna spank you back to the stone age!"
39463,Homer,"i'm sorry, marge, but sometimes i think we're the worst family in town."
28861,Homer,you can just nurse it.
14978,Homer,"hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every sunday? i mean, isn't god everywhere?"
25397,Homer,"but before i go, i'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
39847,Homer,could you tell him a little about yourself?
24314,Homer,i don't wanna talk about it!
32777,Homer,wrong number.
38259,Homer,no penalty.
28415,Homer,oh my god! lenny! carl! bart?
16641,Homer,"there, there."
40977,Homer,hello? hello? hello? stupid phone!
39164,Homer,this is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches tv!
34181,Homer,togasaki-rothman!
27104,Homer,"no! no, i won't go! you can't make me!"
34538,Homer,"hello, local utility? you greedy bastards have gouged homer simpson for the last time."
37764,Homer,"wow, i'd love to help, but i did kind of have plans for tonight..."
30851,Homer,"lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. if they did, then my experiments could be called cruel."
35628,Homer,what the-- this is a gentleman's club!
18005,Homer,"aw, no..."
26377,Homer,"oh, it's no good. everything reminds me of marge."
22407,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's."
16372,Homer,"you're right, marge. good work, boy."
34834,Homer,"what is troubling you, my son? i mean, my girl son?"
31915,Homer,"okay nappien, do your stuff."
25334,Homer,"yeah, but only to crush my wife and son."
15465,Homer,can i have a free calendar?
39428,Homer,"i'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while i can, marge. i don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic."
31583,Homer,the hell we are!
26635,Homer,"oh my god, this dude does the best flanders! you got the mustache and the didilly... okay, now do wiggum."
37905,Homer,"let me? uh, sweetheart, i downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
37822,Homer,my name is homer / i'm a real full back / gonna run that ball / don't want no flack...
23045,Homer,"sure, by their standards, but we live in america."
38724,Homer,"lisa, how many times have i told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?"
28762,Homer,woo-hoo! i got that one right too!
35656,Homer,is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
15029,Homer,c'mon.
13396,Homer,no.
28905,Homer,"interesting. marge, what does that sign say?"
41380,Homer,...mcnuggets.
33631,Homer,"but there is, marge! the first two letters..."
20731,Homer,i guess not.
19018,Homer,"people know your name, but you don't know theirs. it's great."
22327,Homer,me?!
32916,Homer,"this is hard work. isn't it, boy? boy?"
26266,Homer,get in the car.
13196,Homer,you'd better not put this shot after the one where i said i won't have kids. that would be a devastating edit!
34148,Homer,what? pulitzer prize application form?
22335,Homer,"yes! now that lenny's in, carl will fall like a domino."
15794,Homer,you couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
28569,Homer,"but newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. who really opposes ""families come first?"""
33972,Homer,"five, six / who's got tix?"
19723,Homer,"well, i guess i learned my lesson. the thing is, i lost creative control of the project. and i forgot to ask for any money. well, live and learn."
24135,Homer,quick! you've got to hide me from pbs! their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the chubb group!
30285,Homer,rugged? is that the same as handsome?
40629,Homer,no way! because i'm not dying.
17957,Homer,"that's it, marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. go ahead, sleep with him. i'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
30939,Homer,"this isn't india! where's the university of notre dame, the indy 500, wrigley field, dodger dogs --?"
28052,Homer,"the guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""fargo""?"
30468,Homer,"i'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn."
26951,Homer,after everything i did you're going to abandon me?
17833,Homer,burkina faso? disputed zone? who called all these weird places?
20530,Homer,"nah, just your screwy country."
33130,Homer,do you have a pineapple pizza?!
20195,Homer,get it away!
21905,Homer,"look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. c'mon, where's your freak bus?"
41440,Homer,"shut up, you kids, and bring me baloney!"
23874,Homer,"i believe i had hair. oh, here they are."
34938,Homer,"no, it's not. i just told a lie so we could go to hawaii."
25437,Homer,members of the media...
31643,Homer,or my...
34453,Homer,"okay, i will!"
27283,Homer,i'm a people person. who drinks.
20867,Homer,it's not enough to want a cracker. you have to earn it!
32068,Homer,liberals -- i hate them so much!
18855,Homer,"hi, lisa. how's your spring break going?"
30298,Homer,"listen, i thought about what i did. and it was really, really wrong. i'm sorry."
14378,Homer,"oh, sorry. so who do you like in the afternoon games?"
33697,Homer,and i'm good at beginnings.
15467,Homer,i can't afford it. maybe i should buy one of those machines.
32952,Homer,this is the first book i've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
23057,Homer,it's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
36074,Homer,all right! you caught us. what are you gonna do about it? throw us out of town again?
31017,Homer,you seem cool. wanna catch a movie?
36449,Homer,what?! why do i succeed at everything i audition for?
17747,Homer,"oh, there are pictures. i keep them where i need the most cheering up."
24256,Homer,"sorry, son. although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the indian."
39489,Homer,ready as she'll ever be!
36754,Homer,dogs can't get mumps.
31055,Homer,"yes, now you do."
41491,Homer,go vikings!
33916,Homer,"oh, that song's a little on the nose. can we do it to david bowie's ""heroes?"""
23797,Homer,"we'll be fine, honey. the main thing is for you to get better."
19414,Homer,look at me! i'm a puffy pink cloud!
19053,Homer,the beer!
19152,Homer,"uh, i've got a problem, hank."
22120,Homer,"and to think, i respected you! and defended you! you wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
40152,Homer,not to worry. i'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
21494,Homer,these have pleats...
13328,Homer,"hmmm. oh, baby! mmmm. yeah."
37029,Homer,"this is the easiest money i've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
39459,Homer,yes.
23263,Homer,i'll have you know i wandered off from the tour.
14966,Homer,"come on tv... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
35192,Homer,"great idea, but i don't have any money."
19707,Homer,"i'll field this one. let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""genius at work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
19373,Homer,"okay, it's the standard grampa drill. everybody into the cellar!"
33909,Homer,fine. i'll give back the oscars i stole from the lobby.
32463,Homer,"all for you, baby."
23436,Homer,"flanders, you gotta help me. is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
32286,Homer,"hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be."
15336,Homer,i don't know.
36333,Homer,"now, if the korean couple can't speak english, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? what does it mean?"
17429,Homer,"marge, this is so depressing. my only hope is this homemade prozac. hmm... needs more ice-cream."
21216,Homer,you signed my name? i feel so violated.
41488,Homer,"mmm, that's good. more, more! refill! free!"
34190,Homer,here we go.
19817,Homer,yeah! you do your own dirty work!
15450,Homer,"say it in english, doc."
31139,Homer,"hey, we've gone through more hardships than the jews and charlie brown put together."
14348,Homer,"yeah, lay it on me, coach."
30562,Homer,"aw, thanks. now how 'bout a dance with your daddy?"
28647,Homer,"...you probably want to talk this over, so i'll leave you two ""alone."" excuse me."
29402,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
24521,Homer,i'll kill you!
19455,Homer,but what should i do? should i meditate? should i get rid of all my possessions?
26053,Homer,"okay, let's see... ""the price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
21150,Homer,i call president!
30377,Homer,so you want maggie to infect your kids?
22220,Homer,whuh?
17086,Homer,"good night, marge."
22619,Homer,"ya gotta admit, marge, that's a lot more roaming."
21374,Homer,who is this?
14573,Homer,"they're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
17274,Homer,daaaa-vid lettermaaaan!
39027,Homer,"be my guest, but i seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em."
24446,Homer,why you little...
14852,Homer,"broke again, eh herb? just like in real life. i guess you're just not much of a businessman."
27691,Homer,"thanks for the love tip, ""60 minutes ii."""
27518,Homer,i can't see anything in this fog.
26796,Homer,i bought the issue for richard avedon's pictures of lenny.
39486,Homer,"well, we're not licked yet. to save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice."
25228,Homer,for once in my life i'm tall. don't take that away from me.
36979,Homer,"yeah, but i'll go home, weigh myself, and i'll have gained six pounds. what's that about?"
24298,Homer,oh. my name is homer and i'm planning a trip to st. louis.
33264,Homer,oh my god!
40153,Homer,better than your eyes bursting. ewww!
22968,Homer,tilt? you monster!
37690,Homer,you only live once.
19240,Homer,"marge, it's not a real kidnapping. it's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
28098,Homer,i will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
19774,Homer,"bart, i want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
33489,Homer,"oh, right -- like ""dateline"" did to you!"
13352,Homer,where-where are we going?
28978,Homer,remember our honeymoon?
29568,Homer,why must i be so voluptuous?
19030,Homer,so lame that it's cool?
39538,Homer,cupcakes.
31922,Homer,"nappien, you did it again! and everything is as it should be."
38849,Homer,look! i see land!
23750,Homer,taking care of some unfinished business.
40432,Homer,"hey, what are you doing?! no! drop that drumstick! bad dog! bad santa's little helper. come on... gimme that. gimme that."
32734,Homer,"well, that's our book for the year -- i think we've earned some tv."
36301,Homer,"ooo, here's one: ""happy little elves two: the sequelf."" two kids."
14425,Homer,after i catch my breath... can we... go... home?
40536,Homer,"well, there he is... michelangelo's dave."
14690,Homer,"marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
31787,Homer,your hip hop cd was boastful and unnecessary!
32223,Homer,"marge, when i'm onstage i can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. so in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
24273,Homer,shut up.
20957,Homer,"five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
37702,Homer,"yeah, well listen, pal. i have my treasure: my wife and my children."
20102,Homer,"marge, i can't feel my legs!"
37499,Homer,yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
33960,Homer,"the one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! ohhh."
29645,Homer,"eh, they'll be fine."
28943,Homer,"okay, just repeat after me. ""edna, i made a huge mistake and i want you back."""

25125,Homer,"dr. joyce brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect."

32250,Homer,all over the floor.
20352,Homer,"a gun is not a weapon, marge. it's a tool. like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. you just need more education on the subject. tell you what: you come with me to an nra meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
20338,Homer,"now, i believe you have some sort of firearm for me."

41557,Homer,yeah.
29594,Homer,"wow, those jackets are beautiful."
37641,Homer,"marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus."
24294,Homer,"wait a minute, barney. you gotta be sober to fly. i mean, it's not like drivin' a car."
26221,Homer,"not a sports fan, huh?"
33891,Homer,killing makes me hun-gry
36162,Homer,"marge, from time to time i've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" where would i find this marvelous contraption?"

17866,Homer,"marge, we had a deal. your sisters don't come here after six, and i stop eating your lipstick."
29570,Homer,"after my makeover i'm gonna get you, boy."
29599,Homer,"lisa, the world is a very complicated place. and when you get right down to it... cannonball!"
38510,Homer,fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!
33143,Homer,"now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--"

29744,Homer,"hey, i earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, i'm at work busting my hump."
32537,Homer,"moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and i can't remember what happened last night. was i here?"
22546,Homer,"wow. did you see that thing, marge? so powerful. so commanding. so forceful and raw. it didn't ask, it just took."

26794,Homer,whee! whee!
34841,Homer,"well, if you check your purse i think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
41142,Homer,"well, am i?"
36685,Homer,"but we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. and fast!"
26971,Homer,outstanding.
27326,Homer,you know what made me feel better about myself? that award i got for world's greatest dad.
22101,Homer,hold it! what's your clearance?
24804,Homer,i know.
37159,Homer,"if they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
22345,Homer,my spine.
19650,Homer,come on. there's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
38401,Homer,but...
15741,Homer,the other day i was so desperate for a beer i snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
38538,Homer,yeah! and aren't!
41385,Homer,"you have reached the office of homer simpson. if you are calling about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. if you need--"
21168,Homer,simpson residence.
14542,Homer,i have a secret weapon.
27577,Homer,for the past week i've been carrying around this bag of sugar. it's taught me how to love and care for a child.
37067,Homer,"okay, you're right. it's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but i think the choice is obvious -- my dad."
28426,Homer,"okay, you wanna go over there."
33210,Homer,fine. i won't look you in the eye.
19204,Homer,"all right, i think we've heard just about enough from mr. newspaper today."
27919,Homer,"what? it said ""take one."""
15590,Homer,"that yentl puts the ""she"" in yeshiva."
25214,Homer,"hey, where're you going with that?"
35843,Homer,"i'll never eat turkey again. marge, we got any ham?"
31423,Homer,you kids like ice cream?
13909,Homer,no. i need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
22637,Homer,maybe you'd feel better if we watched some tv together.
40941,Homer,is that selma? ring-a-ding-ding!
17368,Homer,they hid them in every millionth krusty klump bar and krusty klump bar with almonds.
35886,Homer,"look, all i want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!"
37242,Homer,this room just got a whole lot cooler.
17847,Homer,"--alia! america, australia, ameri-- ow!"
23551,Homer,the cooling tank just blew and they're taking lenny to the hospital.
15697,Homer,"whelp, time to go to work."
35516,Homer,"no, a guy at work seems not to like me. i guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
29851,Homer,you don't know the half of it.
38006,Homer,what the-- burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
40436,Homer,what show is this?
32523,Homer,"marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins."
29066,Homer,you know i'm not pie man.
36520,Homer,"you're sellin' milk, j.j., and i've got a sour stomach."
19630,Homer,shhh! you're causing more avalanches. .
33733,Homer,hm. it feels like food. but it has no flavor whatsoever.
27755,Homer,mr. burns' reign of terror is over.
27090,Homer,sorry mick!
27082,Homer,"out of my way, nerdlinger."
29411,Homer,what a magical party this has been. mr. burns is a great man.
16856,Homer,"see, i told ya. there's nothin' to worry about. this place isn't..."
40290,Homer,"oh, knock it off, flanders! don't start blubbering on me. i'm gonna miss you too... not."
27058,Homer,i don't remember anybody telling me i was gonna be on tv.
32861,Homer,why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!
24380,Homer,par-ty!
17037,Homer,that depends. is there another way to get this job?
13258,Homer,"bart, help! sonnn!"
14264,Homer,"no, marge, i just can't. i mean, look at me. i'm a trainee... they won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. but i can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
25484,Homer,"okay, now. put..."
25972,Homer,can do. now don't you worry about a thing.
27216,Homer,"hey, get out, i'm in here! oh."
27028,Homer,"manimals, invertebroads! you must fight back against the one who did this to you!"
39906,Homer,"oh, just some blueprints adil wanted. i'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. i bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to."
21625,Homer,"oh, look what you did. now i have to get my cold cream gun."
40381,Homer,"what, are you afraid to make a real bet?"
20553,Homer,"pfft. that's what they said about this billy beer, smartypants."
17635,Homer,woo hoo!
40354,Homer,flanders! what are you doing here?
39839,Homer,"okay. your wish is my command, my little..."
36185,Homer,what about cupid? he's smokin' hot.
28698,Homer,"flanders, pull over! i'm an ambulance!"
22490,Homer,"i'm picking it up. ""sala"" seems to mean jerk. and i think ""manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
32106,Homer,a fresh face!
19553,Homer,it's him!
19140,Homer,no?
24332,Homer,barney...
31197,Homer,what about with my ears?
37803,Homer,"sorry, little fella. one day i'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away."
40108,Homer,karl! so that wasn't just a sweet voice i heard inside my head. what are you doing here?
19154,Homer,"say, what's going on?"
21770,Homer,here we go!
35203,Homer,i thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
15568,Homer,"don't hassle the dead, boy. they have eerie powers."
25954,Homer,"yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?"
22146,Homer,"i think i saw him in ""rent,"" or ""stomp,"" or ""clomp,"" or some piece of crap."
39655,Homer,"bart! oh bart! bart, bart! oh, bart, my beautiful son. why couldn't you have taken me? of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"
22126,Homer,shake on it?
25311,Homer,"it's obvious what's happening. i'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me."
32609,Homer,happier!
30397,Homer,will she know what this is regarding?
37660,Homer,this is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
14389,Homer,play on.
21632,Homer,but this is the best i could do. i guess i'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson.
29998,Homer,five ninety-nine?! what a rip-off! someone should shoot you!
29745,Homer,"yes, president franklin."
15585,Homer,but i love solids.
17919,Homer,"sir, today every country has a national anthem. did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
30375,Homer,"i dunno, maybe. plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
25701,Homer,"ooo, ned, look who's here. it's that girl you don't like... not!"
13819,Homer,"marge, don't flake out on me. that monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
36099,Homer,friends are the only people you can betray! and you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
26993,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
21663,Homer,"yeah, quit stalling, marge. we want our reward."
30649,Homer,"i know, and he's magic!"
15136,Homer,chief justice of the supreme court. what great men he would join. john marshall... charles evans hughes... warren burger... mmm burger.
39426,Homer,"look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. i don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic."
38629,Homer,"oh yeah, great. great, marge. great work. thanks to you, springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
24674,Homer,now these are the tunes i want you boys to play.
19157,Homer,nothing big. it's just a lot of little things.
35856,Homer,"hey, sweetie. marge said there was some family tension. and at christmas of all times."
26985,Homer,ned...
32894,Homer,"i feel terrible. my own mother reached out to me, and i rejected her. i'm gonna make her a card."
40369,Homer,it just is. that's why.
36177,Homer,okay... place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
14526,Homer,"boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
16608,Homer,asleep at the switch! i wasn't asleep! i was drunk!
29720,Homer,stupid spider... afraid of dying.
30188,Homer,i am a little pudgy. you got me. yeah.
36441,Homer,i'm your jesus! me!
20298,Homer,that cost me 35 cents!
37128,Homer,you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go!
17484,Homer,i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
19439,Homer,oh... kay. i think i'm gonna be leaving now.
30061,Homer,marge... what if the rapture is coming and i haven't led a good enough life? i could be... left below!
29725,Homer,a spider!
20110,Homer,ooohh...
20355,Homer,"hi, i'm homer s."
37176,Homer,wanna split it while we snuggle?
24517,Homer,who told you about those laws? was it marge?
39671,Homer,tangy.
15653,Homer,"for your information, i'm his father!"
21133,Homer,uhmmmm... errr... uhhhhh...
31656,Homer,"aw, my little girl's just like cbs news."
36791,Homer,"oh lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. then you switched it off knowing full well i had declined thy infernal mapple care. please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. and please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen."
31225,Homer,"ooh, gummy worms!"
25321,Homer,"absolutely, sweetie."
37551,Homer,costume drama or naughty comedy?
16674,Homer,"stop being such babies. you can't be afraid to try new things. for instance, tonight i'm using a... apu, what do you call this thing again?"
18359,Homer,can you recommend a doctor who will?
13173,Homer,love... conquers... all.
28941,Homer,"really? boy, it sucks to be you. anyhoo, if there's one thing i know, it's how to win back a furious woman. we'll go to her house, and i'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
27150,Homer,"oh, it's red wire to red wire. what idiot dreamed that up?"
36150,Homer,"attention, lovers of free office supplies! come and steal things you can easily afford!"
27646,Homer,stupid flanders. i'm not giving you any of my secret moves.
17338,Homer,"lisa, if the bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
32299,Homer,who are you guys?
36538,Homer,"aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
16912,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll get you a new elephant."
13774,Homer,"look, i get enough admiration and respect at work. i don't need it here at home."
14855,Homer,twenty minutes?!
41303,Homer,don't blow the surprise. pretend you forgot.
29462,Homer,that was me.
23107,Homer,"relax, we're in an electric car."
41542,Homer,"hey, i worked hard all day to pay for your education. can't i get all zima-ed up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?"
19043,Homer,"it's low tide, boys."
23482,Homer,of course not. but you know something? sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
16049,Homer,"must destroy mankind! ohh, lunch time."
39092,Homer,"from now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words."
20179,Homer,"aw, lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
35790,Homer,can you be my dad?
35585,Homer,it's alive?!
23217,Homer,"way to guilt him, marge!"
25713,Homer,mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
29222,Homer,"screw you, doc! i fly from the gut."
19001,Homer,thank you. thank you very much.
21779,Homer,"aw, nuts."
37071,Homer,"oh, how very kind of you. i am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! one lump, please."
33975,Homer,"listen: of all the crazy things i've ever done, this is the craziest. and you're doing it."
37075,Homer,"kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family."
40920,Homer,but marge...
13658,Homer,nah.
20700,Homer,"the experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
26546,Homer,"i told you, i have too much time on my hands."
27497,Homer,there it is.
26058,Homer,oh! yeah. monty's a wild man! yeah!

32085,Homer,my favorite is chicago deep dish.
20391,Homer,"oh-ho, confused, would we?"
20737,Homer,"yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems."
14650,Homer,i know. i want to pet him again!
31381,Homer,moe's the princess of lollipop land! he lunches on lavender and potpourri!
32324,Homer,point one oh with a stomach full of bread. my final offer.
37591,Homer,lisa. i'll miss you when this is all over.
38977,Homer,"d-doo doo doo doo doo! y'know, you're the closest thing i've ever had to a brother."
14498,Homer,"""maybe it's the beer talking, marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? get outta here."""
36280,Homer,"now, let me raise this beer to toast..."
19391,Homer,"yello? yes... mental hospital? i don't know any ""ned flanders."""

23811,Homer,i got the groceries!
35756,Homer,woo-hoo! all right!
35615,Homer,"marge, get my seal club! the big one!"
27246,Homer,"marge, i'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled."
24379,Homer,my pockets hurt.
32738,Homer,that's right. now i'll cut and you soak.
37065,Homer,"now i know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes."
24078,Homer,why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
38405,Homer,dinner party at the neighbors'. at least i can drink.
14475,Homer,"well, i gotta go."
21022,Homer,"oh, he did, did he? i'll show him! i'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
38105,Homer,oh yeah!
29281,Homer,"uh-um... what do you think ""some"" is?"
25364,Homer,"all right, now here's the 411: i'm a record producer, see. i'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for bart."
24956,Homer,"come on, pony up, flanders. the kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
34874,Homer,possibly!
25252,Homer,"tennis court, eh?..."
41521,Homer,tell that to the brave crew of the s.s. triangle.
20662,Homer,"lisa, no! your hands are too weak!"

19797,Homer,"bart, i'm gonna turn my back -- and when i turn around, i wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
37568,Homer,i still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
34397,Homer,"please, please, please..."
32515,Homer,no.
25808,Homer,"and it's important to feel good about yourself... okay, spread your toes. do you know how much glass is in here?"

21734,Homer,i just lost my appetite.
27211,Homer,"fine, watch your stupid eagles concert."

36361,Homer,"yeah, for you kids maybe. for dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""is that splashing or drowning?"""
23779,Homer,"hey, let's go skiing right now!"
30638,Homer,"it's called a hangover, sweetie. and it's an unavoidable part of life."
22288,Homer,serves you little punks right. maybe next time you'll think befo--
36847,Homer,"i have a plan to deal with that. step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
22557,Homer,"are you saying i'm gay? because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
39031,Homer,"uh, i'd like to offer you something... but all i've got is coffee... with cream!"

16715,Homer,"dad, i love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
19341,Homer,ooh! you're feisty. i'm gonna give you a madonna cut.
40382,Homer,"how about this henny penny? if bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn."

22315,Homer,they won't?
34855,Homer,all right. we'll get the vaccine.

30250,Homer,"it got your hopes up, didn't it?"
28680,Homer,no! they were all in their own way totally awesome.
33637,Homer,who would do this to me?! it would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
28394,Homer,"oh god, they're in our food! teddy grahams, gummi bears..."

30870,Homer,stupid non-plasma tv. picture so blurry. might as well rub dirt in my eyes.
39696,Homer,"this isn't gambling, marge. it's a lead pipe cinch."
28604,Homer,like a dog. or a snowman!
29968,Homer,"overeating. and if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. but there won't be time."
37334,Homer,"once again, by eating alone i have saved my marriage."
24474,Homer,"in about fifteen minutes i'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
23053,Homer,"sayonara, suckers!"

23972,Homer,"that's right. just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... oh, i can't even finish. i wanna be rich!"
20264,Homer,you're mutants?
28100,Homer,"the noble chiefs outsmarted the treacherous cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. i shall bet no more forever."
39654,Homer,his lucky red hat! oh dear god! no! bart!
37515,Homer,he's not your daddy.

26504,Homer,fine.
19592,Homer,"oh, thank god. it's only grampa."
40348,Homer,"okay, okay, all right, all right. she's right! let's do something together. what does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
18936,Homer,"hello, selma? selma my dear? how are you? uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... listen, shut up for a second. how would you like to marry apu so he doesn't get deported?"
28121,Homer,stupid prey. they never suspect anything.

30684,Homer,"uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
35773,Homer,"you know, you're kind of a downer."

33327,Homer,"use as many big words as possible. i call ""computer."" bart, you can have ""doorbell."""
19912,Homer,"yes! my precious ""cartoons!"" ""who pumped ethyl?!"""

39372,Homer,those perfectionists? forget it.
35110,Homer,so... chicken.
35932,Homer,then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
33129,Homer,marge?
13742,Homer,kill my boy! kill my boy!
28406,Homer,what kind of an example would i be if i didn't take revenge on things?
39099,Homer,"comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me..."
18659,Homer,then we're agreed. there'll be trouble.
36993,Homer,see? these are our bug-out bags. in here is everything we need to survive.
40092,Homer,"rainy day. there's never gonna be a be a rainy day, marge. there's not a cloud in the simpson sky. and what does my little girl want?"
41208,Homer,"thank you, my lusty friend."
26983,Homer,"go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
25562,Homer,wowww... it just rolled over to ten thousand.
37665,Homer,overstay my welcome for forty years?
31613,Homer,"so this map leads to a treasure, huh?"
36977,Homer,typical sheeple.
14581,Homer,"good one, lenny."
25351,Homer,"so, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
17256,Homer,stuck-up riverdale punks. think they're too good for me.
25694,Homer,good idea.
24460,Homer,oh! what's that awful sound?
36217,Homer,"look at it go! all right! hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town."
19720,Homer,"yes. i certainly do. hello there, itchy. i know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish i would go away, but i think we got off on the wrong foot. i know i can come off a little proactive, and for that i'm sorry. but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, i know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
13322,Homer,uh oh.
31850,Homer,yellow card!
34369,Homer,your mother thinks i'm working on the car!
21627,Homer,"in the olden times, if you were watching tv and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. it was the hardest thing in the world to do. but now, with the lazy man reclining toilet chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip."
22684,Homer,they like me because i'm brave.
19747,Homer,"whoa, not me. and not because john's gay, but because he's a sneak. he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
26065,Homer,"yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man burns."
24455,Homer,"hey, we got a postcard from bart. ""dear mom and homer. i'm having fun."" aw, sounds like he's having fun."
32707,Homer,just gimme a minute. but feel free to go nuts on me.
14893,Homer,i'm this close to having a comb-over!
19897,Homer,"you forgot one thing, wiggum."
33175,Homer,"hey moe, gimme a--"
40793,Homer,do the hustle!
38913,Homer,stressful. do you see how loose my tie is?
17405,Homer,"hmm, i saw that report you did on sasquatch. it was fair and evenhanded. i'll do it."
27535,Homer,"oh look, god's giving us a little shower."
28399,Homer,"you cowardly swede! you face that bear like a man, or i'll never speak to you again."
24890,Homer,they're with god now.
33064,Homer,"stop it, both of you! don't make me drive into that tree! you know i will!"
16250,Homer,"mmmmm, candy."
34404,Homer,"hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. what are you up to?"
38606,Homer,"thanks, charlie. maybe fracking isn't so bad."
39748,Homer,fair enough.
39912,Homer,hmmm.
35322,Homer,my ear makes money?
20817,Homer,"that's a negatory, good buddy!"
16728,Homer,"ah, tv respects me. it laughs with me, not at me."
36339,Homer,homie!
39813,Homer,look marge... honey... baby doll... i...
30444,Homer,yes i am! i mean...
14597,Homer,"yes, money... i mean honey. ooooh! here comes a news report about the lottery!"
23413,Homer,why that little... he insulted your honor!
16273,Homer,"oh lisa, haven't you seen ""home alone?"" if some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
22720,Homer,no problem. i'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
34047,Homer,"okay. kiss me, baby! kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!"
13278,Homer,b'oh!
25367,Homer,will you two shut up? i'm missing precious vj prattle.
32935,Homer,"mom, i'm so sorry. you just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. well, if i get out of this i promise you i'll grant your last wish."
28685,Homer,why do you keep talking that way?!
22638,Homer,no it's not.
19684,Homer,you'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
29036,Homer,flanders!? he's not man enough to trim my crust. i mean pie man's crust. i'm not pie man.
38342,Homer,hey! where's my junk?
30111,Homer,woo hoo! i was right!
31463,Homer,marge?
33293,Homer,bo-ring!
25035,Homer,"yes, exactly!"
21005,Homer,"ooh, funky."
37562,Homer,a whole weekend away from my family. i can't believe i have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. send me a picture?
39948,Homer,oooh.
31482,Homer,but your mother smells like coconut!
32669,Homer,"for the next two hours, we'll be kid free. it'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall."
18303,Homer,lousy smarch weather.
34235,Homer,"with that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
15137,Homer,if you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
35550,Homer,death to america!
26006,Homer,"ah, whatever. just give me a duff."
13452,Homer,"sorry, sir."
39020,Homer,"aw, man, i wish those were white meatballs."
37074,Homer,"all right, marge. maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. we'll take what we can get."
32189,Homer,my pleasure. if ever i would leave you / it wouldn't be in summer. / seeing you in summer i never would go...
26010,Homer,"moe, we want our bar back."
26921,Homer,"good, 'cause i need directions."
13927,Homer,do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
33193,Homer,"i know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
34721,Homer,"well, it's a cat -- i'm not sure it's the cat."
18913,Homer,"oh, how does it work?"
40066,Homer,"oh marge, every woman i i­n­t­e­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me."
29364,Homer,"no problem. bart, i need two hundred dollars."
37639,Homer,"marge! get away from those freaks! you belong to me! the dumb, hairless brute!"
20490,Homer,you dog.
38292,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid!"
27818,Homer,it's the only worthwhile thing i ever made that wasn't lisa.
26517,Homer,mmm! that's the next best thing to eating lenny.
26596,Homer,so that means i don't have to pay the fare.
19473,Homer,okay.
41198,Homer,she said that?
28283,Homer,"la, la, la..."
32065,Homer,"i'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. you can stay. but you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our wall of casual acquaintances who came to stay for a while."
14797,Homer,this sucks. where is that channel changer?
18483,Homer,"do i know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
33426,Homer,you're the government's problem now!
41018,Homer,because you think i'm a genius?
15370,Homer,marge that's...
38601,Homer,and now i banish you from paradise! i'm glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
40027,Homer,i have hair!... i have hair!
36806,Homer,"marge, up to now i thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now i know it's a solid loaf of brain."
38711,Homer,all camping is pointless. you drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. i guess what i'm trying to say is: where's maggie?
26909,Homer,"see, when you don't use milhouse, it's hard. i love this kid."
28236,Homer,"oh mom, i'm so happy! i never want to let you go!"
20147,Homer,ow!
32811,Homer,"song's over, dad."
16689,Homer,i'm aware of that.
16176,Homer,right here.
28141,Homer,moe?! what are you doing here?
37713,Homer,let's do it.
24734,Homer,bor-ing!
16139,Homer,"well, i also do a delightful impression of him. i paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
14991,Homer,give him one for me.
18403,Homer,"hey, all i have to type is ""y."""
34936,Homer,coming!
18197,Homer,"shut up, judge!"
31147,Homer,"buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own marge."
15283,Homer,"kids! if we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
16582,Homer,return to your homes and places of businesses!
38097,Homer,"you're right. bad idea, bad idea... should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? bad idea, bad."
19396,Homer,i engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. now that's psychiatry! eh? eh?
32945,Homer,i thought i was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
23723,Homer,sorry.
13307,Homer,this isn't going well at all.
24547,Homer,"that horoscope was baloney. nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. what's for dessert?"
14178,Homer,"but marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
15013,Homer,"hey ganesha, want a peanut?"
13672,Homer,"see, marge? you knock tv and then it helps you out. i think you owe somebody a little apology."
27997,Homer,what has he done for me lately?
27999,Homer,everyone's against me.
23089,Homer,"do ""ow that hurts."""
32901,Homer,i'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
27101,Homer,it's been a week already?
38792,Homer,but i promised marge.
37173,Homer,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
34316,Homer,"i don't have to do it with him, do i?"
25890,Homer,really. you like skateboards? we're sure learning a lot about each other.
32426,Homer,"marge, i wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?"
28189,Homer,i can't go on...
21254,Homer,"not if we hire more men. and my men will do all your messy jobs. they'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."
27825,Homer,t-shirt from our first rock concert...
33780,Homer,what cologne are you wearing? none of your business! now we'd like our washington monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
30400,Homer,"of all the people for marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
19649,Homer,"marge, i was just watching women's volleyball on espn..."
40176,Homer,"-- or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you."
35108,Homer,"oh marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties."
22325,Homer,me? nah. unless there's a coupon for it. nah.
39203,Homer,"oh, it's lisa. that's ours."
21628,Homer,"sure! believe me, every man in america will want to have one."
31389,Homer,"they got an open bar at this thing, right?"
30211,Homer,that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
24666,Homer,woo! rock 'n' roll!
24255,Homer,sure we can't talk you into it?
17441,Homer,enchiladas.
27828,Homer,"hey, there's writing on the back of this."
36788,Homer,flushy! go get help!
28507,Homer,"there's a trickle-down theory here. if i'm happy, i'm less abusive to the rest of you."
33531,Homer,you just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
16640,Homer,"yep, well, that's what got me where i am today."
17732,Homer,i needed more money to support my growing family. and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
14352,Homer,cincinnati.
16662,Homer,"oh, that i'll wear."
17165,Homer,"mmmm, chocolate... / mmmm, invisible cola. / mmmm, forbidden donut. / mmmm sacrilicious. mmmm, / mmmm, free goo. mmmm, something."
16420,Homer,gotta go.
15593,Homer,woo hoo!
25894,Homer,"all right, all right. come on, bart."
26164,Homer,it's go time.
30117,Homer,"oh, sorry, uh -- i'd tip you, but i don't have any cash."
17373,Homer,i feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
36549,Homer,woo hoo!
35966,Homer,i got this song fever
36692,Homer,that's dad's cologne? i always thought it was his old-man stink.
28452,Homer,"welcome to the homer simpson show. i'm your host, next card. homer simpson it's great to be here in next card. springfield my guests are...moe szyslak, local businessman, carl carlson, raconteur, and lenny leonard, three-time juror. gentlemen, what's on your minds?"
22540,Homer,"well, i think i have a collapsed lung, but okay!"
35153,Homer,"don't feel bad, boy. everyone makes mistakes. yours is just public and expensive."
33234,Homer,"milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... salaam alaikum!"
41415,Homer,here we go... here we go... here we go...
28750,Homer,...i'm taking you all out for pancakes!
40347,Homer,"""neighbors forever. oh, no! ned flanders."""
38764,Homer,it's something you make sketches about.
30440,Homer,woo hoo!
31324,Homer,"sorry, guys. you know, his mother's the one who made me come down here."
38181,Homer,"excuse me, we're trying to find ""café artiste."""
34620,Homer,"i hear what you're saying, lisa -- nothing."
14443,Homer,"well, okay. but you have to swear you're comin' back."
28818,Homer,i sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
35436,Homer,"really, duff blimp? you really want me to?"
36183,Homer,"hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we."""
15955,Homer,so goodbye...
17091,Homer,"lisa, you will respect your new mother. now give her a kiss. kisss herrr."
40295,Homer,"kids, look! street crime!"
15458,Homer,"oh, i thought that said, ""brain hemorrhages."""
37084,Homer,"okay, take whatever time you need. i just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians."
35593,Homer,"...i want you to find out what's making that funny noise in homer simpson's car. it's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. but you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. and you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
20834,Homer,"and you marge, the bringer of beer!"
25149,Homer,i don't understand. that wasn't funny.
38214,Homer,there's sausage being made? where?
31629,Homer,"but marge, i did it all for you!"
22320,Homer,six with the tip.
18033,Homer,splendid. who's coming?
41336,Homer,marge thinks flanders is annoying. this marriage just got interesting.
28895,Homer,"hey, anything's possible. with a little help from my bible."
37318,Homer,i think it would!
32196,Homer,but i can only sing lying on my back.
24409,Homer,it worked! it's a miracle!
14957,Homer,"oooh, waffle run off."
37014,Homer,hm. i cut the wires to something.
25514,Homer,"yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round buddha."
37059,Homer,he was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.
20787,Homer,yes. i am the highly suggestible type.
41196,Homer,hey! you don't have to pay! read the sign!
22170,Homer,now i'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
31713,Homer,look out for the stairs!
16764,Homer,wait a minute race! wait a minute. wait!...ah-ha! now i'll bust that pretty face of yours.
14255,Homer,okay.
20807,Homer,act ii
28278,Homer,i'd like to cash in these chips. give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
13179,Homer,manure for sale! get your manure! loamiest in town!
13696,Homer,"oh, i get it. it's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! well, i wouldn't be caught dead buying this... hello!"
25881,Homer,"i'm with you, son!"
13316,Homer,"hey, what's the matter, son?"
20168,Homer,oh no we don't! judge snyder?
29897,Homer,"well if i was, we'd have taller kids!"
21815,Homer,"well, you know me. i love animals. beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, marge, you're part of the problem."
38672,Homer,why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
15383,Homer,"dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. i'd be honored if you came to live with us."
38767,Homer,"phil collins-era genesis is not as good, huh? ""no reply at all,"" ""land of confusion,"" ""throwing it all away,"" ""illegal alien,"" ""i can't dance,"" and i'm sure i don't need to mention... ""invisible touch!"""
23334,Homer,"eh, i've had a good run."
35684,Homer,really? you'd let me in on your thing? even though i think it's stupid?
35610,Homer,"hello, young man burns."
14094,Homer,a beer?
23442,Homer,"come on, move it!"
13176,Homer,"buenos dias, eduardo. can you write back and tell me what that means?"
35928,Homer,"great show, people. great show. um... not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? not a big deal."
32642,Homer,no. but you're close.
34178,Homer,and you like tomato...
36138,Homer,"here car. here, boy."
19740,Homer,that john is the greatest guy in the world. we've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
33807,Homer,i'm sorry. i got carried away. from now on the only thing i'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. but at least i made lisa popular.
19934,Homer,"well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. so you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
16687,Homer,"i'm coming with you. i got you fired, it's the least i can do... well, the least i can do is absolutely nothing. but i'll go you one better and come along."
24072,Homer,"easy answer, eh?"
28381,Homer,cats!
33702,Homer,"and now, you're gonna visit your grampa while i park around the corner and take a nap."
18545,Homer,hmmm. we didn't have a message when we left. how very odd.
15444,Homer,"please, have mercy."
22560,Homer,"a three-chambered peanut! marge, look what i did! come quick! hurry! marge?"
38256,Homer,"i repeat, no penalty!"
18848,Homer,donut?
16035,Homer,bartdoyouwantsomebrowniesbefore yougotobed?!
34718,Homer,fifty bucks each?! that's your life savings?!
23299,Homer,and the cosby mysteries! that show had limitless possibilities!
38744,Homer,"guys, are you feeling this? are you feeling this?"
26489,Homer,and another thing: no death races!
39541,Homer,wha' th--
23519,Homer,"look, a flying saucer!"
28353,Homer,"hey, this place is amazing. it's fit for a duke, or even an earl..."
36693,Homer,"man, you're making me hot for my dad."
38113,Homer,"uh, okay! um... i can't."
21282,Homer,come to what?
21205,Homer,then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits diaper hill.
25710,Homer,i'm okay.
33837,Homer,where am i?
23007,Homer,let's reschedule.
21604,Homer,uh-huh.
29881,Homer,how did you know?
18036,Homer,"a little too well, if you ask me. i'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
21858,Homer,"yes, i do."
20288,Homer,"yeah, well lenny said it."
17229,Homer,oh look! it's the twelve noon robot parade! hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
27766,Homer,no deal!
18461,Homer,"yeah. well, where have you been all this time?"
39664,Homer,"oooh, ahh. ha! got him!"
33940,Homer,"apu, i have to lose weight now. do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
22398,Homer,shutup! i'm not your clown! don't diminish me!
33132,Homer,"i came here once with marge. are you marge, sylvia?"
16597,Homer,uh... marge?
36811,Homer,"this boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! i am his father... i can't believe i allowed you to hit on me."
15209,Homer,"forget it marge. we already live together; we shouldn't work together. as the bible says ""thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""
40577,Homer,"marge, dear. would it be all right if i went over to moe's for a drink?"
23099,Homer,"before i go, i want to say something. game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. but somewhere along the line, you lost your way. for shame."
37513,Homer,better clean that off.
13977,Homer,anything for my little girl.
20507,Homer,"supper at 4 o'clock? oh-ho, what a sweet deal!"
16999,Homer,pfft. what do babies know?
15127,Homer,i did. i did read to her!
26110,Homer,"look at me, i'm angie dickinson! out of my way!"
17436,Homer,but listen to the music. he's evil!
14233,Homer,our first night together as man and wife.
18147,Homer,f-f-f-f-f-f-
31580,Homer,"oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the greeks called you poseidon, the romans... aquaman. look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again."
18961,Homer,"for more information on grand funk, consult your school library!"
38206,Homer,loser.
13531,Homer,"mmm, thanks -- it looks... hey, wait a minute! just because i'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean i'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! although it is tempting --"
22006,Homer,"oh, we've gotta get home. i don't wanna miss, ""inside the actor's studio."" tonight it's f. murray abraham."
24321,Homer,that's right.
40020,Homer,"oooh, ""gorilla, the conqueror."" the granddaddy of them all."
13356,Homer,i slipped it into your glass as a gag.
41361,Homer,oh my god... is she flirting with me?
17045,Homer,"all right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
40077,Homer,"you got it, buddy!"
20754,Homer,you can't do this to me. what about the carny code?
26114,Homer,huh?... there have been so many classic simpson moments. i remember that time i tried to jump over springfield gorge...
22121,Homer,"okay, we'll call it even."
18939,Homer,correct. now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars?
24152,Homer,"hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?"
39896,Homer,sector twelve?
13761,Homer,"okay, okay, think back to your training..."
23115,Homer,we didn't? that's odd. seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
40317,Homer,"hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. i've become the center of attention."
30407,Homer,i came to get my mail.
39410,Homer,"sorry, no can do!"
35778,Homer,awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
30704,Homer,i drew this picture of you.
17217,Homer,no.
13547,Homer,that's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. they're gonna eat it.
33468,Homer,"beads, please."
22010,Homer,"whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
20548,Homer,now that's interesting.
20310,Homer,bo-ring!
34957,Homer,i repeat: unable to exercise...
23893,Homer,"out of the way, baryshnikov!"
36798,Homer,fine. i'll just go eat the body of god. that's not crazy.
40610,Homer,good thing i'm open-minded.
22961,Homer,a sober irishman?
32627,Homer,"i don't know about you, but i don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where i can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. i say we rebuild the fast-food district -- bigger and better than ever!"
30213,Homer,you have to cheat.
17514,Homer,"i'd like a beer, please."
31152,Homer,"why, 'cause i'm fat?"
30360,Homer,and you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
26769,Homer,"in my role as customer, i saw the whole thing."
15784,Homer,"fellow workers, i've been meeting with mr. burns day and night and i've had enough."
31288,Homer,"must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping."
19928,Homer,can do.
13167,Homer,"good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
26269,Homer,nothing left! nothing left!
34668,Homer,it's like you're a chinese empress!
18841,Homer,"troy, buddy, i gotta know. what's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like selma?"
35262,Homer,"aw, come on, sourpuss. tickle tickle!"
21828,Homer,"oh, i can't. i promised i wouldn't."
25018,Homer,yeah. ya big idiot...
31321,Homer,it was either kill him or kill no one!
26425,Homer,"eh, i'm sick of this tarzan movie."
36384,Homer,looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
26353,Homer,"honey, did you get any sleep?"
30466,Homer,just liftin' this dumbbell.
37909,Homer,one of you turned me in? who was it?
19883,Homer,"ka-boom! blam! oh, excuse me again, dear."
20370,Homer,uh. i'd better just put it down.
35018,Homer,"and me? now, i'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
39025,Homer,well duh!
26976,Homer,"no, you've got chores to do."
35407,Homer,"i can't. they won't let me. lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
34370,Homer,talk to grampa. he used to be a man.
16191,Homer,"well well, look whose come to apologize."
25004,Homer,which one of you youngsters is abe simpson?
34671,Homer,mexico! andalé! andalé! arriba!

15389,Homer,"eh, you don't want to hear that story. i know! i'll tell you about the time i got locked in the bank vault with mr. mooney. it was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
25515,Homer,"so am i, but i don't get all huffy about it."
14993,Homer,"sure, honey."
32731,Homer,"i'm lord evilton from the ""angelica button"" books."
28577,Homer,"marge, wait."
35977,Homer,leaving? why on earth would you think that?
33413,Homer,"oh, come on! that millionaire playboy? he's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the wayne foundation."
38648,Homer,don't drink my loved ones!
28390,Homer,it's a deal!
32883,Homer,you're alive! and you baked a pie!
35232,Homer,stop speaking spanish!
28760,Homer,"...who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? geez."
14326,Homer,"don't worry, you'll grow into it."
13193,Homer,"and jack sprat? is that him, too?"
18685,Homer,spurlock's cafeteria it is.
18959,Homer,"but this is grand funk railroad! you guys back there know grand funk, right?"
25245,Homer,"whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
17796,Homer,"and - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and ah. here's your giraffe, little girl."
32534,Homer,hey boy! do you know where the family is? show me on mapquest.
17894,Homer,no! i'm giving them a foot massage. at least let me have that.
22868,Homer,it's glorious! the streets are paved with water. you could ride a walrus to work!
15928,Homer,"now kids, while your mother's gone, i don't wanna have to wash any dishes. so, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet."
20081,Homer,"oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
28775,Homer,"i know, we'll use reverse psychology. maggie, don't press the red button!"
32326,Homer,can't be late for lisa's big day...
24186,Homer,"friends -- when i came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. but now i've learned to love this island as my second..."
32013,Homer,all the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
36925,Homer,i happen to remember it just a little differently.
15961,Homer,it was one lousy applicant after another. and then...
13507,Homer,oops.
40006,Homer,"ain't that the truth. you know, one time he --"
27271,Homer,your family is invited to a free weekend at stagnant springs spa.
22640,Homer,awful entertaining.
27796,Homer,i have to go.
25617,Homer,oh god oh god oh god!
38730,Homer,oh my god... i'm amazing.
36456,Homer,"daughters of jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
25879,Homer,swing!
13990,Homer,"well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
28019,Homer,i'll never mock the coast guard again. you navy rejects are all right!
41272,Homer,"mmm. look at his eyes. he's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the good las vegas way."
21117,Homer,"uhhhh, like those. but involving you."
21667,Homer,nah. they mess up my hair.
40203,Homer,"ooooh, cushy."
26659,Homer,"oh, man, i can't believe we spaced on the date."
21793,Homer,"please, homer. c'mon, if you let me hang around a while, i can do all kinds of stuff for ya."
22333,Homer,c'mon!
40864,Homer,"yeah, that's right. eight o'clock, my place. come one, come all."
30726,Homer,stupid bart... makes me drive to oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of matt groening ...
13783,Homer,"but i really can't tell them anything, sir."
27355,Homer,what are you buying? jerk stuff?
18932,Homer,i never should have bought this button. can i have my three dollars back?
25695,Homer,could get hurt. could. there's a chance they won't.
23656,Homer,"so, how's the tribe comin' along? any papooses?"
25583,Homer,this flower saved our lives.
16325,Homer,i'm thirsty.
35590,Homer,oh my god! she's still on the first sentence! must make her stop... how to express my...
19544,Homer,you do?
29611,Homer,hm... where's lenny and carl?
22873,Homer,what the?! who the?! hey!
31210,Homer,what?!
13209,Homer,"why, of cour-- no."
30208,Homer,"log cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. blessed art thou among syrups and..."
30519,Homer,"sorry, bart!"
26150,Homer,"son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of god."
30641,Homer,uh-oh.
14022,Homer,"bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson."
39832,Homer,"oh, thanks, boy."
32330,Homer,woo hoo!
16429,Homer,"oh, what the hell, it's me. i'm attracted to another woman. what am i going to do?"
37085,Homer,"man, you sure can talk surfer talk."
39453,Homer,"quick, bart, give me a kiss."
24042,Homer,"no they didn't. they just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit."
16238,Homer,that's what ballet is?
24629,Homer,new springfield rocks!
38549,Homer,"don't worry, marge. they can't beat us. because we're family-run."
32180,Homer,"oh, i can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"
19984,Homer,"well, i am mr. sparkle!"
41304,Homer,"uh-oh. if you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!"
37335,Homer,"for reasons i forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. but what i know for sure, is that i want to share it with you."
16707,Homer,"look, maggie! it's sgt. thug's mountaintop command post, complete with death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
39566,Homer,"lisa, what did i tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?"
36776,Homer,okay.
16102,Homer,those bastards...
26120,Homer,"it's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
25729,Homer,"no, that's not how ya do it."
24092,Homer,so if you're tired of dating the same old losers...
35135,Homer,"that's it, boy! i'm eating your yogurt!"
22671,Homer,i went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. how was yours?
40548,Homer,a hundred bucks?
20455,Homer,"oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
33578,Homer,interesting proposal. now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
23492,Homer,ah-ha!
17991,Homer,"i said, pull my finger."
34234,Homer,sorry boy. you have school tomorrow.
29722,Homer,spider poison is people poison?!
34796,Homer,i repeat: no one will ever know.
21859,Homer,"i believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. if celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively."
36488,Homer,"hey, why don't we go see lady gaga? that'll turn your frown upside down."
19023,Homer,...so i realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
15890,Homer,hey kids. how was school?
41299,Homer,"eh, how bad could it be?"
33039,Homer,this counts as a parent-teacher conference!
13257,Homer,i am the ghost of--
15256,Homer,i'm gonna fight this thing.
40281,Homer,i'll say!
19141,Homer,any sugar around here?
23774,Homer,come on!
19537,Homer,"oh, marge, i've never felt so alone. no one believes me. uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""i believe you, homer."""
15818,Homer,"thanks for coming to visit me, moe."
24239,Homer,ding-dong!
30986,Homer,"but baby, a man has needs."
16857,Homer,"hi, mom."
17829,Homer,krusty! oh thanks! thanks a lot! you came here to save me!
19628,Homer,we sure did!
33473,Homer,"don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. i ripped all the copper wire out of the walls."
32166,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
37231,Homer,how are you a winner? you're cheating in a fake sport!
36270,Homer,i got it...
27731,Homer,"yes, sir."
30608,Homer,that flag is mine! don't mess with texas!
17010,Homer,"now, what you gotta do / if you want to get a kiss / is act real smooth / and make your move like this."
26551,Homer,"all right, let's try the red one."
24087,Homer,a man who's not afraid to cry.
18137,Homer,"faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!"
35099,Homer,my feet hurt.
21802,Homer,chanterelle --
21457,Homer,"when you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
14847,Homer,"well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
20313,Homer,"i'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
17543,Homer,"all right, lisa, you got your way. your mom's going to a psychiatrist. she's gonna tell marge to leave me. it'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
14753,Homer,ooooh.
15098,Homer,did you walk the dog?
23467,Homer,"oh, a little bit of everything."
36244,Homer,"so, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
23707,Homer,"hey, don't make me hassle you, lisa."
39518,Homer,"so you had a little scuffle, eh? hope you won."
21651,Homer,"look, son. edison was just like me."
26216,Homer,use both hands...
31148,Homer,"good idea, honey. buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?"
38720,Homer,i understand. i already signed up for this place next year. i gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
31284,Homer,"if he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"
33598,Homer,our first refund.
28241,Homer,"you weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and i want you to see it."
27107,Homer,"my dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. i was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. i'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
24099,Homer,"how could she not? the place is full of eligible bachelors -- john wayne, tupac shakur, sherlock holmes..."
35835,Homer,how would you know?
36024,Homer,"so, dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in lisa's head?"
20827,Homer,and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
32709,Homer,"wait, what's that smell? it's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water."
30066,Homer,judgment day is at hand.
23963,Homer,"agh, my mouth!"
14710,Homer,i did bad in school.
34082,Homer,"oh sweetie, i found you! now, who's gonna find us? help!"
15395,Homer,whaat?
20836,Homer,woo hoo!
18453,Homer,you see that stone angel up there? that's my mother's grave. my dad points it out every time we drive by.
28446,Homer,wanna play some air hockey?
13979,Homer,"ooooooh, mcbain."
29679,Homer,"hey look, a dragon."
27652,Homer,mmm... promo.
40689,Homer,"you gotta help me, barney. i'm in jail."
24497,Homer,mamma mia! now i'll have to do it.
31163,Homer,i used to be so embarrassed buying these.
24981,Homer,"well, you're the mark."
37504,Homer,but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson...
37007,Homer,if jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
24713,Homer,"maybe so, but dawson's gonna be bummed."
37211,Homer,"it's okay, dad. we know the truth, and we love you."
24976,Homer,would you?
35158,Homer,hey! don't you know it's awards season? who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
16105,Homer,"look! you pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
30388,Homer,i'm so itchy!
39462,Homer,no! i'm not done yet.
36799,Homer,"moe, i could believe this was a random occurrence, or i could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. i'm choosin' hope! moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
23064,Homer,the toilet recommended a place called americatown.
26557,Homer,the one i didn't make and marge didn't make and bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
21057,Homer,i'unno.
27404,Homer,"hello, this is a phone survey. if the election were held today, would you vote for ""a"" the cops are there, or ""b"" you are free to talk?"
29432,Homer,"listen you two, i'll tell you who the true god is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!"
32897,Homer,asleep with your eyes open? mom?
25765,Homer,my kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
28763,Homer,"go, seminoles!"
35710,Homer,"here's fifty bucks. for the next two hours, i don't want to know you exist."
40575,Homer,"no i don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. uh oh i better answer. no, thank you."
24436,Homer,fine. there are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
17377,Homer,oooh -- gummy bears. gummy calves heads. gummy jaw breakers.
40735,Homer,she's mine!
29494,Homer,"you gotta get me closer, chief!"
19469,Homer,where's your mother?
32628,Homer,"c'mon, marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
22087,Homer,homer simpson -- nerd buster. and i'm gettin' you out of here!
17169,Homer,"okay, marge. as long as we're traumatizing the kids, i have a scandalous story of my own."
17718,Homer,"well who wouldn't be upset? that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday! hey, where're you going?"
23701,Homer,will you teach me?
28183,Homer,i'm gonna not kill you every week.
35143,Homer,he what?...
18938,Homer,please identify this object.
20736,Homer,"hey, there's a sucker."
22693,Homer,"my hat's off to you, red. you're a true american hero. and you did it with style and dignity and... hey, you're not breathing. don't people usually breathe?"
35668,Homer,"that's good, marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
39872,Homer,"wait a minute, skinner. how do we know some principal over in france isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
38848,Homer,"don't worry, this time i'm gonna write down where i parked."
16625,Homer,"ahh, the morning horoscope. ""today will be a day like every other day."" it just gets worse and worse."
26293,Homer,"ooh, they're showing the filling now. can they do that?"
30286,Homer,"okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. i have cousins near here. we'll stay with them."
16613,Homer,"aw, dad, i could kiss you."
27554,Homer,"well, i'm not opening the door."
40376,Homer,bart! what're you doing? get down from there before the neighbors see --
29444,Homer,"well, at least we're all in this together."
27733,Homer,"well, he does. all my life i've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. mr. burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" no, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
17218,Homer,don't mind if i do.
32914,Homer,"okay, this is it. i've got one last chance to make up for the things i said to my mom. i will avenge you!"
30886,Homer,"yeah, well i have full tenure."
28932,Homer,"right, naked duffman?"
40364,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. this time move your head and don't follow through."
28243,Homer,"welcome to your room, mom. i want you to stay here forever."
15321,Homer,oooh. heh heh heh.
35119,Homer,"so lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?"
24438,Homer,poor cyborganizer
40339,Homer,"okay, okay. it wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!"
30687,Homer,uh... well i... i think you're my pappy!
23924,Homer,"everybody. i found burnsie's address book. i called the new york yankees and told them to bunt, and then i called the queen of england and asked her how it was going, and then i..."
38123,Homer,i'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage!
20591,Homer,i don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
22689,Homer,"huh? oh, right. the steak."
25148,Homer,a walk? that's a really good idea.
23958,Homer,i don't wanna!
29215,Homer,you're not the boss of me.
25732,Homer,"well, marge isn't here. she had to identify a body at the morgue."
13844,Homer,huh? what?
14622,Homer,i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
41571,Homer,but i need it...
17116,Homer,"ooh, the tinkler. i like the sound of that. we'll take it."
17255,Homer,we're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
29467,Homer,that's because i hate her.
22837,Homer,"i'm gonna be an outsider artist! that way, i can turn all these old baseball cards, disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
34544,Homer,"the wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. check it out, gang."
19788,Homer,"hang onto it, toy-boy! you might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
31089,Homer,"uh, yeah. i started when you were in the hospital. i was so worried. recently i tried this thing called ""beer."" and..."
13416,Homer,i never knew what superman saw in her. give me wonder woman! and that golden lariat. she can tie me up any time.
30215,Homer,"celibacy?! i was talking about the meat on friday thing. man, you guys got more crazy rules than blockbuster video."
38858,Homer,prove it.
31952,Homer,i hope it's spaghetti!
28378,Homer,that's my old lady.
27059,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty great..."
16732,Homer,i can't! i can't!
34562,Homer,"one, two, three, tug!"
25013,Homer,"yeah. we're not criminals. we're just two crazy, mixed-up kids."
14439,Homer,whaa...
29208,Homer,never!
15177,Homer,don't you think i know that?
21425,Homer,"hey, look what was in here. a program from that guy's funeral."
25975,Homer,"man, when's the last time moe cleaned this?"
19896,Homer,"hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
22763,Homer,"no problem, lord. and it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if i had a few extra wives."
22246,Homer,"oh, those awful women want their omelettes."
24384,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
31731,Homer,"dad, do you know what you were kissing? do you? do you?"
36835,Homer,"in my house, we found human bones."
24867,Homer,"nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. nelson is gold."
36616,Homer,"yeah, no kids to ruin it."
29702,Homer,"ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture."
35662,Homer,out of my way! / move it! / geeks must yield to normals!
31336,Homer,i don't understand. how does punishing them teach me a lesson?
16721,Homer,hey.
29821,Homer,"hold on a minute. governor, i've been using my powers of snitching for evil. but now i want to tattle for good. this prison is a hellhole. they feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!"
27943,Homer,"look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats."
23626,Homer,come to daddy! come to daddy!
20231,Homer,ohh! saxomophone.
36772,Homer,i'm standing by that.
31072,Homer,"no, it was the happiest night of my life! the warm spring air, the swings i took in the batting cage afterwards... don't you remember, darling?"

37136,Homer,"oh, it'll happen again, son."
25097,Homer,animotion.
21764,Homer,"oh yeah, couldn't put it down."
40959,Homer,"thirty years! i'll never find him. i'm doomed to walk through this life alone. oh brother, where art thou?!"
36720,Homer,could you please not sound like you like it so much?
33602,Homer,"well, we need help. someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
14011,Homer,oh this isn't working at all. it's hopeless... wait a second.
38751,Homer,i still want one.
20409,Homer,"yes, roy."
28130,Homer,look at those pants. they're standing up with no one in them.

21739,Homer,"look, marge! maggie lost her baby legs!"
18672,Homer,"oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
28007,Homer,"barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
18107,Homer,"boy, when marge first told me she was going to the police academy, i thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""spaceballs."" but instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""police academy."""
35792,Homer,"oh sorry, sweetie. bart can read it to you."
25483,Homer,"no, i do!"
38907,Homer,"set a course, mr. maggie. anywhere but home."
33147,Homer,"hmm, all right. the trick is to ease them off--"

34488,Homer,"oh man, this is so awesome! i can't believe i'm having breakfast where the cops do."
30659,Homer,"i know, it's weird, isn't it?"
17790,Homer,kill wealthy dowager.
26537,Homer,now that's what i call a moon shot.
15296,Homer,fine. i'll never ever do another stupid thing. good night!
26301,Homer,i'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. show the movie!
29915,Homer,"fine, i admit it. help me, ray! appear and strike them down!"
28951,Homer,and the castrati?
24167,Homer,"mmm, i can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: bart, you're the man of the house. lisa -- i'm promoting you to boy. maggie's now the brainy girl. the toaster can fill in for maggie. and marge, you're a consultant."
21327,Homer,hm.
39059,Homer,"thank you, roll of masking tape!"
27018,Homer,"uh, i really don't wanna do that, ned."
26734,Homer,"hello there, flan-didly-danders."
38697,Homer,and i want you to believe me too. isn't it great how much we agree?
36241,Homer,does the chair go back like this?
15361,Homer,daddy.
39824,Homer,oh no.
23591,Homer,but she said i...
28597,Homer,"there's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""dad i don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""
32786,Homer,"now practice preening to the crowd, el guapo."
14783,Homer,"yes, but doesn't the bible also say, ""thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
21808,Homer,ron howard?!
33577,Homer,go back to your day spas!
40556,Homer,whiplash! oh no!

24958,Homer,"okay, we'll move. we don't want any trouble, fellas."
38712,Homer,"uh, listen here, desert arnaz. homer simpson knows how to pitch a tent."
32213,Homer,"happy anniversary, sweetie."
13648,Homer,"excuse me? better? thanks a lot, marge, you really put me in my place."
25119,Homer,"well, i'm not sure, but it mighta happened when i was six."
34454,Homer,you don't think i'm going to?
35390,Homer,yeah. but what if i can't find any commercial rental property?
29671,Homer,"and it's something to be feared -- right, doctor?"
29857,Homer,lousy cat.
21358,Homer,"ew, dad. ""tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing abe simpson. cheerio."""
18097,Homer,"that's okay. i'm supposed to be workin', too."

16285,Homer,come on marge. it's fun to smash things. i smashed it good!
19134,Homer,yes...
21142,Homer,i'm gonna write the best darn article... oh wait.
18379,Homer,thank you for your pity.
22565,Homer,at least i've got a license.
22570,Homer,i'm not gonna hurt him. i'm just gonna wake him up.
25596,Homer,somebody light this monkey.
30511,Homer,"oh, i know! but how can i undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
28264,Homer,go mom! you can do it!
27368,Homer,but i'm full of questions. what's your favorite cigar size? is it robusto? is it?!
15261,Homer,never mind.
14666,Homer,i think that guy's a spy.
16086,Homer,"yeah, you've won this round, dean. but the war isn't over."
14591,Homer,yeah!
32353,Homer,marge is a professional assassin!
23846,Homer,"huh? springfield university homecoming! finally, a chance to relive my golden college years..."
16007,Homer,"oh. i wrote that one, after bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt."
28254,Homer,"haw haw, loser!"
40543,Homer,"well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. and besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. nothing serious."
28645,Homer,that's it! i'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!
26980,Homer,uh-huh!
18025,Homer,now it's two sets of twins.
22699,Homer,"bye, marge!"
23368,Homer,and i'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
38641,Homer,"relax, marge. it's probably just homer comin' home late from moe's."
22118,Homer,go nuts.
20709,Homer,"obviously, i don't. now if you'll get out of my way..."
29166,Homer,"there's a lot you don't know about me, marge. a lot that would shock you."
28958,Homer,"okay marge, i hear ya. now that krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems."
23097,Homer,it burns! it burns!
20098,Homer,"anyhow, i must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing i knew, i was running for my life."
36745,Homer,"come on weakling, get it from me."
36761,Homer,i don't wanna.
34969,Homer,"hey, you're that guy from the f.b.--"
17972,Homer,hm. barney's movie has heart. but football in the groin had a football in the groin.
28011,Homer,i'll take 'em.
15917,Homer,"but, i'll miss ""sheriff lobo."""
34273,Homer,"sweep! sweep! left, right! left, right! back-and-forth!"

15618,Homer,hit me.
41005,Homer,you do.
23239,Homer,"hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
21705,Homer,"it's hammer time, snitchy."
21363,Homer,hi.
14751,Homer,"look maggie, they have a baby, too."
21287,Homer,what? they had a picnic last week.
24843,Homer,five thousand dollars!
28475,Homer,i'm hungry. are they married yet?
20760,Homer,good morning everybody.
17098,Homer,"bye, moe!"
23324,Homer,really? like what?
18925,Homer,"oh my god. i got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of proposition 24, i never stopped to think it might affect someone i cared about."
17934,Homer,call off the debt?
29004,Homer,this must be what it's like to be in space.
35893,Homer,what gave me away?
40196,Homer,"uh, uh, just resting my eyes."
40957,Homer,twen... forty-eight. this is it.
25067,Homer,marvelous! marvelous! enough! i grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
39431,Homer,"there it is, kids... stately burns manor. heaven on earth."
30619,Homer,i get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
24723,Homer,i think we're in the clear.
26247,Homer,group stunt?
17194,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll walk in the mud!"
26775,Homer,that guy's hilarious. his reaction would be priceless.
13481,Homer,"oh, all right. you always do that hand thing! and it usually works."
25552,Homer,"i want to shoot a lion in the face, fight muhammad ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras."
40147,Homer,"marge! oh, marge!"
38029,Homer,"that's ""fake name."""
17023,Homer,"i mean, woo hoo!"
31013,Homer,"let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles..."
25413,Homer,"either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
33331,Homer,"if you'll show me to your bathroom, i'd like to pretend to wash my hands."
20429,Homer,"quit runnin', son. i just want to give ya a big hug!"
29842,Homer,"hey moe, hey moe-clone."
40761,Homer,"i'll take that, you stinkpot! just warming up, mrs. bloominstein."
33005,Homer,"so, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
13226,Homer,yes indeedy.
21827,Homer,i might have.
16341,Homer,"wow! for free, ""surplus drums of mayonnaise from operation desert storm."""
14180,Homer,"oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
15418,Homer,"boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah."
13806,Homer,"here you go, kids. lousy punks..."
18633,Homer,"hey, big spender! / dig this blender! / rainbow suspenders!..."
34168,Homer,i guess these days headhunters can be anything.
21919,Homer,i'm sensing some negative vibes here. but i promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
28375,Homer,"hmm, dare i pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
33416,Homer,my own plaque! and one for vice president butthead! cool.
13953,Homer,thanks. when is she gonna stop loving me?
27016,Homer,gotta find a way to change marge back. and replace the m&ms i took from the mini bar.
37612,Homer,i've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!
24952,Homer,i know that. how much to fix it?
40146,Homer,they are all against me! they all must die!
24676,Homer,"so, new springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? with our ample parking and daily who concerts."
26016,Homer,it's not about spite. it's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor moe. now help me nail up this urinal.
34955,Homer,"your honor, i would like to request a sidebar."
20190,Homer,"oh, my father gave me beer as a child. till i wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
16142,Homer,"okay, stupid!"
21113,Homer,"so if my cover gets blown and i need help, what's the signal?"
28084,Homer,why you little...
41297,Homer,"all right! ""try it"" means sex."
23038,Homer,"well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
16491,Homer,but they're so sweet.
29814,Homer,"what happened to the guards?! okay, okay. don't panic. maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
35500,Homer,"i'm still drunk from last night, / got driven home, i don't know by whom."
40982,Homer,oh.
37379,Homer,"it's an honor, sir."
37094,Homer,"too late! you already signed! oh wait, there's one more."
20583,Homer,i went yesterday.
33548,Homer,"great time to nap, einstein!"
16751,Homer,default? woo hoo! the two sweetest words in the english language. de-fault! de-fault! de-
38444,Homer,kaboom.
37448,Homer,are you nuts? you can't win if you don't play.
40880,Homer,"huh? hey, how'd you get in here?"
35391,Homer,"oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?"
41190,Homer,"shut up, boy."
19955,Homer,"good one, mom! / you're so bad, honey."
21275,Homer,"close, but you're way off."
27967,Homer,i always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
21323,Homer,how can you put that filth into your bodies?
19506,Homer,"don't worry, i have a plan. i saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. i think it was called ""the bus that couldn't slow down."" first, i hook this common vcr into the security camera system like so..."
25302,Homer,nooo!
13798,Homer,"hey krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
26403,Homer,you will too!
18224,Homer,mmm. sounds good.
38269,Homer,"am i gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
27730,Homer,but the book said you would applaud my initiative.
14191,Homer,"hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
38882,Homer,"'tis a far, far better thing i do than i have ever done before."
18149,Homer,what?
18775,Homer,"uh, smithers already left, sir. i'm his replacement, homer simpson."
13383,Homer,oh.
29569,Homer,how do i look?
27257,Homer,"wow. marge, i think i figured out their primitive language!"
34010,Homer,"ooo, mouth."
36608,Homer,"eh, nothing we can do."
28675,Homer,"all right, ""chapter one."" hm, that makes sense. ""there once was a girl from nantucket..."" good, good... ""her name was temperance barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. she..."""
26812,Homer,"good night, lisa."
24717,Homer,"oh, right. why don't we just break into fat tony's compound and get it back?"
15703,Homer,the man never drank a duff in his life.
22655,Homer,and a ooga-booga to you too.
18030,Homer,"how do you explain the culottes, boy?"
18831,Homer,what for?
33094,Homer,"marge bouvier, will you not marry me?"
29273,Homer,"woo-hoo! if marge becomes auntie ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities..."
27664,Homer,"see, it all works out?"
32459,Homer,all food tastes like barf now.
21595,Homer,let's see now... inventions... inventions...
32885,Homer,"mom, i can't believe you're here. you keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. you're just like that show ""scrubs""."
13994,Homer,"well, that's what i... wait a minute. what are you doing?"
22856,Homer,"this piece i call ""failed shelving unit with stupid stuck chainsaw and applesauce."""
31526,Homer,"yeah, but there's something else. there's this loser staying in our house. marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does."
39719,Homer,"sure, boy. what's on your mind?"
17221,Homer,"trust me, marge. with today's modern cars you can't get lost. what with all the silicon chips and such."
13282,Homer,i dunno.
20374,Homer,"i put it in a safe place, marge. i mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
31522,Homer,"oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors."
19835,Homer,"wow, even moe's moved to fancy new digs."
26526,Homer,"oh, here's the story of joan of arc..."
40759,Homer,my name's homer simpson. i'd like to sign up for something.
26912,Homer,"look at him over there, eating that apple. what's he planning? what?!"
35997,Homer,then why did you say it?
15208,Homer,bo-ring.
39925,Homer,perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
14240,Homer,... little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
14434,Homer,yes it's me!
23822,Homer,what's wrong with us?!
32183,Homer,of course.
22853,Homer,"marge, i've screwed up everything i've ever done. i mean, look at bart. but i finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. and that feels pretty good."
28417,Homer,is this thing hurting you?
23995,Homer,"pearls, eh?"
33500,Homer,"flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on christmas, would you?"
23898,Homer,"bart, i need a miracle!"
28072,Homer,i see. do you have any suggestions?
19793,Homer,no... this whole thing is my fault. i've been a lousy dad.
40328,Homer,"well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years."
16206,Homer,"uh, huh."
15478,Homer,really? what's it like?
15425,Homer,you know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? i've got that right now. ooh... bacon!
18448,Homer,that's m'name.
40143,Homer,it's got great high ceilings.
21171,Homer,"honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
17370,Homer,"ma-arge. they can't carry enough candy. they have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
35473,Homer,"yeah, isn't this place great? if you're single you can come here every night."
13467,Homer,marge! lisa! maggie! let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
35274,Homer,"well of course, i would love to be a more sensitive father. you know that."
32169,Homer,"you'll never catch me, lord!"
37179,Homer,we'll get those kids back.
30129,Homer,"no, i'm in a good place with that."
14267,Homer,because i knocked you up?
36940,Homer,my dog.
27643,Homer,"hello? yes, i'm ned flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. oh yes, i she does look pregnant. now, who might you be? a tabloid? is that one of those really strong mints? hello? hello?"
40265,Homer,"what's wrong with you people? let's show some spirit! come on, get up!"
24722,Homer,"well, that didn't work."
24095,Homer,"oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. chicks really dig sensitivity. did you get that, bart?"
33684,Homer,"i have not! oh right, you think i do."
14034,Homer,leave me alone.
27877,Homer,did you ever get the parody songs i sent you?
26318,Homer,"well, as much as humanly possible."
21368,Homer,"'mornin', barney."
31107,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
30941,Homer,"oh, i hate this sub-continent."
18360,Homer,of course.
34705,Homer,"oooh, the nobies!"
26598,Homer,"fine. take me, but let the boy go."
22924,Homer,ow! ohhh...
14895,Homer,"ah, kids' letters from camp."
14562,Homer,"well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
13413,Homer,"wow, i did it! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. i fought it for six hours. she says one word and i toss it back. and you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? come here, baby."
40657,Homer,no. let me hear you play.
35138,Homer,"wealthy? hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. eh?"
15567,Homer,please.
13378,Homer,"whoa, who says that?"
37647,Homer,"let me worry about how. but you know, you could make his last day a happy one. and the ring is just the icing on the cake."
40552,Homer,"you sure have got some education, mr. hutz."
13632,Homer,"yeah, right."
20653,Homer,"thanks, ted."
15797,Homer,happy new year!
26484,Homer,lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
23236,Homer,even mine?
19079,Homer,that's one of the creatures!
40848,Homer,bart!
21309,Homer,"hmm... a bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. wow."
23946,Homer,"they're rebroadcasting major league baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! or so the legend goes."
20161,Homer,and why are the kids here?
26929,Homer,how 'bout lenny?
26097,Homer,"i was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of chad sexington. do you mind?"
29626,Homer,"now patty, here's a veil i picked out just for you."
24038,Homer,but what if i have to do my business?
37807,Homer,but n-n-n-nurture...
26940,Homer,green vegetables and homework.
37518,Homer,"just call me borders books, 'cause i'll always be here."
26578,Homer,...i will eat this toblerone / and i will not pay!
37678,Homer,and you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. so i'm gettin' you shined up nice.
34622,Homer,it's from moe!
18302,Homer,take out the garbage.
22438,Homer,"yeah, isn't it? i got it off a hair dryer."
35178,Homer,"oh, because lisa won't tell me what flower it's from."
37188,Homer,"it's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
17561,Homer,that's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
27475,Homer,and i miss being your knight in flabby armor.
39102,Homer,i was distinctly promised no math!
13223,Homer,"coming, chief."
17351,Homer,"okay. all right, pie, i'm just gonna do this."
16563,Homer,"you know lisa, music helps daddy think."
16762,Homer,and that is that.
29164,Homer,per... our... agreement!
36006,Homer,"come on, lisa!"
27267,Homer,"so, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
21211,Homer,attaboy!
13299,Homer,and?
32263,Homer,but it's just you and me... that must mean i'm your boss. i'm sick of you! you're fired!
19207,Homer,are you an angel?
31060,Homer,"here's me fighting with former president bush, me fighting with current president bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss."
37654,Homer,one of us! gooble goo!
17343,Homer,"we're laughing with her, marge! there's a big difference."
34886,Homer,stupid dog! let go of that delicious bird!
15267,Homer,"but marge, i think he should learn about it the same way i did."
30457,Homer,i'll give you five dollars for it.
33430,Homer,what a week.
36978,Homer,maybe.
34139,Homer,stupid grampa. i try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
19483,Homer,the lighthouse keeper!
24967,Homer,who gave you all this money?
15398,Homer,"not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow i managed to fit in eight hours of tv a day."
15936,Homer,i figure it's some guy's name. some guy named gabbo.
34993,Homer,don't ask questions! just go!
22639,Homer,"oooh, here's something you'd like. ""when animals attack magicians."""
33691,Homer,"i'll save you, maggie!"
21517,Homer,"okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off."
29588,Homer,"...bart was never kidnapped! lisa, i'm very glad you brought me this. i'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
30072,Homer,...minus the number of filipinos in the bible...and you get...
34217,Homer,why you little...
24307,Homer,"if i didn't, i'd lose their respect."
24324,Homer,me too.
15514,Homer,"like a giant billboard that says, ""no fat chicks""?"
22930,Homer,"of course not! ""nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""
34862,Homer,"now boy, everyone in town gets burns for half an hour to do as they will."
30442,Homer,"honey, animals don't feel death. that was proved by the scientists at black angus."
33159,Homer,saving our marriage!
27758,Homer,"unlike mr. burns, i will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. and now, as i ascend this crystal staircase to my office, i say: avert your gaze!"
20998,Homer,"yep, i earned it."
18518,Homer,"eighteen seconds, hmph. if this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. say, you're all shivering. are you cold or what?"
33755,Homer,no time. i'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
30711,Homer,"aw, dad."
19148,Homer,well...
15809,Homer,"i love you too, son. you know, boy, i don't think i've ever felt as close to you as i do right --"
24429,Homer,you'd better.
34025,Homer,woo-hoo! our boss is our best buddy!
28918,Homer,let's go.
23537,Homer,"oh, i'm twenty-six hours late for work. no time for maggie."
39015,Homer,"great. and if anyone asks where i am, just cover for me."
19957,Homer,uh-huh.

33117,Homer,sushi fight!!
17842,Homer,"hey, are you like one of those english guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
17260,Homer,john denver.
22175,Homer,"all right, bart!"
24568,Homer,don't worry. no child will ever starve in my home.
38233,Homer,you don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
24185,Homer,oopsie.
28621,Homer,i wish i had bullies like you growing up.
24230,Homer,you're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
19822,Homer,the important thing is i didn't imagine it.
23588,Homer,"hey, everybody! i'm gonna be on tv again."
29648,Homer,is there a chance for advancement?
21576,Homer,"ooh, look at all the inventions edison came up with. the stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. and look at him dance."
32978,Homer,"hey, ned."
18837,Homer,"oh, i love legitimate theater."
21915,Homer,hear ye! hear ye! the intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
28345,Homer,"oh marge, i am so sorry. i should've listened to whatever it was you were saying."
17179,Homer,"i tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in capital city together..."
28154,Homer,off you go.
20703,Homer,it's carnival time!
34275,Homer,she used to be my therapist.
29130,Homer,"oh, cold shoulder, huh? well, i'll just talk to myself. hey, how ya doin', homer? oh, not too bad, how about you? oh i'm fine. your wife was great in bed last night. you keep your hands off my wife! oh yeah? well i give her what she needs. and she likes..."
29818,Homer,"marge, c'mon!"
30218,Homer,"...i coveted the wife in ""jaws 2,"" i lied to a waiter, i masturbated eight million times and i have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
38506,Homer,i hate the golden age of sail.
38503,Homer,you're my son and you will hate what i hate. angled parking. lemons. kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. and this boat!
32681,Homer,"hm, it seems like a lot..."
21999,Homer,do we have to listen to you?
15375,Homer,once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad.
17958,Homer,"it's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
27970,Homer,"quit following me, you coward!"
27464,Homer,i'd rather talk about our feelings. i feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. rebuttal?
21645,Homer,taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon.
14342,Homer,"lisa, please, i can't hear the announcer."
23098,Homer,it burns! it burns!
22520,Homer,only till eleven.
35069,Homer,"well in that case, lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so i opened the drapes to let in more sun."
35682,Homer,too sad to walk! too sad and fun to walk...
35187,Homer,"now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town."
16297,Homer,marge! marge!
41121,Homer,casino?
16879,Homer,"heh, heh, it does look like al gore."
14907,Homer,"kids, back me up."
38587,Homer,ow! ooh! what the? mmm! i smell toast!
35358,Homer,hey!
38004,Homer,"um, mr. burns, sir? can i get another pair of glasses? maybe two pair. one for the beach house. can i also get a beach house? two beach houses..."
32715,Homer,"well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
27451,Homer,"dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
35272,Homer,now i have to work overtime--
32542,Homer,marge had a black eye?! i could never do something like that! could i?
19074,Homer,"i guess you mean president clinton. he usually hangs around washington, d.c."
35243,Homer,"hold on, lemme get the door here."
20120,Homer,"aw, shoot. all right, all right. give me one bowl."
20246,Homer,good.
41439,Homer,bart! can the chatter and fetch me a baloney sandwich!
16787,Homer,y- no.
38856,Homer,this is so fake.
29883,Homer,high-five!
38909,Homer,"we sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?"
36479,Homer,"i've always said ""hungry""!"
24679,Homer,why me?
25831,Homer,ew! nasty!
17386,Homer,"so, a graduate student, huh? how come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
33576,Homer,i'm on it.
32635,Homer,"oh my god, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!"
17939,Homer,but what can i do? i'm just... one man.
23511,Homer,one hundred and... may i speak to my family for a moment?
25568,Homer,you have failed.
22660,Homer,me too.
17259,Homer,"well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
18609,Homer,"goodbye, trophy."
18269,Homer,that's it! go to your room!
25185,Homer,and his fondness for the guitar.
18351,Homer,"carpal tunnel syndrome? no. lumber lung? no. juggler's despair? no. achy-breaky pelvis? no. oh, i'm never gonna be disabled. i'm sick of being so healthy!"
30119,Homer,"wait! before you go, there's one thing i gotta know. what happened to my family?"
33339,Homer,i doubt it -- friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
34592,Homer,mmm.
26826,Homer,"certainly, lenford. make every day a celebration of your love. surprise her with a pasta salad! put a mini-beret on your wang!"
16963,Homer,"right back atcha, son. aw."
31278,Homer,avenge me!
16394,Homer,now i have to face stupid reality again!... flanders! my socks feel dirty! gimme some water to wash 'em!
19129,Homer,all right... what's the number?
24403,Homer,the gi-ant...
38787,Homer,nothing's gonna stop me now.
29146,Homer,"now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. but you can't spell u.s.a. without us... eh?"
26884,Homer,now you do it for me.
32485,Homer,no...
25291,Homer,"too busy to reply, huh? i know how that goes. well, i think i'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament."
24600,Homer,go away. we've got bigger problems now.
27757,Homer,... iffic management!
16464,Homer,"no, lisa, i swear to you. i'm one-hundred percent completely serious. you've got to turn around right now before it's too late."
29727,Homer,"sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. but i'm not gonna die for many, many years."
26786,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
24548,Homer,fine.
25062,Homer,call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is / mr. plow.
16196,Homer,all right. stay calm. remember your training.
24106,Homer,"it's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. if they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker."
29681,Homer,hey dragon! you fly like a girl!
39947,Homer,"krusty, i'm man enough to admit i was wrong, and i'm sorry i fingered you in court. i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated."
41004,Homer,america.
22594,Homer,okay.
39884,Homer,"did you see that? you know, marge, this is the way i've always wanted it to be. we've become a fully functioning family unit. we've always blamed ourselves, but i guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
27822,Homer,"puzzle piece, come out and play-ay."
40603,Homer,no.
36571,Homer,"eh-eh, school night."
16244,Homer,"phht, that's just an old wives tale."
27872,Homer,how much do you tip a leg waxer? i need to know by tomorrow!
40137,Homer,catch.
28045,Homer,now it actually is a fanny pack.
23643,Homer,yes it is. it's very good and you're a good little baby. yes you are.
27378,Homer,it's one word.
33747,Homer,"hi, homer simpson. mind if i sit near your son? mine sucks."
25613,Homer,comin' in from the left.
22730,Homer,"the second i let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in."
40586,Homer,"alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. start with the feet, still angry? good, good homer, good. this is tough, need refreshment. ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her."
39590,Homer,"kid, tonight's not your night."
41056,Homer,"so what does my little girl want? what? let me write this down. copies of ""teen dream... teen scream... and teen steam magazine."" well, okay. you're the sickie. goodbye, lisa."
31949,Homer,we don't get what?
23451,Homer,"hello, kitty."
25120,Homer,"hey, i came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
15328,Homer,forget it pal. i don't need your phoney baloney job. i'll take your money but i'm not gonna plow your driveway.
30602,Homer,you're sending me to italy?
25055,Homer,"one snow angel, comin' up."
22152,Homer,"ohh, i'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent."
32019,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. time for the family portrait. let's bunch together now. here we go."
23602,Homer,"well, world, this is it. you know, i always thought you'd die before me. but now as i prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking..."
27873,Homer,"the kids are cool, but marge is still judging me."
25997,Homer,"freshen your drink, pal?"
13317,Homer,"hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
18146,Homer,"kids, would you step outside for a second?"
27840,Homer,"more like, where didn't i find it. it was practically everywhere."
19718,Homer,never!
16650,Homer,that dog can sell anything.
13357,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. can't we just forget it and go to church."
29558,Homer,"oh mighty god, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
36554,Homer,sorry.
27752,Homer,mr. burns?
30051,Homer,i'll always be there. not even death will stop me.
31184,Homer,"everything. and i learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""shark tale""."
25140,Homer,"comfy, isn't it?"
34258,Homer,"i'm sorry i missed dinner, honey. we still have time to catch a movie. that can be romantic."
16893,Homer,well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
31984,Homer,how come things that happen to stupid people keep happening to me?
38107,Homer,"i can handle them from now on, marge."
31798,Homer,thank you!
41325,Homer,friend...
14237,Homer,pfft. now you tell me.
30334,Homer,"lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
31968,Homer,"moe, i can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
32047,Homer,"what the hell is a ""fundae""?"
14711,Homer,my personal hygiene has been described as...
27892,Homer,"you know, moe, i was just thinking. my problems with marge started because i drink too much. and then tonight alcohol only made things worse. maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
34657,Homer,cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
34016,Homer,"oh, there's so many men around the world, of every shape and size / i want to nibble on jamaican jerks and teriyaki thighs..."
13524,Homer,amen to that!
32842,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
28984,Homer,it is.
36541,Homer,do we screw them on the credit?
40909,Homer,ooh! barbecue!
37844,Homer,well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. but only for a week. got a lot of ice cream comin' in.
19249,Homer,"hold on, mr. burns. maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? all your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
28547,Homer,now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on christmas to discover they have no presents.
36729,Homer,i never thought homer simpson would be a part of the day of the locust.
14386,Homer,"hello, i'm homer. i'll be your customer."
18261,Homer,here ya go!
19221,Homer,he made fun of my weight.
13382,Homer,uh say... uh... reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
41507,Homer,darn tootin'
24790,Homer,do i get paid now?
20898,Homer,so her career got in the way.
27452,Homer,marge?
17720,Homer,yeah.
27361,Homer,still? then you're not gonna like your other present.
39944,Homer,"yes, i do."
25526,Homer,"well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home."
25384,Homer,i am a washing machine. do what i say.
34829,Homer,"oh i'm sorry, maggie, but even at your age, i'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... i can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
15402,Homer,"i know you like clowns, so i made you this bed. now you can laugh yourself to sleep."
27637,Homer,flanders?! can't a man just drink alone on a wednesday morning?
13938,Homer,ohh... i need money.
18164,Homer,i've got no time for your demented parlor games! you won't be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you.
13807,Homer,get a good haul this year?
21942,Homer,don't make me come up there!
38410,Homer,"well, you know--"
29964,Homer,"doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. they're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
26162,Homer,wha?! that's it. no more chat rooms for you.
33832,Homer,thank you.
14179,Homer,"well, what color is it? blue or purple?"
13739,Homer,"hee hee, hee-hee-hee! read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
34169,Homer,"you nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'."
33446,Homer,oh yeah.
36447,Homer,"oh lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?"
34849,Homer,thank you.
19564,Homer,marge! how could you?
26565,Homer,"the simpsons are going to antarctica. next year. this year, brazil."
13965,Homer,in the garage.
35671,Homer,"oh no, i don't eat anything new unless i've eaten it before!"
34400,Homer,"boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
34711,Homer,they fight and bite? i never go to europe without learning something.
38319,Homer,"marge is right. i'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now."
24080,Homer,"well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape..."
24336,Homer,"barney, no! don't!"
20356,Homer,"hi. it seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. so if you'll have me, i would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
32644,Homer,i dig the wig! i dig the wig!
19527,Homer,you don't have to humiliate me.
14481,Homer,uh... she's small... she's a girl...
35114,Homer,"so basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. like west virginia does for virginia."
38575,Homer,the power of chrysler compels you!
27087,Homer,"no, i think it's seltzer."
23234,Homer,"well, sure, if it's true."
32939,Homer,god bless america!
17398,Homer,"thanks, kids."
33956,Homer,no... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
38265,Homer,"once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
41364,Homer,no i haven't!
30964,Homer,"silence! now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant."
25105,Homer,"okay people, let's keep this short. we all want to get home to our families."
22235,Homer,"ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. so breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. but first, i'm afraid we have some bad news. the waffle bar is closed. i'm sorry. i'm so very--"
29742,Homer,"marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
27859,Homer,"nice to meet you, stuart."
34602,Homer,"a phony bird call?! that means marge is coming! everyone, act legal!"
23253,Homer,who cares? that man can really slug.
22642,Homer,yes it is.
23527,Homer,"so, mindy? how did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
24522,Homer,"hey, hey, stop it!"
19734,Homer,"man, you should come over to our place. it's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
27503,Homer,"you know, i used to think god only helped professional athletes and grammy winners. but now i realize he helps shmoes like me, too, carl."
22489,Homer,"uh-uh, no way. i don't want to miss a word."
23269,Homer,"thanks for the chance. you won't never regret this, mr. editing guy!"
33343,Homer,what about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
24590,Homer,television broken?
13554,Homer,what was that last one?
22414,Homer,"uh, so, i just want to know how come you made your homer simpson character so..."
26339,Homer,looks like i need some fuel for me mule. gas for me ass.
40314,Homer,what a family.
28727,Homer,nope.
15531,Homer,"""what if?"" what if i'm taking a shower and i slip on a bar of soap? oh, my god, i'd be killed!"
28015,Homer,"chaka khan, let me rock you / let me rock you, chaka khan / chaka khan chaka khan..."
24986,Homer,suckers.
34800,Homer,"i know, i know. don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows frankenstein. it's racist somehow."
29609,Homer,"okay, what's next? adam and steve or madam and eve?"
22053,Homer,"the name on the back says ""honeybunch."""
33380,Homer,dondelinger!
39190,Homer,are you gonna put my head in a vise?
38974,Homer,"well, that's everything i know that girls like."
27015,Homer,"oh my god! she's become a monster! which i have to admit, i sort of suspected during the sex."
25870,Homer,i used to be.
26923,Homer,"hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. and i felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
41508,Homer,... big fig newton!
27781,Homer,i don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. i don't even want it.
23249,Homer,"my god, is she brave. standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
38995,Homer,"marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. fighting him is like kicking george washington in his wooden nuts!"
26848,Homer,but what about the axe?
13422,Homer,no.
31694,Homer,i'll tell you why.
24141,Homer,"oh, save me jebus!"
35803,Homer,"tell her i'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
14900,Homer,nothin' could be finah.
41194,Homer,"oooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
17375,Homer,i don't know.
33892,Homer,eating makes me thirs-ty
32055,Homer,"i've never been to war, but i imagine it feels just like your first kill. the happiness swept me away!"
40976,Homer,"because... ... i'm your baby brother, homer!"
24511,Homer,"right about here, i realize something's wrong."
37127,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!
13944,Homer,"heh heh, the perfect crime."
14853,Homer,"wait, marge. didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
26041,Homer,son of a...
23131,Homer,stupid...
35611,Homer,that sucker soaks up flattery like a twinkie soaks up gravy.
36356,Homer,bart's been raptured! and his crap's been craptured!
17608,Homer,"heh heh heh! so long, suckers!"
14740,Homer,"forget it, pal. they don't call me colonel homer because i'm some dumb-ass army guy."
31496,Homer,he killed greystash!
36753,Homer,can this day get any worse?
25805,Homer,"oh, it shows. i was gonna say something, but i thought it might sound you know, weird."
28843,Homer,"ow, my ankles snapped."
27708,Homer,wipe me down and sign me up!
36512,Homer,"observe. hey, it's me again. he's there, isn't he? well, i hope this doesn't sound weird, but i'm inside your closet."
28206,Homer,"all right. ""drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? yum, yum. i think i'd like some whipped cream on my wyoming!"
20342,Homer,potentially dangerous?
28336,Homer,the queen of whaaa?!
27941,Homer,"we did it! finally, man has triumphed over a small, furry animal!"
17746,Homer,absolutely.
19234,Homer,of course not. we'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
17715,Homer,oh just that one time.
40161,Homer,"what are you lookin' at, buddy?"
37263,Homer,"i'm not punching you, flanders."
17896,Homer,request permission to slink by.
35437,Homer,"oh, what the hell? life is made to be lived. i've been buttoned down too long!"
16025,Homer,everything is a source of fun...
33100,Homer,"hey, everybody pees in the pool!"
17067,Homer,"now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
13840,Homer,"oh, ah, thanks boy."
19109,Homer,wowww.
15073,Homer,really?
24555,Homer,woo hoo!
23150,Homer,"yeah, but..."
18945,Homer,"yeah, native americans like us."
37204,Homer,tights? robes? this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
13970,Homer,"patty, selma, what a pleasant surprise."
22927,Homer,"now if i drop her, no more tears."
20319,Homer,five hundred dollars! forget it.
40712,Homer,"""oooo, as read by larry king."""
29958,Homer,"marge, no machine could ever replace you. why you-- or could it?"
29711,Homer,ling?... ling?... ling?...
36649,Homer,that settles it. no banks for me.
34167,Homer,they took away our donuts at work! all i've had are my meals!
16313,Homer,"hi, son. hi, son. hi, son."
13702,Homer,"i changed my mind. it was a passing fancy. although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
21784,Homer,billy baldwin!
28753,Homer,"hey, apu, what's with the line?"
16289,Homer,it's just no fun without marge.
13513,Homer,me and my big... letter writing pen!
15307,Homer,stop!
26680,Homer,and now a man you will see is definitely not dead... mr. montgomery burns!
30463,Homer,woo hoo! pizza for breakfast!
14128,Homer,"have a duff, boys!"
22219,Homer,"slave girl? oh, slave girl?"
26364,Homer,that's enough running.
21844,Homer,see? it's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. the only one who understands me is that guy who married martha raye.
22547,Homer,canyonero...
40745,Homer,"i'd reached step one: she knew i existed. the only problem was, she didn't care."
25557,Homer,"on the plane, i'm gonna need two seats... for the twins."
17782,Homer,marge.
13583,Homer,"now listen. i'm bringing michael jackson home to stay with us for a few days... isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
38809,Homer,"aw, thanks for your honesty, apu. is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
31159,Homer,okay.
41267,Homer,"there it is, homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. and nobody heard it."
26036,Homer,what the hell is that?
39513,Homer,"surely, lisa. you see how it works, bart? a cupcake here, a good grade there."
13205,Homer,thank you.
30384,Homer,"mr. stomach, are you hungry? i'm always hungry. now make with the pizza, fatso. you're the stomach!"
19466,Homer,"hey, wait a minute. there's no such thing as a talking dog."
33818,Homer,"we can't afford to move to waverly hills! their house prices have commas in them. as it is, our lawn is just green-painted cement."
41314,Homer,"remember the family jewels, son."
29428,Homer,"why the sweet talk, apu? are you after some cheap drugs?"
31741,Homer,i've got a good feeling about this.
26166,Homer,bag's in the kitchen.
33830,Homer,"heads. i mean, tails. i mean, on its side."
36997,Homer,the one thing i couldn't prepare for.
28998,Homer,"i knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from bart and lisa. kids don't beat me, i beat kids."
18687,Homer,but sipowicz does it.
23344,Homer,he's definitely dead!
26954,Homer,i need you guys to help me. why'd you lock yourselves in?
32810,Homer,"oh, i see. it's reverse psychology. well in that case i'm not going and i'm not staying. and i'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling."
21658,Homer,let's just say i'm sitting in the right chair.
32618,Homer,"well, if i'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap i love."
17188,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
30606,Homer,what's in you?
34573,Homer,why couldn't i be eaten by a giraffe? that would be fun!
38658,Homer,my ears are burning.
19431,Homer,"well, chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
38769,Homer,"oh, so you're sticking up for yoko here? looks like i've got another yoko on my hands."
26571,Homer,"forget every word, boy. it's useless."
34968,Homer,just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
29695,Homer,i'm a nuclear--
24234,Homer,"you don't love me. the only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion."
14202,Homer,someday i'll buy you a real castle.
16981,Homer,what does sequestered mean?
24920,Homer,sorry.
26398,Homer,wee! wee! wee! wee!
25897,Homer,"yeah, they're italian."
29693,Homer,"oh, look at him sleeping. he's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. yes you are... yes you are!"
22370,Homer,"hey, howyadoin'?"
17447,Homer,"oooh. ""mr. and mrs. erotic american."""
20488,Homer,oh... oh... ooo... oh... yodel.
32813,Homer,"marge, my fringes are knotted again."
19755,Homer,"marge, the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt!"
31733,Homer,"oh, why did i borrow that roof from him?"
30765,Homer,stupid horse! it's a deer crossing!
29559,Homer,"after forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and noah sent forth a single dove..."
21713,Homer,"daddy would like a word with you, barty!"
37963,Homer,"no, discipline would imply i'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
18166,Homer,say it burns. say i never shot you... before.
19357,Homer,i won't.
20552,Homer,i'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
23190,Homer,we shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
33442,Homer,"marge, i won't bore you with the truth. all i can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house."
31936,Homer,"what are you, a travel agent? 'cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
24159,Homer,you don't have tv? but what will i watch while i'm sitting on the couch?
28888,Homer,"marge, i did it out of love. love of not being arrested. but i realize now that nothing is more important than you."
27254,Homer,"oh, yes! the tag chafed my throat! let's go eat some bugs."
16461,Homer,"um, because i have a small role in a broadway musical. it's not much, but it's a start."
40162,Homer,"oooh, thanks."
20956,Homer,"well, why would i want to look at a pen with a... oh no, her clothes are coming off! heh, heh. hey, you know who would love this? men."
28867,Homer,"nice work, cruise control."
33378,Homer,"marge, i still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter."
25023,Homer,"absolutely. we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
30350,Homer,"boy, lisa's room really is scary."
25090,Homer,"hello, marge. hi, homie. sign this, please? you're the boss! daddy, ask the man for some candy! no, no, no candy for you. then at least get some candy for yourself."
31430,Homer,you're glad? you don't look glad. are you sure you know what glad means?
35849,Homer,"ooo, a b-mail!"
22167,Homer,"i wouldn't do that, reverend. you see, ""saint flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"
36654,Homer,on a poker site!
19572,Homer,oh yeah.
22893,Homer,i've got a surprise for youuu!
22794,Homer,"marge, i'm out of beer."
25493,Homer,"now don't feel bad, honey. did you know back in grade school, i had a bully problem myself?"
35214,Homer,how 'bout don johnson?
34107,Homer,"more vicodin and eggs, please."
28320,Homer,"i understand the word ""gave."" unless it means something else in this country."
23810,Homer,"lisa, help!"
16652,Homer,woo hoo! cheap meat!
26620,Homer,does it go in the butt?
22512,Homer,this valentine's crap has gone too far.
38570,Homer,nice.
36565,Homer,"i swear, i am not filming."
37883,Homer,"if you all go, then i have to pay for a babysitter!"
32355,Homer,"great, great -- i turned over so many wheelbarrows... wait, that was your thing."
19541,Homer,"no, i refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks i'm crazy. unless you're feeling... amorous?"
41045,Homer,"marge, the dog is hungry!"
27491,Homer,"flanders, what's your secret? you never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""mr. blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. it sickens me."
17639,Homer,"from now on, i want you to be honest with me. i mean, i'm not perfect, right?"
36312,Homer,but i can't afford this...
38971,Homer,lisa...
16897,Homer,"i don't have time to read. just give me the gist of it, son."
15076,Homer,oh yeah? with what?
34710,Homer,can my son come too? he knows what to do when i swallow my tongue.

34444,Homer,"i say burns owes us a party. let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
27393,Homer,a forty dollar steak?!

29719,Homer,"let's see now... ""kill spiders?"" we don't have spiders."
25199,Homer,"ow! owww, my back. dr. steve didn't do anything."
17101,Homer,i give up. i don't deserve to live with you.
28620,Homer,"and if anything happens to me, i want you bullies to take care of my boy."
29440,Homer,"we really appreciate your help, johnny. is there any way we can repay ya?"
29149,Homer,"we mean it, don't move."
33703,Homer,don't shake your fist at me!
32415,Homer,"your thoughts should stay in your head! heh, heh, i sure told him. now, what am i gonna do about marge?"
33270,Homer,"homer, why are you really here?"
30233,Homer,"hop in, boy! we'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt."
13640,Homer,"yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
16417,Homer,and we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
16483,Homer,huh?

30195,Homer,"and if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the army. where you'll be sent straight to america's latest military quagmire. where will it be? north korea? iran? anything's possible with commander cuckoo bananas in charge."
36187,Homer,bum-ba-bum-ba / bum-ba-bum-ba...
19773,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. but i know something that will..."

36552,Homer,why you little...
19563,Homer,"take a look at this, lisa. you don't see any ""homer is a dope"" t-shirts, do you?"
19559,Homer,"uh, i'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. any questions at all. doctor hibbert?"
36092,Homer,it's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.
15099,Homer,"yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
36680,Homer,thank you mr. papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.

37509,Homer,"okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
27217,Homer,i go by how funny the sign is.
36072,Homer,there's no sex like fugitive sex.
39121,Homer,"yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?"
35159,Homer,"if i find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble."
39750,Homer,bart!
24251,Homer,all right! geez...
35635,Homer,can one of the hundred be making the list?
28356,Homer,only my hairdresser knows for sure.

29435,Homer,"dad, you tried your best. for the first time in my life i can say, without being drunk, that i truly admire you."
33787,Homer,"but first, as part of ""operation popularity,"" lisa and i are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
27833,Homer,"why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment."
37567,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
22614,Homer,i didn't mean to! look!
17664,Homer,"the information super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""star trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
16546,Homer,"well, you have a gambling problem!"
19156,Homer,"well, my family wants to move back to springfield."
37695,Homer,i was gonna be king of cheeseburger mountain. did i change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? probably a little bit of both.
25918,Homer,"but, constance, it only happened because..."
36412,Homer,"yeah, dr. cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
22036,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll do it. but if i die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
23993,Homer,"marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. but don't worry, i have a way for duncan to earn his keep."
33324,Homer,"toldja, marge. tol. dja."

17162,Homer,"there you are. thought you could get away, huh?"
31545,Homer,"oh marge, i'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate."
23576,Homer,"hey, this was supposed to be about me. now, any other questions? pumpkin face? headgear? chicken pox? smelly? lazy eye? spikey head? okay, class dismissed. rock on!"
15966,Homer,"well, one of us made some money. i sold a guy our spare tire."
21616,Homer,ow!
40476,Homer,"you didn't mean that. bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises i don't expect you to keep. if you make this promise, you have to keep it."
26747,Homer,"i need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till i tap the keg."
17308,Homer,"hmm. fabulous house. well-behaved kids. sisters-in-law dead. luxury sedan. woo hoo! i hit the jackpot. marge, dear. would you kindly pass me a donut?"

40926,Homer,"one seafood burrito, apu."
13296,Homer,never thrown a party? what about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
35094,Homer,step away from the traitor!
15014,Homer,"no offense apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
29335,Homer,ladies! there's no need to fight over me.
37522,Homer,why are you taking away the train?
34231,Homer,"i said someone like me, i didn't say me."
30509,Homer,does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
31189,Homer,"okay. take it, take it! just don't hurt me!"
28216,Homer,"marge, i don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
39852,Homer,hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... da da da da da.

19478,Homer,"hey, barney! soul mate! let me buy you a beer."
20772,Homer,"all right, better put on a pot of coffee, marge. this could take a while."

33286,Homer,did we really need a bridge there?
27430,Homer,"no, i'm good."

20337,Homer,"come on, come on, open up!"
14729,Homer,"hey! oh, you meant that as a compliment. now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. maybe we should give them something new."
34285,Homer,"i'll do it myself. when we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
19300,Homer,"oh, i hate having parties. the toilet always gets backed up."
17281,Homer,"come, family, sit in the snow with daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."

33825,Homer,"yeah, um, well, i'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. where's the bedroom?"
31876,Homer,how many?!
34684,Homer,it doesn't matter.
33145,Homer,that takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
39762,Homer,"lisa, i'm not scared. i think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. does the time always drag like this?"
35647,Homer,"i won't say, but his initials are s.f."
20202,Homer,nah.
30743,Homer,why you little...
39795,Homer,bart! what are you doing?
32425,Homer,mmm... porkpie.
30185,Homer,"no, i wanna make you a respecting stock. i don't know if you've noticed, but i've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years..."
23804,Homer,"come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""scrub toilet?"" okay, that was a practice. practice... practice... okay, here we go. ""feed fish."""
24911,Homer,"hello, operator? i'd like to report a really weird island. please send lots of rescue copters to..."

32354,Homer,"hey, what's that?"
36582,Homer,"ooh, i like that. now, i'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
37995,Homer,only five pancakes? you're trying to kill me!
25951,Homer,no. of course not.
40991,Homer,"yeah, though the boy was a close call."
17531,Homer,permit me to solve the mystery. your mother has a fear of flying.
41429,Homer,not so fast! say hello to the united federation of homers through history!
34647,Homer,"today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
37126,Homer,how can something that applies to bart apply to me? i'm so much older and wiser.
32812,Homer,"yeah, me too. since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
32346,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna be home late tonight. i'm going to... midnight monkey madness at the zoo."
30823,Homer,"hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!"
26184,Homer,"no, you are an angel like denzel washington in ""the preacher's wife,"" or will smith in ""bagger vance,"" or slimer in ""ghostbusters."""
14418,Homer,not duff dry... dallas.
15625,Homer,uh... revenge.
28328,Homer,"but please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me."
37530,Homer,uh... anniversary? that comin' up?
22203,Homer,hey! lance murdock!
22809,Homer,"okay, no big deal..."
35623,Homer,"marge, i just saw the greatest movie. guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! i'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
14444,Homer,all right then.

35327,Homer,"lisa, don't feel bad. judas betrayed jesus but he still got paid."
25198,Homer,"one, two, better-not-sue..."
33019,Homer,"marge, what's going on?"
20408,Homer,"well, i'm tellin' ya, flanders can't coach at all! now i'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
21610,Homer,"look, i just want to know how to invent things. tell me."
22458,Homer,"woo, privilege!"
21215,Homer,"and to think you wanted me to crawl, marge! well, this man doesn't crawl. he stands tall. that rhymes, marge, and you know it rhymes. admit it!"
16618,Homer,shut up.
25069,Homer,"i know, ranch dressing."
15726,Homer,you name it.
26039,Homer,got that cat right in the leg.
41536,Homer,really? i thought it was written by losers.
31063,Homer,but what if we...
19865,Homer,"you see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
25553,Homer,your box made promises of a vacational nature. and i expect you to live up to them.
21527,Homer,"my god, you're greasy."
19333,Homer,'cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
25141,Homer,"wait, you can't hate me. i'm your better! your better!"
27397,Homer,of course i do. it's all my fault for refusing to pay...
34755,Homer,"they sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
23008,Homer,"gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here."
33373,Homer,woo-hoo!
20948,Homer,you!
39665,Homer,"okay, okay. this time i'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him."
37692,Homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."
38543,Homer,make love now?
32694,Homer,twister! get down!
18637,Homer,"table five, table five..."
34685,Homer,you can't close! i'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
29341,Homer,"marge, that's crazy talk. now look, i'll save lisa. your place is here with the women."
21426,Homer,"yeah, him. whatever happened to that guy?"
25829,Homer,yah!
28526,Homer,"no need, flanders. i've already given them my old clothes."
15927,Homer,"marge, please. i'm having enough trouble with the lobsters."
13245,Homer,"hear me, people of springfield. i come from yet another distant future where gun violence has destroyed the very earth itself."
15363,Homer,ye-esss...
17529,Homer,"it's okay, marge. we don't need to go on a trip. we'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
38300,Homer,"ooh, pepperoni!"
37697,Homer,"if you're my wife's secret lover, come in. there's nothing i can do for her anymore."
26823,Homer,"oh no, not the good cheek!"
25966,Homer,"geez moe, you've been a real crank lately."
19277,Homer,working... so... late... that...
23855,Homer,okay. all right. okay.
28511,Homer,can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
38884,Homer,"i get it, lisa. i finally get it."

20584,Homer,lenny really wanted to go.
22834,Homer,so you'd better catch the fever. catch it...
15125,Homer,woo hoo! u.s.a! u.s.a! u.s.a!
36669,Homer,"look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
27571,Homer,"crawling! oh, he's really gone. he's gone!"
34712,Homer,another good one...
22814,Homer,come on... fit you...
25044,Homer,"wait a minute. you're telling me the police force, the tv news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and bart a lesson?"
22055,Homer,"say, who are you guys?"
15683,Homer,eww.
30666,Homer,"i need a present for my wife / or i'll have no sex for life / diamond ring, a vase by ming / some kinda useful kitchen thing"
14692,Homer,your wife don't understand you/ but i do...
21044,Homer,"damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! can't we all just get along?"
35620,Homer,"oh, uh, roz, i have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. could you cover for me?"
15178,Homer,"ah, sweet soft-hearted marge. you just can't see the big picture. if i stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the supreme court. if i fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""mister tight buns"" competition. i can't let that happen, i won't let that happen and i can't let that happen."
15774,Homer,hired goons?
18072,Homer,then how come that guy's winning?
40625,Homer,"no need, doc. i can read marge like a book."
17969,Homer,i have every right to be on that jury even though i got there because i'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
25572,Homer,help! kitenge!
23034,Homer,"yes, sir."
22899,Homer,are we kissing?
33125,Homer,"all marge and i need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""do not disturb"" sign."
33654,Homer,won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
19641,Homer,burnsie!
38568,Homer,"bart, you went to hell and came back a winner, like jesus. now come on, boy! pull me apart like string cheese."
29438,Homer,sure it will. all we need is a pilot!
32961,Homer,"objection, your honor."
22647,Homer,"oh, no you don't. screw that touchy, queery crap! we'll take the harsh antacids. nothing's too good for my little girl."
18501,Homer,"hang on, boy! daddy's comin' to save ya!"
30079,Homer,"here's my angle: there's no way in god's heaven i should get into god's heaven. but maybe he'll let me in, if i warn others the apocalypse is coming, as i previously shouted."
18534,Homer,"ooh, sorry. here's another one."
24327,Homer,"lenny, carl, i know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. to me, you're true blue."
24146,Homer,done.
22252,Homer,"so long, su--"
18505,Homer,"well, goodnight, son."
30623,Homer,"hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"
30732,Homer,"so, i see you're also traveling with your son. what boy prison are you taking him to?"
23757,Homer,"forget it. he releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: feed the children, save the whales, even release the hounds."
24850,Homer,good start! now finish the job!
33287,Homer,i'll save you!
27360,Homer,but it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- lisa simpson.
13266,Homer,"behold, as i slept, your uncle claudius poured poison in my ear... poison most foul...so he could marry your mother and become the king."
23660,Homer,"kids, come and get it!"
17286,Homer,"this shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools."
34449,Homer,"okay, left hand: rembrandt!"
20268,Homer,"go to hell, cloaky!"
32387,Homer,more bread please.
36158,Homer,a common misconception.
19210,Homer,i can't remember where we parked.
21949,Homer,"nooo, nothing made of dead guys. what's in the back?"
25546,Homer,that amos burke made his own rules.
18053,Homer,"oh, right."
16514,Homer,"okay, marge, let's go."
24024,Homer,my horse must lose!
30759,Homer,"thank you, colonel."

13359,Homer,about last night... you might have noticed daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
33781,Homer,what do you mean? and who are you?
40445,Homer,"damn, no spots."
40881,Homer,get out of my house! i don't wanna associate with criminals.
34885,Homer,what they don't suspect is that i'm into this.
29901,Homer,of course we are! if you wanna be.
25982,Homer,ayyy.
33765,Homer,gotta be something from earth.

32380,Homer,"hop in, bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
24475,Homer,"yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
38786,Homer,"headin' home, baby."
40798,Homer,"ohhh! oh, marge! this'll be the greatest night of your life. i've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but i'm gonna spend it all on us. i'm renting the biggest limo. i'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. my tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw."

23084,Homer,it's a crane. the japanese believe they bring good luck.
40229,Homer,"are you all right, mr. burns?"
28641,Homer,it's stuck! krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!
39007,Homer,perfect! just like when we let you name maggie.
21996,Homer,two hours? why'd they build this ghost town so far away?
21698,Homer,the chair? how come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?
41038,Homer,ooo.
33569,Homer,"that was good, but lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
40444,Homer,it's your fault i'm bald!
34856,Homer,i thought he was an old clump of rags.
33966,Homer,"pay the man, boy."
23783,Homer,don't hurt me! here's my wallet.
27255,Homer,"savages! i'll handle this, marge."
40903,Homer,"excuse me. i hate to interrupt your judging me, but i wanted you to know i've made a couple of really important decisions. number one: i'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. and number two: i'm not very fond of any of you."
17243,Homer,but there are five of us.
34137,Homer,it's a father-son commitment band that i bought and never told you about!
17330,Homer,"whew, that's all of 'em. and i'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. how 'bout a present, son?"
32693,Homer,now let's add the rear window defogger!
24697,Homer,"oh lisa, this must be a rough time for you. do you have any friends or family you can stay with?"
16986,Homer,"uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
31367,Homer,hmm... i must be supposed to remember something.
30228,Homer,"marge, what are you doing here?"
24995,Homer,"oh, of course, of course. it's just that..."
40570,Homer,"oh, the truth!"
14887,Homer,check... mate.
34477,Homer,just my lunch.
28605,Homer,"""...i'd love to be with you, but i just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. will meet you later. love, dad."
39363,Homer,you can't stay in there forever!
34586,Homer,i want some of that!
36215,Homer,so what do i do again?
18495,Homer,"heh, heh. why jerk my neck around like a goon when tyranno-vision decides what i should look at?"
27711,Homer,"oooh, published by kinko's!"
18291,Homer,"hee hee hee. i've got your donut, lard lad! and what are you gonna do about it?"
40337,Homer,well... he...
23715,Homer,how could i be down a thousand bucks?
17984,Homer,"will that girl ever shut up? okay, marge. i'll plan everything. we can have the reception at moe's. wait, why not have the whole wedding there? we'll do it on a monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks."
15126,Homer,hee hee!
34806,Homer,excuse me?
20891,Homer,"aw, i understand, kids. i'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
33268,Homer,we'll look it up in the corona.
30029,Homer,do you know the hours i worked? the people i had to yell at? the tires i had to slash?
24613,Homer,how the hell did they find that out?
16837,Homer,food fight!
18283,Homer,"c'mon, i'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, i mean a veggie-back ride home."
22166,Homer,"well, we'll see about that."
28466,Homer,"y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."
21479,Homer,not yet. wait... wait... wait... now!
23962,Homer,"oooh, oooh, charlie horse, charlie horse!"
23282,Homer,"how about ""screw flanders""?"
17450,Homer,"ooh, the pharaoh's chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
29566,Homer,barf for your master!
41309,Homer,"homer, that's a terrible thing to say."
22274,Homer,shut it off. they're losers.
38072,Homer,"uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. you know, dweebler."
26245,Homer,"yeah, they're called ""congress""."
27228,Homer,i'll teach you to whistle on the sabbath!
23571,Homer,"yes, bart's weird friend."
32830,Homer,ready... for... pick up. ready! for! pick up!
18558,Homer,"i've figured out the boy's punishment. first: he's grounded. no leaving the house, not even for school. second: no eggnog. in fact, no nog period. and third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
14693,Homer,"hey moe, you got any fudd?"
16580,Homer,never mind the commercials. just give it to me. i've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
28474,Homer,will you make my sundae for me?
36535,Homer,i thought there was no crime in new york any more. giulianiii!
30017,Homer,may i have a word with you?
34003,Homer,another politician who can't keep his promises.
28767,Homer,that still sounds like the smart kid.
17040,Homer,"incorrect, marge. two perfectly good jackets."
14984,Homer,i can wait all --
35599,Homer,and i sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
38151,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa..."
22382,Homer,"gee... i never thought i'd say this about a tv show, but this is kinda stupid. hey, ""policecops."" that sounds like a lethal combination."
30496,Homer,"bart, this is the greatest present i ever received. to open another gift now would be like following the london philharmonic with jessica simpson. whatchu got, lisa?"
32882,Homer,mom!
20138,Homer,sorry.
39858,Homer,my back! there goes my back again!
13906,Homer,"mr. burns, you do this personally?"
40739,Homer,what?
15055,Homer,"i sent in an application for you. i couldn't find a big enough photo, so i sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
25581,Homer,"so, you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?"
26893,Homer,you know what will cool this place down? a little touch of winter.
17803,Homer,"look, you're gonna be having dinner with groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
15271,Homer,i married her!
39869,Homer,"hear him out, marge."
17158,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i've learned my lesson. a mountain of sugar is too much for one man. it's clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii."
17729,Homer,"my marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. i failed. quitting my dream job was the hardest thing i've ever done."
19445,Homer,"get moving, you stupid... when i'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". come on!"
34967,Homer,"i'd like a third helping, please."
24933,Homer,hey!
38654,Homer,"uh, look, i just wanna ask... can we be friends?"
17187,Homer,oh yeah. like you don't know. we're gonna have sex.
21664,Homer,"man, it feels good to get out of that car. ooo, go-carts! c'mon everybody, let's go."
32875,Homer,that's it...
30527,Homer,every man for himself! trample if you must!
13814,Homer,"why at that little shop, right over... there."
20371,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll do it. for you."
35512,Homer,good ol' larry.
30330,Homer,"hey, i love waking up drunk in the morning."
21249,Homer,"well, ray patterson thinks you should do it! animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. did we lose a war? that's not america. that's not even mexico."
16042,Homer,"aw, no fair."
29021,Homer,usa! usa!
14328,Homer,"shh! marge, he's a good digger."
36674,Homer,did you say my dad worked here?
17560,Homer,that's just the engine powering up. that's just the engine struggling.
15429,Homer,trust me.
26975,Homer,hm...
30135,Homer,"thank you, lord! it's back the way it was."
38753,Homer,"well son, i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write... down the names of and then cover. but then i remember: i'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
27256,Homer,we come in peace. we takem your land.
30618,Homer,it says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
37483,Homer,"sorry, lenny."
25653,Homer,"did you ever see that ""blue man group?"""
26834,Homer,"if he wants to sleep with us, forget it."
32064,Homer,"oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!"
31593,Homer,you're all idiots. i'm putting it on chill thunder lite.
15491,Homer,sorry.
34251,Homer,"uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... i spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, i didn't know you could rent a balloon..."
21608,Homer,"ohhh, it's no use. i can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community."
29316,Homer,"yes, but he came here to die."
19197,Homer,"uh, sure."
20602,Homer,you're all nuts.
15508,Homer,you're adopted and i don't like you.
26044,Homer,"all right, i'm sorry... but i will not save the rainforest."
17757,Homer,it's at times like this i wish i were a religious man.
36920,Homer,bongo?! i told you never to ever talk about bongo!
24733,Homer,"look, marge! i'm in a limo! the simpsons are going to paris!"
20878,Homer,booo!
40400,Homer,'fraid not infinity.
22276,Homer,wooooo! 'topes ruuuule!
13999,Homer,"goodbye, son."
40747,Homer,"dad, i'm in love."
35157,Homer,i'd like to thank mr. speedy pants repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the bangles. see you at the cool party!
13986,Homer,okay. hank.
35156,Homer,"angry dad's voice is part walter matthau... hey, felix!... part little richard whoooo! ...and a little bit of snoopy when he cries."
16355,Homer,"oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
28450,Homer,you broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!
14719,Homer,i can't. i'm her manager.
33950,Homer,"okay, now i'll be the dog and you be the daddy."
13575,Homer,baby.
15003,Homer,no sale.
13301,Homer,me?
35666,Homer,"look, honey, a family's like a team. and on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee."
20542,Homer,ow! ow! my boating arm! what's going on?
26182,Homer,stanford.
40887,Homer,just a select circle of my friends.
26410,Homer,rainier wolfcastle.
24065,Homer,you want anything else? water? chili fries? how about some white noise?
18112,Homer,okay.
35722,Homer,a million bucks?
40494,Homer,because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
31848,Homer,i don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!
36047,Homer,"wait! if you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
20945,Homer,"let me out! i'm innocent! i changed my mind, i don't want to be in here anymore!"
26780,Homer,"let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy mrs. dash..."
20424,Homer,do it.
24376,Homer,why isn't my baby gaining weight?
29533,Homer,"welcome to the ""homer simpson showboating academy."""
38714,Homer,hey marge!
37433,Homer,"yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true."
22676,Homer,"well, i really gave him no choice. y'see..."
30563,Homer,i can't believe i lost after ben affleck campaigned day and night for me.
30955,Homer,just outsource it to lisa. outsourcing is the answer to everything.
22061,Homer,that's the last time i trust the strangest people on earth.
30896,Homer,i don't know why i ever married that woman.
20935,Homer,"that's my girl. you just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. moe will take care of everything."
36650,Homer,what the--? i'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
29597,Homer,"yeah, be cool. like us."
13633,Homer,mmmmmm... money.
40047,Homer,a thousand bucks. i can't afford that.
36508,Homer,"pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
30179,Homer,"hey, you knocked out my power. how am i supposed to eat without watching tv?"
19892,Homer,"well, i don't think so. you don't even have a trigger on that thing."
21733,Homer,ohh... ahh...
33884,Homer,i can't wait for the reviews!
14915,Homer,"hey, there's quarters in here!"
17649,Homer,"oh marge, kids, i miss my club."
25039,Homer,stop! this has gone on just long enough.
19776,Homer,you'll thank me on your wedding night.
29941,Homer,and what's the network?
34843,Homer,ta-da!
23182,Homer,"i'm tired of running away. did ""braveheart"" run away? did ""payback"" run away? it's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
15292,Homer,well... i really should discuss this with my wife.
35828,Homer,bart! thank god i had this in my pocket.
36953,Homer,crawling... so painful...
34693,Homer,i organized the kitchen. i labeled everything with a label maker...
25145,Homer,"hmm, i'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern..."
21046,Homer,"well, i guess that's everyone. except earring-boy."
20647,Homer,"stay out of this, old man."
25460,Homer,they're moving the team to albuquerque!
37323,Homer,"okay, let's see how straight it is."
29563,Homer,"quiet, you!"
21159,Homer,"helper monkey, eh?"
23573,Homer,next question.
16348,Homer,"hey, i hear ya, buddy."
21619,Homer,this will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
17118,Homer,is it a pool yet?
27680,Homer,"sir, i studied under ed mcmahon!"
17594,Homer,this is it. my ticket in. they have to let me join if i'm the son of a member.
25720,Homer,"but ""dr. screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. well, you don't have to worry about the bill. we've never welshed on a... look, a bear!"
21406,Homer,don't ever say that.
30877,Homer,"hey, funny man, say something funny!"
13766,Homer,"this is all your fault! okay, gotta pick a button. pick a button. pick a button. uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... no, wait! bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? no, no!"
18786,Homer,"here are your messages: ""you have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""you have 10 minutes,"" ""your car has been impounded,"" ""your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""you have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
34771,Homer,"don't fight it... that's it... that's it, a little more... how's that?"
22584,Homer,"oh, marge, you saved me!"
31037,Homer,she's opening her eyes!
38079,Homer,overfed? i don't know this word.
16809,Homer,"marge, quit livin' in the past."
17511,Homer,"the last bar in springfield. if they don't let me in here, i'm gonna have to quit drinking."
35055,Homer,ah! got one!
30905,Homer,kidding! kidding! i don't vote! the polling place is up a hill and i never make it!
23767,Homer,i think what lisa meant to say is...
25426,Homer,i'm sorry to hear that.
24695,Homer,hmm. it's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
30983,Homer,may i escort you to the railing?
31512,Homer,"marge, we have a problem here."
17233,Homer,i kicked one of those stupid itchy characters in the butt.
33453,Homer,"marge, are you mad i forgot to send in the payment?"
31311,Homer,"yeah, get him a woman. that'll end his misery!"
37906,Homer,why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the air buds and ray liottas of the world?
38199,Homer,now let's play human foosball!
14880,Homer,you know a d turns into a b so easily. you just got greedy.
34102,Homer,"hm, people in other countries make love? it's about time."
39440,Homer,bart!
30403,Homer,you're not saying no.
28152,Homer,"oh my god, i've gotta save her!"
36087,Homer,"well, i rented that plane."
33868,Homer,"what do you think, marge? maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
21575,Homer,reading about this edison character. they won't let me in the big people library downtown. there was some unpleasantness. i can never go back.
32161,Homer,what? i'll show him. i'll show that guy!
25307,Homer,"hello, bart. how are the tennis partners?"
23697,Homer,woo-hoo!
20992,Homer,uh-oh.
16223,Homer,"oh, lisa, you and your stories. bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and tv... is."
33443,Homer,fine. back. and we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
36909,Homer,i know what must have happened:
36126,Homer,"don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! geez, it's all over the place. holy moly."
30667,Homer,i need a store i can break into
40184,Homer,"be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
34213,Homer,"oh barney, that's brilliant! just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
13913,Homer,sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
33396,Homer,"i got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!"
35617,Homer,hm.
15475,Homer,"well, marge, we could do worse."
27207,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
38725,Homer,it's like some kind of guitar central.
39398,Homer,"hey, if they think i'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken."
15350,Homer,"barney, that's great. when two best friends work together, not even god, himself, can stop them."
37020,Homer,"you got to watch a vhs copy of ""red dawn"" thirteen times. stop complaining."
34233,Homer,race you to the cockpit!
27788,Homer,"no, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
36660,Homer,"ha, of course i do! happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?"
27679,Homer,"beat it, waxie."
16229,Homer,"oh, sorry."
18689,Homer,simpson family.
31190,Homer,"okay pretty boy, where's fat tony's fifty bucks?"
25191,Homer,"first i'd feel like having a blt, then proud of you."
14485,Homer,never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
27610,Homer,"hm, now without lettuce."
40678,Homer,"well, i ... oh, let's get some worms."
20537,Homer,that doesn't matter. the important thing is we won.
33271,Homer,"oh, look at that. we're out of almond paste. don't get up. i'll grind the almonds myself."
40782,Homer,and anyone can be tooted?
18260,Homer,one whopper for the copper.
33897,Homer,"to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. and all our yesterdays have lighted fools. the way to dusty death. out, out, brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. that struts and frets his hour upon the stage. and then is heard no more."
40925,Homer,"boy, a good man really is hard to find."
20343,Homer,woo hoo!
17929,Homer,yes. i am in flavor country.
15464,Homer,"looks like an ""x."""
39990,Homer,no problemo. we'll just get off at the next exit.
39152,Homer,can i try it?
35547,Homer,"well, i suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
29398,Homer,"yo, yo, yo! keep it on the low flow!"
26952,Homer,"what, and let them come after you and the kids?"
15662,Homer,and then when he's lying on the ground...
14499,Homer,"damn, crappy nails! super glue my butt!"
24615,Homer,"quiet, honey. daddy's asking the man a question."
29108,Homer,what about now?
17078,Homer,but i'm not in the cla...
35058,Homer,life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
40462,Homer,"come on, flanders, he's not that bad."
25077,Homer,"c'mon, kids. let's leave this awful place and never come back."
39527,Homer,"well, thank you very much, mrs. maharishi gandhi. let's go, boy."
18712,Homer,i'm driving up to the main building. they've got valet parking tonight.
30328,Homer,"look at the bright side, marge. when i die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. that's multi-tasking."
35126,Homer,and you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
25938,Homer,cops!
30620,Homer,don't worry. we got the cheese insurance.
16432,Homer,"hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze."
41282,Homer,wow. that saxophone would make a great pipe.
18929,Homer,"hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
27175,Homer,can i help you?
32150,Homer,"okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
32137,Homer,stop peppering me with questions!
32637,Homer,"if you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!"
41511,Homer,"b-b-b-b-but the poncho. hit the road, square."
17887,Homer,what a wonderful dinner. what a beautiful family. someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
16842,Homer,"marge! i think i hate ted koppel. no wait, i find him informative and witty. 'nite."
26957,Homer,"yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. i'm giving this badge to the next guy i see."
24926,Homer,i'm sorry. what?
21235,Homer,"that's a good question, bono. 'cause i'd be the most wack, tripped-out sanitation commissioner ever! can ya dig it?"
23233,Homer,that was fun. we have to get out more often.
13941,Homer,woo-hoo!
36800,Homer,to hope!
38851,Homer,"fine. but i'm not paying for the insurance. oh, what the hell, give me the insurance."
22669,Homer,i told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. bom-bom-bom-bom... i told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
39405,Homer,"unlike most of you, i am not a nut. just a good, honest american who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur."
32045,Homer,sure do. let's go get ice cream!
25652,Homer,"quick, moe! marge cut off my thumb."
17297,Homer,what the hell are you smiling at?
31535,Homer,gunderson!
14046,Homer,he's not so fat.
37384,Homer,church bulletin? church bulletin? church--
25667,Homer,"ooh, she wants to know how your life is going."
20275,Homer,"okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
17007,Homer,"well, i'm opposed to the whole thing! damn opposed!"
30850,Homer,"hey monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!"
40370,Homer,"now, this is a picture of your enemy, todd flanders. every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him."
37597,Homer,"hey, i'm the one in bed with two beautiful women."
24265,Homer,"well, i do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. oh, you can."
38597,Homer,"bad news, bears. forecast calls for nothing but rain."

38159,Homer,then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
23612,Homer,"listen, boy... i was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
27811,Homer,"oh, that takes me back."

17685,Homer,"from now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
28713,Homer,"that's great. i'm honored to drink to apu and, uh... apulina."
37521,Homer,"yeah, just like we did with bart. anyway, this year i'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."

19344,Homer,marge? can you come in here? we need to talk.
29527,Homer,"after you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!"
38754,Homer,yep. it's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. pretty unforeseen...
40171,Homer,"'tis some visitor,"
27014,Homer,and i've never seen you use your tail like that.
13468,Homer,"lisa, dim the lights! no, turn on more lights! but do something!"
18270,Homer,"marge, since i'm not talking to lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
29414,Homer,"i'll get a second job. one that pays well. you think those guys on ""friends"" need another friend?"

20385,Homer,"this gun cost me everything. my wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
39340,Homer,"well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, i think. now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we simpsons have dreamed about for generations. you may outsmart someone."
14959,Homer,"uh-oh. here, boy."
14720,Homer,"marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."

30596,Homer,"and marge, there are certain things i can do for you that no other friend can. special things."
34382,Homer,"hey, my bathing suit came off!"
16167,Homer,"a million dollars and three hawaiian islands. good ones, not the leper ones."

32134,Homer,somebody's gotta do 'em.
21319,Homer,not there either. over here.
31132,Homer,really? you'd kiss an ugly old man like me?

15262,Homer,all right. hit the change of venue button. now!
35866,Homer,is it snowing down here?
26625,Homer,"okay, let's see: ""toke as needed. caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""
24593,Homer,"it's a badger all right... or possibly a griffin. bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?"
25718,Homer,maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
23517,Homer,get the... get outta... bad animals! go home!

32108,Homer,"oh, tell me more!"
35729,Homer,you're the zephyr.
40974,Homer,"woo woo! the h stands for herbert! herb, were you adopted?"
26684,Homer,"but there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away."
18300,Homer,we'll be right back.
24932,Homer,attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
27976,Homer,fine.
38288,Homer,"...so marge says i gotta ""ask lisa on a date."""
16669,Homer,you're selling what now?

33437,Homer,uninsured! uninsured!
31816,Homer,"thanks, moe!"
40416,Homer,"son, this is a tradition. if you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce."
38824,Homer,um. maybe.
23199,Homer,"yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
18663,Homer,"it's your sons, george bush jr. and jeb bush. come outside, dad!"

13776,Homer,"what's your problem, boy?"
40643,Homer,"eleven-thirty! oh, that's just great."
28947,Homer,because i'm successfully married.
18884,Homer,helms calls for donut tax?!
30092,Homer,"goodbye, stupid earth!"
39989,Homer,don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.
22444,Homer,"oh, i spit my gum in there."
32614,Homer,"set the table, marge!"
33834,Homer,when do i get to move back home?
17016,Homer,what?!
39116,Homer,i'm not spending my precious saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than i ever had.
30339,Homer,no one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
38033,Homer,"well, as long as i'm paying for the time..."
16030,Homer,"i tied him up, out back."
14921,Homer,"but marge, what about dessert?"
35978,Homer,and ours!

20299,Homer,you're just making it worse. i promise i won't hurt you.
18625,Homer,"oh. i wanted to write ""disco stud"" but i ran out of space. not that ""disco stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
18199,Homer,what i wouldn't give to hear lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
22216,Homer,"well, there you go. now how 'bout a drink?"
28948,Homer,uh-oh.
22690,Homer,so much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
34433,Homer,"this one says ""carolina panthers!"""
14554,Homer,"kids, kids, kids. you can each get me a beer. but first let's see it again in super slow motion."
40721,Homer,"shut up, boy. cheap chinese tvs... why did i every buy... is that better?"
27367,Homer,"look lisa, i'm still trying to get to know you. who's your favorite traveling wilbury? is it jeff lynne?"
35956,Homer,that's what a play within a play is for!
34440,Homer,can i buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
28730,Homer,"close, but no cigar. just plain diamonds."
19990,Homer,"thanks for swinging by the house, reverend."
33543,Homer,"oh, we're too heavy."
39825,Homer,"what do you mean, sir?"
34319,Homer,no problem. you can unload.
25614,Homer,or is it the right?
28338,Homer,back cuts?
19239,Homer,no!
18944,Homer,what?
36291,Homer,"sorry. before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?"
38173,Homer,"i don't know whose this is. i found it next to the cash machine, and i've always kept it. look at the balance."
41001,Homer,"oh, okay. i'd like a big one, then."
22242,Homer,"ooh, a friendly bee."
23422,Homer,"wow, a free beer! and i owe it all to a little glove slap. glove slap..."

24073,Homer,"oh, yeah. that's it, baby, that's the money shot. yeah, the camera loves you. oh-ho-ho, you tease, you."
13162,Homer,absolutely. or my name isn't... whatever i told you it was.
17180,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
27319,Homer,frank grimes...
26362,Homer,"wait, you really think marge is gonna fall for this guy? even after i bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
25452,Homer,"oh, so hungry... can't give up... must continue fighting evil corporation."
18671,Homer,you didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! never!
15633,Homer,"son, i just want you to know i love you very much."
15853,Homer,"i never passed remedial science one ""a""."

26319,Homer,ostrich burgers! get your ostrich burgers!
23907,Homer,i mean an award that's worth winning.
23022,Homer,"yes, i did."
27170,Homer,domiciles for the destitute? is this that thing that jimmy carter does?
19166,Homer,"marge, look!"
29548,Homer,i wonder if other super bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.
34826,Homer,"sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
14535,Homer,"mmm, do - nuts."
16003,Homer,i'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.
21237,Homer,"my campaign is a disaster, moe."
18524,Homer,i don't know.
18667,Homer,bingo.
29560,Homer,i thought america was hungry for meaning. i should have just sent a crocodile into space like i originally planned.
37285,Homer,now have me sleeping under a cactus!
40538,Homer,"hey, don't worry marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in springfield elementary school is gonna come and see this thing."
34872,Homer,"no, i'm no-ot! yes i am. the bloody hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of london..."
16906,Homer,he likes peanuts.
33546,Homer,professor frink! help me figure this out!
14219,Homer,"you know, i had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
31905,Homer,you would be.
26072,Homer,are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
25513,Homer,problem: a pointy deity. and i've got the perfect solution.
13732,Homer,don't lie to me boy.
20609,Homer,come on! it'll be fun!
33970,Homer,it wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a bavarian castle!
30262,Homer,me? but i'm the father.
22295,Homer,"so, marge, ready for another episode of ""don't go there""?"
30305,Homer,wow. i can see why she loves you.
40076,Homer,i am nature's greatest miracle!
21455,Homer,"i'll get us out of this, honey. it's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'."
17709,Homer,thank you. thank you very much. it is nice work.
17855,Homer,"when will you australians learn? in america, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. the streets are safe. old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. so, like us, let your children run wild and free. because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. now boy, run back to the embassy! back to american soil!"
17809,Homer,"you mean i get 5% off on everything in the store just because i look like... i mean, just because i am krusty the clown?"
20520,Homer,"ohhh, right, right. the fake marriage thing. how's that goin'?"
38237,Homer,where's your mother?
33760,Homer,look at all these helicopter parents. i hope bart's doing okay on his own.
39604,Homer,i'd like to see your finest rv. do you have something that's better than the land behemoth?
32421,Homer,oh the girl i love's got beautiful... eyes
22185,Homer,"first of all, i get five dollars a day plus expenses."
32171,Homer,those are words.
29229,Homer,"we'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. bart?... lisa?..."
40154,Homer,wow!
29642,Homer,"oh, i just love it here. so many things, and so many things of each thing!"
40011,Homer,"lord help me, i'm just not that bright."
37377,Homer,"right, um, i don't understand, lisa, we let you get up early to watch the royal wedding!"
38215,Homer,coming! i haven't forgotten about the sausage.
37302,Homer,"marge, i thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous."
34403,Homer,"y'ello. this is he. yeah i wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of mount zion? great. i'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. yes, i know what a falafel is."
22114,Homer,they're milking rats! milk-ing rats!
32175,Homer,woo hoo!
13493,Homer,i'll show you mad in the morning.
15815,Homer,"okay, okay. this time i'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him."
22783,Homer,"oh, yeah. definitely pain!"
22920,Homer,"boy, moe, you sure look angry. here, have some nuts."
20558,Homer,"a buck, eh? that gives me an idea..."
31752,Homer,so... how long is señor homer out of town for?
16919,Homer,stupid tornado. look. it got patty and selma.
37386,Homer,day by day... day by day... the deacon's job... is pretty okay... pretty okaaay... i'm going to be a deacon... day by day... i'm already a deacon... day by day...
18656,Homer,"oooh? hiding behind your goons, eh, bush? oooh! well, you are a wimp."
23455,Homer,"all right, let's see what the old girl can do."
20954,Homer,"um, i'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito."
28712,Homer,a lot of that went in my lungs.
41249,Homer,twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
29013,Homer,do i ever!
35350,Homer,"um, i take a special size."
15755,Homer,then i got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
14669,Homer,"marge, i have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. tonight you robbed me of it. i'm going now and i don't know when you'll see me again."
30656,Homer,"oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... i'd like to tell you all a little story i call ""the first christmas."""
39607,Homer,wait till flanders gets a load of this.
41066,Homer,nooooooooooooooooooooo!

39932,Homer,"yes, sir."
14553,Homer,ha ha. cops can't win!
17621,Homer,"huh? oh. yeah. thanks, lenny."
27516,Homer,i couldn't help it. those pews are so comfortable.
38874,Homer,"see, marge?"
26379,Homer,do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? something indoorsy.
29641,Homer,"patty, i admire your decision. it takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. so i'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
19012,Homer,"really? me, too. but i got kicked out 'cause of my views on vietnam. also, i was stealing projectors."
40628,Homer,"oh marge, i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die."
35255,Homer,but i haven't finished my rituals yet!
20657,Homer,"outta my way, snow-poke!"
31878,Homer,i don't work here.
32552,Homer,how 'bout the deja viewmaster?
30181,Homer,but i siphoned that gas from flanders! flanders...
21367,Homer,"thanks, bart. that makes it all worthwhile."
36104,Homer,i repeat. one...
40282,Homer,because they might say no.
18176,Homer,"marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
34533,Homer,"hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
21208,Homer,"uh, it's like the measles. good to get it out of the way."
24031,Homer,i can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. and furthermore...
37899,Homer,theaters? all i need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. care to join me?
36480,Homer,i thought i heard clicks and pops!
24114,Homer,done and done.
38050,Homer,where's my money?
33599,Homer,"yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! there's sully, and mack, jimmy d. and jimmy b.! what can i get ya, boys -- the usual?"
34686,Homer,"oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--"
39446,Homer,you remember the rules from last year?
36615,Homer,"i'll take it from here, wing-man."
14428,Homer,alley balls?
16875,Homer,"heh, heh. stick it to the man. no, wait!"
15058,Homer,"well, if i could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, i would. but to me, she's beautiful."
37315,Homer,marge was so happy when i made those promises. what changed?
40044,Homer,hair... hair... just like everybody else.
18698,Homer,"just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, marge?"
30177,Homer,you're a god!... i can't think of any more!
32532,Homer,save some suds for--
30847,Homer,"when the monkey falls asleep, i'll sneak you out in this trash bag. then i'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
24424,Homer,...knock you out...
26776,Homer,apu is cheating!
22409,Homer,okay.
37632,Homer,"great... oh, and i have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."
23922,Homer,and another thing: if i ev...
24002,Homer,"champion horse, coming through!"
35289,Homer,"hello, boy."
15438,Homer,fall on your knees / oh hear the angels' voices /
33623,Homer,your first mission is to look out the window.
28883,Homer,feed my pets and tape my shows!
19732,Homer,"oh, yeah. like when a clown dies."
23601,Homer,"this is the end / my only friend, the end / weird scenes inside the gold mine..."
38567,Homer,"no, boy. i want you to do it."
32015,Homer,you butcher!
39842,Homer,marge. marge. we're gonna try one more place. the sapphire lounge. bart! i said look at the floor!
22238,Homer,"geez, i've never seen anyone so whipped so fast."
37252,Homer,"i hate unions. there's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
25479,Homer,you read my mind. sooo...
37337,Homer,"moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
32192,Homer,"but if i'd ever leave you, / it couldn't be in autumn. / how i'd leave in autumn i never will know..."
20693,Homer,and their damp-trousered pa.
13824,Homer,"come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. i thought he was just being colorful."
31084,Homer,do you know what you just gave up?!
17816,Homer,oh yeah. speed holes.
35199,Homer,he's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
28882,Homer,my demons and i are closer than ever. next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. i'm just goin' in to bust marge out.
37528,Homer,"shake it off kids, they're just jealous!"
14288,Homer,"as the years went by, your mother and i were blessed twice more."
16428,Homer,"see, i got this friend named... joey joe joe junior... schabadoo."
18491,Homer,that sideshow mel thinks he's so big. whatever happened to sideshow bob?
19290,Homer,"let me finish. we could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
35270,Homer,bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
33529,Homer,"don't worry, honey, i'll be your ""seeing-eye homer."" we're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... um, i'm gonna take my break now."
13551,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons."
28107,Homer,men of cruelty.
25577,Homer,"okay, here's the situation: we're hopelessly lost and about to die."
16745,Homer,"aw, that's nothin'. watch this. there once was a man from nantucket"
23023,Homer,larry flynt is right! you guys stink!
41569,Homer,marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine...
17871,Homer,if only i could think of an invention. something that would really make money. must concentrate and work harder than i've ever worked...
40558,Homer,"no, of course you're not going to die. everything's fine!"
37868,Homer,you got me weed?
27304,Homer,but i'm not drunk!
29422,Homer,"hola, señor. we are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country."
16436,Homer,i made it the whole day without seeing her again.
27520,Homer,"he's not giving it to me, god is. because i prayed for it."
14611,Homer,"hey, you did the best you could."
34245,Homer,"boy, this has gone too far -- i quit! as soon as i finish these oats."

32733,Homer,move or die!
14767,Homer,"wow, my concert going jacket still fits. and this is where i used to hide my beer."
14512,Homer,what if i catch on fire?
29520,Homer,woo hoo! but why?
17299,Homer,"oh no! they're gaining on me. wait, i have an idea."
14036,Homer,three-time soapbox derby champion ronnie beck!
38438,Homer,needs more numerators.
32723,Homer,well... i certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
16566,Homer,"we don't need a thinker, we need a doer. someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
25410,Homer,"nice place you got here. ooh look, a hair net. be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
36271,Homer,i got it...
36346,Homer,spoiler!
40459,Homer,that was beautiful. can we go now?
31025,Homer,"fine! i'll finish it myself. and don't think i'm gonna screw it up, because i won't!"
37608,Homer,"yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, lisa."
30183,Homer,"oh, i was just driving around the mid-atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and i just... oh, who am i fooling with my awesome lies? i want you to come back to springfield."
33391,Homer,why? why?
23996,Homer,huh?
32775,Homer,"come on out, boy."
27615,Homer,three ribwiches please. and instead of a shake i'd like a blended ribwich.
24260,Homer,"right, right, present. anyway, can i get you some soylent green?"
30583,Homer,i bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
35845,Homer,"are we done yet? ""it's a wonderful life"" is about to start. i wonder what my life would've been like if i'd never seen that movie..."
28996,Homer,"and now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. but before the intercourse, the dinner course."
24846,Homer,that's right! top of the line!
26683,Homer,it's true we're losing money...
15864,Homer,i'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
30853,Homer,mr. teeny?!
19480,Homer,"hello? is this g-b-m? uh, yeah. i read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, i also like rainy days and movies. uh huh... uh, no, i don't like that. or that. no, it's not that i'm afraid. i'm gonna hang up now. bye-bye. oh, i give up."

32094,Homer,"um, wait, i forgot the words."

14872,Homer,"wake up, boy."
23524,Homer,"lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is..."
19126,Homer,"all right, team, it's the fourth quarter. the lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
34989,Homer,this is horrible! i keep smelling my own breath!
32502,Homer,i'd like to know if wes doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
30586,Homer,"wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""peterson's field guide to birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
27189,Homer,"you took a twenty-karat diamond, and made it gleam / like a big spaghetti dinner, smothered in whipped cream."
34690,Homer,what are we watching?

37680,Homer,i think i just might have what you're looking for.
30938,Homer,"thanks, sweetie. i've never been less angry to receive a book."
15032,Homer,"ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"

13198,Homer,this pays a lot better than you think.
27761,Homer,you're right. put two walnuts in there.
23072,Homer,looks like he's doing a commercial.
34257,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? it's date night."

38780,Homer,"i'm sorry, apu. i thought you were living your dream life, so naturally i wanted to ruin it. but now i know things stink, so i'm okay with it."
13243,Homer,make egyptian slave homer do it.

33898,Homer,me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
19996,Homer,yes.
14776,Homer,"well, that's a waste of money. we already have a guitar."
37144,Homer,"the same way hollywood does, by watching british movies!"
40952,Homer,"this makes me feel special, dad. since i'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me."

30909,Homer,"tonight on jock center: a slugger on 'roids, tiger woods is annoyed, and north korean missiles deployed!"
29053,Homer,since when do i listen to cakes?
37089,Homer,"i swear to you, marge, when i have the time, i will google them both."

36267,Homer,"uh, right, right... actually, i'm the designated hitter for all you guys."
27486,Homer,"well, i guess flanders doesn't have all the luck."
17320,Homer,"oh good, here comes the collection plate."
26238,Homer,that's a great idea. do you think i could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
13775,Homer,it tastes so bitter. it's like ashes in my mouth!
41458,Homer,"um... ""webster's defines""... um... ""in the words of ted nugent""... ""school spirit""... ""next card""... ""the future""..."
30278,Homer,"no, no. it's not gonna be like that, i swear."
38018,Homer,"marge, that's a compact-only space!"
33079,Homer,"this looks like a job for captain crazy! up, up and away!"
36225,Homer,why did i do that? / it sounds so dull and boring. / what was i thinking?
40593,Homer,what are you getting at?
14925,Homer,so what time does this play start?

34466,Homer,ooh! we mock your very decency.
36912,Homer,it's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
22300,Homer,"well, at least they've already done me."
37674,Homer,"hey book, are you expecting this?"

34589,Homer,"what's it say, boy?"
19345,Homer,"marge, will you marry me?"
22137,Homer,why do you talk that way?
24136,Homer,please help me! i'll do anything! i'll light a candle! i'll help with your next charity scam!
14078,Homer,but--
30013,Homer,"good job, sweetie. every time you hit that note, i'll shoot a glass with my bb gun."

35502,Homer,last may!
33278,Homer,everyone get out!
31609,Homer,where did you come from?
14614,Homer,"in doggie heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! and all the best dogs are there. old yeller... and about eight lassies and..."
33757,Homer,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, bart and lisa are gonna be failures. failures who work for... noah!"

39224,Homer,mm-hmm... mmm-hmm... mmm-hmm...
21145,Homer,"ohh, we're never gonna make it. let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
32225,Homer,"die, you stupid cobra, die!"
29622,Homer,lemme get my belt sander. maybe i can grind the ugly off your face.
26335,Homer,but bold moves are no longer my forte!
24535,Homer,why you little...!
22271,Homer,losers.
33737,Homer,"son, from now on, i'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
36287,Homer,i'm doomed! can they climb stairs?

22641,Homer,somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
28735,Homer,i want to get a second house. closer to work.
35376,Homer,"and now, to break the news as gently as i know how."
28955,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get something to eat."
20795,Homer,really? i'm surprised about maggie.
13445,Homer,"hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
16296,Homer,oh my god. they're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. and it's all my fault!
33410,Homer,okay.
21252,Homer,i'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. i'm sure he had more important things to do.
34445,Homer,i'm pounding melchizedeks!
15566,Homer,"all right, i'm almost there."
36451,Homer,they cannot judge me. only my father can judge me.
28731,Homer,"i heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor."
37581,Homer,"marge, i changed in boise. i'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed."
16785,Homer,i know i shouldn't eat thee but... mmmm... sacri-licious.
31831,Homer,"did someone say ""snack""?"
23883,Homer,"yeah, well you went to a cow college!"
35397,Homer,these are really good scissors.
38853,Homer,"i just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long."
31766,Homer,"oh, deal with it."
35646,Homer,"uh, i just came to say that you're perfect. so perfect, i think mr. burns should give you a hug."
39879,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'. the lek?
39386,Homer,"oh, no, what have i done? i smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? a few measly cents. not even enough to buy one beer. wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
32887,Homer,"every time you go, i feel abandoned. but not this time. i'm not gonna let myself get hurt."
32178,Homer,"dude! you don't think you know me, but you do!"
22768,Homer,you're pretty uptight for a naked chick. you know what would loosen you up? a little fruit.
15171,Homer,"someday you'll thank me for this, son."
19004,Homer,all is well on tour with america's most popular alternative music festival...
19880,Homer,"remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. we're patriots. like... all those people in jail."
14659,Homer,"why marge, you frisky little devil."
33650,Homer,marge! moe and maya are here for a double date.
19959,Homer,i made a bad mistake and lenny sent me home to think about what i did. but i don't remember what it was so i'm watching tv.
36090,Homer,"you know sweetie, there was a time when i would've killed for that information, but i'm pleased to announce i've already bought your mother a present."
27071,Homer,you what?
37235,Homer,i wish grampa was my dad.
28301,Homer,you know the drill. try to land on my back-fat.
33853,Homer,maybe you could come over again. i'll cook you my special microwave burritos. i stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
29137,Homer,"talk about boats! then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't."
28930,Homer,"hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage."
35405,Homer,"stop that. okay, okay. you win. i'll teach you how to make love to your wife!"
21574,Homer,"cut it out, boy!"
37882,Homer,"okay, i've gotta go see the radioactive man movie before it gets totally ruined for me."
16277,Homer,we pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two popsicles out of the freezer.
36597,Homer,"well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. when do you think things first went wrong?"
32601,Homer,hmmm... the only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
29684,Homer,"but marge, i don't want her to be happy."
17570,Homer,like what?
37040,Homer,how long have you been in there?
32695,Homer,"mrs. simpson, may i take you for an evening drive? our loaner awaits!"

38026,Homer,"moe, that's great. how do you get your ideas?"
37222,Homer,i don't know. should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
32231,Homer,"that's it! let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to marge and you can never, ever have it. this opera's over when the fat man sings."
30428,Homer,"david, you're by far the best son i've ever had. uh-oh."
32404,Homer,sleep tight. the container store now has five convenient locations!
40048,Homer,"a thousand bucks. of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! thanks for nothing!"

29554,Homer,"we now take you back through the ages, to a time before tv, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. the time of the bible!"
20400,Homer,you're a disgrace to this family.
18068,Homer,"laser effects, mirrored balls. john williams must be rolling around in his grave."
18542,Homer,"young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
30736,Homer,"don't forget to wash your hands, shakespeare."
28942,Homer,"hey, if we get your girlfriend back i won't have to."

17438,Homer,let's never fight again.
35155,Homer,i have many people to thank...
32275,Homer,"...which i previously alluded... are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?"

40693,Homer,wow! of all the luck! to think i almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
21980,Homer,"aren't you proud of your big sister, mr. pinchy? hmm? hmm?"
23939,Homer,"marge, you know i normally listen to you, but i've gotta seize this opportunity. just in case i never become a real billionaire."
25144,Homer,so you all hate me?
36013,Homer,oxygen... i need oxygen.
36119,Homer,what?

38383,Homer,that horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
37977,Homer,"i'll let you try them on, right after i decide if these videos are ""funny or die"". funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
33606,Homer,"moe, you were right!"
33267,Homer,praise be oliver.
18962,Homer,"and when i listen to a really good song, i start nodding my head, like i'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" and then sometimes i switch it up like ""no, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
14525,Homer,"bart, this is your teacher? i should start going to parents night."
39120,Homer,woo hoo! off the hook!
30934,Homer,that's me!
39382,Homer,beer! now there's a temporary solution.
26185,Homer,"don't blame me, blame tinseltown and its second golden age. may it never end."
34646,Homer,the ferry will be back in ten minutes. it'll take us home... to find out the truth.
17046,Homer,"down the hall, room twelve."
38946,Homer,yeah you are too.
13787,Homer,"um, grace under pressure is no..."
30692,Homer,"hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on daddy's boat!"
35029,Homer,because you're my best friend in the room.
39747,Homer,"ah, sounds delightful. just you and me and the balladeers."
20604,Homer,i like being thanked.
40705,Homer,"oh, gimme a break, marge."

26418,Homer,"all right, son. we'll all go -- first class!"
17397,Homer,"well, that's kind of a gray area."
17201,Homer,"oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. look at this bible i just got. fifteen bucks! and talk about a preachy book! everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
37063,Homer,clearly the boy's in shock.
29032,Homer,"somebody ought to take him down a peg. or, should i say, down a pie."
29460,Homer,put up my house? but i just paid it off... what would marge say?
31991,Homer,"oh relax, marge, i'm just messin' with ya. i know i'm not a dog. i'm a people, like you."
33715,Homer,"oh, this is great, honey. thanks for telling me about it. i hope you don't mind i invited lenny."
23147,Homer,"okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
14087,Homer,"business, eh? well let me tell you something. you just lost yourself a customer!"
31648,Homer,now what do they want?
28649,Homer,he was my best friend.
16552,Homer,"oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em."
22818,Homer,"come on, you..."
41513,Homer,bom bom bom bom
26831,Homer,"fine, i won't kill it."
18328,Homer,"um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""tron""?"
16260,Homer,"marge, i got sprayed by this skunk! oh look, it's doing it again!"
22423,Homer,"dynamic, isn't it?"
29992,Homer,here's a corner.
23867,Homer,too far.
25751,Homer,peek-a-boo!
27041,Homer,"ah, i don't care about the color of your skin, lenny. you're my friend!"
14056,Homer,"yeah, things are tough all over."
35704,Homer,"well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but i'm gonna prove her wrong."
30740,Homer,you know who would really like this place? bart. wait a minute... where the hell is bart?
20761,Homer,stupid gravity.
31133,Homer,"what a game! i got on the kiss-cam, i participated in ""the wave,"" and i got to pee in a trough! marge, can we get a trough?"
33671,Homer,not even heated up. typical dog.
22564,Homer,"well, that's a turn-off."
24271,Homer,"gold bars discovered by marge? zero. gold bars discovered by homer? well, let's just see..."
38352,Homer,"yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
33813,Homer,that mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
23016,Homer,but i was gonna score...
19047,Homer,"hmm. i bet this place sells illegal fireworks. just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
17707,Homer,"so here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and i won't ask for anything more. if that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. okay, deal. in gratitude, i present you this offering of cookies and milk. if you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. thy will be done."
16572,Homer,"no, we're forming a vigilante group."
20619,Homer,that old flanders place gives me the creeps.
41291,Homer,i'm doing the best with what i got! all you feed me is reality shows!
16564,Homer,i dunno. can you swing a sack of door knobs?
28487,Homer,that evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass smithers...
23674,Homer,"boy, that hansel sure can eat."
27871,Homer,"well, i'd better go. but before i do, marge, there's something i want to ask you."
16354,Homer,that's what i've been saying. we're all fine the way we are.
14747,Homer,okay.
33915,Homer,"yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate ."
29374,Homer,"oh, you'll win for sure. you and science go together like lenny and carl. the science is carl."
16843,Homer,"hey, what's up for today, neddie?"
18559,Homer,"eh, what are you gonna do?"
29455,Homer,"why did i ever have kids? i could have written symphonies, or been shakespeare."
14158,Homer,uh... all of them?
18817,Homer,for knocking mr. burns out a third story window.
34088,Homer,again!

25017,Homer,"chief, i'd like to scare my son straight. could i show him a jail cell?"
24097,Homer,hello? mailman?
40386,Homer,"i'm game if you are, flanders."
31677,Homer,"son, one day you're going to be a great father."
36054,Homer,not you! him!
32973,Homer,"now, are you gonna come quietly, or do i have to..."
36250,Homer,"hey, i've gotta tell ya, i'm miserable there. i'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"
38819,Homer,"what if i left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?"
39806,Homer,"well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!"
27513,Homer,"ooh, you coughed up some dry wall."
14129,Homer,"hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
25238,Homer,and i'll have the beef wellington.
39343,Homer,"wow! what are you readin' there? comic books? uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?"
18175,Homer,"oh, i always wanted to be a teamster. so lazy and surly. mind if i relax next to you?"
34115,Homer,"did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
19270,Homer,"c'mon, boy. give your old man a little credit."
28999,Homer,you monsters! you followed us!
18134,Homer,"oh, great. now i'm upside-down."
30989,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll see to it you fundamentalist christians live to take over all america by the twenty-first century!"
32743,Homer,well wonder no more!
29934,Homer,the awesome power of the human mind.
30040,Homer,marge. bart. maggie. santa's little helper. lisa!
16643,Homer,"come on, lisa. say something funny."
25740,Homer,"oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
27373,Homer,my name is homer simpson. and i desperately need your help.
33911,Homer,"i don't know if i can. i'm a yo-yo dieter: ""yo, hot dog man!"" ""yo, peanuts!"" why aren't you laughing? don't you know what ""yo"" means?"
16781,Homer,why am i such a loser? why?
14930,Homer,you know i would never do anything to hurt your feelings. good night.
33177,Homer,"no, this is about you. edna wants to break up."
18378,Homer,"oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
20835,Homer,yeah. he's my favorite fictional character.
33160,Homer,help! fat man hanging from a tree!
35117,Homer,"yes, that's exactly it!"
27621,Homer,that was awesome!
14395,Homer,"boy, i know you're gonna like your present."
35526,Homer,completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...
18997,Homer,"i don't think i have a choice, marge."
21017,Homer,"well, guys, i won't be seeing you for a while."
14333,Homer,"whoo hoo! denver, yeah!"
39501,Homer,arrrgh!
19662,Homer,i like him!
18229,Homer,run for your life!... ... boy!
37200,Homer,one thousand dollars!
22997,Homer,who told you?
35634,Homer,you're mean!
35688,Homer,i guess fun dad is a foodie now!
35992,Homer,let me just download the complete works of shakespeare.
39311,Homer,hmmmm. how could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
28009,Homer,black power! black power!
36831,Homer,"you have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt..."
39662,Homer,"no. this is a trap. it's going to catch us our dinner. come on, boy."
25898,Homer,moe? what the?...
41454,Homer,"half-day, eh?"
20214,Homer,"you lose, michelangelo's david. who's next?"
29044,Homer,"watch it, one more step. welcome to my secret lair."
16739,Homer,"i'll field this one. the only danger is if they send us to that terrible planet of the apes. ...wait a minute, statue of liberty... that was our planet. you maniacs! you blew it up! damn you! damn you all to hell."
29852,Homer,"don't worry, marge -- hot wheels to the rescue!"
16008,Homer,it's probably the person you least suspect!
28131,Homer,"oh my god, i'm late for work."
17865,Homer,my house is on fire! woo hoo! insurance to the rescue.
24439,Homer,talking while the tv's on can't be good for you.
38074,Homer,"i'm eating the food of the future. beep, boop. what is... love? boop, beep, boop."
21907,Homer,fine. i guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
18086,Homer,". fooled you flanders. made you think your family was dead. didja get it? they're not, though."
18332,Homer,i'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... i'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... i'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! i don't know...
28005,Homer,can i get a phone that plays the mexican hat dance?
31461,Homer,"if you won't talk to me, i'll send in polaroids to show you how sad i am that i let you down."
16679,Homer,well you deserve it. all these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
28729,Homer,nope.
34390,Homer,"flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. but the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
37896,Homer,"bless you, boy. that was the greatest thing i've seen on a computer that i can talk about with you in the room. how did you know how to do that?"
38804,Homer,gimme another one.
19021,Homer,what's with all the questions?
18691,Homer,"you should've held out longer, boy."
13326,Homer,i promised i wouldn't eat? never! you lie!
28636,Homer,"let's see... i'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. and mega-size it, please."
19245,Homer,we've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. hel-lo!
25419,Homer,"and i gave that man directions, even though i didn't know the way. 'cause that's the kind of guy i am this week."
31414,Homer,max told you about me?
41430,Homer,"okay guys, let's regroup. we'll come back with more homers and start fresh in the morning."
22374,Homer,"wally, i'd be lying if i said i hadn't."
34550,Homer,we'll have to eat thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
38073,Homer,because it's his home forever.
17151,Homer,no!
21011,Homer,"well, i think i can make it out. ""are you a homosex..."""
25700,Homer,christ be with you.
17177,Homer,"well, this is my floor."
34995,Homer,ayyyy!
18249,Homer,"you know what you should serve, marge? more of these lamb chops. these are the best ever."
13861,Homer,"hurry, moe, hurry! i've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
30992,Homer,i do!
17223,Homer,"now remember, we're in the itchy lot."
31385,Homer,"there once was a rapping tomato / that's right, i said rapping tomato / he rapped all day / from april to may / and also, guess what, it was me."
40995,Homer,"you mean, if i want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
26106,Homer,zing! what's a skeletor?
27260,Homer,that lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
34696,Homer,"wow, marge. i can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar."
40839,Homer,that's right. sixty-eight channels. mtv for the kids. vh-1 for us. sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!
38659,Homer,a boxing glove!
18772,Homer,"uh, mr. smithers? i don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
22963,Homer,"do you really think you can capture the loch ness monster? i mean, he's eluded leonard nimoy and peter graves."
15634,Homer,mmm... grapefruit.
30777,Homer,"mr. stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if i whipped up public interest for them?"
37397,Homer,...so i stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
29531,Homer,"lenny, can i move you from wednesday at noon to sunday at six?"
36134,Homer,what the--
31409,Homer,ice cream man! wait!
37771,Homer,"oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
38209,Homer,"the trick is, wait several weeks."
14799,Homer,chocolate...
27333,Homer,"oh, god!"
30301,Homer,you're needed at home!
22225,Homer,"well, of course a-- who are you?"
16838,Homer,whatcha doin'?
13511,Homer,"hey, c'mon, joey! do you have to twist my arm?"
26506,Homer,stupid king of troy. i think i speak for all the greeks when i say this war has gone on for too long.
34774,Homer,fine. i'm going for a walk.
31380,Homer,"oooh, moe's a poet! he has a soul! flutter your wings! it's teatime in buttercup junction!"
32517,Homer,"a doctor, huh?"
38497,Homer,you can still lick it!
16321,Homer,there we go.
27347,Homer,i love that little shill. let's get her that diary.
15213,Homer,"and that's good! but, here's the bad part... uh... uh... ooh, look at that headline: ""canada to hold referendum."" sorry marge, can't talk now."
28286,Homer,i wish i'd married a businessman. then i'd have nice things.
33030,Homer,"so, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
31263,Homer,what are struts?
39002,Homer,"not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!"
20831,Homer,now i can show all of you what i've come to realize. the reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! he's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
31727,Homer,he was a great dad! every year he got so mad when santa didn't bring me presents.
40039,Homer,hitler.
26325,Homer,i'm gonna kill you!
29942,Homer,at what time?
26792,Homer,it's where i got this!
37041,Homer,woo hoo!
40268,Homer,"i thank you. you're too kind. glad you enjoyed it, but i can't take all the credit. the batter did his part, too."
38998,Homer,"uh, pittsburgh thirty-five, dallas thirty-one!"
35800,Homer,you don't understand me. only she understands me.
26346,Homer,"spill it, moneybags."
18851,Homer,i'm sorry. i guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
15613,Homer,"it's that record club. the first nine were only a penny. then they jacked up the price! it's not fair, it's not fair i tells ya."
19479,Homer,"well what about you, lenny?"
15054,Homer,"uh, was your second wish to be entered in the little miss springfield pageant?"
20648,Homer,"aw, that's my girl. i love you, marjorie."
30408,Homer,"resident... occupant... i can't open these. ooh, a traffic ticket!"
27779,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. thank you for... huh?"
29151,Homer,"because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. and this time i want it tight!"
38217,Homer,oh yeah. that's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
40710,Homer,the good book...
18245,Homer,"so, ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
23219,Homer,hmm. my career has kinda lost momentum...
13780,Homer,"oooh, right next to the boss. eh, he'll never know who did it."
32795,Homer,i told her not to go into one of those.
29636,Homer,you handsome devil. someday they'll let you and me get married! can you imagine the children?
21524,Homer,"uh-uh, think. is that what alex would say?"
34868,Homer,"yeah, i've done all i can do in that medium."
32099,Homer,drunk!
15244,Homer,"...all you can eat, ha!"
35696,Homer,"east oak street, is that it?"
15048,Homer,i need help.
29484,Homer,what do i do?
39637,Homer,"yes sir! this is a real adventure. why, i bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this."
23473,Homer,"i'm only one man, marge."
34492,Homer,impressive.
17771,Homer,"i'm terribly sorry. flanders is the only useless person here. if anyone dies, it should be him. i'm sorry. please forgive me. so let's kick flanders out. sorry."
37154,Homer,i'm on it.
38190,Homer,that's why she'll believe it.
29086,Homer,"she was the prettiest girl i'd ever seen. uh... until i met your mother, who made that girl look like a godzilla made of garbage."
37996,Homer,"look, honey, i know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. isn't that right, glasses?"
29263,Homer,i was thinking of chicken wings.
14548,Homer,and here it is.
23849,Homer,so much.
39488,Homer,would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely motorola?
34041,Homer,"honey, i know it's been a rough couple of weeks. but i booked us a night this saturday, at a very romantic hotel."
21000,Homer,"gentlemen, there's only one solution. we place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
18473,Homer,"first, it wasn't 25 years. it was 27 years. and second, she had a very good reason."
22287,Homer,"hello, big maggie."
32844,Homer,"yeah? no kidding? well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun."
18155,Homer,my tool shed! oh dad!
41258,Homer,think unsexy thoughts. think unsexy thoughts! think unsexy thoughts!
26999,Homer,"it's okay, boy. you'll be shooting angels in heaven."
37485,Homer,"sorry, carl. it's world war ii all over again -- america kicks iceland's ass."
38346,Homer,"open your stance a little, there. yeah, that's it. do your worst, kids!"
32784,Homer,this is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital.
39770,Homer,"uh, no, i don't mind."
21032,Homer,ulll.....
19626,Homer,no. there's no way out.
16984,Homer,"so ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the springfield palace hotel."
25295,Homer,"with that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
34334,Homer,i was too! the words were in my brain!
34733,Homer,"yeah, the luck lasts longer! thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!"
20806,Homer,"batman! / i mean, leader! i love the leader!"
14361,Homer,fifty big ones!
15139,Homer,"dad, you and your stories... ""bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
24801,Homer,am i glad to see you guys. you gotta call...
18808,Homer,you're on.
37255,Homer,"marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" but don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. so, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
18088,Homer,that's why it was so funny. but they're not.
34873,Homer,"did i? anyway, the bloody hangman set to his gory work. bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
24050,Homer,"oh, how rude of me. my name is..."
15446,Homer,no! remember your hippopotamus oath.
15240,Homer,"aye, aye captain! marge, we're going to that restaurant."
34836,Homer,"it may not be a boy. it could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the santa fe lifestyle. just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
18721,Homer,"yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."
23869,Homer,that had nothing to do with the bucket.
13655,Homer,that was a joke?
34890,Homer,"marge, listen to the man -- he pays bart's salary."
24885,Homer,nooo!
35249,Homer,way down here?
17213,Homer,no.
26393,Homer,i'm bored. heyyy... a fair!
37022,Homer,"good riddance. when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, i really lost interest."
37569,Homer,"i'll kill you, you son of a--"
25347,Homer,courtesy of pete sampras.
40756,Homer,far out!
26312,Homer,nicely done.
16067,Homer,"no, ma'am."
18700,Homer,"oh, this game could mean big things for me, marge. if i beat mr. burns, i mean really wallop him bad... i'm sure to get that big raise i've been gunning for."
20688,Homer,"ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?"
27312,Homer,don't be so sure. i've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
17066,Homer,"no, wait! uh, uh, wait!... i, yes! i do have a story about two other young marrieds."
32712,Homer,"it's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
24174,Homer,"and lo, what a wondrous message it is:"
19867,Homer,"i can explain, marge! please let me explain! oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
16731,Homer,make it stop!
37289,Homer,it's amazing how much exercise i've gotten from those words.
24171,Homer,"well, i'm not not licking toads... well, it's time to get to work. humanitarian homer simpson, over and out."
16834,Homer,they're fine.
21755,Homer,"screw this. hang on, everyone. we're takin' the ol' simpson shortcut."
39436,Homer,"why you, listen to me you..."
36050,Homer,"soda, eh?"
33422,Homer,now let's get something to eat.
40493,Homer,"boy, i've tried ordering you, i've tried punishing you, and god help me, i even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
35381,Homer,you did this?! with your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
33658,Homer,"this is no time to pat the bunny, maggie. daddy's watching a very important mid-atlantic hockey league conference semi-final do-over game."
22679,Homer,"c'mon, everybody, we're going to the slaughterhouse!"
18478,Homer,"oh, come on, mom. we use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
18029,Homer,do you have a better idea?
32820,Homer,"son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--"
31012,Homer,which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
24815,Homer,you're right. it's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
18292,Homer,get what?
33377,Homer,"wait a second. if i'd been class president like i was supposed to, i'd be the one with the big mansion and the color tvs and the hot wife!"
31793,Homer,kids. they always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
34303,Homer,"you still reading that thing? i'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. ever!"
24448,Homer,much better.
27639,Homer,sara sloane? the movie star?
16776,Homer,get tickets. must get tickets. find phone. yes!
32604,Homer,"no, this is a moment i want to remember."
16946,Homer,boo!
13533,Homer,print name?
34728,Homer,i believe this stranger!
15721,Homer,does the lord count as a person?
13210,Homer,squeaky! squeaky!
22237,Homer,"are you sure? oh, rats. no offense, sweetie."
38891,Homer,why are they dancing? shouldn't they be making weapons?
32198,Homer,"excuse me, ""film."""
20606,Homer,"gee, that picture makes your butt look big."
15142,Homer,"bart, don't tell your mother, but i brought you some pizza."
36832,Homer,no one would ever think you're a lame old man.
30919,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
22509,Homer,wouldn't you like to know?
35442,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
21154,Homer,"mr. burns, i think we can trust the president of cuba."
34793,Homer,looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
21189,Homer,nuh-uh. it isn't filled until it's spilled.
23877,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
20478,Homer,"ooo, let's see what she wrote!"
21834,Homer,"i'm looking at you, horshak."
22304,Homer,yeah! / you're only here 'cause marge forgot her pill.
36195,Homer,"uh, marge, this is my friend keggy..."
28143,Homer,"get your own family, moe."
15598,Homer,i'm on my way!
39063,Homer,woo hoo!
23484,Homer,"from the producers of ""waiting to exhale."""
32241,Homer,you know you make me wanna

34289,Homer,"but this time, on ice!"
32860,Homer,"one, two, three... another chute?!"
40766,Homer,ignoramus. it means i'm stupid! doesn't it?
16730,Homer,"no, the batteries!"
16742,Homer,less shame?
18586,Homer,the hardest shot in bowling. it was all up to me.
17283,Homer,urge to kill rising.
13429,Homer,are you?
34725,Homer,"oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- wiggum's making his move!"
37152,Homer,"finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles."
41407,Homer,another me? you can watch the kids.
36452,Homer,"i'll take you with me, old man!"
27040,Homer,oh.
19981,Homer,y-y-y-yes.

30202,Homer,"i didn't need that new fact! now i forgot who won bud bowl eight. boy, i'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
25135,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, i give you your moron!"

19226,Homer,why? it's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
22332,Homer,c'mon!...
34331,Homer,"that was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
35930,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. i think i know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy."
32483,Homer,"battery, battery, battery!"
39735,Homer,my birthday?
25026,Homer,"anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. let's hit the hay."
40998,Homer,"okay, we're watching."
36263,Homer,what happened to you guys? you used to be cool.
15857,Homer,you handsome devil.
26291,Homer,that's what i told lisa!
21532,Homer,"oh, i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. i've been muscled out of everything i've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
17321,Homer,"we can spare it, marge. we've been blessed."
35805,Homer,"that's great, let me run the numbers because i really want the simpson account. and give these cigars to your children."
37691,Homer,i'm tired of livin' once.
14007,Homer,bart!... i'm gonna help you build that racer.
27450,Homer,"kids, i'll go find your mother."
40994,Homer,even pork chops?
16377,Homer,bart!!!! mmm... apple.
36808,Homer,guess it must've been the person who knew i needed hope most of all.
14830,Homer,don't i get some kind of trophy? at a big award ceremony?
34591,Homer,i'll have to check it out sometime.
37892,Homer,you're shushing me! this guy's on his cell phone! she's texting! he's sexting! and that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
33624,Homer,"marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. so -- will you marry me -- in style?"
38061,Homer,"more like ""at your six-pack,"" am i right? it's okay if you need to take a little nap."
38333,Homer,"it's not exactly fun and games for me either, marge."
23994,Homer,"mmm, that's terrific, duncan. you're ten for ten. now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the nfl."
39485,Homer,that's it? that's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
20942,Homer,"hurry, moe. at three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. the exercise yard!"
35467,Homer,"whoa! flanders, this chick does not get our thing!"
26333,Homer,listen to all that revving!
22711,Homer,"great. i'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. and then when the paperwork is done, i'll make gwenn my wife."
35122,Homer,i do keep it together.
33120,Homer,here we are.
25454,Homer,but homer simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... hey!
21860,Homer,"in closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. and when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. thank you, your honor."
23854,Homer,make me.
13152,Homer,"ooh, a switchblade. i see the switch, but where's the blade?"
19716,Homer,"put a sock in it, roy."
37732,Homer,oh yeah. great. um... do i drop you at the curb or do i have to park and walk you in?
36820,Homer,"okay, where did you get these donuts?"
29030,Homer,"aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down."
27829,Homer,"""dear homer, i can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""
21631,Homer,what?
37548,Homer,"you guys are the best. i just want you to know when i'm holding marge in my arms tonight, i'll be thinking of all of you."
25684,Homer,she's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? can they do that?
28185,Homer,"the nobel prize! finally. so, uh it's for what, my whole deal?"
19356,Homer,"telemarketing, eh?"
27147,Homer,"hey, flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!"
23752,Homer,"hey, why is this door locked?"
34425,Homer,"chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?"
20594,Homer,you're the boss.
13821,Homer,now you're talkin'!
29888,Homer,"some day that bowl will overflow, and i'll be there."
17474,Homer,all right! that's it. we're goin' home. i'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
39319,Homer,"that's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. hey, look at this! ""i am a weiner."" he sure is!"
15699,Homer,then to the duff brewery.
36501,Homer,parenting. it's the one job you always know you're doing right.
18940,Homer,uh... partial credit.
28306,Homer,i still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
34689,Homer,"well, since moe's is closed again, i thought i'd help you cook dinner."
36730,Homer,are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
20064,Homer,"no... candy! sweet, sweet candy."
33053,Homer,"you better settle down, boy, or i'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera..."
20335,Homer,"pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. i tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
29237,Homer,"marge, i don't want to buy this house. i'd have to live next door to myself."
18089,Homer,"""the girls of the internet."" ooh, i'd go on line with them any day."
32037,Homer,why the cemetery? i wondered. but my dreams were too strong.
39835,Homer,"look, i'm not drinking out of the carton. come on, marge. please forgive me? i'm sorry. i'm so sorry."
15663,Homer,kick him in the ribs...
28654,Homer,maybe on planet zoozoo.
22115,Homer,"bart, no!"
13286,Homer,chores? me need clone.
23503,Homer,"aw, thanks honey."
17471,Homer,"dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? maybe i could've been something more than i am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
28104,Homer,"uh, i'm giving it back to the earth."
17572,Homer,i saved your life. that egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
20990,Homer,"then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. but we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
21659,Homer,"mail call! gather 'round, everyone!"
25929,Homer,"hey, marge, surf's up!"
14196,Homer,but it gives me time to think.
38369,Homer,fat tony?
26378,Homer,what did carl think?
29755,Homer,woo hoo! free gas!
28405,Homer,"rub a dub dub, i'm washin' the blub."
37371,Homer,deacon? is that like one of those weird catholic priest things?
40419,Homer,"hi, patty. hi, selma."
30413,Homer,where's my bucket?
35667,Homer,"okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a saturday surprise dad day."
32565,Homer,bring it on.
32592,Homer,"so marge wasn't cheating on me, i never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. thank god i figured it out before i did anything stupid."
21653,Homer,"we're not rivals. we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. i can't destroy your work, my friend."
36049,Homer,i mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
18214,Homer,"oh, there's my sweet little maggie."
19085,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, sir, and i'm gonna get you back to washington before it's too late!"
25643,Homer,it's too late.
40805,Homer,"thanks, mr. b."
34296,Homer,"listen, lisa. you're gonna find more than you bargained for. if i were you, i wouldn't dig into the past. i lived in some of that past, and i got out for a reason."
38766,Homer,you know what? apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. we're gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left.
22727,Homer,"well, i'm not really a trucker, so i don't talk to the rep that often."
18387,Homer,check core temperature? yes-slash-no. yes.
37090,Homer,"oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but i'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what i'm saying..."
41461,Homer,they're too big to fail.
28297,Homer,over my dead body!
36463,Homer,i sure envy him.
22416,Homer,who's jeremy piven?
25633,Homer,"thanks, moe."
31082,Homer,at least she's found someone who can make her happy.
20504,Homer,"hey, dad. i've come to spend some time with my favorite father."
32948,Homer,"uh, we'll stick with the coins."
35182,Homer,"thank you for the tour of your factory, mister wonka."
41323,Homer,"greetings, friend. do you wish to look as..."
24075,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i don't.
29042,Homer,"pie man is not your father, little girl. i... murdered your father."
30082,Homer,"marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
40098,Homer,"karl, you saved me. why?"
39200,Homer,we're late.
13823,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. we're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
15845,Homer,"why, you little --"
39744,Homer,too exciting.
29269,Homer,stupid bart. bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
36706,Homer,"when i prayed for this concert to be over, i didn't mean like this!"
38914,Homer,for the first time i actually had to do my job.
13947,Homer,mmm... salty.
21722,Homer,idiot?! why you... little...
40079,Homer,do any of these suits do that?
27047,Homer,"so long, jerks."
40061,Homer,"daddy's home, sugar!"
31587,Homer,then when all seemed lost...
25019,Homer,colgate cavity patrol?
38298,Homer,"don't worry. i won't embarrass you. i will put my napkin in my lap. i will use the utensils provided for me. and if our food is slow in coming i will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the earl of yarborough."
21199,Homer,"hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men."
21224,Homer,you want to know what i think?
39143,Homer,"okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
22776,Homer,"this is my fault. i shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""applegate"" thing."
41234,Homer,don't say revenge. don't say revenge.
26271,Homer,part of me knew that.
14181,Homer,"yeah, and i have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating i always get."
40091,Homer,"can do, sir."
20322,Homer,"i don't have to be careful, i got a gun."
36886,Homer,hold down the fort?! with my bad back?!
40403,Homer,ow.
16050,Homer,so you want me to go to college?
14532,Homer,p.s. -- i am gay.
13692,Homer,"um, mr. burns..."
16925,Homer,huh?
37985,Homer,reality!
18142,Homer,"i hate my job. i mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
19965,Homer,yeah. we're gonna get rid of the christmas tree. it's starting to turn brown.
34304,Homer,i got an idea: you can march to selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
31802,Homer,"first amendment rules, privacy drools!"
28123,Homer,flower power my ass.
29239,Homer,"oh c'mon, marge. it's not fair to compare us to an american household."
40661,Homer,"hey, flanders, could i borrow your camcorder?"
29348,Homer,i wouldn't say that.
35836,Homer,"now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
30645,Homer,can i be the phantom of the opera?
21004,Homer,fired. i can't believe it.
21389,Homer,i am at work. this is what i do.
18842,Homer,okay.
16063,Homer,i hate that lousy dean!
35543,Homer,washin' out the dog poo / sure beats pickin' it up / flanders' driveway is my goal...
40344,Homer,dear neighbor... 
20254,Homer,oh my god. everyone's gone! little bart...
24902,Homer,"help, i'm being kidnapped!"
39866,Homer,marge! marge! marge! get the door.
40774,Homer,"well, a... you see the problem is, you don't know me. i have references. just ask coach flanagan, and ask mr. seckofsky and barney gumbel."
13363,Homer,"sorry, reverend."
30926,Homer,mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie!
40310,Homer,"i was graceful. i was witty. brother, i was somethin'."
32287,Homer,"guess what, boy. last night i towed your principal's car."
14115,Homer,i own stock?
40042,Homer,i was right.
31256,Homer,"yeah, i hear it too. maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""we will, we will rock you..."""
20536,Homer,"""up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" da-da-da-da-da."
41548,Homer,slam!
36897,Homer,you're back!
17593,Homer,what?
17203,Homer,tv town! hammock land!
18013,Homer,"hmm, i guess bart's not to blame. he's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and i've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
18168,Homer,which one were you? the ugly one?
23289,Homer,why you little...
16342,Homer,"oh marge, you and i are fine now. who needs brad goodman?"
40878,Homer,"it's coming down. my foot is, that's it, marge. it's coming down. the cable stays. the foot has spoken."
18917,Homer,"woo-hoo! a perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
31141,Homer,buck mitchell!
18869,Homer,ummm... do you have a crush on anyone?
36132,Homer,"hey bart, check this out."
39608,Homer,"hey, how much is it?"
21670,Homer,hey!
19267,Homer,"'preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. and i gotta live with him."
34060,Homer,you wouldn't dare!
25535,Homer,hurry up. i can't stand here jabbing you all day.
15291,Homer,"eh, i can't afford it."
23465,Homer,you watch me. i'll grow something out there.
32728,Homer,pudding power activate!
19045,Homer,"hey, he looks just like you, poindexter!"
35959,Homer,"folks, because i love democracy so much, i command you to vote for this man whom i alone have selected as your next president:"
37291,Homer,her husband's gonna be there too.
31603,Homer,are you gonna torture me?
36102,Homer,"wait one sec, marge. before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
20823,Homer,these lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. oh! a lima bean that looks just like the leader! i'll put it with the others.
37469,Homer,i thought it was superman's superman-cave.
28195,Homer,"yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! like getting the rat out of maggie's room!"
14414,Homer,"don't worry, moe. i'm not bettin'."
35823,Homer,"thanks. now if you'll excuse me, i don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old simpson family fun."
39651,Homer,"through here, boy. back to civilization."
35082,Homer,oh yeah? i'll show you.
16438,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
39632,Homer,what do you think? should we stop here?
19715,Homer,"you're right, marge! it's not my fault! i'm not gonna let 'em treat poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
39336,Homer,"i'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? sort of a spare in case bart's brain blows up."
33219,Homer,she's gone. can you drive me home? i'm a little drunk.
30508,Homer,how you doin'? so... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?
27297,Homer,very well. i am gone!
28139,Homer,i recorded that for private use!
34532,Homer,months?
40591,Homer,we have meatloaf!
19315,Homer,thanks for introducing me.
28651,Homer,i'll do it!
26644,Homer,you just said it!
41279,Homer,i've already gone this far... i wonder what my life would be like if i robbed the kwik-e- mart?
21310,Homer,"gym? what's a ""gym?"""
26652,Homer,"as soon as i graduate, i am so outta here."
18308,Homer,you are?
21375,Homer,museum? i don't like the sound of that. what did your mother say?
27155,Homer,homicidal robots... so like us.
35718,Homer,i've waited my whole life to hear that!
32453,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. i know just what it'll take to hang onto marge."
35100,Homer,"well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the tv."
15641,Homer,"i love you too, pepsi."
24055,Homer,"hey, t-shirt- t-shirt-t-shirt!"
19514,Homer,"please, don't hurt me!"
22878,Homer,marge! why does art hate me? i never did anything to art.
27965,Homer,flames? searing pain? a black cat? i must be in heaven.
41373,Homer,she'll forgive me...
40973,Homer,by any chance does the h stand for herbert?
27975,Homer,why you little...!
16934,Homer,woo hoo! what do i get?
30709,Homer,but how?
37869,Homer,"that's great, sweetie. after all that time and hard work, i'll have... radishes?! it's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! radishes. nothing but radishes."
16651,Homer,what kind of catchphrase is that?
38962,Homer,"'cause if i'm sick, i get to stay home and make s'mores. all i need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
37501,Homer,is this everyone?
32596,Homer,what plan?
36325,Homer,stranded? what's that?
22901,Homer,"shut up, shut up, shut up!"
14506,Homer,aye-aye! admiral butthead.
21465,Homer,"nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
33840,Homer,you make words into dudes.
16344,Homer,"i just thought i'd remind everybody. after all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
35632,Homer,am i early?
16671,Homer,is he still out there?
33503,Homer,it was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
23071,Homer,"oh, of course. you're right. you know, i read about a shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... run, bart!"
33358,Homer,please! you've gotta have some secret agony! i bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
36469,Homer,"great, we'll take care of everything. we'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners."
32942,Homer,"well then, mom, this was for you."
17553,Homer,did you talk about me in therapy today?
32626,Homer,i can't stand to see a grown burger cry. we must rebuild fast food boulevard!
18287,Homer,nuts!
14836,Homer,pfft! heavyweight championship. there's like three of those. that couch was one of a kind.
16905,Homer,"what do you mean? it's an elephant, isn't it?"
30728,Homer,it's no use.
18455,Homer,here lies... walt whitman?!!
15545,Homer,"stick your head out the window, boy. it's the greatest!"
21354,Homer,"i did it! i made it all the way to... aw, crap!"
37389,Homer,"calm yourselves! in times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... reverend hooper."
13499,Homer,"now bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. just give me some kind of signal."
27924,Homer,"coming, sweetie!"
34894,Homer,i got the idea from a show where people regret these.
26935,Homer,"ooh, ooh! here's my commercial!"
30636,Homer,"i love you, marge."

30393,Homer,"i just got fired. better check the ""want ads."""
19792,Homer,"oh, she'd never go. she's a vegetarian."
39091,Homer,"i'm so sorry i threw you across the room and called you a liar. when you told me i was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. it was a poem you were writing about my potential. i'm gonna start celebrating my size and i need you with me as a partner. now if you'll excuse me, i need to talk to the broken porch swing."
16202,Homer,"not likely. heh, heh."
37096,Homer,check mate.
24108,Homer,"hey, what the hell's going on?!"
36893,Homer,move this here. tap. mill! mill! barn! silo! tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! brothel. parsonage! theater in the round! and... hay pile...
13900,Homer,wow!
24642,Homer,"thank you, marge. now, let's see how olde snobfield does without electricity."
30673,Homer,the only tummy ache is in my head. i can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
36578,Homer,is there any other deal that you can accept?
22393,Homer,take it or leave it... carl.
29576,Homer,"you did it on the straight, got your dad's permission / but your mom dropped a bomb, so i flipped my position"
18510,Homer,goodnight.
39442,Homer,"where are you, kids?"
13892,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah."
28527,Homer,good-lookin' group.
15176,Homer,but then i won't be watching tv. you can see the bind i'm in.
32116,Homer,think positive. think positive.
33873,Homer,"well, i may be playing a tree but at least i'm getting my face out there."
19225,Homer,"...and larry and i have so much in common, marge, way more than you and me. if i could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be larry!"
20808,Homer,"come again, marge?"
31489,Homer,"oh, of course. whatever you say, sweetie. nighty-night."
35444,Homer,if i tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? don't drink it!
31491,Homer,"lady, you're nice, but i'm married."
35145,Homer,observe.
33207,Homer,"right, right. but will it happen this time?"
29450,Homer,"now remember to eat smart, people. go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with that cheap stuff."
34486,Homer,oh yeah -- sorry i was such a jerk about it.
37081,Homer,"wow. i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family, but now i see there's another."
20961,Homer,that makes 22 to 16.
26222,Homer,"you know, there are only so many times i can say i'm sorry and still mean it!"
33301,Homer,"hold still, sweetie. daddy will kill it. and this time no screw-ups."
21579,Homer,"no, not this one. ""the smugglers of pirate cove."" it's about pirates."
29187,Homer,"well, that loser milhouse has always had a thing for her. don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
38302,Homer,"maggie, help me with this shirt."
39970,Homer,"actually, the simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family."
41048,Homer,"oh, are you? well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard."
37933,Homer,"one family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
34565,Homer,"oh lisa, i'm sorry. i tried my best. i know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect."
25001,Homer,"so what's the pitch, old man?"
37269,Homer,"fear not, people. i will lead you safely across."
34069,Homer,"i hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!"
34998,Homer,ohhhh.
40140,Homer,"quiet, lisa. you're scaring your mother."
19192,Homer,never.
29688,Homer,"and this is marge, our surprisingly hot nanny."
35063,Homer,why you little!!!
39178,Homer,how do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?

21357,Homer,"""last entry. i have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. worse still, that treacherous skunk abe simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
24040,Homer,bees!
37881,Homer,amazing grace / how loud i sing / to drown the spoilers out... shut up. shut up. shut up!
41102,Homer,"well, happy birthday, bea. she can come with us. hey, there's room for all your friends in the car."
26800,Homer,here you go. don't worry. i soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
30488,Homer,"kids, this is the holiest night of the year. tomorrow is father's day, and that makes tonight father's day eve."
39118,Homer,i need it now!
36385,Homer,"swiss cheese. marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
30143,Homer,"thanks, ned."
13494,Homer,"she's right. okay, think, homer. don't panic. they don't pick up the mail till noon. there's still time!"
29604,Homer,now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
23727,Homer,"hello, police? can you send a swat team to 742 evergreen ter..."
35915,Homer,"are you ready for irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""oh, that's a lovely touch! oh, such beautiful form!"" if we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, rudys, ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! ochocincos..."
19309,Homer,that's a door?
33402,Homer,"marge, the way i feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
17763,Homer,flanders! open up!
25052,Homer,i wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
28964,Homer,i'll right-side you!
37240,Homer,okay.
26806,Homer,i take a whiskey drink / i take a chocolate drink / and when i have to pee / i use the kitchen sink / i sing the song that reminds me i'm a urinating guy!
16658,Homer,ooh. rancid meat attack. stupid parasites. is there no way i can find justice?
39355,Homer,"can you still see the ball, bart?"
20906,Homer,stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
30472,Homer,"negatively, i assume."
18573,Homer,that longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
40521,Homer,there's peas in my fruit cobbler.
37710,Homer,that doesn't sound happy.
23633,Homer,"oh, current... too strong... i know! if i sink to the bottom i can run to the shore."
16770,Homer,"see because of me, now they have a warning."
35319,Homer,"honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, i booked us a couples massage."
26616,Homer,that is not a worm.
27111,Homer,can i have forty guest passes?
22334,Homer,"oh, c'mon!..."
33087,Homer,nobody shuts out my blather!
41393,Homer,i'm in charge of the tackle box!
32955,Homer,wait!
41506,Homer,"sing me my bedtime song, mom."
22360,Homer,i didn't ask for your life story. just give me the key.
28635,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty unreliable."
27764,Homer,i need a vacation.
37543,Homer,"marge, i threw my back out. can you please refill this prescription right away?"
32663,Homer,"with the nineties drawing to a close, and the sydney olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled..."
30264,Homer,"well, we'd better go eat that yogurt."
22981,Homer,i'm hot... so very hot...
29896,Homer,ray's not gonna like that.
34598,Homer,all right! all right!
37134,Homer,"i've told you a thousand times, call me homer!"
31251,Homer,"marge, giving me credit was your idea. now could you rub my butt? i sat on it so much it's a little sore."
27238,Homer,"you know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and maggie's in her cage..."
30184,Homer,after the party.
20770,Homer,my groove!
16499,Homer,"lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
15414,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!...
39890,Homer,you want to see where i work?
39387,Homer,not even close.
38682,Homer,"oh, thank you."
39144,Homer,"babysitting, eh? what do i know about kids?"
33634,Homer,"no matter what i do, marge yells at me. if she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
21092,Homer,"no, because... you see i went ahead and... year-wise, i was counting forward from the last previous..."
21342,Homer,wow! look how far i climbed! and i'm not even tired!
21694,Homer,enough bickering. i know how to settle this.
22154,Homer,aww...
22812,Homer,"all right, let's see..."
34632,Homer,"moe, my in-laws are coming. i need something strong enough that i forget i hate them, but not so strong that i tell them i love them."
40824,Homer,"marge, pour vous."
21936,Homer,"hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on."
36354,Homer,why don't you talk to mrs. steak?
21106,Homer,"no, please, i'll do anything!"
26143,Homer,"okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
13192,Homer,"is that the same jack from ""jack and the beanstalk""?"
26317,Homer,krackle was my favorite.
39166,Homer,there was beer involved. i have two daughters. and i've learned you have to let them go their own way. even the one-year-old.
36915,Homer,"a minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! torture, torture, torture!"
20943,Homer,"hurry up, moe, for the love of god! hurry up!"
20399,Homer,now wait a second. you doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
16336,Homer,and that sends me into a shame spiral.
32255,Homer,"yeah, it's paint."
20866,Homer,"that's where you're wrong, pal!"
14421,Homer,"please, please, please..."
25138,Homer,i've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
39897,Homer,"oh, that sector twelve."
17671,Homer,"yes! with my bills paid off, i can finally quit this lousy job."
35014,Homer,"wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! what kind of a world is this?"
18953,Homer,when are people going to learn -- democracy doesn't work!
16204,Homer,no.
25211,Homer,"okay, that should do it, moe."
40179,Homer,"though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --"
34099,Homer,there comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. do we eat dessert or do we make love?
23059,Homer,here's our room!
23224,Homer,"oh, this thing'll do anything. watch, i'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. no, wait... i'll make it say ""whatsa matta you?"" in turkish."
35651,Homer,no.
17028,Homer,"you think i don't want to? it's those tv networks, marge. they won't let me. one quality show after another. each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. if they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. but they won't, they won't let me live!"
31483,Homer,"okay sweetie, which book should i read?"
39992,Homer,"sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it."
40009,Homer,"uh... uh... no. are you sure this microphone works? uh, well, i wouldn't say i aided her. this is on, right? because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
17097,Homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
20785,Homer,"marge, marge, marge. remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
34458,Homer,please tell me they suffered.
35137,Homer,stupid kid. all you do is cost me money. money i could be wasting!
20446,Homer,"oh, really? do reeky players get the game ball?"
26057,Homer,ummm...
24337,Homer,no! you've gotta be sober for this. gimme that!
28292,Homer,no way! i'm saving for a speedboat!
40106,Homer,"dirty trick. okay, i'm not gonna kill you, but i'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. you ruined your father. you've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
22060,Homer,"well, yeah, i know..."
21516,Homer,not for you it isn't. you're in the grease business now.
14960,Homer,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
35812,Homer,"oh marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
16659,Homer,bor-ing.
17680,Homer,and now the final phase of my plan.
17119,Homer,woo hoo!
15715,Homer,"stupid bicycle. can't believe this. no good, rotten..."
30528,Homer,safety... safety... die for safety.
41383,Homer,"...mcnuggets. mmm, mcnuggets."
14383,Homer,"the usual, moe. a beer and a wad of bills."
24766,Homer,which i spent on a novelty horn.
29710,Homer,now let's see... which one is ling?
39246,Homer,"huh, when do we get paid?"
40407,Homer,it's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
36349,Homer,"thanks, marge. you ruined my show. now i'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
36052,Homer,fine.
26007,Homer,"okay, look cool."
17687,Homer,that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. we began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
24862,Homer,i can't. my web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
40945,Homer,not one word.
33319,Homer,"a simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
17176,Homer,ew.
27325,Homer,"goodnight, sleepyhead. do you have to poop?"
21643,Homer,"so, we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it! then i'll be an inventor!"
21012,Homer,but i'm not a h--
15266,Homer,"..._______ calendar? hmm... ooh, mostly mozart is in town."
21442,Homer,ahh!
41116,Homer,"pass the bug juice, dad."
39334,Homer,"nonsense, marge! frosty krusty flakes are what got him where he is today."
19232,Homer,pho-ny kid-napping...
17521,Homer,"and um, ah, i'll just uh get us started..."
21788,Homer,"oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... bethesda?"
29903,Homer,"all right, then you can just look at the portrait i painted of him."
25236,Homer,"c'mon, you're here to make friends."
38344,Homer,sure.
13773,Homer,"thanks, magic."
37672,Homer,you misheard that on purpose!
24246,Homer,yeah!
39524,Homer,"the code of the school yard, marge! the rules that teach a boy to be a man. let's see... don't tattle... always make fun of those different from you... never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... hmmm, what else... ?"
16979,Homer,all right.
30722,Homer,i don't tell your mother how much i've lost.
25015,Homer,"okay, thank you, sir."
39851,Homer,about a million girls.
16371,Homer,"well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
17326,Homer,"ooo, how convenient."
21178,Homer,and so on.
14771,Homer,"now, just meet me back here after the show."
19325,Homer,it can't just be sex. it can't.
41452,Homer,"hey, professor von hubba-hubba! wanna hop in my dune bug and erode some beach?"
22675,Homer,you better believe i did.
27506,Homer,"oh heavenly god, my son is plagued with homework. with your vast knowledge of the shore birds of maryland, i know you can help him."
40553,Homer,fifty percent?
22769,Homer,and you keep saying we need to do things together...
15652,Homer,"oh... it's you. so, you're looking well."
13423,Homer,no.
34024,Homer,can't we just all supervise ourselves?
15316,Homer,"well, john q driveway has our number. now we play the waiting game."
15871,Homer,yes!
14015,Homer,"thank you, bill cosby, you saved the simpsons!"
18024,Homer,"aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. he misses casual sex."
20775,Homer,"this, bart, is a crazy man."
32270,Homer,"man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
25771,Homer,i'll call.
31330,Homer,i have to marge. who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
20994,Homer,"""do the message! da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."""
33314,Homer,and she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
32133,Homer,"one small coffee, please. and a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it."
35945,Homer,what's this? some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
36731,Homer,i'll fix that later!
15967,Homer,"it'll be a long time before your mother gets back with the tire, so why don't i tell you more of the story? now that we had a name, the be sharps needed a hit. something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's..."
32224,Homer,"not me, they love me."
37842,Homer,the deed is done.
24365,Homer,"""in an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?"" marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"
33379,Homer,"that's exactly what it means. and dondelinger took that life away from me. and the taking of a life is murder. and the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but i'm gonna find dondelinger and tell him i know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
31715,Homer,"i'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
22598,Homer,"hey, that's super! see you later."
23553,Homer,are poo and ass taken?
33768,Homer,i did it! i helped my son! helicopter homer away!
15084,Homer,that's good.
25234,Homer,"now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. and moe's is the friendliest place in the rum district."
15673,Homer,"forget it, pal!"
39583,Homer,"no, me! no, me!"
31682,Homer,eh?
17516,Homer,i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
26363,Homer,"oh god, you're right. i've gotta get her back before it's too late."
37832,Homer,come on.
30046,Homer,lisa.
22042,Homer,"i love you, dad."
19840,Homer,"oh, come on marge, relax! lisa's in charge. she's the responsible one."
25485,Homer,you...you really scared us.
23766,Homer,"perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."
41500,Homer,"marge, please, i'm busy."
26891,Homer,"so hot, so sticky..."
27335,Homer,i wouldn't have it any other way.
38733,Homer,music! beautiful music!
32050,Homer,"oh my god, this is amazing! wait, i'm gonna be driving. i'll go for the cup."
14586,Homer,"look, i didn't steal that copper wire. i just thought they were throwing it out. here, take it."
32293,Homer,what? i'm still in springfield.
21373,Homer,hello?
24706,Homer,"well, i won't lie. fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. but i wouldn't trade it for anything. except for some mag wheels. oh, man, that would be sweet."
26423,Homer,"listen to me, son. no one loves a quitter. so you go over there and you win her back."
19672,Homer,come on -- isn't he the guy i bowl with? the black guy?
14717,Homer,no!
24822,Homer,what? lemme see that.
36780,Homer,"sweetie, in the future all you'll need is this."
13629,Homer,"ooh! i love your magazine. my favorite section is ""how to increase your word power."" that thing is really, really, really good."
16439,Homer,that's unsexy.
34103,Homer,"ooo, look! ""congress of the crow!"""
20311,Homer,"oh, but i want to do some rioting."
27076,Homer,omigod! omigod! omigod! it's mick jagger and keith richards...

38224,Homer,"sure, why not?"
24383,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
13929,Homer,"one scratch-for-cash, please."
39876,Homer,"i'm gonna miss you, son. and listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. i guess what i'm saying is, don't mess up france the way you messed up your room."
27133,Homer,"what am i, the lost and found?"
16356,Homer,"ah, mcgarnigal. eases the pain."
33880,Homer,"well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks."
13959,Homer,you did?
32584,Homer,"wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then i'm not gonna do it."
37321,Homer,where can i find a better voice-activated search machine?
30491,Homer,is there a super bowl bunny?
30437,Homer,you wanted to believe the lie!
34654,Homer,"oh marge, you not leaving with moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
23210,Homer,"yeah, and i'm a size four."
39865,Homer,"and maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup."
35525,Homer,men's room? oh my god! we're completing each other's...
24124,Homer,"yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."
32296,Homer,you... let... go...
18648,Homer,hey! my taxes paid for that horn!
14662,Homer,"ah, this movie's too complicated... hey, the floor's sticky..."
37657,Homer,"you're rejecting me? but i'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
29085,Homer,i couldn't believe my eye.
17949,Homer,"but, i'm still hungry."
19902,Homer,"to alcohol! the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
30241,Homer,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.

27714,Homer,god yes!
20135,Homer,it's gonna be dark soon. i'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
39373,Homer,i'm no supervising technician. i'm a technical supervisor. i've never done anything worthwhile in my life. i'm a big worthless nothing.
37524,Homer,she won't see it like this. i'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
14530,Homer,"i may hold you to that, marge."
23590,Homer,"woo hoo! first stop, maude flanders."
39850,Homer,ahhhhhh!
31685,Homer,"now that i'm super-wealthy, i can buy them whatever their hearts desire. that's why rich kids turn out so well."
41530,Homer,"i thought you were telling me you wanted to apply yourself to making a collage. and as i recall, i was against it."
36117,Homer,"son, do you have a minute?"
39526,Homer,"aw, marge."
41322,Homer,"greetings, friend. do you wish to look as happy as me? well, you've got the power inside you right... etc."
28277,Homer,"this is it, baby. first thing tomorrow, we're getting a playstation one!"

32589,Homer,are you kidding? the mother of my children with the reason for my children! this is gonna be the greatest party ever!
33081,Homer,occupied!

34719,Homer,his strike zone's the size / of a tuna fish can...
35361,Homer,he's cheating on selma? that's crazy! why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
18075,Homer,"marge, are you okay?"

25477,Homer,"they said if i come in late again, i'm fired. i can't take that chance."
34114,Homer,"oh, c'mon! look out! what would that guy-- look out! that's funny."

25783,Homer,"well, i learned my lesson. from now on you two are the only kids i'll care about. oh, and maggie."
28764,Homer,"so our kids keep getting smarter! if we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."
17935,Homer,"debt's off! let's go, marge. woo hoo!"

40270,Homer,"i should have slept on it. or at least stared blankly for a while. perhaps if i'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."

31067,Homer,the heart is the symbol for love.
34860,Homer,"oh man, this is great. the most evil man in town is in our power. he will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. and anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
29430,Homer,hold on. we're just innocent tourists.
28428,Homer,wait! stop! i know bullets can be scary sometimes. but i have an idea. first we pull off all of your fur.
25034,Homer,"yes, exactly! no, no! i mean, the whole incident is hazy."

28969,Homer,where do i begin? to tell the story of how great a love can be...
21763,Homer,"okay, remember where we parked."
16038,Homer,nope.
35424,Homer,"uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
30275,Homer,uh-oh. that might have broken the phone. i'd better call moe.

24823,Homer,"ho, ho, ho, merry everyone!"
37011,Homer,"now we're going to leave this place. i'm sorry, bart -- i know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
29997,Homer,what's the cheapest thing you've got?
27876,Homer,weird al yankovic!
17012,Homer,all right!
20642,Homer,"oh yeah? we'll show 'em. come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."

25868,Homer,room five?!
21429,Homer,"hey marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? wee little parties?"
25733,Homer,"well, they would keep me company. and this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal."
17986,Homer,"yo, hugh. here's a little bit of u.s. hospitality. what do you think of that?"
26501,Homer,i decide who reads and when. how 'bout now?
19742,Homer,couldn't agree more. happy as a clam.
32990,Homer,let's roll.
33366,Homer,i've gotta know.
32245,Homer,a little bit louder now!
39367,Homer,"you know, i defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. they been through here yet?"
35693,Homer,"you know, i'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. maybe i'll like it."
27343,Homer,"oh, it's so beautiful."
35148,Homer,it would be an honor!
39321,Homer,"yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
37142,Homer,"that's it? well, then let's ""power"" this party up!"
27425,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i released them all into the wild."
14002,Homer,huh?
24151,Homer,"no, i'm good."
23941,Homer,propellers... spinning! turn... left! boat go... there!
27618,Homer,"wow, this is amazing. i could follow the ribwich from town to town."
34507,Homer,"well, if you really want me to stay..."
40827,Homer,huh?
40550,Homer,"you don't have to do that, mr. burns. i can throw myself out."
29017,Homer,"nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! at long last."
16930,Homer,"on the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
18694,Homer,not an issue.
20456,Homer,"i didn't raise him to be a quitter, marge. it must have been you. you've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
29534,Homer,today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
33384,Homer,"virgin? what are you, a girl?"
23110,Homer,oopsie.
15934,Homer,he's dead now.
25503,Homer,it...
38103,Homer,"i've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. they pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!"
38950,Homer,psych!
39074,Homer,"i'm sorry, i thought you were over-feeders anonymous."
19724,Homer,"nine hundred dollars? well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
19489,Homer,a ship! a ship with people! i know... i'll bring them to me! and then they'll have to be my friends!
30592,Homer,i'm not!
18896,Homer,"second class? what about social security, bus discounts, medic-alert jewelry, gold bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
41228,Homer,don't tell him you were at a bar! but what else is open at night?
28705,Homer,"don't worry about those losers, marge. i think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
24887,Homer,"thank you, folks. and now i'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and..."
39185,Homer,if anything happens to marge... we'll all be orphans!
38791,Homer,okay! okay! i'll stay for one beer.
27038,Homer,"jewish? oh, no, i'm not jewish."
37512,Homer,"and we're more in love than ever. in your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!"
38082,Homer,that's why i've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
23400,Homer,"okay, but there's... dan quayle and courtney love... tanya harding... al sharpton...?"
17416,Homer,whaa?
25126,Homer,"now, who's up for a trip to the library tomorrow? notice i no longer say ""liberry"" or ""tomorry""."
34428,Homer,oh yeah. gotta keep track of those.
26854,Homer,"hey, i'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- oh-ho-ho, you mean me? i'd be delighted."
39103,Homer,"marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like albert."
21129,Homer,"well, mr. burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
41462,Homer,"uh, uh, no, i'm, uh... just exploring my body!"
31144,Homer,"wow, i think we've really hit on something here. unfortunately, we're out of time. how does that make you feel?"
34189,Homer,"a disc? please be compact, please be compact! woo-hoo!"
24935,Homer,"not a chance. no one can silence me, but me!"
36383,Homer,he turned that russian guy into swiss cheese!
14821,Homer,"oh, my couch! the arms, the seat... the dream is over. all right, who did this?"
16833,Homer,"okay, let's go boating!"
22903,Homer,"just for the prototype, honey."
31530,Homer,a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
37105,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get 'em. unless we die on this icy mountain road. then they've won forever."
17850,Homer,punishment?!
25298,Homer,"good morning, partner!"
36998,Homer,"marge, this is it! teotwawki!"
34851,Homer,"your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. so, by the power vested in me, i now pronounce you sweet dreams."
37722,Homer,"ooh, indigo!"
23061,Homer,"ohh, yeah..."
21884,Homer,"ohh, my mother painted that for me?"
33191,Homer,i'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!
17358,Homer,"now that we're all alone, marge, admit it. you like lisa best."
33362,Homer,why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
15931,Homer,uh... no.
16754,Homer,oh.
30932,Homer,what about her.
38604,Homer,woo-hoo!
25645,Homer,say goodbye to your brother.

27532,Homer,"bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
32776,Homer,"y'ello. she what?! oh, my god! well i'm gonna settle this once and for all! meet me at the place we discussed."
38291,Homer,"uh, hello. lisa. i know your brother and..."
37937,Homer,the hell you are! piracy is stealing! you're taking money out of my family's mouths.
34694,Homer,and i also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
39435,Homer,"don't correct the man, brat. oh, boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
19634,Homer,we could build snowmen.
35251,Homer,all right!
17295,Homer,"oh, my loving family. nothing's changed."
40672,Homer,"i just want you to know that i love you, dad."
19962,Homer,dammit!!
41211,Homer,oh my god! a naked celebrity. be cool. don't stare at his famous wang.
33928,Homer,is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
23118,Homer,who else is in it?
30737,Homer,"yeah, i'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
41172,Homer,"all right, scale. you don't like me and i don't like you, but i've been very good, so you better treat me right."
31980,Homer,of our marriage?! i don't want to live!
26889,Homer,"well, i'm glad everyone's all right, but i think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for tv ratings."
18144,Homer,"that's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now marge?"
26608,Homer,"it's a murder, honey. a group of crows is called a murder."
33372,Homer,woo-hoo!
39098,Homer,"excuse me, pardon me, coming through."
40668,Homer,hello? yeah he's here who is this? bart's friend milhouse. bart! get your butt down here!
31103,Homer,look at that line.
25219,Homer,you're gonna regret this.
38434,Homer,you pay lenny and carl to be my friends?
20420,Homer,then why are you running the obstacle course?
15578,Homer,two more feet and i can fit it in the fridge.
32028,Homer,okay. hold still. this is the last picture on the role.
35556,Homer,this is no way to treat the talent!
33236,Homer,i'm really thirty-eight.
16975,Homer,sucker.
26528,Homer,"...the french were fighting the english, in the hundred years war, which was then called ""operation speedy resolution."""
39081,Homer,"ooh, like fat albert."
28844,Homer,"ahh, summer in tuscany."
24544,Homer,stupid horoscope!
29904,Homer,something like that.
33155,Homer,"i know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, i'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."
23886,Homer,"well, i think the veal might have died of loneliness..."
23904,Homer,who are you?
21488,Homer,gil! thank god it's you. you gotta help us.
17065,Homer,"this is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
39892,Homer,"well, i'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in security, but sure, you bet."
37552,Homer,"you just dodged a bullet, mister sugarpants."
19362,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
24686,Homer,"eh, it's hopeless."
36164,Homer,"don't yell at me, brain! this happened on your watch! you have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!"
23330,Homer,uninspired.
21954,Homer,unless...
17781,Homer,clowns are funny.
13332,Homer,why not? i paid for it.
17889,Homer,"mmmm, slanty."
16802,Homer,ow!
16389,Homer,"hey, there's a new mexico."
18739,Homer,"i don't understand thee, marge."
17537,Homer,and i don't believe in it. it breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. you don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
19811,Homer,"oh, all those stairs..."
25738,Homer,"hey, it was fun. my kids are sick of all my stories. but they just can't get enough of me!"
33590,Homer,"you okay, dad?"
24189,Homer,it could be you!
15102,Homer,"well, she was. and she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
14486,Homer,"you got it, sweetheart. you have enough blanket there?"
31573,Homer,"you did the right thing, boy."
23300,Homer,sorry.
36018,Homer,"you have the most wonderful mom in the world, which is why i have no idea where she is or what she's doing."
33450,Homer,got it!
17640,Homer,"lisa, you were right. my happiness is fading."
39764,Homer,"eat, mm-hm."
39417,Homer,"oh, sit tight. i'll be right back."
29254,Homer,"steady, steady..."
19236,Homer,"if you really love larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
36059,Homer,private plane crashes.
26860,Homer,the missus prefers you call me simpson.
25429,Homer,albuquerque isotopes? what is all this stuff?
17418,Homer,i don't have a friend in the world.
17903,Homer,what paper?
32657,Homer,marge! marge! where are you?!
26018,Homer,"but when i'm passionate about something, i see it through to the end."
26348,Homer,"hm, a million dollars? wait a minute. how much sex would be involved? 'cause if it's ""some""..."
19254,Homer,someone found my keys!
19427,Homer,"aw, lousy wiggum. now the whole town thinks i'm a chili wuss..."
14187,Homer,"those were idealistic days... the candidacy of john anderson, the rise of supertramp... it was an exciting time to be young!"
14119,Homer,not any more...
29419,Homer,dad?
37956,Homer,"we've talked about this, marge. the hammock is a chore-free zone."
22974,Homer,"but you know what? to be loved you have to be nice to people. every day! but, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
34581,Homer,"ooh, a baby whale. my diet is working."
25424,Homer,is...
35462,Homer,"oh, absolutely, ned. sorry."
17987,Homer,"whew! uh, enjoy."
20767,Homer,now!
29927,Homer,not real.
29027,Homer,"oh, i have a funny feeling we will. wherever people are mistreated, the pie man will strike!"
14229,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry. i wish i could afford a better place."
20453,Homer,"don't listen to them, son. i have total faith in you."
39141,Homer,not my department.
27295,Homer,"guys, bob is my only hope. back off and give him some room to think."
32049,Homer,uh... cone!
33059,Homer,bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
24417,Homer,"okay, now am i the only one on fire? good."
25501,Homer,"ow! oh, my..."

16283,Homer,"ooooh, ""jet!"""
30242,Homer,professor pigskin told me to bet on the raiders but they look awful.
34362,Homer,"and when you're out of my sight, you must constantly twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though i don't know what twitter is and have no desire to find out."

32103,Homer,please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
25933,Homer,"okay, she lives at one ocean view drive. let's start skulking."

17084,Homer,"keep up the rough-housing, son. without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. oh, these stubborn grass stains."
28294,Homer,"why can't you have a normal dream, like being an olympic figure skater?"
24310,Homer,wasted? what about our staring contests? and the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? remember the day we jumped that census guy and stole his clicker?
13904,Homer,isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
15391,Homer,ah yes. i remember the day we moved in...
31925,Homer,"well son, your uncle homer is, like eighty percent of america, whacked-out on prescription drugs."

18211,Homer,noooooooo!
29251,Homer,trying to.
20805,Homer,"na na na na na na na na leader / na na na na na na na na leader / lea-der, lea-der, lea-der!"
29938,Homer,"not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
16134,Homer,every time mr. burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. and i always get some terrible job.
33858,Homer,where are my videogames? my x-box?! my wii?!
36033,Homer,so do your farting now.
22735,Homer,"oh, i shoulda known. they're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
36101,Homer,"you would do that? oh my god, this might be a marge's birthday where i get sex!"
22545,Homer,"ohhh, you suck, marge."
20160,Homer,and why am i here?
27566,Homer,what the--? half goes to bart. half goes to my vegas wife. what's left for moe?
26001,Homer,not for friends of moe's.
30345,Homer,"oh, and i spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
19521,Homer,so?
18059,Homer,"what i'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
13706,Homer,"oh, i know i need to pay them. but there's just so many."
13650,Homer,"stupid flanders... always showing off. go ahead, marge, have a ball... what if they game back and i was dead from not eating? they'd cry their eyes out. we should have never gone to the flanders'. oh, why did we go to the flanders' house and leave homer all alone with no food. and i'd be laughing. laughing from my grave."
26051,Homer,easy.
38417,Homer,"okay, i slept on the couch, and i flipped the sweaty cushions over. what else can i do?"
20717,Homer,"hey, come on! he doesn't have any money. look at his clothes."
19762,Homer,"you know. it's... it's not... usual! if there was a law, it would be against it!"
29736,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge -- i just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. they should get here soon. i paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
13390,Homer,it's true. it's all true.
13305,Homer,"lisa, don't hold anything back. you can tell me. are you crying because you called daddy a baboon?"
18043,Homer,"so, how was everybody's day at school?"
40862,Homer,"we could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable tv."
18226,Homer,and he knows my name.
16750,Homer,"congratulations, barney."
15202,Homer,"let's see, foundation repair... ah, here we are..."
34351,Homer,i'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. lisa! you're a wonderful child! keep up the good work!
19654,Homer,but how am i supposed to pay for that?
24610,Homer,"it's not fair! i've been a fan of the who since the very beginning, when they were the hillbilly bugger boys."
28023,Homer,"thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, marge."
26568,Homer,"so it's opposite land. crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
17327,Homer,"see, son? telling the truth isn't so bad."
40080,Homer,"ooh, i like this."
28823,Homer,"your majesty, can i go home now?"
26207,Homer,it's okay. we're married.
30512,Homer,i don't know. what happened to the last safety salamander?
14935,Homer,shut up boy.
18150,Homer,homer simpson! homer simpson! shut up! homer simpson! my name is homer simpson!
18046,Homer,"oh, this is wonderful! you're alive!"
33727,Homer,too much cherry!
27504,Homer,"dear lord, as i think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, i am reminded of colonel sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? i command you!"
35095,Homer,the boy's flash drive may be in there. but i've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
24670,Homer,"c'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant who of ""my generation,"" ""won't get fooled again,"" and ""mama's got a squeeze box""?"
22431,Homer,you remembered my name!
23472,Homer,"oh, it's been a month. why won't anything grow?"
31019,Homer,"so... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?"
19132,Homer,got it...
18078,Homer,you did what?!!
18726,Homer,wow.
21248,Homer,and can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
39886,Homer,just kidding.
40847,Homer,oooh. pizza.
20681,Homer,"well, they put us on the ""waiting to exhale waiting list."" but they said don't hold your breath."
38635,Homer,gravy thursday.
33280,Homer,run for your--
21360,Homer,"this may not be the top, but it's as close as a simpson's ever gonna get."
20467,Homer,"aww... you know, tomorrow's the championship game and i could sure use a good offensive tackle."
39592,Homer,uh-oh. you missed me.
24727,Homer,"you want money? get a job, like your old man."
37209,Homer,"my dad's always been so angry. maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy."
36330,Homer,"you know, i should get back to the treadmill."
16825,Homer,"come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. oh, i can do it faster that that."
30787,Homer,"earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. except the maine potatoes one. it's just a reminder to myself."
19768,Homer,"just remember, son, whatever happens --i'll always love you."
19460,Homer,"that's it? well, that's marge. big deal. great spiritual quest, wolfie. my soul mate is marge."
35558,Homer,so cold. warm me up.
26958,Homer,i must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
41081,Homer,bart!
20502,Homer,but you can't leave! we're scammin' an old lady at my house and i need a place to hide out.
20436,Homer,"now just because i'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. he calls me ""coach"" just like everyone else. which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
17272,Homer,noooo!
19250,Homer,"i'm a father myself, sir. and sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
31667,Homer,they're gonna cut my head offff...!
16574,Homer,woo hoo! woo hoo hoo hoo!
27482,Homer,yes...
20901,Homer,"oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. but that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
13220,Homer,crush them in the name of jebus!
19065,Homer,"we'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
32924,Homer,"three o'clock. goodbye, mom. you're finally free."
27658,Homer,get... out of my... airspace!
28460,Homer,"so did i, son. and look where i am today."
17171,Homer,gotta go.
34438,Homer,spread the word! peace and chicken!
31567,Homer,"uh... i thought today was opposite day. by the way, you're very ugly. it's opposite day."
23815,Homer,"anyway, where were we? hello? hello? they hung up."
34242,Homer,never!
28137,Homer,this is how we play. the squirmy wormy spider / squirts out of daddy's hands...
16595,Homer,"oh, kent, i'd be lying if i said my men weren't committing crimes."
39861,Homer,the boy. bring me the boy.
28629,Homer,and i'm the luckiest--
26881,Homer,"y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
41080,Homer,i'm saying...
36982,Homer,"so, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
28586,Homer,"son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?"
35522,Homer,"you know, i just got a little chill when you said my name."
33734,Homer,what else do they got?
37466,Homer,i just need to get closer.
32477,Homer,"i sure have. plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. when it is, everyone should get it."
34790,Homer,"hey pal, how ya been?"
19215,Homer,can't they get a pole for that sign?
27042,Homer,"oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya..."
24278,Homer,"ah, trash night. in france, they call it ""la nuit des poubelles."" in germany, it's ""crappenfest."""
32230,Homer,"uh, i'm not sure she's workin' out."
34842,Homer,"i am so sorry, marge."
24048,Homer,"oh, i missed one!"
36272,Homer,i said i've got it!
30544,Homer,"marge, without this outfit, i'm just homer simpson, multiple felon. with it, i'm a costumed hero like george washington or dame edna."
15456,Homer,"don't worry, marge. america's healthcare system is second only to japan... canada, sweden, great britain. well, all of europe. but you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in paraguay."
36927,Homer,everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
33879,Homer,why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?
41085,Homer,"no, we have to commit ourselves. now take this down. ""free to loving home. world's most brilliant dog. says 'i love you' on command."""
28702,Homer,uh-huh.
15442,Homer,"hey, c'mon, quit it."
32682,Homer,"really? you people are idiots! that's the dumb-- what a stu-- i mean, that sounds fair."
24259,Homer,"oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!"
18919,Homer,bear patrol tax: $5?! what?! this is an outrage! it's the biggest tax increase in history!
25876,Homer,fine.
16319,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll get rid of the trampoline!"
32217,Homer,i said you look hot! hot! ay chihuahua!
15997,Homer,then came the day we knew we were finished.
37125,Homer,it was during happy hour. don't you want our baby to be happy?
15026,Homer,"i was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that i am."
16790,Homer,duck! i can't let the boys see me with you!
20505,Homer,you're already in a home.
33944,Homer,what happened is you left! who did you leave me for? tell me. i can take it.
30419,Homer,we'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
18578,Homer,"uh... excuse me, mr. burns?"
37399,Homer,i know c.p.r.
21541,Homer,"okay, turn on the suction."
33614,Homer,"oh my god, she fainted! let's go get smelling salts!"
29885,Homer,oh ray! you came at the agreed-upon time.
36945,Homer,don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
23172,Homer,no time talk! need steal car! must save powerful but controversial movie!
32686,Homer,"hey boy, check out my new car!"
30532,Homer,i don't know.
33299,Homer,you're the nerd.
15596,Homer,"hi, kids. how was duff gardens?"
16935,Homer,woo hoo!
21704,Homer,"i know you are, but what am i?"
25530,Homer,woo hoo!
16408,Homer,"son, there's something i was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, i want you to have it now."
26482,Homer,"hey, watch the movie."
32036,Homer,"hey suckers, check it out. marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery."
23046,Homer,but it's so cheap.
17095,Homer,"okay, thirty."
13204,Homer,"it hurts! it hurts so bad! please, just put one in my brain!"
29500,Homer,"moe, you've won. i'll see you at baggage claim."
32769,Homer,maybe you're drunk.
30138,Homer,"free movie tickets?! i feel like roger ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!"
17585,Homer,then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
40646,Homer,bart! bart!
16788,Homer,"flanders, i decided i'd like to go to the game with you."
26063,Homer,you're right.
27962,Homer,"oh thank god, the dog's here! pull me free, boy."
22987,Homer,no. but i got it.
26399,Homer,sorry.
26915,Homer,"from ""the woolly bully."""
24785,Homer,you're the boss.
36064,Homer,"oh, ""smithers""!"
16821,Homer,"oh, yeah. a judge made me do that once, too. stupid lack of public urinals. hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, i'm comin' with ya."
15065,Homer,"nope, that's it."
20660,Homer,shut up! one at a time! lisa?
31353,Homer,"moe, moe, you gotta hide us from the army!"
33766,Homer,you're no help.
27502,Homer,vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. i could do this all day. and i just might. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god.
21446,Homer,i love that dog.
37988,Homer,where's my money?
41153,Homer,"your mother must have painted this. i guess she thought he was cute... hey, what the..."
17462,Homer,"hoo mama! this is finally really happening. after years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, i know i'm gonna get rich with this scheme! and quick!"
21016,Homer,nighty-night!
24064,Homer,"i know, i know. it's never easy."
25811,Homer,"the perfect crime. marge, i have to be in court next tuesday."
31096,Homer,"yeah, she's over in post now."
23186,Homer,no.
33451,Homer,"oh, mr. burns! why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
31786,Homer,no problem. hey drederick!
22652,Homer,"nah, you must be thinking of your mother. i'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... can't we just go in?"
30130,Homer,"yeah, i'll definitely read those later."
28099,Homer,"let's see. what native american activities should we do? making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the civil war."
40435,Homer,"you know, his girlfriend is the weather lady."
34333,Homer,"fine. i was gonna apologize, but now i'm not going to!"
20829,Homer,but i want to go.
26458,Homer,whoa. there's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!
27741,Homer,why are you looking at me like that?
16270,Homer,"oh, that would be delightf... quiet, boy! there's nothing to feel ashamed of here. women have a right to a night out. right, lisa?"
27499,Homer,"it worked! i got my wish! from now on, i'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding."
17348,Homer,"ah, sorry bart, lisa and i are going out for gelato. we'd ask you to come but, you know..."
34225,Homer,"son, if i was interested in fun, i would've run away the day you were born."
28765,Homer,"if you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. i'm slappin' this sucker right over ""support our troops."""
24212,Homer,go moe! boo everyone else!
34345,Homer,whatever. knock yourself out.
20021,Homer,marge -- perfect. bart -- perfect. other kid -- perfect.
34083,Homer,"mmm, not bad."
13626,Homer,stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
16594,Homer,"aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, kent. forty percent of all people know that."
35501,Homer,"some may say / i don't deserve any pay, but hey / i came up with ""sixties day"""
16959,Homer,"hey, the trail of donuts ended. bart!"
25262,Homer,and it's bad news for the gophers.
26095,Homer,i don't know. but i was quite moved by your letter. i'd love to meet you and your family. shall we say dinner?
23087,Homer,"well, i haven't talked it over with the family, but i think we'd all like a free dinner at americatown."
34687,Homer,yeah. now what am i supposed to do?
17598,Homer,"number one? ha ha. what kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""hello, my name is number one."" and so forth."

32163,Homer,"oh yes, of course."
26054,Homer,"let's see. ""you will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""you will find true love on flag day."" ""your store is being robbed, apu."" are you getting all this, lisa?"
18422,Homer,"shame on all of you. give me my dignity! i just came here to see ""honk if you're horny"" in peace."
25563,Homer,"what did you just see, lisa?"
20057,Homer,what's a tim conway?

17049,Homer,"yeah, yeah. that'll eat up some time. uh, how 'bout you, otto."
25655,Homer,thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
16513,Homer,"marge, you waited for me."
25066,Homer,"wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles."
30421,Homer,i guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
19111,Homer,wow.
14344,Homer,"oooh, that's a big lock all right. i just don't trust that guy."
35269,Homer,whoo!
14484,Homer,you're not going anywhere.
30885,Homer,"oh really? bart, when did you get your tenure?"
38541,Homer,"well, you woke up the right man in bed."
13701,Homer,now i don't want it.
39084,Homer,i have a beauty of a sort to some.
25207,Homer,"hmm. i don't know what that is, so i'm gonna say yes. now, go limp."
21738,Homer,ooh!
34283,Homer,it's stuck!
14411,Homer,"however? what however? what do you mean, however? however what?"
30531,Homer,but i'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.
18766,Homer,all right! liver!
29891,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
20177,Homer,i'll practice you!
39622,Homer,all right. all right! i'll take it.
13164,Homer,"hey, you're right. give it back! no, i still want you to have it. but every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
21871,Homer,"that was the problem. the important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, i'm finally getting some decent parts."
40422,Homer,"come on, dad. let's get outta here."
17198,Homer,"marge, pour vous."
32654,Homer,"like all young people, i had a musical dream."
27524,Homer,aw... he thinks he's papal.
21085,Homer,no.
24527,Homer,that's ridiculous! how could i even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
14192,Homer,"don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. lousy, ungrateful... can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
20491,Homer,what's the big problem?
39790,Homer,"oh no! two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. i'm a whale. why was i was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? well, from now on, exercise every morning, homer."
34762,Homer,woo hoo! another ladder!

31528,Homer,what the hell is this thing?
19878,Homer,"forty-two bathtubs, please."
14170,Homer,that's right. i lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
32629,Homer,"think tank, eh?"
28038,Homer,psst. bishop to queen four.
14909,Homer,that's okay. we're none of us perfect.
37738,Homer,"i'd better call it a night, guys. i don't want to take any more of your money."
24442,Homer,"whee! touch the sky, maggie! whee! touch the sky!"
26316,Homer,"sure thing, alky."
31361,Homer,"stupid army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance."
20489,Homer,"late night, huh?"
25538,Homer,"oh, the bag boys are on strike! i'm shaking."
30303,Homer,"well, that's very reasonable."
22017,Homer,"oh, i blame myself for this."
33644,Homer,whose side are you on?
20702,Homer,ice-cream-man-ice cream-man!
38473,Homer,"now come on, give daddy a hug."
38131,Homer,"boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done."

19611,Homer,"uh, not as such."
16029,Homer,"wow, a houseboat! you know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
20964,Homer,bo-ring!
41181,Homer,"it's for you, marge. from merry old england."
40567,Homer,"well, marge, what do you think?"

36606,Homer,"hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? then today will be nothing but beautiful memories."
23682,Homer,don't worry. i brought some chloroform.
35909,Homer,america's latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side.
30332,Homer,there's a little plastic man in your hair and i'm trying to rescue him.
32999,Homer,"yes, for now. i guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. maybe we could order one of your cakes for lisa's birthday."
28403,Homer,"check it out, ladies. the suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
36118,Homer,i've been thinking. i really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. so i'm gonna let you out with my apologies.

20514,Homer,mmm. who knew that lay's made liquid potato chips? i can't suck just one.
31345,Homer,"okay, these are war games and i'm head of my team. i have to think like a great military leader."

39689,Homer,"son, we're in this mess together. no matter how tempting it might be, i can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
17113,Homer,"marge, can you set the oven to cold?"
40421,Homer,"oh, i love those kids! they've got such a great attitude!"
26210,Homer,"look, i married her, but that is as far as we went. we never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
14310,Homer,"marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
33163,Homer,"i know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, american history..."
13711,Homer,"knock 'em dead, boy! kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
26116,Homer,"it was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. and to kill the boredom, we sang."

40972,Homer,"hello, is this h. powell of detroit, michigan?"
23964,Homer,"in the net, right?"
28592,Homer,"oh man, this is so confusing."
26090,Homer,"ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."

40425,Homer,this thing's gonna be roaring any time now!
36453,Homer,"mmm, historically inaccurate."
24041,Homer,"okay, nobody panic. there's plenty of spray for me."
14193,Homer,where do you think you're going? you're gonna listen to my story.
23637,Homer,"actually, that was before i went in the ocean."
39857,Homer,i told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--
23375,Homer,"geez, marge, tell the neighborhood."
15341,Homer,"there's a $10,000 bill in it for you."

24685,Homer,"all right. ""open stuck drawer..."" all-righty."
24585,Homer,"wait, stop! we can outsmart those dolphins! don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. i'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"

26762,Homer,apu?
18681,Homer,"look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
27298,Homer,don't look at me!
41395,Homer,i heard you and mommy yelling again last night.
25928,Homer,"shhh, you'll wake up flanders..."
20972,Homer,we'll tape it!
17955,Homer,okay! wait a minute. are you humoring me?
17258,Homer,"well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
38121,Homer,"oh, it is so hard running in sand."
20258,Homer,"oh, i've lost everything. i can't go on. no, no, no! i can't just wallow in sadness. it's time to laugh again. i'm the last man alive!"
23185,Homer,i think so.
35740,Homer,"i just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is."
22209,Homer,"hey flanders, don't spill my beer!"
23694,Homer,"oh, no. you're not gettin' me on that dance floor. don't try and make me. if i have to get a divorce i will."

33444,Homer,"me too, baby. but we gotta get real."
22280,Homer,woo! rumaki!
16184,Homer,"aw thanks, marge. but it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul."
16397,Homer,"woo-hoo! see that, boy? your old man was right, not flanders. we are doomed! in your face, flanders!"
20859,Homer,you don't look so rich.
13187,Homer,did he have any hobbies?
41326,Homer,"greetings, friend..."
18937,Homer,"oh. it can't be that many. c'mon, apu. i'll be your tutor."
24469,Homer,"why? it's just a cute little weasel. hello there, mister weasel."
26908,Homer,that's it. nobody messes with my little girl. i'm gonna find those dolls.
35913,Homer,"a high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
18216,Homer,old painty-can ned!
27199,Homer,do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?
17501,Homer,can't.
40971,Homer,"h! of course. that could stand for herbert! it's a long shot, but..."
24991,Homer,"here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you."
37414,Homer,stupid clog...
30770,Homer,try this one...
34556,Homer,"ooh, it's dinner time!"
28181,Homer,come on!
21503,Homer,can't you just write on your arm like i do?

40293,Homer,"well kids, there it is, capital city."
33454,Homer,"baby, i hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause i'm about to file a claim."
30837,Homer,i am gonna get them so wet.
21238,Homer,"i hate the public so much. if only they'd elect me... i'd make 'em pay. oh moe, how do i make 'em like me?"
32561,Homer,"oh, i miss those bygone days of earlier this week. but i'm needed in a darker place."
40418,Homer,"see, maggie? those silver and blue guys are the dallas cowboys. they're daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. understand?"
40055,Homer,you got me!
28151,Homer,i'll get our little passports.
30703,Homer,daddy... daddy...
26757,Homer,this was supposed to be a mock battle! mock!
20629,Homer,"oh, you will, honey. you will."
30200,Homer,"that'll straighten you out, boy. there, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to hell!"
21920,Homer,"yes, b-b-but the poncho..."
32504,Homer,nobody do it.
14427,Homer,"marge, can you take my ball to nick's today? a bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
16470,Homer,"oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. colonel klink, why have you forsaken me?"
27907,Homer,"hey, mister? if you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? it's already rewound."
36585,Homer,i'll get right on it.
38142,Homer,"well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
19034,Homer,"lisa, let's go!"
21048,Homer,"uh, is the poopdeck really what i think it is?"
34124,Homer,get to the show!
25566,Homer,"now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
26805,Homer,"hey, where's my keg?"
40300,Homer,"okay, here are your tickets. they're supposed to be good. you're sitting with the player's wives. and don't forget to cheer for me."
16586,Homer,too late.
26455,Homer,that hurts. but i just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
36843,Homer,terence shaved my head!
41202,Homer,you are smooth. i'll give you that.
17942,Homer,"no, my ears are really burning. i wanted to see inside, so i lit a q-tip."
28512,Homer,"i don't need her, i've got you, astrolabe."
22470,Homer,i can't lose them!
21103,Homer,help! somebody!
13678,Homer,"no, i do not know what schadenfreude is. please tell me, because i'm dying to know."
36690,Homer,"oh my god. i never knew the sacrifices my father made. move over, fonzie. i've got a new hero."
18190,Homer,i can see lisa... but it might be a starfish. i've gotta call 'em!
39003,Homer,oopsie.
16818,Homer,"i'd like to introduce ned flanders, my best friend."
35889,Homer,"i'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. i..."
30349,Homer,"don't worry, he's not showin' up."
16083,Homer,"uh, excuse me ""professor brainiac,"" but i worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, i think i know how a proton accelerator works."
26790,Homer,"uh, we didn't order that."
38618,Homer,"because i've never gotten a promotion before. once i thought i had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. so judge me all you want."
31708,Homer,he's lying!
39163,Homer,moe szyslak!
16725,Homer,stupid carbon rod. it's all just a popularity contest.
34412,Homer,whatever. it's your camera.
39512,Homer,"well, you see, boy. it never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
30604,Homer,do i have to hang out with them?
15422,Homer,i can't wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
18888,Homer,"c'mon, maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little..."
20819,Homer,oh boy! we get to see the leader pass by.
18195,Homer,"listen. yes, i know."
23496,Homer,a sprout!
25917,Homer,"heyyy, how 'bout that? ha, ha."
40223,Homer,what's wrong? i just want to snuggle.
17789,Homer,"steady, steady..."
32613,Homer,we're free!
34451,Homer,but--
27412,Homer,"cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. ooh, a trash can. we'll find breakfast in here."
27607,Homer,you seem like an impartial observer. but i've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
37487,Homer,put the noodles in the shed. there isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
33173,Homer,"fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! i'm going to moe's, for beer! have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!"
25423,Homer,"well, is that it?"
21511,Homer,and now for the profit taking.
14651,Homer,the cat? what's the point?
37370,Homer,"seriously, ""pews?"""
22229,Homer,"ned, no! think of your wives!"
24293,Homer,disgracefully hilarious! you passed out before we could even give you your presents.
13147,Homer,"you know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
38813,Homer,... ...
13951,Homer,mustn't sleep. must monitor core.
29507,Homer,or maybe a manwich...
19914,Homer,wow! a golf shirt! with my corporate logo on it!
39310,Homer,rudolph with your nose... over here... / so you can guide my sleigh today....
35734,Homer,you're in.

30203,Homer,"no meat?! what do they eat, light bulbs?"
32511,Homer,now?
41351,Homer,"okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--"
35089,Homer,i'll just use my eye.
39798,Homer,"hey, shut up!"
28156,Homer,"moe, i was just thinking, if maggie and i were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
25642,Homer,thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
20844,Homer,"maude, eh?"
27192,Homer,forget it kiki. you're not putting your brain into her body.
17064,Homer,"now what is a wedding? well, webster's dictionary describes a wedding as: 'the process of removing weeds from one's garden.'"
21243,Homer,fellow citizens! how would you rate the trash service in this town?
23748,Homer,"whaddaya say, honey?"
23706,Homer,"yeah, that's the life for me, marge. cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers."
21466,Homer,"now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
31902,Homer,"look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
18679,Homer,sit down! / you're breaking -- / don't touch that--
39338,Homer,"don't worry son, you can have mine. here, let me show you how to put on a tie."
22102,Homer,access denied.
22882,Homer,why'd he do that?
21904,Homer,"oh, yeah? when's the last time you freaked out the establishment? you guys are total sellouts."
14082,Homer,get away from me.
40116,Homer,five thousand two... i mean... lots of money.
37888,Homer,"all right, movie, you better be worth it."
33119,Homer,what a cute couple. she's gonna take him for a lot of money.
36734,Homer,dan!
34601,Homer,my little einstein.
28126,Homer,your baby!
20697,Homer,even the criminals are beginning to croon.
38675,Homer,i was voted employee of the month as an april fool's day joke. why you little... why you little...
15893,Homer,no son of mine is gonna be a 19th century cockney bootblack. we're gonna find you another school.
14944,Homer,i'm all naked and wet!
27595,Homer,"aw, that's the dumbest thing i ever heard, you stupid little kid."

19211,Homer,"eh, not mine."
23068,Homer,"oooh, they got our number."
38757,Homer,what kind of erotic asphyxiation?
41058,Homer,assassins!
31277,Homer,everyone! my stupid male pride made me lie to you. everything i claiiimed i did was actually built by maaarge!
20913,Homer,"oh, you did. but -- i still don't know... i can just imagine what marge would say."
35796,Homer,my work is so meaningless.
36431,Homer,"when i was in special ops, they held me in an afghan prison where all i could see was a patch of blue sky. but that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes."
24268,Homer,then what is his ghost protecting?
17464,Homer,"ow. i guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug."
35181,Homer,huh? this one didn't make me feel anything.
18017,Homer,you got it.
25249,Homer,we're gonna go with the wolves.
19127,Homer,"hey, if tom landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then i should just quit right now."
21324,Homer,"look at you people. bart's a tub, lisa's weak as a little girl, and maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
29178,Homer,everyone okay?

30091,Homer,"okay, guys. get ready! we're just seconds away!"
36009,Homer,well i'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
39024,Homer,i gotcha!
38207,Homer,pathetic.
30815,Homer,it's a lot of little stuff. god has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave saturn?
18629,Homer,i think this is the best neighborhood in town. anybody agree with me?
15573,Homer,sure... unless another aunt dies.
26447,Homer,yes!
20713,Homer,do do do do do...

32475,Homer,huh? why do i look like me again?
17858,Homer,"show 'em what american butts are made of, son!"
21244,Homer,"uh, okay, it's excellent. but aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?"
29206,Homer,"c'mon, shoot me a new one!"
24408,Homer,"well, i'm gonna try anyway."
29970,Homer,"son, i just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. leave your body. make lots of friends!"
41243,Homer,"oh my god, he is coming on to me."
29026,Homer,you've hurt your last feeling!
30752,Homer,"kidding! i'm kidding! we can do that, we have a special friendship."
27508,Homer,"lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. then take some time off for yourself. fly to france. have a nice dinner."
23895,Homer,"no, wait! i got a kid who's a miracle worker! he'll heal him up real good."
18528,Homer,"simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree"
13856,Homer,y'ello.

20085,Homer,"'evening, moe."
23555,Homer,"hey, guys. is it normal to see burns' face on a bowling ball?"
29492,Homer,"hang on, marge, homie's comin'! i won't let that man make you happy!"
20077,Homer,leggo my leg.
37122,Homer,"if you're lucky, me, then this."
20428,Homer,"well, i'm not gonna make the same mistake. from now on i'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my dad."
36276,Homer,such a peaceful end.
40729,Homer,some people call me a space cowboy / yeah / some call me the gangster of love / some people call me maurice. woo woo / 'cause i speak of the puppets oh of love.
15777,Homer,"gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
40773,Homer,so... you wanna go out with me?
24725,Homer,"sorry you're such jerks! ha, ha!"
33710,Homer,"son, girls come and go. but you'll always have your family."

41562,Homer,leave the humidor.
16164,Homer,"sorry, burns. no deal."
25842,Homer,"lucky, shmucky. i knocked her up. but she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. but if i died, she'd be completely free. for man or machine."
38446,Homer,"if the expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten."
25072,Homer,woo hoo!
37857,Homer,uh-uh! no way! i'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! and maybe that guy. lincoln-style. but that's it.
30841,Homer,but she'll leave the rest of him alone?
24505,Homer,why you little...!
28683,Homer,"apu, do you sell crazy straws? i've got a guy with a broken back and i'm tryin' to cheer him up."

34713,Homer,did you say a hague?
24925,Homer,"look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."

40731,Homer,but we're early for lunch. let's go grab a burger.
17739,Homer,"it's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, marge."
13843,Homer,"well, okay then... ... four o'clock... coupla hours i have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
29065,Homer,see...
28028,Homer,"you know, i feel pretty good. maybe i should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar."
39268,Homer,"now let's not get mushy, son. i still have a job to do."
38469,Homer,"yeah, yeah, great. i guess my getting-up days are over."
24248,Homer,"yeah, you were..."
19862,Homer,going bowling. not back - avenge deaths.
14259,Homer,"yeah, what do you want?"
28334,Homer,"lady, please. get back in your overturned car. let the guys handle this."
29427,Homer,oh wait. i was supposed to take these with food.
24288,Homer,hey flanders? can your god do that?
15612,Homer,"marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. and to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. permit me to demonstrate."
17755,Homer,"so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
20197,Homer,"when a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
16383,Homer,"shut up, brain, or i'll stab you with a q-tip."
19443,Homer,huh? a tortoise?
17902,Homer,"rabsolutely rothing, rarge."
23733,Homer,really? read it.
21964,Homer,"that means that you weigh... one hundred and sixty pounds! oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!"
21279,Homer,"uh, nothin'."
23560,Homer,real real real real real!
27886,Homer,"i've learned a lot living here. it doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!"
35087,Homer,let's see if this works.
17785,Homer,you weren't complaining when i got you this close to chachi.
19251,Homer,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
15693,Homer,"c'mon, boy! finish him off!"
28875,Homer,"listen, moe. i did something really terrible to someone i love."
32376,Homer,who is it?
26548,Homer,that's it. they have awoken a sleeping giant.
30794,Homer,will you tell me a story?
19080,Homer,these candidates make me want to vomit in terror! i've got to stop them!
34141,Homer,"why you little... oh, i can't. when i look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
16472,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
38867,Homer,wow. this place is completely alien but everything's in english. just like canada.
39787,Homer,"pffft. i have to warn you, marge -- i think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly."
22198,Homer,"""nobody's goin' to take my ned / i'll teach him to have fu-un / ooh, he's a flanders machine..."""
14707,Homer,"thanks. you did say sugar, right?"
19956,Homer,two in a row!
27037,Homer,lick 'em. go away.
33072,Homer,"that's it, boy! you're going to bed without supper!"
35017,Homer,"the pressures got to him so he started to eat. soon, he was known as ""fit fat tony,"" then just ""fat tony"" for short."
26543,Homer,"fine, i'll cut off your ponytail."
39389,Homer,almost there.
29463,Homer,marge! how dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
39198,Homer,on a beautiful night like tonight... how could i not?
31179,Homer,"mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
19512,Homer,"eh, i guess i'll walk home."
35912,Homer,"zoomy, zoomy, zoomy dateline, nebraska."
37763,Homer,"um, hey... i was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy i forgot to give bart..."
15595,Homer,homercles cares not for beans.
15541,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
38035,Homer,"i don't need to know, marge. you deserve to have your secrets."
34022,Homer,to love!
31855,Homer,"son, i'll never understand women if i live to be forty."
15691,Homer,where?
31016,Homer,"hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
37151,Homer,i think it's a terence malick movie.
31029,Homer,"seventy-four? oh sorry, there's been a mistake."
38953,Homer,"get the ball, boy! c'mon!"
29940,Homer,what time's the show on?
39633,Homer,all righty.
30698,Homer,and my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
28644,Homer,i gotta get a job before marge finds out i was fired.
13760,Homer,"simpson, it's all up to you. it's showtime!"
21294,Homer,"hmm... all right, but don't lose them. they're my only pair."
20145,Homer,"homer one, new york nothing."
39233,Homer,well... i want to do the christmas shopping this year.
37818,Homer,"may i ask what this is regarding? oooh, a budding new friendship? oooh! boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
39625,Homer,"that's the spirit. ready or not, nature here we come!"
28837,Homer,and i know just where to find him. 742 evergreen terrace.
20125,Homer,"but i can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. oh, why did i drink all that crab juice?"
35294,Homer,"oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
37006,Homer,"well, just because i imagined it doesn't make it any less true. and now all those people are on their own."
25370,Homer,"wait a minute, bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? that's pretty farfetched, lisa."
31585,Homer,oh my god! it's beautiful!
39287,Homer,what! that scrawny little bag of bones?
20066,Homer,i want candy!
30166,Homer,...ead.
26449,Homer,stop saying that.
27609,Homer,one ribwich please.
39491,Homer,"cash, of course. i've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. i'm holding it right now. here it is. look. check it out. two hundred and fifty big ones."
23494,Homer,"oh, you're right. this farm's hopeless. why didn't i listen to those inbred hicks? i guess i'll just go hang myself in the barn."
14728,Homer,"guess what, lurleen, i got you a gig on tv."
28074,Homer,gotta go.
26785,Homer,you bet i am!
16896,Homer,"wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
23777,Homer,oh. that was scary. we came this close to losing our spare christmas tree stand. you monster.
20966,Homer,"c'mon, lisa, join the family!"
14760,Homer,"oh, would you two knock it off? i hate all the programs marge likes. but it's no big deal. you know why?"
17808,Homer,"hey, he didn't give me a ticket! this is an intriguing development."
27093,Homer,but rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
22077,Homer,hmmm...
21303,Homer,"oh, great. now the cat knows."
32409,Homer,"good idea. i'll drown my sorrows in anchor steam beer! oh, i'm sorry!"
28548,Homer,"they don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
22013,Homer,you just sit back and relax. i'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
15998,Homer,are we hot?
27357,Homer,i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
28371,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't fatty and smell-ma."
37018,Homer,"out of our way, corn! the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
24463,Homer,"go, lisa! c'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!"
28812,Homer,i'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
25528,Homer,cart.
19620,Homer,"oh, man, you are so right. did you ever sit like this?"
21015,Homer,"sorry, can't hear you, marge. i'm clapping."
14738,Homer,uh... i gotta go.
13190,Homer,they had a sale on skulls.
13309,Homer,"although, maybe this will help. now you lost someone special and it hurts. i'm lucky because i never lost anyone special to me. everyone special to me is under this roof."
31061,Homer,"well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose."
23737,Homer,"excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
27597,Homer,"i put you in humiliating commercials for money, which i spent on myself. i just wish i had an opportunity to make things right."
14134,Homer,i spent it on beer.
34215,Homer,"catch, boy!"
32888,Homer,"that's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. in fact, i don't even want your pie."
23974,Homer,"don't shush me, you rich bastards!"
20045,Homer,"well, basically i just copied the plant we have now..."
23827,Homer,leprosy? i can't believe it! that fortune cookie was right.
38392,Homer,here's a blanket they can borrow
19465,Homer,and that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
31661,Homer,then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
28461,Homer,"boy, everybody loves my show."
35794,Homer,"please, lisa. i had eighteen martinis today."
23457,Homer,and... there.
22521,Homer,not entirely.
36262,Homer,let's go!
31546,Homer,you could caramel my arm...
17548,Homer,all right. how much do you charge?
33565,Homer,"no, marge. you're the most giving person i know. besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne."
27114,Homer,good thing it's laminated.
38198,Homer,then why did the auction house say it was real?
19331,Homer,all right.
30835,Homer,fine. as soon as i finish watching my show.
17567,Homer,"hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
30412,Homer,"well, i got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad."
24447,Homer,worse.
18857,Homer,you made it! did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
14869,Homer,that's it?
31105,Homer,"hey, flanders! thanks for saving our place."
26591,Homer,gimme a drink with all your sweetest brazilian fruits mixed together.
26139,Homer,"mmmm, pie pants."
14079,Homer,barney?
33659,Homer,"stop him, babando!"
15986,Homer,"i miss you too, honey."
35612,Homer,oh well!
36419,Homer,"when i was in special ops, they held me in an afghan prison where all i could see was a patch of blue sky. but that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
34789,Homer,then... his story was true!
19531,Homer,"well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were discussing wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
29581,Homer,follow instructions? he's doomed!
15982,Homer,oh my god. oh my god! where did you get that brownie?
39771,Homer,'night.
14987,Homer,and you remember... matthew... 21:17.
21122,Homer,walk? that wasn't part of the deal.
29084,Homer,i thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
15546,Homer,i'm trying my best.
22080,Homer,"well, beats work."
30784,Homer,fine.
36778,Homer,why you little...
32718,Homer,wrong again.
17818,Homer,what keeps doin' that?
21690,Homer,"really? well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
27289,Homer,"just fix it, mr. sasswrench."
39079,Homer,"ooh, labels."
36967,Homer,"oh my god! this unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!"
19948,Homer,"you're welcome, honey."
19200,Homer,"uh, well... i was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!"
24389,Homer,bring on the rappin' granny!
16952,Homer,"bart, you listen."
28803,Homer,"i don't see any ghost. i did find this newsweek from 1986: ""why america loves saddam hussein."""
25150,Homer,"hey, don't blame me. this movie is tired and predictable. you know she's gonna wind up marrying richard gere."
38664,Homer,"then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion..."
40010,Homer,"have you ever seen a kung fu movie? it was just like that. but now i know her moves. so, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on homer simpson again."
32832,Homer,hmm... that sounds like tress macneille.
37871,Homer,vegetables?!
21070,Homer,"on second thought, go right."
19062,Homer,"oh my god, marge, it's escaped!"
20300,Homer,"that sounds like witch talk to me, lisa."
20696,Homer,i knew i should've shut that window.
29607,Homer,"...and do you, julio, take thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in massachusetts and vermont... maybe canada... stay outta texas... as long as you both are gay?"
28562,Homer,"wrong, lady! oh wait, the baby."
35994,Homer,and i've created something that created something incredibly popular!
22044,Homer,even those guys look too civilized for me.
26177,Homer,"i'm good for the rest, you know i am."
37596,Homer,what was the first one again?
20825,Homer,marge? you're the leader? you don't look anything like the beans.
38961,Homer,i'm not? cool! am i sick?
37038,Homer,"no, no! you're the first successful business i've ever run!"
27160,Homer,"well, what about bart?"
36577,Homer,"listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy."
21250,Homer,don't you deserve better than the best?
28008,Homer,"hands-free, eh? then i could give the brothers the black power salute."
31579,Homer,what's the code word?
32717,Homer,"hey marge, looking for something? i'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper i don't like. maybe it'll be this one."
36273,Homer,that could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
25233,Homer,i love the theater.
23865,Homer,what guys? i wanna see the freaks.
20463,Homer,"oh. well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of skittles."
32465,Homer,"uh, it used to be."
15184,Homer,itchy's a jerk.
16350,Homer,"hold on, son."
32886,Homer,no thanks.
15466,Homer,"oh doctor, i was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. and there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt."
41353,Homer,"play it cool, homer. don't let her know it's perfect."
28153,Homer,"we're not. your sleeve got caught on that tree. here, let me unhook ya."
29525,Homer,"don't forget showboating. that's the cornerstone of my ""pyramid of success."""
33080,Homer,"aw come on, gravity. you used to be cool!"
26678,Homer,so what? mr. burns is dead.
24965,Homer,what the?!
26424,Homer,"oh, i quit. there's no convincing you. i'm gonna take a nap."
37648,Homer,the ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. now let's get you married.
32129,Homer,"well, i can see the position of handsomest c.e.o. is already taken."
20783,Homer,"it's free, right?"
41050,Homer,"hey lenny, i need to leave early. cover for me, will ya?"
39698,Homer,where is it. the game... where is it?
21509,Homer,money in the bank.
38287,Homer,i'm sleeping on flanders' couch tonight. ours is crap.
30966,Homer,it's... um... jannnn... febbbb... marrr...
24390,Homer,what? she's hilarious.
14051,Homer,"say your name? why should i do that, my lad?"
35040,Homer,"well, i've put it off, but today i'm finally getting this garage organized--"
22130,Homer,"it's my duty, marge. besides, those mobsters don't scare me. bart, would you go start daddy's car?"
20047,Homer,"hey, you okay, grimy?"
14898,Homer,sounds interesting.
22467,Homer,"that's what i'm saying! see marge, this guy gets it."
31326,Homer,wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
39553,Homer,ohhh... get out of the corner!
28187,Homer,i wish i was death again. that was cool.
32568,Homer,who was it with?
14764,Homer,"hey, down in front."
13585,Homer,thanks everybody! it's great to be sane.
29474,Homer,"ah yes, detroit-style. very nice. so, you've been at moe's every night this week."
35683,Homer,"when i'm sad, i make baseball bats."
23719,Homer,if you'd've been awake you would have said no. you can see the bind i was in.
36813,Homer,old man... i'm not an old man... this drawing doesn't think i'm old.
26919,Homer,did you steal dolls from my daughter?
29512,Homer,easy... gentle...
21100,Homer,"c'mon, get in there. drop."
28197,Homer,whom? whom?
27094,Homer,precisely.
34493,Homer,"hey, would it be okay if i uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"
25604,Homer,aww... cereal? you know i like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried!
21128,Homer,"uhh, i don't know what to tell you."
30172,Homer,"hi, i'm homer simpson. i live next door. so, is that your whistle?"
35548,Homer,hey! wha?! wha?! wha?!
33462,Homer,"ha, ha! eat my food! drink up my drink! put your coat on my daughter's bed! i command you!"
20084,Homer,"well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to disneyland for real!"
15553,Homer,donuts. is there anything they can't do?
29308,Homer,"c'mon, say something conclusive."
40197,Homer,ah! uh... i'm just resting my eyes. holy moly! nine-thirty.
15880,Homer,nooooooo!
35910,Homer,audio book read by lenny. i'm not just another loudmouth. i'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say but not racist things!
16087,Homer,"hello, dean? you're a stupid head."
21971,Homer,uh...
22145,Homer,"that guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
15404,Homer,wow. a baby and a free burger. could this be the best day of my life?
33069,Homer,"so at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."
22795,Homer,"but, marge, i'm not like other men. that's why you buy my pants at that special store."
20172,Homer,"mister, we could use a man like sheriff lobo again."
17410,Homer,"... somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so i grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! i just wish i had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
34546,Homer,you used to be nicer!
19467,Homer,damn straight.
14649,Homer,let me pet him again!
17697,Homer,the next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
23984,Homer,work out!
29242,Homer,"a walk-in microwave! hey marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
20851,Homer,"uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. that's why i need a name that's cutting edge, like cutco... or edgecom... interslice... come on, marge -- you're good at these. help me out."
36235,Homer,cherries!
37004,Homer,society will not have to start from square one.
17920,Homer,"chauffeur's license, eh? mel, buckle your borscht belt!"
18484,Homer,you could live with grampa again.
23283,Homer,"aw, they're both good."
23158,Homer,"mel, you're coming off desperate. roll it, louie!"
13911,Homer,of course.
17502,Homer,i'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
17427,Homer,"hello. i am homer simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""father goose."" you know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. nobody cares that i didn't do it. but i didn't. okay, look, i've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. so i figured, ""we'll see about that."" so i get this big chunk of cinderblock and i..."
18701,Homer,"good morning, mr. burns. beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
29123,Homer,"oh, sorry, right."
13264,Homer,why you little...
23790,Homer,"ow, my legs! this is the worst pain ever..."
39182,Homer,"just tell me one thing, marge. why did you lose faith in the revue? i mean, ""cats and dogs"" writes itself. cats and dogs on capital hill / they don't get along and never will"
13726,Homer,to ned flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
30005,Homer,lisa sings so sweetly and bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
26589,Homer,i hope they're goin' somewhere good.
39062,Homer,"okay, okay. standing o or die!"
21101,Homer,woo hoo!
13754,Homer,huh? ahhh!! it's my problem! we're doomed!!!
25180,Homer,"now, for a little calming blue."
19179,Homer,woo hoo!
29482,Homer,"well... i'm worried about marge and moe. they've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. but it's not physical. so everything's great, right?"
37902,Homer,"welcome to ""cinema pirate-diso."" tonight's movie is ""life is funny,"" directed by judd apatow. it's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. so for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
39041,Homer,how do you break up with a guy?
32798,Homer,"boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
22028,Homer,procedure. deadly procedure.
34109,Homer,"oh, sweet meerschaum, take me away."
31087,Homer,really? well she's still great!
31504,Homer,greystash! greystash!
39603,Homer,oooh! credit.
29150,Homer,"okay, kids show off your pipes..."
28927,Homer,"marge, guess what! skinner wants to bail on his wedding!"
29055,Homer,i've run out of pie-related puns!
27252,Homer,our lives are ruined!
25905,Homer,what's the big deal? he sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
13212,Homer,"squeaky, squeaky, squeaky!"
13794,Homer,we could have seen a monkey.
16504,Homer,"uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. dealer busts. looks like you all win again."
23901,Homer,poor guy. he lost his leg.
33720,Homer,why... you... little...!
32692,Homer,that's my boy! now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
29399,Homer,i'm hangin' this over the mantel.
37392,Homer,day by day / day by day / i've got three kids / and two are okay / two are okay! / one of them is the baby / the smart one is mine maybe / i hope the boy gets rabies / day by day by day / day by day... / oh i pray / day by day by day by daaay!
38944,Homer,yes you are.
26077,Homer,pistol whip?!
39210,Homer,"marge, where's the extension cord?"
39406,Homer,"our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or i. many of them, incompetent boobs. i know this because i have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. and i say, this stinks!"
21992,Homer,uh-oh. tape must have fallen off.
31333,Homer,no she couldn't.

15207,Homer,bo-ring!
28770,Homer,i'll be right back.
40145,Homer,what could happen?

25875,Homer,"come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
41540,Homer,"oh elaine, will you ever find someone who's sponge-worthy?"
36252,Homer,"when the moon hits your eye / like a big pizza pie / that's amore / when the world seems... when you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid."

35373,Homer,"what do i do? patty's gonna kill me! unless... i kill her first! i put the body in the car, i dump the car in the lake, i put a james taylor cd in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
33354,Homer,"exception that proves the rule. if losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. watch, i'll prove it."
34220,Homer,you go rent us a truck.
41554,Homer,hey marge.
34825,Homer,you're lucky you're behind glass.

37724,Homer,so beautiful.
32438,Homer,that will never happen!
18003,Homer,"no, no, let me finish. i just want you to know i've always been proud of you. you're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. you helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. but you're also my daughter, and i don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
30869,Homer,"oh yeah, good times."
38498,Homer,i don't know. eat your broccoli.
23266,Homer,"i'll eat eggplant / i could even eat a baby deer... la la la la la la la la la la... who's that baby deer on the lawn, there..."
35811,Homer,"now relax, dottie. leave everything to me."
19708,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
13778,Homer,what? what is it? what are you doing?
31632,Homer,"i'm gonna get my revenge! and if i get caught, i'm pinning it on the baby like the time i shot mr. burns."
17911,Homer,what was that -- national anthem?
20804,Homer,"you gonna finish that, bony?"
29756,Homer,"boy, i wouldn't mind driving that to the holland, michigan tulip festival."
24929,Homer,"oh, no! an anti-escape orb!"

28194,Homer,"okay, that's good! stop there!"
40244,Homer,"uh... simp-sons, sir."
17898,Homer,you're really pushing it.
35292,Homer,now it feels like morning. what i am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
15720,Homer,so they say i might have a problem.
18793,Homer,no.
37223,Homer,text me the choices.
16374,Homer,just tucking him in.

32689,Homer,"what's the matter, son?"
14595,Homer,"i know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. go-get-all-your-money..."
38586,Homer,"i think he gets it. see, he--"
37217,Homer,who?
15299,Homer,"dear lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is klondike 5-3226."
16166,Homer,i knew you'd come crawling back.
39351,Homer,let's go get a burger.
15053,Homer,"lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?"
14275,Homer,"thanks, mom."
19547,Homer,we'll fake it and sell it to the fox network.
28465,Homer,"you hit him high, i'll hit him low!"

38039,Homer,where's that cake now?
34034,Homer,"oh fine, i guess i'm at your beck."
41099,Homer,dad! it's the third sunday of the month. you know what that means.
29188,Homer,"i'm so sorry, honey. i said good things about you too. check out the lifestyle section: ""plastic pearls make the girl."""
27336,Homer,"hey skinner! do you and edna want to join marge and me at ""great moments with mr. eisner""?"

30866,Homer,"oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."
31849,Homer,ronaldo?! winner of two world cups and three fifa player of the year awards?
36258,Homer,"so, bart, the little dickens, is going through that phase where young boys think their dad's an idiot."
32044,Homer,i have a right to my views.
15287,Homer,"adam west! hey kids, batman!"
13866,Homer,"oh, me and my trenchant mouth."

15888,Homer,"hello, dondelinger."
21448,Homer,"hmm, that's queer."
29537,Homer,"this is either about me, or steroids."
24731,Homer,"take that, lisa's beliefs."
22917,Homer,"hello, little girl, is your mommy home? you'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy mr. bouncy best-friend."
33310,Homer,huh? but how are we supposed to combine the dna of two strains of the same species?
23113,Homer,salt water seems to be good for it.
15521,Homer,maybe.
27564,Homer,woo hoo! you're still mine! and you thought i was a bad dad before.
31218,Homer,and what about my new job as a mexican wrestler?
16876,Homer,"we'll call you back! bart! with ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. we could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
39796,Homer,where am i... the planet cornball?
26167,Homer,i did it. i found our dog. now our christmas is complete.
38239,Homer,yes. but knowing that lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
13801,Homer,why you little...
39546,Homer,bart!
38428,Homer,lots of pizza.
13646,Homer,"well, why doesn't he just say so?"
19056,Homer,"attic? oh, that's silly. seriously, though, don't ever go up there."

24007,Homer,"you can do it, duncan. i don't care if your odds are... five million to one!?"
28813,Homer,and the peanuts in your mouth.
24530,Homer,"it was the best thanksgiving ever. i mean, emotionally, it was terrible. but the turkey was so moist."
29653,Homer,show you what it's like in the real world!
19230,Homer,it's so unfair. you're everything a dad could hope for.
34074,Homer,why do my actions have consequences?
21270,Homer,"they let me sign checks with a stamp, marge. a stamp!"
17713,Homer,"hmmm. with little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. well... i'll be in the tub."
39253,Homer,"not a word, marge. i'm heading straight for the tub."
26372,Homer,"i saw something terrible, and i can't even say it so i'll have these two dolls do it for me."
16125,Homer,"oh, let's just say i had help from a ""little magic box..."""
17804,Homer,"being a clown sucks. you get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. who am i clowning? i have no business being a clown. i'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
35349,Homer,"hm. so, should i bring a towel?"
28249,Homer,"okay, boy. flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus."
14162,Homer,wow. chocolate -- half price!
15365,Homer,he'll tire himself out soon.
15557,Homer,"now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
26367,Homer,just for twenty-five years.
28880,Homer,"lisa, lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. macarthur park is melting in the dark / all that sweet green icing rolling down / someone left my cake out in the li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li- li... li... li... li..."
14121,Homer,well... how are you?
20762,Homer,i've got it!
21642,Homer,that chair might be the only one he made.
20076,Homer,i guess.
21002,Homer,it's my first day.
37412,Homer,thank god i'm not in the shower!
38122,Homer,no. no. i can't be old yet. i won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till i'm fifty-two!
15556,Homer,"bart, warm up the car. we're going to duff gardens."
20539,Homer,"i'd like a yellow boat, please. with extra motors."
29105,Homer,"and now that my special girl has heard the truth, i know she'll forgive me."
33946,Homer,just you and me?
30589,Homer,burns' mansion?! that's mr. burns' mansion!
18856,Homer,"oh, owls, eh? so you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
17726,Homer,how about if i triple the business? then could i get a raise?
23758,Homer,"get 'em, boy. hit those smart-ass books."
18209,Homer,the springfield river!
28114,Homer,"boy, that slaked my thirst."

34814,Homer,come and get it.
22204,Homer,"he's a daredevil, ned. he laughs at death."
31939,Homer,is that one?
35408,Homer,suck! of course!
40666,Homer,"i'm sorry, officer. i know i was going too fast. just give me a ticket."
39937,Homer,"oh fantastic. marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. i was down at the kwik-e-mart minding my own business when... oooh oooh, ooh, the news."
22774,Homer,"i gave a rib to eve, and now she's gone forever."
35307,Homer,"no, no. i'm just a kid. leave me alone!"
20905,Homer,"let's get out of here, moe. this is goin' nowhere."
31395,Homer,oh i'm sorry. we should exchange insurance information. i have none.
14695,Homer,"lurleen, i can't get your song outta my mind. i haven't felt this way since ""funky town."""
37962,Homer,i didn't tell you about the basement.
36045,Homer,"i always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
32092,Homer,"now make every word ""beer."""
23218,Homer,do i get a card?
35923,Homer,"death to america! i mean, over here."
14726,Homer,stop it.
33302,Homer,"marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
15527,Homer,"hmmm, false... no, wait. maybe it's true."
14247,Homer,"good evening, madame. you have been selected by the good people of slash-co to reap the benefits of their new nev-r-dull knife-edge. here... shake hands with the slash-co."
31896,Homer,move over just a...

14014,Homer,"all right, i will! son, i don't think you should let me help you."
17478,Homer,"i know, but you're never supposed to tell the child."
16426,Homer,mindy has a motorcycle.
31068,Homer,so beautiful. i wish i could understand italian.
34239,Homer,"um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
38919,Homer,it's called a double standard. one of the bedrocks of parenting.
25498,Homer,but i'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare maggie away.
23420,Homer,i demand satisfaction! i challenge you to a duel.
31023,Homer,how did this happen?
25889,Homer,"oh, yeah... i forget things sometimes..."
33026,Homer,forgot my keys.
31576,Homer,shiiiii... pwreck!
23195,Homer,"okay, mr. difficult. how about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
31469,Homer,"i just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?"
15942,Homer,my wallet's in the car.
39396,Homer,i think we should put a stop sign at d street and twelfth. the other --
35195,Homer,"their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
14679,Homer,uh-huh.
37202,Homer,you won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
21775,Homer,"bye-bye, fishies! higher! higherrr!"
33957,Homer,"hm, i don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
19271,Homer,"yeah, well, i still get to punish you."
29900,Homer,what's in the box?
28981,Homer,"we don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
23350,Homer,"wow, it sure is slippery up here."
29929,Homer,real.
27704,Homer,three coats.
33936,Homer,"well, one thing's for sure: i'm not everyman."
18449,Homer,"listen here. my name is homer j. simpson. you guys think i'm dead, but i'm not. now i want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
25983,Homer,yello?

20938,Homer,"moe! oh, moe, thank god you're here!"
29111,Homer,"marge, i'm really sorry i hurt you. but i've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun i hid from you, the time i sued the church, ruining lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
21726,Homer,going where?
39652,Homer,"when you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. it becomes natural. like a third sense."
32615,Homer,i can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!
38590,Homer,woo hoo!
27435,Homer,"no, no worries. this is what all those hours of playing tetris were for."
34986,Homer,what are we doing here?
14746,Homer,"just so i don't wonder... you would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
15855,Homer,"i don't know. i flunked latin, too."
38263,Homer,um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. turn on eighty-nine point nine.
36525,Homer,"yes, and now look at us. only in america."
22938,Homer,clown.
21049,Homer,what's a jib?

21463,Homer,"no, no, honey. maybe this will help."
30754,Homer,"you sweet little angel. oh, i'm gonna rip your head off. and spit down your adorable little neck. because i wanna smash your little stupid head. oh, but i love you we'll go on a fishing trip. but first i'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. that's what i'm gonna do!"
18343,Homer,arrgh!
16655,Homer,your old meat made me sick!
31860,Homer,"lisa, honey, i bought you something. a dvd!"
16114,Homer,perfect.

24236,Homer,i know what you mean. our dog had that.
40497,Homer,"ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god."
15515,Homer,get to the money!
35013,Homer,are you gonna kill me now? 'cause i'm super ready.
22054,Homer,"well, actually, you did..."
33461,Homer,"marge, lighten up. even grampa's enjoying himself."
35663,Homer,woo-hoo!
30867,Homer,"wow, i can actually feel the heat."
22804,Homer,"how 'bout it, bart? would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
15868,Homer,ed sullivan.
30171,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i've taken every precaution."
15093,Homer,and that is that.
41171,Homer,"all right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
21745,Homer,you intergalactic hussy! how could you?! was he better than me?
24763,Homer,blue spanish eyes / teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes...
16001,Homer,i'll give her a good home.
18690,Homer,"uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your mom's done fitting in."
33545,Homer,can't someone help me with this puzzle?
16006,Homer,"oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! oh wait, it's for bart."
22214,Homer,"way to go, flanders. the bible's finally pulling its weight. got any more holy numbers?"

20362,Homer,"all right, put your... oh well, i'll rob it next time."
16545,Homer,"well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! and remember when i let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like santa claus?"
21523,Homer,"li-sa, i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. but apparently this new girl is. so my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
25336,Homer,booo! you rot!
27166,Homer,woo hoo! i win the bet! who's your daddy?
32814,Homer,"and remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and tv movies. regular movies, don't hold your breath. but tv movies, the sky's the limit."
34386,Homer,"hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do i sign up?"
30612,Homer,why you little...
40086,Homer,"well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
21691,Homer,i see a horn!
13517,Homer,"mr. burns, you brought us a present."
19731,Homer,"no. how can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? you're a grown man."
34699,Homer,"well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. so, i decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny i left in my pants went."
16131,Homer,yes.
26969,Homer,shuttle's in the hangar!
30087,Homer,"all right, everybody. pair up with a rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity."
18305,Homer,"oh, no. better ride this one out in the closet."
35717,Homer,okay -- maggie gets a toy!
34487,Homer,"i'm there every day, five to eleven."
21061,Homer,i am?
13992,Homer,bart!... bart!!!
29880,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
37181,Homer,waldo. waldo.
21107,Homer,i'm very happy to meet you.
13146,Homer,that's 'cause i've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
28589,Homer,i'll assemble it myself.
40135,Homer,i don't know.
20890,Homer,"hey, i thought your mother told you to take a bath."
34155,Homer,just with indifference.
15850,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
36514,Homer,"i was thinking about you. it's your birthday in like three, four months? would it be weird if i threw you a party?"
27987,Homer,"all right, you're not a coward. and that's beside the point because--"
41029,Homer,and some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! like tail fins! and bubble domes! and shag carpeting!
18579,Homer,"mr. burns, i, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
40247,Homer,"wow! flash bailor came on to my wife! you've still got the magic, marge."
40760,Homer,"debate? like, arguing?"
27392,Homer,"oh yes. well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! how did you spend a thousand dollars?"
25961,Homer,this thing pays for itself.
36089,Homer,yes! awake! let's do this!
39364,Homer,march your butt right out here. now!
40352,Homer,"that was just a practice shot, boy."
28992,Homer,"oh yeah, like people in new jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. it's on the freakin' state flag."
33261,Homer,hm. usually that ends the dream.
37861,Homer,"well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior i want to encourage in you. i'm in. a hundred percent!"
19781,Homer,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
33055,Homer,"hmmm, you make a good case. i'll take it!"
21548,Homer,"uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... scotland."
37802,Homer,"okay, i've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. the sky is blue, but no one really knows why. don't believe what they tell you. girls are great and terrible at the same time. get used to it. and, most importantly-- oops, we're here. you'll have to figure it out on your own."
23981,Homer,takin' care of business!
15677,Homer,you'll do as your told.
17234,Homer,"but marge, i was a political prisoner."
24543,Homer,missed me! stupid horoscope!
14886,Homer,oh yeah?
29620,Homer,"if you love the bible so much, why don't you marry it? in fact, i now pronounce you and the bible man and wife. and you're the wife. you owe me two hundred bucks."
20256,Homer,little marge...
37950,Homer,bart! your comic vendor's here!
30624,Homer,it's a lamborgotti fasterosa xt 550 with abs sport tech package.
17500,Homer,jokes on them. i'm still alive.
19500,Homer,"we're number one! we're number one! in your face, space coyote!"
21409,Homer,"feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? that's what my heart's doing all the time. bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
27224,Homer,who wants to eat a loser?
29093,Homer,i'm elvis. elvis jagger. elvis jagger abdul-jabbar.
25457,Homer,i'm soooo hungry.
31570,Homer,"dear marge, how are you? i am fine. the waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. and the salt water is rising. what's next? pepper water? ha ha. love ya, homer simpson."
26945,Homer,"well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth."
16768,Homer,stupid rod. i got gypped.
32991,Homer,"no, it looks cool!"
18606,Homer,awww.
27763,Homer,"oh! oh, yeah."
20714,Homer,"who, me?"
30385,Homer,i have to do this for work.
26518,Homer,i'm still hungry.
22847,Homer,"wow. it's like marge's dream come true... for me! isn't that great, marge?! for me!"
30009,Homer,"much of the tune is plagiarized. now go, go, go!"
24066,Homer,"sleep tight, neddie."
30467,Homer,forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
28083,Homer,now i'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
24896,Homer,"let's see now... ""bulletin: new race discovered living six inches under... denver."""
33203,Homer,what is it?
22528,Homer,how the hell should i know? just get in this cage.
28835,Homer,that was you!?
25256,Homer,but try tellin' that to killy mcgee up there.
27221,Homer,"i know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, lenny."
21953,Homer,"hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? oh, i can't afford that."
22464,Homer,"oh, this is the worst party ever."
29544,Homer,dammit!
39455,Homer,"boy, i'm glad that's over. now we can go home and act normal again."
30822,Homer,protect the duck! protect the duck! produck the tect!
32881,Homer,"you're right, boy!"
14745,Homer,i'm sorry lurleen. all i wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and i've done that. now i better get out of here before i lose my family.
40742,Homer,j.
18374,Homer,"oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
24609,Homer,"hey, that's not me!"
40449,Homer,"hey, i don't see your name engraved on the bar stool."
33076,Homer,"how's the war going? we're winning, that's great! and our standing abroad? fantastic!"
20022,Homer,"no, no. he doesn't know he's coming to dinner. i didn't think he'd come, so i called and said i had something really important to tell him and that i could only tell him about it here."
39377,Homer,"moe, i think i'll have another -- -- whoops. moe, i'm a little low on funds. you think could cover me just this once?"
19764,Homer,"yeah! and that's another thing! i resent ""you people"" using that word. that's our word for making fun of you. we need it! well, i'm taking back our word and i'm taking back my son!"
34708,Homer,arctic circle! i just got that!
35637,Homer,"do this, do that. lousy roz, thinks she's so big..."
23418,Homer,heavyset? what's that supposed to mean?
19463,Homer,"wha? golf course? did i dream that whole thing? maybe the desert was just this sand trap... oh, and i bet that crazy pyramid was just the pro shop!"
23183,Homer,"it's your plan, from ""braveheart."" your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
39780,Homer,"you know, i've been thinking... everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. but your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. i don't know how you do it. you've just got a gift, i guess. i've always thought so. i just never mentioned it. but it's time you knew how i feel. i don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...goodbye, my wife."
13424,Homer,no.
38526,Homer,okily dokahama?!
26552,Homer,"okay, i'll try the green."
29682,Homer,"you name it, oh wise mountain ape."
30568,Homer,silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
32149,Homer,"if i'm gonna tell that woman the truth, i'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
20991,Homer,"woo hoo! beer, beer, beer!"
38965,Homer,i'm beat.
13478,Homer,an elephant's butt.
13683,Homer,"hey, boy. how was class?"
20250,Homer,you call that prime rib?
27911,Homer,don't yell at ned!
25594,Homer,anything for these noble animals.
16267,Homer,"how can you do this, marge? how can you desert your children?"
29286,Homer,"well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough."
27740,Homer,get rid of a bird? no way. their eyes are so expressive.
34340,Homer,"i've got to apologize. once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
40778,Homer,i'm... a spare. excuse me.
19621,Homer,why get up? here's a little move i've been tinkering with. say i want that bowl of dip.
33341,Homer,is it some place i have to put on a tie?
35032,Homer,stupid flanders' wi-fi!
26371,Homer,then it's settled. we leave springfield forever.
30764,Homer,"woo hoo! vegas here i come! oh right, bart."
17930,Homer,it's a big country.
30782,Homer,it's not supposed to.
14048,Homer,"boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. sheesh, what an ego."
31136,Homer,"yes, yes. the game you played so horribly at."
25977,Homer,"but on the other hand, moe's not here."
28080,Homer,that i fixed with new words!
15606,Homer,bart!
21528,Homer,"if she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys."
31960,Homer,"hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen ionic breeze."
14678,Homer,... that's true.
35986,Homer,"less blathering, more slathering."
22449,Homer,nah. just park it.
25952,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll find out what he's up to. kids shouldn't have secrets."
40443,Homer,"yeah, boy. get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness."
25333,Homer,"hey, that's great. listen, i need a new doubles partner. my little girl's a lead weight."
13622,Homer,"look, marge, that guy has the same last name we do... taxi!"
17862,Homer,"yeah, that's right barney. this year i invested in pumpkins. they've been going up the whole month of october, and i got a feeling they're gonna peak right around january. and bang, that's when i'll cash in."
34606,Homer,"oh no! i don't have to listen to you. if i'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
27666,Homer,that's a great idea. why didn't you say something before?
37760,Homer,good as new. and thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. it may be a little stretched out.
28347,Homer,"dear god of england: please let me go. in return i will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and i'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, i can't do it. it's so stupid!"
26751,Homer,grape.
24745,Homer,you call that saying grace?!
33522,Homer,never! hooray for stupid flanders!
25665,Homer,"flanders has cooties, flanders has cooties."
30824,Homer,woo hoo! i won!
33648,Homer,"thank you, that's very... more sarcasm."
16314,Homer,"marge, it's the perfect exercise. it'll double the value of our house. and it was free. freeee!!"
20290,Homer,"okay, okay. it's your sugar, bart."
15434,Homer,huh?
39468,Homer,i wish i could hear what they're saying.
26261,Homer,wait. you went to a sugar factory? were there oompa-loompas?
31102,Homer,don't start the exhibit without me!
36351,Homer,well...
38667,Homer,"marge, i'd like you to meet leela and fry."
20614,Homer,"man, the air feels good on my neck!"
15971,Homer,wait'll i tell marge!
14580,Homer,lurleen.
17604,Homer,and by the sacred parchment i swear that if i reveal the secrets of the stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
29849,Homer,"marge, i thought you'd never take me back after what i did to krusty."
25603,Homer,breakfast!
18044,Homer,"marge, anyone can miss canada... all tucked away down there."
41567,Homer,spread yellow gunk / on my pancake heart / country-churned girl / in my grocery cart
31359,Homer,"yeah, marge always loves your cards. well, you may not be the smartest guys in the army..."
23450,Homer,just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
16692,Homer,are we in india yet?
28963,Homer,"okay, don't go. just stay here and rot with grampa."
35022,Homer,are you through with the chair? i've got to do the taxes.
34509,Homer,playing nursemaid to chief wiggum.
22310,Homer,"oh, marge. that's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain."
18230,Homer,why? that was the problem in the first place. you were going broke because we were your only customers. wasn't that the problem in the first place? that you were going broke... moe?
14273,Homer,marge!... marge!...
34464,Homer,i don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
23776,Homer,"oh, precious heirlooms! daddy would never let them take you."
33622,Homer,"hello. it's me, lance romance."
35881,Homer,but i have to go to the bathroom!
32033,Homer,smile. look cheerful. here we go...
19392,Homer,"oh, him."
21790,Homer,"a gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses."
14194,Homer,your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
33487,Homer,bart! don't forget to turn the chicken!
35765,Homer,"just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
18764,Homer,get lost!
33836,Homer,that's another twenty or thirty years.
37545,Homer,"and what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
28904,Homer,my poor boy is miserable in here. there has to be something i can do to help him.
14812,Homer,disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! a pox on them!
39242,Homer,"what's with the crazy getup, barn?"
41307,Homer,"homer simpson! do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? what would jesus do?"
31257,Homer,"...i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, infinity. i never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
34153,Homer,how can you stand up to this punishment?
13163,Homer,i found this stone earlier. i was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but i want you to have it.
18806,Homer,"you can't let yourself end up in a place like this. you've got two choices: you can give up on yourself and take the barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
14774,Homer,there was a little spanish flea... a record star he thought he'd be... he heard of singers like beatles... the chipmunks he'd seen on tv... why not a little spanish flea? and so he hid... inside a dog...
40771,Homer,hel-lo.
40278,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. you can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. you make me sick."
14831,Homer,herb!
25560,Homer,that's okay. i got 'em.
32405,Homer,"don't worry, boy. they'll find your parents soon."
19081,Homer,stop! those candidates are phonies!
14391,Homer,you promised you wouldn't get mad!
40318,Homer,okay. i wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
16626,Homer,"yeah, you kids gotta go to school. i gotta go to work. the only one who has it easy is marge."
28210,Homer,world's biggest pizza?!
26226,Homer,"you know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face."
29499,Homer,"oh, it's true. i don't know marge at all. i'll just go home now."
18127,Homer,found 'em!
15348,Homer,easy... easy...
30363,Homer,"although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
41042,Homer,"no! no! no! bad dog! let go! bad santa's little helper! stop it! no, not the sports section! no!"
16120,Homer,"actually, i've been working on a plan. during the exam, i'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
34058,Homer,"oh i don't think so! you know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? she's the first lady of france, carla bruni!"
16962,Homer,because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
35819,Homer,this family time is so precious. gotta go.
39060,Homer,gonna be a tight fit.
37658,Homer,what the hell does gooble goo mean?
40321,Homer,who told? marge! beer me!
32366,Homer,at your funeral.
39176,Homer,one am lovin' and two am steak? night marriage rules! i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
40178,Homer,"-- surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"
29446,Homer,dammit.
22835,Homer,"lisa, all great artists love free food. check out jasper johns."
21987,Homer,yeah... pinchy?... pinchy?!... oh... pinchy!!!
24004,Homer,"hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
26724,Homer,it should be gary oldman!
21602,Homer,"as long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. now, here's how it works: lisa, you say one thing, then bart, you say another. just toss out things and i'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea."
13291,Homer,me concur.
30198,Homer,the smoke will wake us up.
21124,Homer,ooh! a trillion-dollar bill? 'atsa spicy meatball!
19086,Homer,oh no! what have i done? what am i doing? what will i do?!
32441,Homer,oh my god! the prophecy is being fulfilled.
15502,Homer,"darn right. and to make sure, i want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows."
21637,Homer,"look, mr. edison, i did it. i'm an inventor! and i owe it all to you."
35263,Homer,tickle tickle too!
18639,Homer,"okay, let's give it up for the new guy. now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. hello? hello?"
40566,Homer,five hundred thousand dollars!
27847,Homer,"oh, i didn't realize you've been counting the years. is it that horrible living with me?"
16554,Homer,"curse you, magic beans."
22468,Homer,tree-huggers...
31894,Homer,pay to the order of... stupid reverend... memo: bite my ass ... wha?!
14091,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
35955,Homer,"you faked it?! lisa, how could you?!"
39677,Homer,just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. food!
39739,Homer,"oh, no. come on, come on! open up!"
22047,Homer,"uh, excuse me, i'm fleeing in shame and i'd like to look my best."
34132,Homer,uh-oh.
35565,Homer,don't buy it! i bought one last year and it was crap construction!
27933,Homer,stop shoving! the little one isn't getting any.
21897,Homer,"okay, okay. narc."
39346,Homer,jeez. no beer... no opera dogs...
36503,Homer,wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
37526,Homer,"oh, we're still on for tomorrow night."
15767,Homer,that's-a-nice-a-donut.
13663,Homer,heyyyy.
26230,Homer,i don't know.
16493,Homer,"oh, baby."
37140,Homer,shows how much she... knooooows! it's hurting my eyes!
26516,Homer,that pig looks like lenny.
32625,Homer,now for a victory cigar.
17167,Homer,"marge, i want you to stop seeing this jacque. you can let him down gently. but over the next couple of months, i want you to break it off."
23025,Homer,"""gigabytes!"" they've done it again. gigabytes. wait, this isn't ""weird."" why, there's no magazine called ""weird,"" is there?"
36131,Homer,"pretty dope, don't you think?"
16064,Homer,"yes! take that, bitterman!"
35273,Homer,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
21343,Homer,"wake up, you lazy sherpas. we've got a mountain to climb!"
40417,Homer,"i know, i will."
28309,Homer,would an american dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
24428,Homer,"okay, but i ain't payin' for two weddin's."
15301,Homer,"uh, huh, that's mr. plow."
39821,Homer,barney!
39777,Homer,i gave you advice? get outta here.
33988,Homer,woo hoo!
35609,Homer,"uh-oh, it's old man burns!"
32713,Homer,three please!
28832,Homer,"oh, i'm so bored! maybe i'll clean out my wallet."
18589,Homer,"marge, you're missing the point. the individual doesn't matter. it was a team effort and i was the one who came up with the whole team idea. me."
15758,Homer,"people stop! we can't give up our dental plan! lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
15364,Homer,why you little...
18912,Homer,"thank you, honey."
36237,Homer,"oh lord, i have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. if you can weasel me out of this physical, i will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. amen. now to mumble in a religious fashion. dear god, oh, lord oh god, oh, lord..."
38850,Homer,"you planted that on me, man!"
38790,Homer,"hey, um, you gonna be okay?"
32154,Homer,marge... i've gotta be honest...
28884,Homer,i'm here to deliver a package to marge simpson.
13595,Homer,i had a feeling it was too good to be true. every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
29916,Homer,"but that's not true, bart saw him at the builder's barn."
16559,Homer,"marge, they're only human."
14743,Homer,my whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
19142,Homer,uh... yessir. no problemo.
38577,Homer,he is me!
36019,Homer,"that's right, sucker! it's valentine's day, and i've got a date with some fastballs!"
17783,Homer,that's it! you people have stood in my way long enough. i'm going to clown college!
25635,Homer,"did you ever see that ""blue man group?"" total rip-off of the smurfs. and the smurfs? they suck."
33170,Homer,lemonade!
40277,Homer,"you wanted to see me, ""tex""?"
37452,Homer,to the best feeling in the world -- money.
21468,Homer,are you ready to rock? 'cause heeere we go!
34092,Homer,"i see. so you're saying ""warming"" makes it colder. well, aren't you the queen of crazyland? everything's the opposite of everything. la-de-da-de-da! i'm lisa simpson. la-de-da-de-da."
32772,Homer,"because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. but you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!"
31292,Homer,"uh, no. just gas."

31597,Homer,may we? may we? mais oui!
15779,Homer,nope. nope. nope.
19323,Homer,oh yeah. you gotta do that.
38517,Homer,"aye-aye, sir."

18864,Homer,eh... truth. ask me anything.
24961,Homer,a good son would come through for his dad!
38132,Homer,"the kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave."
25601,Homer,i was wondering what became of him.
27668,Homer,i see a bad moon rising...

17652,Homer,"go knightboat, go!"
35622,Homer,i thought of it first.
38611,Homer,useless left-handed crap.
39958,Homer,"gee, a romantic evening. nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
32873,Homer,who told you these things about me?!
33316,Homer,"your bees died days ago. these are their angry, mutant descendants. and they're tough enough to live in any environment."
28834,Homer,"that's it. from now on i'm not looking forward to anything. oh my god, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! i can't wait!"
21551,Homer,ow! stop pummeling me! it's really painful!
31173,Homer,uh... she was here a minute ago. she must be pooping.
14268,Homer,you the boss?
26869,Homer,you'd be dead a million times.
24202,Homer,"not bad, lisa junior. but god's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume."
26308,Homer,broken jaw?
37890,Homer,i wonder what else is chicks?

36610,Homer,"i, uh, hope it's twins!"
36584,Homer,would you go to the prom with me?
17978,Homer,"sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that i mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
30670,Homer,i don't care what that letter said. this man raised me single-handedly. when i think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
28945,Homer,which are you saying is dead? our marriage or our batteries?
29048,Homer,"i was in so deep, i forgot pies were food."
29353,Homer,you broke in!
39987,Homer,ooops. time for a fill-up. garçon! another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
13918,Homer,stable? that sounds expensive.
13523,Homer,exactly. it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
23518,Homer,"thank god, there's one left!"
29230,Homer,"fine, me."
36556,Homer,"okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""magic craphole waste removal,"" but it wasn't me."
28010,Homer,uh... a lighter.
37233,Homer,why does everything i forbid always happen?
31125,Homer,"tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?"
23132,Homer,'preciate it.
15079,Homer,do you sell toys?
13492,Homer,why did you do that?
30156,Homer,"sensual, isn't it? and the best part is stupid flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. hence my nickname, stupid flanders."
18548,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not."
37382,Homer,"now, for the record, i hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. i never hated the church itself. and now, finally, i believe in something bigger than myself."
40986,Homer,hello in there.
40579,Homer,"well, that's it. i guess this is the class i'm gonna die in."
27078,Homer,to rock!
29962,Homer,"c'mon, son. you can fight this. do the bartman. do the bartman!"

19359,Homer,now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
15678,Homer,"ah, sweet pity. where would my love life have been without it?"
19456,Homer,"you know, i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and i would -- hey!!"
16722,Homer,"hello. well, today's the day for homer j. i know i'm gonna win this time."
39640,Homer,"now don't worry. our situation isn't as bad as it seems. and you're forgetting, i'm an experienced woodsman. now you all stay here for a minute while i go over this way and try to get my bearings."
17304,Homer,"oh, i wish i wish i hadn't killed that fish."
27073,Homer,"i'm okay. i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you..."
34327,Homer,well don't be wrong in front of our son!
32377,Homer,"oh, i'm not decent. let me throw something on!"
37093,Homer,now i can finally complete my bucket list.
33494,Homer,poltergeist in the closet...
25522,Homer,so all her bullying was just to get some attention.
27249,Homer,"you monsters! you've turned this show into a ""survivor"" clone."
15822,Homer,"what a lovely surprise! you're here to see me, right?"
25000,Homer,how'd you get wise to us?
35653,Homer,need more butter! and not the unsalted.

39009,Homer,"oh my god! brace yourselves, family. we're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. boy, get me my baseball bat."
27242,Homer,"all right, let's see what we've got here."
20920,Homer,"no, you look a little nervous, lisa."
33985,Homer,"well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night."
15900,Homer,whack! whack! whack!

13693,Homer,"sorry, flanders."
22413,Homer,"yeah. ""bart."""
15135,Homer,he's the boy you love to hate.
17839,Homer,"that's tough but fair. boy, go with the man."
35458,Homer,but you learned! you grew!
18268,Homer,"lisa, you ruined my barbecue. i demand you apologize this second!"
23379,Homer,uh-oh.
22303,Homer,perfect.
13273,Homer,"oh, right."
39531,Homer,"unfortunately, son, we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own."
35215,Homer,it is so cool for you to let me go on tour with cheech.
22321,Homer,stem lube. even i didn't fall for that... although winter is coming...
20339,Homer,yuh.
17780,Homer,"well, i got everything i was supposed to get. i'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. that advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
23114,Homer,"um, i'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. can i have my prize now?"
32262,Homer,"wow, i'd really like to meet this guy."
30903,Homer,"so it would appear. however, cousin it, there, was born a woman."
32727,Homer,"listen, baby. the other night was great, but it can never happen again. oh, who am i kidding? i have to see you right now!"
27079,Homer,are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!
36371,Homer,"i'unno... lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely."
22832,Homer,this lady says i'm an artist.
22378,Homer,"dog, cat?"
22644,Homer,"well, that's a relief."
26855,Homer,"y'ello! hi, mrs. bellamy. no, i'm not doing anything. i can mow your lawn."
19442,Homer,hey buddy! get back there with the other rocks!
31434,Homer,"honey, i brought you more sticks."
29502,Homer,and you're my margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
32756,Homer,"i thought this might happen, so i brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
14008,Homer,"okay. no, i'm gonna do it."
30041,Homer,i don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
31533,Homer,scottsdale? will we stay at a tripletree resort?
26032,Homer,i would.
15386,Homer,what? what?
27069,Homer,"""the rolling stones rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!!"" but i thought you guys were mad at me. for once in my life, i'm confused."
41213,Homer,what? where're your going? i--
37366,Homer,wait a minute! this has oats in it!
33761,Homer,there's no future in that!
34982,Homer,"oregano, basil, rosemary..."
36174,Homer,free it is!
26159,Homer,how was that?
36430,Homer,"strad, where are you?"

31123,Homer,the isotopes are winning? to the bandwagon!
14981,Homer,"marge, come to bed."
38378,Homer,"come on, buddy. just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
28427,Homer,hold on. something doesn't feel right.
36522,Homer,"son, you can dial down the crazy. your mother and i talked about it and we found a way to get to new york. it's all set, boy. to save money, we're swapping houses."
32312,Homer,"and to pay you back, i'm returning your nose."
17313,Homer,"uh oh, it's seeping in! stupid cheap weather stripping."
15182,Homer,mmm... soylent green.
23928,Homer,"marge, you're right. we do have to have a party."
21780,Homer,"what? oh, already?"
31427,Homer,"i said, god bless america!"
20094,Homer,"oh, i don't want to go to new york city."
20940,Homer,"moe, you gotta get me outta here. tell the cops i didn't steal the car. say you lent it to me."
36648,Homer,"wait, the frog in the trench coat is kermit too?"
41566,Homer,he who is tired of weird al is tired of life.
18090,Homer,"are you kidding? being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for marge, god forbid; and i can run background checks on whomever i want mohammar--"
13630,Homer,"miss? what does the ""i"" stand for?"
17290,Homer,i've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. ok. don't panic. remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
17480,Homer,"kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... put it away, boy... situation. and your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. starting right now, i promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
40361,Homer,"son, this is the only time i'm ever gonna say this. it is not okay to lose."
26109,Homer,"look at me, i'm a famous historian! out of my way!"
13170,Homer,"i've gotta go, i've got a date!"
27084,Homer,"ooh, i'm telling mr. jagger."
34823,Homer,i'll take... that one.
40531,Homer,"sit down, boy!"
24419,Homer,that's perfect! we can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
30693,Homer,"wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
37331,Homer,marriage is so tough. every second it could explode catastrophically. makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
22979,Homer,"all right, a gross-out contest! grandma plopwell, you've done it again."
34889,Homer,stupid dog!
24889,Homer,finally.
41033,Homer,"bullseye! and another thing. when i gun the motor, i want people to think the world is coming to an end! vroom! vroom! vroom!"
30706,Homer,dad...
14028,Homer,"oh, sure, i'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. this is how you get your kicks, isn't it, lisa?"
30206,Homer,"hey! i'm bart simpson's father, and i'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! hey, what's that smell?"
39694,Homer,no we don't. try being objective for once in your... oooh!
35045,Homer,i don't like those guys.
31464,Homer,marge?
25707,Homer,"woo! you da man, carl. i believe you can fly."
39096,Homer,"sorry, fellas. there's a movement i have to join. i've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating."
27838,Homer,marge... did i ruin your life?
14201,Homer,"oh. well he's always happy. no, wait. he's always mad."
28476,Homer,then whose garter is this?
22189,Homer,"one day soon i will come for you, and then the game will begin. could be in the middle of the night. it could be when you least expect it. or whatever's good for you. i don't care."
18515,Homer,"go on, maggie. go. go."
23501,Homer,"oh, great. i got a field full of mutants."
39119,Homer,"hey, marge. i'm supposed to help drive the kids? oh, man, i wish i knew that sooner, but i just had a beer."
33201,Homer,"and these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
20326,Homer,ahh.
34571,Homer,"hey! not on the rug! you bad dog! ow! ow! ow! stop biting my leg! ow! alright, that's it! you're going outside!"
33478,Homer,and it was gooood.
34785,Homer,"ooh, got a text."
28207,Homer,"from what, too much hot fudge? huh? c'mon bart, show me some love!"
40380,Homer,that's right!
16116,Homer,and all those other pranks were my idea too. i'm the one who should be expelled.
35573,Homer,"bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
20247,Homer,so do i.
36826,Homer,beer keg do-nut?
14862,Homer,"i try, but i can't."
25627,Homer,"okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women."
26709,Homer,"this'll teach that stupid chair. i'm on fire! oh, i hope no one's drawing this. ow!"
32414,Homer,"boy, stop talking to yourself!"
39071,Homer,what the?
25306,Homer,"hello, marge."
20526,Homer,"actually, it's more like twelve. no, i'm so stupid, seven. it's seven hours. you have seven hours. see? seven."
34310,Homer,so that's why i love drinking so much.
34452,Homer,eat my lunch?
41510,Homer,how could you let me turn into you.
40241,Homer,"lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. it comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
18293,Homer,"well... i acquired it legally, you can be sure of that."
41179,Homer,"what?! marge, you have to."
23731,Homer,... and those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look i get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
24872,Homer,no way! mr. x is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
25164,Homer,the wrestler?
18364,Homer,"oh, two-twenty-five?! that means i lost weight!"
36941,Homer,"yeah, mom, you promised!"
20849,Homer,mmm... memo.

33291,Homer,duh!
16495,Homer,"oh, margie, you came and you found me a turkey, on my vacation away from workey..."
33199,Homer,"hey, what's going on?"

21958,Homer,uh-oh.
31764,Homer,aw. our kids used to be so cute!
28754,Homer,pre-nursery school?!
18950,Homer,"if we pass proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest americans of all."
30471,Homer,i'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
25463,Homer,"oh, i'm wasting away. i'm down to a b-cup."
20534,Homer,put me down! ganesh commands you! oh-ho-ho-ho!
19388,Homer,"aw, shoot."
41426,Homer,"well, if we put our heads together, we can think of a plan."
40804,Homer,"oh, okay."
20892,Homer,don't worry. daddy'll fix it.
37877,Homer,"wait, you guys saw the new radioactive man sequel?"
33209,Homer,i wanna change my bet... i'm going against my daughter.
27614,Homer,"oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. only very serious daddy business can tear me from your side."
22760,Homer,don't mind if i do!
38642,Homer,the eyes in that picture are following me.
15503,Homer,"bed goes up... kids, i want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. let's see... uh... oh, i'm no good at this."
26742,Homer,"well son, i wanna show you how grateful i am. let's go fishing."
34831,Homer,be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
15112,Homer,he was a zombie?
36757,Homer,"get him! i mean, woo hoo!"
32247,Homer,no problem.
18498,Homer,"go back to massachusetts, pinko!"
23636,Homer,"oh, you do love me!"
23456,Homer,hang on.
34059,Homer,"if you fire me, i'll call president sarkozy and he'll be all over you like truffaut on hitchcock."
19350,Homer,"okay, ready."

37368,Homer,"padre, can i be honest with you? i've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. but there isn't."

13687,Homer,"uh, well actually, moe..."
27171,Homer,"well, if bart can be ""el barto""..."
27799,Homer,"you may be a smart kid, lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."

28313,Homer,"we're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the usa. we saved your ass in vietnam and shared our prostitutes with hugh grant. so give me some free maps, and none of that dry british wit."
15479,Homer,"well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and i'm not gonna sugarcoat it."

29307,Homer,"but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
20724,Homer,"did ya hear that, bart? the carny code. bart, did you hear that?"
28203,Homer,"okay, get ready to laugh!"
40896,Homer,"ugh, ah, hello, mr. burns. would you like to watch the fight?"

40609,Homer,"it's so hard to choose. it all looks so terrible. just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those."
34542,Homer,what the? who turned off the wind?
29061,Homer,"no, not him! anyone but him! i've had my problems with him. everyone has. but like every monster, he just wants to be loved."

31034,Homer,"mark and tracy, i remember the first words i heard you say: ""i do."""
28162,Homer,does this mean they'll never cancel the jim belushi show?
34301,Homer,"well i don't. the motto of the simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead."""
16138,Homer,i'm writing a delicious send up of mr. burns for his birthday party. is poo poo one word or two?
22066,Homer,"no you're not, dad."
13718,Homer,yes it is.

16889,Homer,"grooming him, eh?"
28398,Homer,can i fight human-style? by slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
21098,Homer,"if i don't see it, it's not illegal!"
39746,Homer,be right there.
24927,Homer,i'm tired of being drugged and gagged. there's gotta be a way to escaped.
17520,Homer,"uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, i'm gonna let you do most of the work. i think you're ready for it, alan."

28026,Homer,"stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. i miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!"
34150,Homer,how would he know grampa was going to die today? unless... he was going to kill him! but would someone really kill a man just to win a pulitzer prize?
37043,Homer,"way to get us back on topic, marge."
24869,Homer,i did it. i changed the world. now i know exactly how god feels.
18263,Homer,thanks flanders. i have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
33023,Homer,what have you done to my family?
37812,Homer,"hi maggie, if you could talk, i know you'd have a few choice words for me."
20454,Homer,"what? well, i got news for you, mister. you can't quit! you're cut! you too, milhouse."
37228,Homer,"your grandfather is super lame! i mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?"
22217,Homer,"oh, that. that can be treated with our good friend alcohol. you might want to write that down. where the hell's your notebook?"
40601,Homer,"oh, try me."
30141,Homer,"shut up, flanders, i need a favor. would you mind watching maggie for a while? it would only be until later."
37051,Homer,maybe the last words i'll ever write.
39740,Homer,ah... no.
39415,Homer,what?
31150,Homer,and i say a monkey can mow our lawn!
23372,Homer,"hey, foamy, i want the news, not the weather. marge, did you hear me zing werewolf flanders?"

32430,Homer,"hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. now i know why pimps are so happy."
18634,Homer,"hey, big spender!..."
40212,Homer,"oh, marge. what's the big deal? i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had."
40345,Homer,you are my brother. i love you and yet i feel a great sadness in my bosom.
41212,Homer,"thinking is your department, jerk! that's what i pay you in beer for!"
27918,Homer,"well, i guess we could afford one nice trip."
22093,Homer,woo hoo!
29509,Homer,"oh, i've only got a hundred dollars. i'd better bid shrewdly."
16084,Homer,"all right, i will."
30690,Homer,i'm sorry... i got a little carried away there.
14335,Homer,twenty big ones on denver.
16988,Homer,"oh, i miss you too, marge. but the law needs me. i'll be home as soon as i can."
35844,Homer,christmas card photos?!!
26939,Homer,"you know, the old lady's apartment was actually lenny's. we just used a different duvet cover."

38727,Homer,"oh, i don't have what it takes to play guitar. i mean, i'm no joe walsh in the brains department."
28304,Homer,what?
40841,Homer,"don't worry, marge. take a look at this."
23425,Homer,huh?
20909,Homer,"aw, come on, moe. think of all you have to offer besides money."

39881,Homer,political what?
21062,Homer,very well then. i'm a captain.
20524,Homer,all you need is a car bomb and...

28734,Homer,"thank you. thank you. remember, my dog up and died. thank you."
13664,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders! i'm wishing as fast as i can!"
21226,Homer,i want to register to run for sanitation commissioner. and tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
35198,Homer,i've failed as a parent. i swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. to the media room!
41327,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson, a.k.a. ""happy dude."" the court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. i'm sorry. if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one dollar to sorry dude, 742 evergreen terrace, springfield... you have the power."
39124,Homer,there's no guys! we haven't made any money.
18791,Homer,"no time, marge. i think mr. burns wants me to do some long division."
25599,Homer,what a nice lady.
23268,Homer,"no, it usually takes a few hours."
18554,Homer,"well, maybe someone will give you one for christmas..."

19155,Homer,"aw, those jerks. always walking over the small businessman. don't get me started about the government."
27989,Homer,help! help! i'm drowning!
32598,Homer,"hmmm... the only problem is, i'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman. no doubt i'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. and that will make me want to jump off a--"
29456,Homer,"oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
15062,Homer,i'll tell you when you're older.
41396,Homer,we got a fish! we got a fish!

21105,Homer,"no sir, please. i can't go to prison. they pee in a cup and throw it on ya. i saw it in a movie!"
26314,Homer,i learned so much about my family. you'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
32721,Homer,i now declare you chips and salsa.
23879,Homer,and chili fries!
23333,Homer,"ooh, sweet."

31674,Homer,did she mention she was knocked up?
29567,Homer,lousy american-made dog!
37914,Homer,your moans of sympathy are all i have!
20800,Homer,"well, you see, when i get bored, i make up my own movie. i have a very short attention span."
25631,Homer,we need more ice! my thumb is fading fast.
30189,Homer,i saw my advantage and i took it. that's what heroes do.
33113,Homer,"limbo? you mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? either way, i'm in."
18760,Homer,what a jip.
28000,Homer,"bart, are you okay?"
35695,Homer,"so it's weird -- don't worry, i'll make it fun."
23957,Homer,"oh, that would be just... you're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?"
20017,Homer,"no, i won't accept that."
18569,Homer,"hey, we can be a team!"
22361,Homer,"man, that's gonna be some show."
17493,Homer,we're both screw-ups.
16144,Homer,are you ready to laugh?
32391,Homer,blueberries!
38926,Homer,how can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
32675,Homer,"you'd think so, but..."
13550,Homer,who are you?
23892,Homer,boo?
31471,Homer,you used to love it!
15963,Homer,the be sharps.
26522,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
31198,Homer,lady. man. lady. man. lady.
14654,Homer,easy... easy... how'm i doing on the right?
39430,Homer,"marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."
27027,Homer,what game?
14363,Homer,"well, i wouldn't call it a bet. it's a little thing daddies do to make football more exciting."
27605,Homer,"mars, eh? hmmm, i see no evidence of water."
39926,Homer,"the reason i look unhappy is that tonight i have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as i call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
29935,Homer,"so, ray does exist?!"
37689,Homer,"no dream will come true,"
41253,Homer,"""you will find happiness with a new love."" oh, even the chinese are against me. what's the point. i can't fight fate."
24057,Homer,"and poor ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. well, from now on i'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much i love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. maybe just a pat on the butt. yeah, that works."
28565,Homer,"honey, no one messes with my mrs. i'll come down on those guys like the garage door on bart's bike."
20975,Homer,"lisa, it's me, daddy, your father. i rounded up every simpson in the tri-city area, so i can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the simpson genes. this is your great-uncle chet. go ahead, chet, tell her what you do."
35356,Homer,"well, if you insist."
20181,Homer,"don't worry, son. if that bothers you, i'll destroy something maggie loves."
27760,Homer,"now, open it again and put a walnut in there."
30863,Homer,look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.
13461,Homer,it was the olden days!
22861,Homer,"wait! come back! i'm a god to you! worship me -- or fear my wrath! please fear my wrath, please... call me."
24573,Homer,"mmm, sugar walls."
30719,Homer,"hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. it's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
41502,Homer,oh.
23163,Homer,"yeah, guys like me."
25087,Homer,you're right. that suit gizmo could be worth billions. and i'm gonna get a piece of the action!
27988,Homer,"a plan, eh? okay, we'll use a plan."
18304,Homer,do not touch willie. good advice.
34350,Homer,"don't know, don't care."
21396,Homer,i hope this works...
17421,Homer,how come you guys hesitated?
33466,Homer,"because i have this magical thing called a home equity loan. i borrow all the money i want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. sucker."
29980,Homer,"did you hear that foxy, the fox network fox?"
30971,Homer,"see, it goes: ship's wheel, popeye tattoo, gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
23794,Homer,whoa-whoa-whoa! don't go nuts.
34737,Homer,"come on on, the cardboard's fine."
27091,Homer,"i'm so hot for me, i'm so hot for me / i'm so cold..."
35222,Homer,"oh yeah, i getcha -- ""work on the show."" maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? marijuana reference!"
22264,Homer,"because, i loved them once and they broke my heart. let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
16936,Homer,"hey, this isn't such a great prize. oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
33991,Homer,the math checks out!
16073,Homer,"marge, try to understand. there are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. as a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
21804,Homer,"nothing, nothing. i'm just broadening my horizons. uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a humvee?"
13745,Homer,i thought he was dead.
40950,Homer,"oh dad, you and your imagination."
27585,Homer,sure. my son is bart simpson and...
32778,Homer,"okay, bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. step one: we chuck the raccoon in there."
27008,Homer,"hey, i'm on vacation."
18780,Homer,hmmm. one of these must be a breakfast maker.
37578,Homer,"i'll just enjoy these green beans with slivered almonds. mmm, so slivered."
32737,Homer,"stop saying things, bart! that's the tv's job!"
32301,Homer,"okay, i get it. i'm not stupid. it's number two, right?"
37775,Homer,"oh baby, shake it! homer like!"
30913,Homer,"marge, meet pro football's newest team: the springfield meltdowns!"
32167,Homer,move it! move it! move it! do you want to be second out of the parking lot? do you?
38726,Homer,stig. you've got a name that's not a name.
36108,Homer,this yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! from her show!
31081,Homer,"oh no! he's marge's, and my, dream man! i've gotta make a play for her now or i might lose her forever!"
23911,Homer,"look at me, i'm a billionaire!"
24056,Homer,"oooh, a bobby pin."
34942,Homer,huh? what'd i do?
30738,Homer,"uh, but could you add a bacon nose? plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
41096,Homer,"oh, we saw that."
41125,Homer,holy moly! you're winning!
23021,Homer,wow. i can't believe someone i never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
15768,Homer,"well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, mr. burns or me."
24583,Homer,hmm. phone's off the hook. everything must be okay.
32607,Homer,"now, back away from burns and i will let your dog live."
27122,Homer,i'll do four.
34815,Homer,and not the good kind!
18894,Homer,"oh, don't worry, maggie! i'll think of something!"
38261,Homer,"hey-hey, what--"
32676,Homer,they were the bonnie and clyde of their day. their names were... bonnie and clyde.
33618,Homer,i need that paper quick!
26411,Homer,"these courtside seats are great. thanks for the hookup, wolfie."
13141,Homer,"wow, a negro!"
31592,Homer,which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?
33041,Homer,"hey, he went into a construction site!"
25409,Homer,"they wouldn't? well i'll go to bat for you, honey."
24264,Homer,i'm still cool.
14492,Homer,"yes you are. you've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on tv. i know, i'll build him a dog house."
36689,Homer,"hey, i'm startin' to remember why i don't remember so much."
20366,Homer,"mmm, you probably left them at work. on another topic, guess who was picked to host the next nra get-together?"
28639,Homer,i can't see! i'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
24435,Homer,that's what we've been trying to tell you.
17596,Homer,"comin' through! can't throw me out! my father's a member! i'm in, i'm in!"
27978,Homer,"i don't care if his name is bony mcdork, just make the checks out to me."
27223,Homer,so how do you afford such a sweet pad?
39917,Homer,"goodbye, adil. i'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted."
16475,Homer,"yeah. uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. heh heh."
24353,Homer,"yeah, but in what ratio?"
21605,Homer,"a-- wait a minute! these aren't exciting new products! you're not even trying. okay, that's it. both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves."
16187,Homer,that's right.
30154,Homer,what a combination -- hot chicks and stupid flanders.
41541,Homer,"here's what i say to that: no soup for you! because i am ""master of my domain."" newman."
24873,Homer,what a bombshell!
19257,Homer,a whole week of just father and son! see you at dinner.
18258,Homer,"wow, barney! you brought a whole beer keg."
15168,Homer,hmm...
39473,Homer,i've got some wieners in my pocket.
29138,Homer,"there there, save your lies for the american public."
22383,Homer,isn't bad? tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
31586,Homer,wait a minute. how am i breathing?
13436,Homer,are you?
40956,Homer,bart!
38424,Homer,so... where are all the friends?
22033,Homer,"marge, i've been thinking. what if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, i gave grampa that artificial kidney i invented?"
19314,Homer,i sleep in a big bed with my wife.
26885,Homer,"goodbye, marge."
24053,Homer,i need a shirt! gimme a shirt!
17962,Homer,"exactly. heh, heh."
30269,Homer,"c'mon, marge. when are you gonna call?"

39693,Homer,no!
19421,Homer,"one... two... hey, what's the big idea?"
22192,Homer,you gotta live down here.
24490,Homer,everybody wanted a piece of us.
39525,Homer,"yeah, right! this ought to be good for a laugh."
28065,Homer,"who's ""we""? got a mouse in your purse?"
18080,Homer,"marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. and i have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
37733,Homer,"no time for breakfast, marge. just give me a banana."
37442,Homer,what the hell is that?
36036,Homer,two can play at that game.
40607,Homer,"oh, okay, okay!"
38922,Homer,when?!
38499,Homer,we're on an old-time boat!
17795,Homer,"hey, hey."

22110,Homer,"oooh, mini-cannoli!"
16708,Homer,"ah, come on, marge, you're way too..."
22493,Homer,"""i cherish you, my precious."" mm, nah. ""to a heckuva blacksmith."" nah, i already got him one."

30366,Homer,uh... this is still part of your dream. dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
29109,Homer,what about now?
32276,Homer,why? what happens if i point it this way?
17989,Homer,"oh, right."
18198,Homer,garbage in garbage can. makes sense.
24373,Homer,you gotta hide me. death is after me! and i don't entirely trust these cowboys.
24244,Homer,"well, sister bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. with sexy results."
30018,Homer,"is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'cause i can make it greener..."
27534,Homer,"eh, god's cool."
17144,Homer,must... protect... sugar... thieves everywhere... the strong must protect the sweet... the sweet
31701,Homer,wow. i have a pretty good life after all.
35991,Homer,"aw, sweetie. hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"
29012,Homer,"quiet, the commercial's on! if we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv."
34630,Homer,"well, marge and i don't have any problems. we never even fight anymore."

28748,Homer,it's old lady simpson! run!
25470,Homer,me so hungee.
34336,Homer,"you can't sex fire me, i sex quit!"
23316,Homer,"so come to the legless frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. p.s. parking was ample."
23153,Homer,"and it was fine for the 1930's. the country was doing great back then. everyone was into talking. but now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! and seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
24190,Homer,"check it out. there's island blackjack, island craps, island texas hold 'em... but if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. four sand dollars on number six, please."
19377,Homer,see? i told you it was over.
30343,Homer,lisa!
15091,Homer,my baloney has a first name / is h-o-m-e-r / my baloney has a second name / it's h-o-m-e-r.
31183,Homer,this is all my daughter's fault. but i'll make it up to you. bart and i will run your business till your dad's okay.
39113,Homer,"and because you love me, i will not stop yo-yo dieting till i get it right."
19113,Homer,um... someday i'd like to own the dallas cowboys.
30768,Homer,and don't you try to stop us.
36624,Homer,"hey, the pocket wants what it wants."
34505,Homer,you saved my life. and i came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
27410,Homer,"well, all the childless drunks at moe's thought it was a great idea."
13207,Homer,got it.
27142,Homer,"stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. nice going, geniuses."
24006,Homer,he ran all the way here.
24247,Homer,"i'm sorry about your face, moe."
30494,Homer,a leatherbuddy! there's no limit to what i can do with this.
14382,Homer,not sunday -- daddy-daughter day.
18668,Homer,"so i thought to myself, what would god do in this situation?"
32907,Homer,that's it.
17362,Homer,i love bart!
40519,Homer,"oh. well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?"
25218,Homer,five? why don't we make it fifty?
36345,Homer,"spoiler alert! i've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""coconut cream die."""
25456,Homer,dancin' away my hunger pangs / movin' my feet so my stomach won't hurt / i'm kinda like jesus / but not in a sacrilegious way...
13833,Homer,come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.
41203,Homer,uh-oh.

36965,Homer,america can't collapse! we're as powerful as ancient rome!
29689,Homer,"don't mention it, miss october. but don't look at her passport, it's different."
13586,Homer,here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
27854,Homer,"stupid flanders with his misleading silhouette. well, i guess i have no choice but to go back home and... hey, i never noticed that newspaper box."
33311,Homer,you and me?
34297,Homer,"i warn you: i don't know what's in there but if it's about a simpson, you ain't gonna be proud."
22071,Homer,it's a miracle! you recovered!
19009,Homer,"hello, ticket-holders!"
38903,Homer,it does look delicious.
29338,Homer,you uh...
41126,Homer,"dad! please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. you understand that, take all your money and leave now."
17846,Homer,australia! america! austr--

37434,Homer,"marge, i have something to show you."
32042,Homer,it's over? that wasn't so bad.
28916,Homer,"relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
29346,Homer,pretend to care!
18862,Homer,"boy, lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. i don't know how i'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
37091,Homer,great. and now my dad can notarize.
13386,Homer,"ohhh, because i got drunk and looked down her dress."
22990,Homer,hm...
39615,Homer,how much do you want for it?
35783,Homer,"wow, these seats are amazing."
23583,Homer,"hello, everybody!"
20458,Homer,"mr. burns, this is homer j. simpson, the father of the big quitter. well, i just wanted to tell you i'm a big quitter, too, and i quit!"
37590,Homer,so i heard half of nothing.
21245,Homer,aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
24399,Homer,"hey, where is everybody?"
38927,Homer,what kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
34749,Homer,"hey pal, howya doin'?"
17309,Homer,don't touch anything?!! i'll... touch... whatever... i... feel like!!
39630,Homer,don't worry. this is an all-terrain vehicle.
22739,Homer,"i think we lost 'em, bart."
23742,Homer,i guess i'll never find her.
29368,Homer,the couch is like that tree!
18082,Homer,"marge, i want you to take care of yourself out there. you've become very dear to me."
15753,Homer,don't worry. we won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. that's where i got this scar.
19613,Homer,"mr. burns, i insist that we cheat!"
35848,Homer,i meant a week from tomorrow. that's when the new penis gets here.
28790,Homer,the re-deadening? is that any good?
23395,Homer,"well, son. i guess this is the end. but we've both had long, full lives. oh, right."
22798,Homer,"'scuse me, i have a few questions for pop."
40968,Homer,fine. thank you.
19104,Homer,i'm gonna miss springfield. this town's been awfully good to us.
38502,Homer,"wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. you're enjoying this, aren't you?"
38012,Homer,"awww... wait a minute... since marge is wearing my glasses, i can see everything she sees. uh-uh, i shouldn't watch this."
34658,Homer,marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
27699,Homer,marge doesn't think i'm sexy. what am i supposed to do?
18664,Homer,"okay, son! give him the glue!"
30747,Homer,"so lenny, how's it goin' in vegas? pretty boring, i'll bet."
40455,Homer,"eight o'clock, but what does it matter?"
19624,Homer,"you got it, buddy."
16980,Homer,"okay, fine."
17613,Homer,what's this?
15996,Homer,i pity the fool who doesn't like... he. and wher's barney?
21977,Homer,we're not eating mr. pinchy. he's part of the family now.
30559,Homer,"that's right, i am a man! the man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. let's meet her now."
17904,Homer,"i don't know marge, i can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
23622,Homer,"whee! whee! don't be scared, maggie. daddy won't drop you. whee!"
28063,Homer,"no, it's true. the car, the soup... it's like you hate me... your own husband..."
25240,Homer,"hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out."
20711,Homer,"yes, sir!"
39361,Homer,what?
20809,Homer,i've joined the movementarians! and so have all of you!
18362,Homer,"oh, it's a dream come true, boy! i can, nay, i must, eat everything i've always wanted. now c'mon! every second i'm out of bed, i'm burning precious calories. now get grabbin'!"
13156,Homer,"hm, i guess it's row versus wade. and it's my right to choose."
24767,Homer,"financial panther, eh?"
28325,Homer,"what? by saying ""macbeth""?"
29479,Homer,hey moe... haven't seen you in a while.
29767,Homer,i'm marge simpson. don't eat off the floor.
23122,Homer,"uh, you're thinking about me, right?"
41221,Homer,don't tell him. give him a fake name.
36245,Homer,"so, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
28728,Homer,nope.
32153,Homer,honey... don't try to remember the whole day. just what you're feeling this second.
37989,Homer,but the avatar looks just like you!
33250,Homer,i'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
17161,Homer,"marge, it's three a.m. and i worked all day!"
21261,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ray. are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?"
39631,Homer,"ah, come on. we're going back to nature."
18052,Homer,woo hoo!
17408,Homer,hee hee. here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
30556,Homer,that's weird. he started off as an egg.
38509,Homer,what the?
28556,Homer,"oh. wise guy, eh?"
15116,Homer,"eat lead, einstein!"
17970,Homer,"oh great, now you're going to make fun of me."
16737,Homer,"no. it wasn't me, i swear. it was... him."
39789,Homer,"two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! i'm a blimp! why are all the good things so tasty? from now on, exercise every morning."
15837,Homer,"yeah, that's more like it! ""oh, i want to be in that rumba / when the saints go over there.... over there..."
21462,Homer,"bart, i told you not to leave that tv on."
21926,Homer,"well, i do walk through pretty much anything... ohh, you kids are sweet."
18988,Homer,"well, homer, this is it. time to get back with the people. the young people."
33387,Homer,i don't feel much like eating. i'll never know what would've happened if i'd have been class president.
26488,Homer,cosmic.
39265,Homer,i'm jolly old saint nick.
40530,Homer,"... oh, hey, thank you, maggie."
27407,Homer,"lisa, i can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. i'm the worst dad in the world."
40104,Homer,ahhhh!
20281,Homer,"man, how'd i live without this thing?"
16040,Homer,sorry. what am i thinking?
14440,Homer,"what? but marge, we just had a vacation. remember mystic caverns?"
21485,Homer,"marge, can we trade? i don't trust these guys."
17928,Homer,i'll never forgive myself for this.
26978,Homer,"wow, four of me. i think this could be a magic hammock. and it just might be the answer to my problems."
16907,Homer,"i only have two questions. how much, and give it to me."
38621,Homer,"mr. burns, we did it! everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights."
16611,Homer,"oh, this doesn't work any more."
34043,Homer,"all right, i put in a hundred-hour work week, but i took a power-nap while i was driving us here and now i'm rarin' to go!"
28214,Homer,"someone, or something, knows i love oversized food and short, punchy articles. so they hid a message in the first letter of each line. see: ""homer, meet me 4th street overpass, midnite."""
19098,Homer,"well! what do you think of me and cypress creek now, marge?"
39461,Homer,"no! ignore the boy, lord. now can the chatter and bow your heads. dear lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. i mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my french... but they act like savages! did you see them at the picnic? oh, of course you did. you're everywhere. you're omnivorous. oh, lord, why did you smite me with this family?"

20236,Homer,"next, i'll tell you the origin of maggie's pacifier."
29357,Homer,"bart, can i ask you an important question?"

27792,Homer,"sweetie, daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
20682,Homer,"whoa. whoa. calm down, little lady--take it easy--take it easy. no."
24461,Homer,shh! this plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
32288,Homer,"it's homer, idiot."

41547,Homer,"marge, what are you doing in this crazy college? this place is nothing like ""animal house""! i smashed a beatnik's guitar and he sued me for damages! successfully!"
26887,Homer,i knew it!
28349,Homer,"okay, what do i do?"

33792,Homer,"hello, little girl, who do you belong to?"
18445,Homer,"right away, mr. smithers! i'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"

31449,Homer,i'll never make it! unless...
18696,Homer,really?
36632,Homer,"geez. i mean, i'm no luis guzman, but i'm all right."
37299,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
34970,Homer,there was barbecue sauce on it.
27481,Homer,yes...
28308,Homer,"marge, i'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. now let's see, which rifle should i bring?"
41558,Homer,"okay, i'll keep the l.p.s and you take the c.d.s. i'll take the typewriter, you take the computer. i'll take the enron stock, you take the microsoft stock. and um..."

20592,Homer,then what are you complaining about? you got yours. mm-hm-hm.
36206,Homer,roomy.
39046,Homer,"i could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am i."
20283,Homer,"sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. if you don't use it responsibly... kablamo!"
38537,Homer,woo hoo! flanders isn't perfect!

36395,Homer,"now, listen, lisa--"
27339,Homer,purple rain!
39419,Homer,"hmm. when you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. but that's the lug you're looking at. and i vow to continue spending every free minute i have crusading for safety. of course, i'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
28175,Homer,hm.
35426,Homer,who's alone in the vehicle?
18931,Homer,"wow. you must love this country more than i love a cold beer on a hot christmas morning. darn it, apu, i'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
18470,Homer,mo-om! you're not looking!
34734,Homer,come in. come in. don't wipe your feet.
18018,Homer,"don't worry. we'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
14173,Homer,"and does it ever say, ""i love you?"""
38579,Homer,"so... yeah. things aren't perfect with the missus and me. and by the way, nice melons."
40830,Homer,gotta go.
31211,Homer,"oh! let me know when and if you want sex, honey!"
30674,Homer,"there's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""m""!"
31840,Homer,hilarious joke?
19256,Homer,right... uh huh... gotcha... cat in the furnace.
35413,Homer,i'm afraid it's all too true. my wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
34959,Homer,i can't go undercover with fat tony. he's met me. i've been in his house. i was briefly his consiglieri... consugly... canolli... robert duvall.
39548,Homer,"come on, come on. let's go."

15096,Homer,ew. dog water.
30530,Homer,"now honey, you know daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
16216,Homer,it sure was nice of mr. burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... pennsylvania.
14837,Homer,i think i'm gonna take a walk.
13462,Homer,"hey, let's go! emergency! life-or-death here!"
21688,Homer,"ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? and would it kill you to make some coffee?"
34080,Homer,"well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. and i detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game."
13464,Homer,eh.... the boy.
31801,Homer,i also wreck bar mitzvahs!
22571,Homer,"uh-oh. here's your slingshot, lisa."
38778,Homer,"look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. what a sellout. cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat..."
15217,Homer,marge what're you doing? it's lunch time.

26634,Homer,sh-sh-sh.
30551,Homer,"hey, people may not love homer simpson, but they love this suit. just like they love their stupid american flag."
18398,Homer,"marge, this is everything i've ever dreamed of, right here."
22330,Homer,"yeah, they're good. but i wouldn't count out the... denver broncos ."
26433,Homer,just you wait!
24478,Homer,ch-ch-ch-changes / time to change the oil / yeah / changes / don't wanna be an oily man /
28877,Homer,can i have some peanuts?
37517,Homer,"but first, m'lady, let me escort you to heaven -- the fancy swiss chocolate store on level three!"
14905,Homer,"well, this is the first i've heard about it."
16596,Homer,y'ello.
26336,Homer,"oh, what do i do? what do i do?"
35827,Homer,it's closing?! but where will people find clips of old tv shows if they're not housed in a giant building? where? where?
38192,Homer,and that man sold it to me!
25223,Homer,"i can still see your movies, right?"
31904,Homer,"well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover."
18987,Homer,"well, excuuuuuuse me!"
21599,Homer,"uh, this isn't working. i've got to try a different approach."
38076,Homer,go! go! go!
32958,Homer,"okay boy, this is it. five dollars!"
31630,Homer,"it takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! plus, in the middle, i had to take revenge on some of my contractors."
14190,Homer,"i was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
35974,Homer,"and that, kids, is how you stick it to the towne centre real estate investment trust. no, no, no. woo hoo!"
33752,Homer,"i don't have to ""helicopter"" bart -- i've got a backup plan called ""lisa."""
24844,Homer,"this is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?"
26745,Homer,"i love you, boy."
18288,Homer,that's false advertising! lard lad lied!
14800,Homer,"ooh, sweet."
24864,Homer,that lousy pothole! why don't they fix it?
18861,Homer,they all have hilarious names and are delicious.
21561,Homer,"marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for lenny."
40309,Homer,"mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. uh oh."
18801,Homer,"would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"

26011,Homer,"oh, so you're ashamed of us. well, you've turned into a big phony."
34371,Homer,that's all that happened? and i got to miss work?
17289,Homer,look at that! i'm the first non- brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
39717,Homer,"wow! look at these bowling balls, maggie. can you think of a better way for daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?"
36300,Homer,no... no...
20480,Homer,"oh. well, congratulations."
17607,Homer,but what if i were to shake your hand in this wise?
32371,Homer,"oh ma-arge! want some com-pany? as always, silence means yes."
24005,Homer,"hey, what's with the attitude? i just want some dealies."
15248,Homer,"that's it! whew, i'm glad one of us remembered. that could have been embarrassing."
41549,Homer,"i can't do it! our harmony-laden r&b doesn't make sense in this cruel world. i'm taking our music to the next level: guitar rock utilizing nihilist grunge energies. or, as i call it: grunge."
21534,Homer,"emus? really? oh, that's pretty crazy... nah... i'd only fail just like i fail at everything."
13602,Homer,"marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. god forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
33547,Homer,yo! over here!
24923,Homer,"of course! it's so simple... wait, no it's not. it's needlessly complicated."
35762,Homer,"mr. burns, so glad you're here! finally the party can get started!"
39354,Homer,"can it wait, son? it's getting kinda dark."
24638,Homer,"oh, that was fifty already?"
32195,Homer,"oh, no! not in spring-time! / summer, winter or fall! no, never could i leave you at all!"
26118,Homer,something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
27824,Homer,"aww, marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. the fake business card i made up to impress her..."
38088,Homer,what the--
22014,Homer,"yep, that's what happens when you get older. it's one of those natural things. beautiful in its way."
37651,Homer,ho ho ho! a very small time!
15692,Homer,"you know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops."
13539,Homer,"son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?"
30778,Homer,"through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, i haven't even thought of it yet."
32519,Homer,uh-huh.
38591,Homer,"oh, i love canadian on canadian violence. oh baby, this is so great! thank you so much!"
25509,Homer,baby could order poison.

13851,Homer,no. bart bit me.
38842,Homer,no.

19178,Homer,yes!!
23967,Homer,ahhhh!
21301,Homer,"no, i mean it. i'm really serious this time."
20837,Homer,quiet. god looks like he has something important to say.
13454,Homer,"aw, nuts! extremely rare blood and i don't have it."
33982,Homer,there certainly is.
24467,Homer,"that's not true, honey. you can always write a depressing broadway play of some kind."
14105,Homer,"moe, sorry i lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
21622,Homer,"that's why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun. it's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. close your eyes, marge."
14564,Homer,"hey, i called for that!"
14166,Homer,i think i did pretty good in there.
27747,Homer,hello!
27785,Homer,"oh, you want a piece of me?"
13535,Homer,"all right, all right. i'll get lisa to do it."
38418,Homer,mmmm--
28226,Homer,i know! i'm working my way up to you.
15730,Homer,"i was saying ""pssst. i love you."""
39708,Homer,it's good to see you all in church.
37309,Homer,"oh my god! a marriage so perfect that i could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. what do i do?! what do i do?!"
39511,Homer,"bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing."
16162,Homer,yes. we'll send the eye.
39088,Homer,"they taught me that i don't need to lose weight, i should just be proud of what i am."
29898,Homer,"you know son, my dad used to take me down to johnson's hardware. old man johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. when they built this place, he hung himself."
24512,Homer,"yep, there i go. then came the rocks. jagged rocks. hitting me with their jags."
29050,Homer,"no, i shouldn't."
15740,Homer,i would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
38060,Homer,"oh, i know what that means. there comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. finally! i was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
15353,Homer,you mean...
40167,Homer,"listen, you big stupid space creature. nobody, but nobody eats the simpsons."
33979,Homer,"well, i... uh..."
15245,Homer,"shut up, you little monsters! hello, i was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
28616,Homer,"there are many people i'd like to thank for this award. my wife, anjelica huston -- this is for you, angie! we did it!"
31723,Homer,yabba... dabba... dooooo...

38223,Homer,it's okay. i'm an american!
31191,Homer,it'll do for now.
24567,Homer,"oh, i'm no dunce. i was born an oaf, and i'll die an oaf."
22951,Homer,"well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
39271,Homer,"ah, son. one day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. receiving a big fat check for a job well done."
21886,Homer,i'll treasure this poncho forever.
23326,Homer,a bat! now that's a new one.
24068,Homer,"okay, be right down."
23018,Homer,"now's our opening. come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!"
40737,Homer,"well, i'm here for being me. every day i show up, act like me, and they slap me in here."
23204,Homer,i'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.
14072,Homer,i'll tell you what's wrong. that rotten moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
15019,Homer,"that's right, old friend."
40490,Homer,"hey, boy. wanna toss the old --"

24504,Homer,"son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
15147,Homer,"boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
40032,Homer,"and if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
15159,Homer,oh. how convenient.
22755,Homer,heads up!
39968,Homer,"hello, this is mr... sampson."
28771,Homer,"why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? why, santa, why?"

35658,Homer,i won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
27756,Homer,and today begins my reign of terr--
34953,Homer,"it's okay, it's okay. i can be out in eighteen months with good behavior."
41460,Homer,"""color my world,"" ""disco sucks"" and butthead the goat."
41250,Homer,money can be exchanged for goods and services.
25323,Homer,"oh, come on. you've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. now serve!"
13862,Homer,"hey, do i tell you how to do your job?"
38988,Homer,the best. wonder what ever happened to him.
37735,Homer,it's a tough economy. money doesn't grow on trees.
27477,Homer,good. can you wax the car? ow! ow! ow! i'm kidding! i'm kidding!
26064,Homer,these would stop joan collins herself.
30417,Homer,okay.
41387,Homer,"pistols at dawn?! oh, why did i have to slap a guy who says ""suh""?"
13740,Homer,"you know if you need a hat check girl, i've got a daughter."
41544,Homer,are you by that joan miro statue?
22852,Homer,"frankly, i'd be a little turned on."
25380,Homer,but... the tv gave me the impression that...
29434,Homer,my butt looks so huge during perp walks.
32086,Homer,drive to chicago? i don't have time for that. i have to be back at work on monday. and my boss is a total jerk.
30015,Homer,"well, moe's getting a big screen tv in february. just in time for the pro bowl. maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
28483,Homer,"fine, we'll play it your way."
16180,Homer,see maggie? see the fun box! do do do do doo do...
16183,Homer,"marge, you must hate me for not taking mr. burns' money."
25708,Homer,"okay guys, i've got a secret play i've been saving for the olympics or possibly the final four, and it goes something like this... uh, skinner i want you... moe, you can take ... homer, you can take groundskeeper willie. no way am i taking groundskeeper willie. yes you are. are you a team player or not?"
29640,Homer,"people please, can we wrap this up? it's gonna rain and i've gotta get the bikes in here."
32402,Homer,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
19084,Homer,hold on guys. i'll help ya!
39202,Homer,pardon my galoshes.
34607,Homer,"everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""
20405,Homer,"fun, too."
32953,Homer,we missed one!
27561,Homer,why you little...!
23556,Homer,what a rotten day!
34432,Homer,"the dome of the rock? messiah, away!"
30451,Homer,marge isn't home.
22793,Homer,you throw da can away...
26799,Homer,"wait, wait. you forgot to eat a light bulb."
38188,Homer,i wish i knew how.
15532,Homer,we monorail conductors are a crazy breed. half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... am i turning you on?
34263,Homer,dude...
36149,Homer,unguarded stuffff...!
33688,Homer,"here we are, maggie. that park you love..."
31734,Homer,it's not right. it's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
20833,Homer,to think i turned to a cult for mindless happiness when i had beer all along.
17391,Homer,for a minute there i thought i was in big trouble. it's just a...
28285,Homer,clothesline.
22723,Homer,i fell asleep at the wheel! but we didn't crash. it's a miracle!
34557,Homer,but that would make a great movie.
37961,Homer,"okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. well, he's not a boy. he's immature, but fat and old."
16862,Homer,i call the basement.
14741,Homer,"lurleen, they loved you."
25057,Homer,man -- everyone has a snow day but us.
39573,Homer,"you know marge, getting old is a terrible thing. i think the saddest day of my life is when i realized i could beat my dad at most things. and bart experienced that at the age of four. so why are you still awake?"
31169,Homer,"oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. real fair. class act."
19022,Homer,"sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
22343,Homer,woo hoo! homer simpson with the pick!
37076,Homer,this is not that! and that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!
33863,Homer,sometimes i think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
18339,Homer,someone's in here.
23178,Homer,no offense.
26900,Homer,no! i've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that santa claus. no more irresponsible behavior.
24774,Homer,but how do i get it?
39042,Homer,"wow, you're good at that."
36322,Homer,british version was better.
29216,Homer,"please spare me. i'm not a murderer, i'm not. and i've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!"
33357,Homer,"great, thanks. listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?"
13606,Homer,we're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
32025,Homer,"all right, everybody. squeeze in real tight."
36482,Homer,are you gonna do that every time i open one of these?
23280,Homer,how about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
17444,Homer,oh. all right.
17523,Homer,"good news, everybody. because i endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
20279,Homer,"this mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. but not any more, baby!"
38141,Homer,you know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
35059,Homer,"i liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. but the supervising producing was the best i've ever seen."
19903,Homer,"alright, men. get ready to blast off!"
34932,Homer,ai-yi-yi-yi!
13292,Homer,i do!
21774,Homer,higher!
30465,Homer,"hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?"
33642,Homer,"to get the key i have to lick through a lollipop? oh, how awful."
39212,Homer,...every year.
15148,Homer,"run along, ya little scamp."
13379,Homer,oh.
38169,Homer,that's exactly how it is.
33585,Homer,have one more beer at o'flanagan's pub... we'll do that one!
34468,Homer,"well, at least we've got the best asbestos."
25901,Homer,"oh, i just got comfortable. use the bottle."
33689,Homer,see you when the moon comes out.
21177,Homer,"oh, i don't need your pity."
30598,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp... bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
31412,Homer,"yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. change a hundred?"
27661,Homer,never!
26329,Homer,i just poured myself a new glass of milk. the old one sat out for a little while. are you comin' to bed?
14682,Homer,"hey... hey, lurleen! i've gotta say somethin' to ya."
35788,Homer,i really should look at this picture a little longer.
13399,Homer,"hey, kid! you forgot your... whoa!"
14066,Homer,"a ""flaming homer""."
17890,Homer,time to fertilize the lawn. a couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
34352,Homer,sorry!
37171,Homer,earring!
30450,Homer,"well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
23437,Homer,"i was afraid of that. well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. you know, i've always wanted to tell you how mu..."
13825,Homer,"lisa, that was very selfish of you."
29750,Homer,"kids, your mother and i have decided to take a little break from each other. while we deal with our issues, i plan to go on ""motorhome makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. all i need is for someone to start a show called ""motorhome makeover."""
18247,Homer,sure.
27206,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
15583,Homer,s-s-o cold.
13812,Homer,oh yeah? how much?
23265,Homer,"i like pizza / i like bagels / i like hot dogs, with mustard and beer..."
22025,Homer,"ahhh. i'm the luckiest man in the world, now that lou gehrig's dead."
33216,Homer,you sure you're not mad?
22471,Homer,eep! leave me alone! go swab begley. he likes it!
29299,Homer,"all right, boy, which con did you work here? copy off another kid? pay attention and take notes? well, take note of this!"
14890,Homer,he-he-he.
24367,Homer,i've only got three more years to live!
35492,Homer,right. teasing.
38247,Homer,thanks for telling me. i was gonna tape it.
18459,Homer,i thought you were dead.
27138,Homer,rock and roll! woo hoo!
17477,Homer,"of course not marge, just for the rest of his life. he said i was an accident. he didn't want to have me!"
31655,Homer,what's your hurry?
14244,Homer,"i swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
35180,Homer,nerd.
26949,Homer,"you all know me. i've kept the streets safe for you and your children. i've tricked or treated at many of your houses. last year i was jar jar binks. now, who will stand and fight with me?"
29769,Homer,"oh yeah, marge? what about my womanly needs?"
13643,Homer,i was serious.
19685,Homer,"oh, that poor woman."
15036,Homer,"oh, it's no fair. we'll never have a buffer."
18373,Homer,i need a miracle.
14615,Homer,well... of course. there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
17106,Homer,wait until my class hears about this. kidding!
15325,Homer,"barney, you stole my idea!"
36618,Homer,"uh, well, looking back, i guess it started sometime before bart was born."
15813,Homer,shhhh! just watch.
36481,Homer,"welcome, money-changers! you can trust sleazy sam for the best rates, or my name isn't jesus h.--"
33178,Homer,yeah.
31505,Homer,don't say his name! in your mouth it sounds like dirt!
17248,Homer,"yes, ma'am. sideshow bob. yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
18232,Homer,"what was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... moe? look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... moe?"
13140,Homer,underprivileged? you pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?
34570,Homer,"aw, look. he's doing his business."
34249,Homer,"marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, i have something to confess. um... i wasn't there for that wedding toast because... i was buying a lottery ticket."
28370,Homer,"yeah, it's impressive. but i still haven't found the perfect gift for marge. only imperfect stuff for me."
33987,Homer,"i'll save you, marge!"
25693,Homer,why won't you light? the gas is on full blast!
35894,Homer,"because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, i can't go out in public."
17769,Homer,"uh, yeah. i can do that."
21035,Homer,"you know marge, joining the reserves was the best thing i ever did. i feel good about myself, i'm helping my country, and later, i'm gonna get gilligan's autograph."
22800,Homer,i'd like to return this barbecue kit.
36728,Homer,dinner time! i know you're hungry! i can hear you rubbing your legs together! oh my god!
40406,Homer,the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress.
18583,Homer,"domo aregatto, mister roboto..."
23446,Homer,rural route 9? that's it! we can hide out at the farm where i grew up!
30683,Homer,"that is small, right?"
41382,Homer,...lisa simpson.
40828,Homer,"hey, flanders. who put that bug up your butt?"
36566,Homer,note to self: edit out my lies.
31870,Homer,my son caught the ball! this makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
24628,Homer,"i reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
27915,Homer,if you despise polite left-handers...
14878,Homer,stupid roller-skate.
39731,Homer,"c'mon, son. let's take the head thing back to the authorities."
13830,Homer,hiya bart!!! how's my boy! heh heh. heh heh.
30125,Homer,uh-oh.
19588,Homer,"you mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? oh, fat tony... i will say good day to you, sir."
36043,Homer,we won! woo hoo!
21927,Homer,that's it! somehow!
25056,Homer,"ahh, why does that always happen?"
24287,Homer,get outta my dreams and into my car.
21761,Homer,lower! lower!
30542,Homer,"expand my brain, learning juice!"
16004,Homer,"there are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. now off to bed."
33681,Homer,there you are!
39090,Homer,"marge, you're my wife of ten years and i love you. but i must observe the teachings of this man i just met tonight. now, the first thing i have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
36121,Homer,i'll poke a broom in there! you know i'm capable of it!
14749,Homer,you son of a... sold!
29704,Homer,"i would, but marge would kill me... i mean ohh, right."
28821,Homer,refuse to answer on the grounds that i what?
24754,Homer,nooo! it was finger ling-ling good!
38294,Homer,"yeah, i knew you'd think it's dumb--"
35297,Homer,why you... i'm gonna... maybe this time...
24738,Homer,"no, i like to save the environment in my own way."
35340,Homer,fat tony! i was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
37625,Homer,a beer from the sky! it's a sign!
20123,Homer,blech! eww! geesh! i'll take a crab juice.
32254,Homer,it's paint. or is it?
17207,Homer,suckers.
25719,Homer,miss work? but my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
22197,Homer,then we're goin' to las vegas! which is actually back in that direction.
38398,Homer,"ooh, doubles!"
39979,Homer,"well, don't just stand there, boy. help miss botz with her suitcases."
23603,Homer,i wanna live!
38442,Homer,i've had my problems with sparklers.
38117,Homer,you won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
17257,Homer,"hey, mr. smithers!"
34286,Homer,"ooo, you're hot when you're horny..."
27183,Homer,"what's this? it's enormous! oh my god, there's another one!"
38493,Homer,"uh, works for me."
28093,Homer,"now i'm michael jackson. i own all your songs, losers. hee, hee, hee."
31090,Homer,but do you also remember that you're an enabler?
33305,Homer,the secret is not to swallow the stingers.
31375,Homer,"oh, i was supposed to take moe fishing today! everybody hide!"
24453,Homer,"oh, here we go with the add ons. no thanks."
31859,Homer,yeah. what have you done with the real moe?
36636,Homer,but i was really looking forward to...
17455,Homer,no.
16612,Homer,i didn't say stop.
14159,Homer,i sure do!
13762,Homer,yes.
28648,Homer,they'll be back.
25561,Homer,"eh, bound to happen."
22256,Homer,"anyhoo, we came out of walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships..."
40706,Homer,that was beautiful.
27706,Homer,nobody loves oily homer...
21123,Homer,losers...
17466,Homer,that is correct.
33553,Homer,i see--
29510,Homer,one hundred dollars!
22405,Homer,"people are laughing at me, marge. let's get outta here. forget the baby's medicine."
24781,Homer,at lenny? but he's a war hero!
14148,Homer,"oh, marge, i'm gonna be fired. i know it."
31689,Homer,"i don't know. you can put horseradish on your dead mother for all i care. the point is, i'm rich, rich, rich! just look -- my dog has his own jacuzzi!"
25995,Homer,sorry. he seems nice.
40690,Homer,ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.
34419,Homer,flanders! stupid flanders!
25373,Homer,"so, ah, what songs did i miss?"
28091,Homer,it's not all his fault. i blame this latchkey kid.
41285,Homer,i'm not thinking. you think.
36147,Homer,"chief, i believe i have the answer in the back of my car."
37297,Homer,beats drowning.
19561,Homer,"uh, yes."
22478,Homer,chesty larue.
21410,Homer,"i'm enjoying my life too much to care. and you should be too. so what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!"
22915,Homer,"yeah, but i should have no problem selling a thousand springs."
23502,Homer,"addictive, eh?"
38066,Homer,"okay. in your terms, points are like mice."
32807,Homer,what?
18254,Homer,"yeah, right, lisa. a wonderful, magical animal."
15829,Homer,"oh, yeah."
21036,Homer,then i'll whomp him with my hat.
14653,Homer,"marge, that's just a suggested car size."
14593,Homer,"bart, i need some lucky numbers, fast! how old are you? uh-huh, and what's your birthday? no kidding. and what's lisa's birthday?... what? you don't know your sister's birthday? what kind of brother are you?"
25006,Homer,he's dead.
25171,Homer,oh.
25404,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll handle this."
33365,Homer,ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
34165,Homer,you... can't... do that...
26629,Homer,i could walk up to the president and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
13876,Homer,no!... wait a minute. what was that last one again?
35235,Homer,tour bus parked. gotta save marge!
20612,Homer,"yeah, honey. even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother."
15080,Homer,"well, i need something for my son's birthday."
29562,Homer,today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
27881,Homer,i don't know... date a chick with kids...
22432,Homer,mr. power.
20025,Homer,it is. it is. but first let me introduce you to my family. my perfect family.
36445,Homer,whee! whee!
32360,Homer,"well, they're not as pretty as you, marge."
35291,Homer,"oh son, i can't quit drinking any more than i could quit being a man."
31299,Homer,dr. phil mcgraw!
16239,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
30664,Homer,that's great! now i'll just get my present for you. which is... right outside the door.
18066,Homer,"ok, then this. doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo"
16129,Homer,"oh, marge. you're worse than that crusty old dean."
17682,Homer,woo hoo!
31760,Homer,uh-huh... uh-huh...
26553,Homer,let's try the red one again.
32083,Homer,he is not my boyfriend!
14931,Homer,"maggie, time to go to the..."
26595,Homer,taxi!
14627,Homer,"maybe you're right, marge."
35563,Homer,they always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
20089,Homer,"goodnight, barney. don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. just slide it under the door."
34354,Homer,fine. i'll do both at once. we should both take a role in vacation planning!
27791,Homer,it's a concern. a serious concern.
16507,Homer,"strike three, marge. i remember that meeting, and i have a photographic memory."
26155,Homer,'cause he's all man.
31749,Homer,"oh lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet."
38376,Homer,i just did that because it was a series of funny words!
30221,Homer,woo hoo!
13852,Homer,i gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
38099,Homer,speak for yourself. glug-glug-glug. chomp-chomp-chomp. beeeeep. my lifestyle is my retirement plan.
37111,Homer,"well, i'm glad someone has."
37336,Homer,"well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy."
36795,Homer,"this is your miracle? a tree? ooh, look at me. i turn sunlight into complex sugars. big whoop."
14354,Homer,"doh, not the wind."
17267,Homer,you don't look so happy.
20333,Homer,let's see what happens when he walks into my store. then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...
40195,Homer,"oh, man. plain cake donuts? thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. why can't i ever get here on time?"
23349,Homer,"relax, i'm fine. but when i do die, i don't want any autopsies."
34585,Homer,"absolutely. he's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. they'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. but if i'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way."
30523,Homer,"look, lisa. i made safety happen!"
41505,Homer,mom! mom! mom!
15558,Homer,"and i'm a college student! heh, heh."
34045,Homer,"""lick... eyes."" um, i'll try again. ""spank... hair."" what the? ""whisper into... ass."" this game sucks!"
23487,Homer,"that's all it takes. if we learned one thing from ""the amazing colossal man,"" and ""grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
38161,Homer,"so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
29996,Homer,i need change for a dollar.
19558,Homer,marge! kids! they're about to show my videotape!
19108,Homer,"yes, once."
21225,Homer,"well, we'll see about that."
33786,Homer,"marge, the boy and i will be making westminster abbey."
31965,Homer,make them stop!
22707,Homer,that little punk.
32941,Homer,now i'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
36959,Homer,never!
25093,Homer,"uh yes, i see that it's in bill form. excellent."
36872,Homer,"oh no, it's true!"
27470,Homer,"oh, i'm so proud of you, honey. you bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity."
34596,Homer,woo-hoo!
32199,Homer,ho danneggiato il mio piede!
22530,Homer,"we're putting an end to your insane valentine's rampage. never again will good, lazy men have to... what the--?"
30849,Homer,uh-oh.
26600,Homer,this corn doesn't look so big.
25676,Homer,"man, this is taking forever. i know how to speed things up."
18770,Homer,mr. burns has a mother!? she must be a hundred million years old!
25724,Homer,everyone's having fun but me.
32799,Homer,"how could a man just abandon his family? by which i mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?"
40014,Homer,"eww, i hate that icky soup skin."
33509,Homer,my own devices!
18647,Homer,"hey, jerk! move your fanny!"
30680,Homer,"so, i infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
35403,Homer,come on! would you--
32972,Homer,stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
21851,Homer,why you little--!
20449,Homer,"ohh, your mother's not pregnant, is she?"
18119,Homer,"marge, how did you know..."
13816,Homer,"don't shoot, don't shoot. they're souvenirs."
22898,Homer,and is that us on the roof?
37815,Homer,"hey, what's this marching band have to do with homer junior? what? there were cheerleaders in our house? and nobody told me?"
18212,Homer,"oh, bartholemew, i feel like st. augustine of hippo after his conversion by ambrose of milan."
19011,Homer,"we've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back."
14291,Homer,"aw, ain't that cute... hey!"
35730,Homer,it won't be like kansas city.
16578,Homer,"you know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
26875,Homer,here's my underwear drawer.
18877,Homer,"yes, that's a real pickle. would you excuse me for a moment?"
21703,Homer,you sent me to the chair.
26579,Homer,"there he is! it-- oh wait, you said brown hair, right?"
41359,Homer,"okay, just imagine she's a bond girl."
27426,Homer,"why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
19051,Homer,no lighter?... nothin'?
23940,Homer,woo hoo!
23009,Homer,it's time to get homer-erotic.
35572,Homer,"later, losers."
36656,Homer,sorry. check out my new t-shirt.
35655,Homer,and check these out...
41017,Homer,"uh, may i be excused, please?"
35931,Homer,"marge, i'm going to meet with the republican establishment and pick their nominee! if there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?"
23616,Homer,"mag-gie. it's me, dad-dy!"
34472,Homer,no food allowed in bank?
16994,Homer,i'm not stealing it. hotels expect you to take a few things. it's a souvenir.
28242,Homer,"hey guys, i brought my mom."
28650,Homer,"cool, an ambulance from the '60s! i bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. injured hippies!"
14737,Homer,sure they will.
28607,Homer,"woo hoo! i mean, beep beep!"
18370,Homer,"so that's it, isn't it, marge? looks. i didn't know you were so shallow."
29923,Homer,sorry. give me one that doesn't taste so good.
36124,Homer,dri-ving-to-work!
29603,Homer,"hey, i gotta get in on this! these people have rights! the right to buy me a sixty-two inch tv!"
36476,Homer,and what he says is true because it's in all caps. are you gonna argue with caps?
38433,Homer,is that the boy you named me after?
18517,Homer,"quick, down to the fallout shelter! the bombs are dropping!"
20742,Homer,okay.
15769,Homer,"done and done! heh, heh, heh."
26138,Homer,science!?
16209,Homer,woo hoo! ow!
38262,Homer,cleats.
17463,Homer,"sir! hello, sir! yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!"
41155,Homer,likely story.
15505,Homer,"i know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man."
40724,Homer,"hey, yeah, yeah. i think i can."
36302,Homer,watch whatever you want -- i got you here alive. now i'm gonna visit the only court i could never be in contempt of: food court.
38228,Homer,"look at you, using approved electronic devices."
18539,Homer,"no it doesn't, it's funny. their clothes are different from my clothes. look at what they're wearin'."
39147,Homer,"sorry, marge. but i am the royal babysitter. if i start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
30578,Homer,hmmm. i bet she'd be a good friend for marge. she looks defeated too!
19966,Homer,wanna come with?
37973,Homer,"lenny! it's me, homer!"
25128,Homer,"everything from hop on pop to death be not proud. it's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop."
39624,Homer,jealous. everybody ready?
19183,Homer,"you know lucius sweet? he's one of the biggest names in boxing! he's exactly as rich and as famous as don king, and he looks just like him, too."
31552,Homer,"nice brush work, emily. nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her."
24619,Homer,"and as usual, we joe twelve-packs get the royal screw job."
15033,Homer,a ride on the duff blimp...
15526,Homer,"oh, yeah."
26793,Homer,"hey, apu, i think she likes you."
22561,Homer,"marge, you've been out there all morning."
30246,Homer,"marge would kill me! please, there's gotta be something else i can do. like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. i can't do it next week."
15461,Homer,oh. i...
37696,Homer,so sad.
37270,Homer,"help me, flanders!"
33085,Homer,take me with you!
29006,Homer,that sliding should stop soon.
26374,Homer,patty and selma? screw that!
16792,Homer,yeah.
32602,Homer,oh yeah.
33335,Homer,what a racket.
20960,Homer,"now you're swingin', honey!"
14791,Homer,that's it. he's outta here.
16700,Homer,"okay, apu, i accept your apology."
39337,Homer,gotcha!
33969,Homer,"ultimate punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. studies have shown your mother is right."
14230,Homer,i am?
19136,Homer,"oh, the hammock district."
31716,Homer,"yes i do. under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets."
35725,Homer,a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
34113,Homer,that's so fake. that's so fake. i don't know how they-- too real!
33824,Homer,four walls? i was thinking more of something in a two or three.
37616,Homer,"lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where i work poisons our water and our air."
36310,Homer,keep 'em comin'!
23806,Homer,"lisa, i'll do the dishes when i pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. see, there it is. but that was a practice. the system works!"
18906,Homer,i'm sick of these constant bear attacks! it's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
37129,Homer,i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
22964,Homer,"hey, willie. that old couple looks just like you."
20985,Homer,"yes, son. a spectacular failure."
15000,Homer,yeah... think about it.
24253,Homer,"let's go, marge. c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
19653,Homer,"marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
35884,Homer,you make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! and watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
28896,Homer,"oh no! it's a real one! noooooo! why god, why?"
38145,Homer,"nobody touch it! bart, stop looking at it!"
26542,Homer,we are not paying this bill.
16317,Homer,"kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
30547,Homer,"well, there's my x-ray vision, my fire breath... and i can get big laughs with tennis balls."
21024,Homer,"no way, man! my hair is who i am!"
25204,Homer,"and as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains."
37633,Homer,how 'bout this one?
21191,Homer,"ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... garbage water! oh-ho-ho!"
30871,Homer,oh marge! i love you! i love you! i love you!
20435,Homer,"except you, you and you."
13923,Homer,"nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
35328,Homer,i can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. i'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
19690,Homer,"i'm sure we will, honey."
28488,Homer,joe dimaggio?
37049,Homer,"lenny, take us with you to find our dog! it's okay, marge, they're professionals."
27176,Homer,... and that's how my beautiful wife brought our son bart into the world.
14902,Homer,marge keep it down in there.
17764,Homer,get out of there. my family needs to use your bomb shelter.
26104,Homer,"no, huh?"
37124,Homer,what are you talkin' about? marge and i are goin' great.
36274,Homer,"and here i was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. you know, it's crazy, but..."
36292,Homer,"guys, thank you. the words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but i'm glad yours was saving me. the saddest part is none of this had to happen, if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker. or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
21207,Homer,that's not the way she tells it.
30702,Homer,what do i do? what do i do?
34568,Homer,it kills me to see her like that. and if there's one thing i can't stand it's being killed.
33126,Homer,what?! but i have urges!
14033,Homer,no. can't think of a thing.
21182,Homer,"lisa, don't you ruin another love day."
27431,Homer,"hey, your early porno movies! are any of these hetero?"
27231,Homer,"oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, lisa."
18763,Homer,"oh, it's not your fault, honey. i'm supposed to be the responsible one. i shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
33822,Homer,i can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
27380,Homer,dot com.
16393,Homer,sugar. do do do do do do awww. ho--ney. ho.....neyyy. do do do do do do. / you are my candy girrrrl lousy piece of junk!
22941,Homer,"wow, what a high-tech wonderland. oop, got an itch."
19119,Homer,are you guys working?
40315,Homer,my wife and kids stood by me. on the way home i realized how little that helped.
14052,Homer,"you spoke while you were jinxed so i get to punch you in the arm. sorry, it's the law. heh, heh."
17465,Homer,great. i'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
27736,Homer,"moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years."
16605,Homer,it's his job.
36801,Homer,"uh, excuse me, reverend, but i'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
17356,Homer,i asked for ketchup. i'm eating salad here.
38069,Homer,"look, the eagles and the falcons. tell me you're not interested in that."
18206,Homer,"kids, we're good parents now! get your asses out here!"
13972,Homer,shh! they'll hear you.
29508,Homer,"oh, the prid is gone."
34046,Homer,we're gonna be snore in the morning...
39157,Homer,she's gone!
28384,Homer,"goodbye, old friend. i'll think of you whenever i have a stroke or a heart attack."
19906,Homer,"wait a minute. bart's teacher's name is ""krabappel?"" i've been calling her ""crandall."" why didn't someone tell me? oh, i've been making an idiot out of myself."
17774,Homer,"i know kids, i'm scared too."
37999,Homer,"carl, it's me! i'm here! really here!"
40396,Homer,"hey, flanders, it's no use praying. i already did the same thing, and we can't both win."
39414,Homer,umm... what the hey. i'll take the job.
34617,Homer,"so, marge, what were we talking about?"
31921,Homer,"mood swings? mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings, mood swings! mood swings!"
32290,Homer,who said that? i'll kill them with my power!
29029,Homer,"that's really sweet, honey."
39075,Homer,so... you guys are proud of what you are?
18444,Homer,hey everybody! up here!
37225,Homer,fine.
19830,Homer,"aw, i love this pedestrian mall! there's practically no traffic!"
29643,Homer,"oh, dad. how i'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base..."
33028,Homer,you hang onto resentment like a confederate widow.
17273,Homer,heeeeere's johnny.
27021,Homer,"in the jungle, the creepy jungle / homer rides a freak..."
29056,Homer,"it's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!"

33318,Homer,are you guys dangerous?
34261,Homer,we're outta here.
22905,Homer,it's fun for the whole family. and the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
37077,Homer,"okay, i'll nudge 'em with the car. we'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
31145,Homer,"shut up, my ten o'clock's here."
14744,Homer,at least could i have my dollar ba...
26366,Homer,"hello, dondelinger."
30134,Homer,"yeah, i missed you guys too. now if you'll excuse me..."
18617,Homer,it's easier. duh.
16703,Homer,"hey, let's all hug apu."
30830,Homer,"so marge, in tomorrow's game i'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
35127,Homer,probably.
20820,Homer,"yes, it would be nice if he'd buy american, but what are ya gonna do?"
29113,Homer,all right. this is my memory box. i haven't opened it in thirty years.
39620,Homer,yeah!
13637,Homer,"oh marge, grow up."
13796,Homer,a jewish entertainer? get outta here.

35958,Homer,really? that made sense? then i'm definitely doing it.
29697,Homer,you guys are commies? then why am i seeing rudimentary free markets?
18170,Homer,"guess what, kids. they're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here."
23049,Homer,"no, mon, let's go home to jamaica. i and i been in babylon too long."
21325,Homer,"you too, marge. if you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
17674,Homer,"did you hear me? i said, i quit, monty. and since i quit, i can do anything i want."
26973,Homer,"eh, he had a good run."
23435,Homer,and somebody wanted to get rid of it in april.
36398,Homer,but you're not...
17479,Homer,"but when i do it, it's cute."
36130,Homer,"boy, you like this necklace i just bought?"
34948,Homer,"oh, i get it. the government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
22340,Homer,"hey, troy aikman!"
23149,Homer,"okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. it'll let us see your playful side."
38963,Homer,"...did i say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
29978,Homer,neunundneunzig luftballons / auf ihrem weg zum horizont / hielt man fuer ufos aus dem all / darum schickte ein general /
33676,Homer,"aw, her first enabling."
32683,Homer,look at you! idiots!
23979,Homer,thanks. this closes the saddest chapter in american history.
14826,Homer,"yeah. you know, my life just can't get any worse."
38200,Homer,"what if i never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
35352,Homer,maybe we've found all the truffles. the only thing i've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
24851,Homer,$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
33679,Homer,"aw, burrowing your head into your daddy. a sign that my baby is happy and confident."
18798,Homer,"yes, sir."
39423,Homer,"but, don't worry. i've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
39422,Homer,...and i'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. the only reason i'm telling you this is i'm going to be leaving you.
19064,Homer,we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
39973,Homer,"you know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man."
20252,Homer,"heh, still got it..."
27476,Homer,"ready for a real workout, marge?"
36531,Homer,"oh-oh-oh oh, thank god you woke up!"
37862,Homer,i'm on a break.
17202,Homer,no no no no no no no no no. ask your mother.
35287,Homer,"dr. zander, you made me see my life through bart's neck, and i swear, i will never, ever strangle my boy again."
17252,Homer,"it's the rapture! quick, get bart out of the house before god comes!"
40060,Homer,gimme the usual.
22738,Homer,"eat water, good buddy."
17147,Homer,"oh am i, am i really?"
26156,Homer,"quiet, lisa. everyone in the store is looking at you!"
20306,Homer,"oh, i've never heard of those people."
38281,Homer,"marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. don't hide behind a magazine."
37997,Homer,"anyway, i'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
35732,Homer,the caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
29729,Homer,"none. no wait, three. since the last one, i don't remember so good."
21580,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i am.
27161,Homer,this is where the kids were last seen.
32449,Homer,what's your secret?
40301,Homer,bart was strangely quiet. later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. that wouldn't last.
24153,Homer,what was that?
40004,Homer,"just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. no, no, triple."
39128,Homer,"look moe, the least you could let me do is anything i want."
13525,Homer,who stole my shirt? who stole my shirt?
29692,Homer,i hope you washed your hands first.
32122,Homer,"as i said, i've lost all hope."
39412,Homer,hey! what's the problem here?
27979,Homer,corporate jet?
30788,Homer,silly indians. our god made their god.
23619,Homer,there you are.
13410,Homer,to those weirdos in the worm store.
22182,Homer,"wellity, wellity, wellity..."
31266,Homer,maybe i can sneak home without them seeing me.
36562,Homer,hero away!
38719,Homer,just like i planned.
19815,Homer,unless he gets out somehow.
18920,Homer,let the bears pay the bear tax. i pay the homer tax.
20340,Homer,yeah.
21742,Homer,"is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
30513,Homer,i can do that!
32184,Homer,i thought she said polar bear.
36852,Homer,"well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches."
13425,Homer,no.
34435,Homer,"attention christians, muslims, and jews. i have come to gather you into a new faith. from now on you shall be called chrismujews."
26154,Homer,you say that so much it's lost all meaning.
13603,Homer,"ooh... how about the ""v""?"
40665,Homer,"heh-heh. the joke's on him, i'll be dead by then."
25792,Homer,what are you gonna do to us?
18683,Homer,"sold! you wrap it up, i'll start bringin' in the pennies."
13736,Homer,"a job's a job. i mean, take me. if my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
33000,Homer,what'd you do that for?
29672,Homer,"come on kids, we should go. goodbye, selma."
33223,Homer,yessssssssssssssss!
34746,Homer,"hello, flanders. don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
16828,Homer,"the flanderses are not geeks! okay, rod and todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. but we've got to give this thing a chance. i want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
30283,Homer,gotta find your mom. gotta find your mom.
21589,Homer,"marge, that's it! that's why i haven't done anything with my life! i need to be more like thomas edison!"
16323,Homer,"yep, it's finally gone."
25461,Homer,all this hunger for nothin'.
36785,Homer,"dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
22491,Homer,"oh, they're newlyweds. they'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
35217,Homer,i can't believe i'm riding around in cheech's van! the van made of weed!
28965,Homer,i say you don't exist!
41097,Homer,"no, bart. no!"

18466,Homer,this is my room. this is my dresser. it's where i keep my shirts when i'm not wearing them.
22465,Homer,"oh, marge. i thought it would be fun to be on springfield's ""a"" list, but these people are nuts."
26073,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!
41376,Homer,i wonder if there's birds on the moon. i miss marge.
25787,Homer,the simpsons are going to delaware!
35254,Homer,"looks like it's up to me. let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ..."
15904,Homer,yeah.
17392,Homer,"marge, i swear i didn't touch her. you know how bashful i am. i can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
16647,Homer,"don't forget to say ""i didn't do it""."
18143,Homer,what? what's your idea?
41140,Homer,i... can't... breathe! too... many... children...!
35509,Homer,wha?!
18083,Homer,"oh marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
20615,Homer,"ooo, gumball."
14470,Homer,barney! you're gonna pull her arm off.
35375,Homer,i'll just keep cutting till i hit something solid.
29579,Homer,"if that's true, he's gonna be like nwa -- not without ass-welts."
32979,Homer,i brought you something.
24719,Homer,"this is perfect! if i know fat tony, which i don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. come on."
23926,Homer,hey!
23991,Homer,tunnel!
34279,Homer,"oh my god, i'm holding back the team. but our marriage is based on curling. what am i gonna do?"
14850,Homer,"oh, yeah. right. i don't know what this switch does."
27606,Homer,the ribwich! the commercials have come to pass!
13839,Homer,"well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
32966,Homer,i'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
34512,Homer,"oh, everything reminds me of clancy."
39670,Homer,honey! honey! we're saved!
14252,Homer,"""dear marge... by the time you read this, i will be gone. you deserve all the finest things in the world. and although i can give them to you, they will be repossessed and i will be hunted down like a dog. also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
22765,Homer,"sorry, i already gave him a name. ""land monster."""
23428,Homer,"sir, that is an insult! i challenge you... what?"
19435,Homer,"what's happening to me? okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with marge, ate guatemalan insanity peppers. then i -- ohhhh."
25807,Homer,ew!
37712,Homer,"well, what was your childhood dream?"
15180,Homer,all right. i think you've learned your lesson.
26829,Homer,what the hell is that noise?
23194,Homer,"hey, what about a prequel to something? everybody loves prequels."
23010,Homer,"maarge. oh, maaarge."
35964,Homer,my fellow americans... i am full of crap.
31887,Homer,"sex problem, eh?"
37811,Homer,i do.
39595,Homer,"bart-the-bloody-pulp simpson is on the ropes. he's hoping i'll put him out of his misery. well, you're in luck, bart, here comes my right."
25941,Homer,"oh, it's just a friendly seal."
37000,Homer,"boy, get in the car. and say goodbye to your best friend forever."
32624,Homer,"hmm... ""dispose of proper--"" this book is too hard."
30004,Homer,where's my bucket?!
29829,Homer,"well, maybe i was partying so hard with my single friends last night, i forgot the rules."
34281,Homer,uh-oh.
18744,Homer,"of course i do. you're always right about this type of thing, and for once, i want in on the ground floor."
27695,Homer,"well, my special mix tape will get you going."
21852,Homer,"ooh, look at me! i'm kim basinger, the big movie star! i'm so beautiful! i think i'm so great! i'm too important to take homer to the oscars."
15158,Homer,how could you let this happen?
14479,Homer,"now, marge. maggie was very young. it's not like we got so attached to her. no. marge, isn't life funny? one day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. oh."
41060,Homer,but i can't afford to...
22536,Homer,correction. kill us both.
13957,Homer,"yes, sir."
33520,Homer,that's not true. you have bug bites you can scratch.
15906,Homer,woo hoo!
19425,Homer,hot! hot!
20127,Homer,"come on, boot guy!"
25337,Homer,up- bup...
23462,Homer,"i'm sorry, i believe in good grooming."
38316,Homer,"thanks, frenchy."
15152,Homer,ice cream truck!
28614,Homer,so much metal in my eye.
35252,Homer,"gee, sorry, dave."
30097,Homer,"lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?"
36249,Homer,so you guys have any luck finding a new job?
22460,Homer,give something back? boo! get a haircut!
18163,Homer,"so you finally learned my name, eh?"
21717,Homer,more than a lush head of hair?
23062,Homer,"oh, all right."
33108,Homer,"eh, let my dad enjoy 'em a little longer."
14163,Homer,la la la la la...
34287,Homer,"ooo, you're mad when you're angry..."
17555,Homer,"oh, being stuck on this god forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite i have."
18716,Homer,"you kids should thank your mother. now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
34569,Homer,"now, lisa, i know you miss your whale. so i got you a pet that will never die. an invisible dog."
25243,Homer,that thing got picture-in-picture?
38932,Homer,"come on, kids! there's nothing you'd be interested in here."
28537,Homer,and here's another act of christian charity i pulled out of my butt.
13676,Homer,"so, flanders, have you sold anything?"
14241,Homer,there's a problem with the reactor?! we're all gonna die!!!
28749,Homer,uhh... i'll tell you what's goin' on...
35854,Homer,"no, i just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
29918,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
13589,Homer,not me. i got this.
13691,Homer,but the note was asking you to --
27641,Homer,now wait just a minute -- i used to worry marge was too good for me. she was always thinking of ways to improve me. but then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. so we're all where we want to be.
22566,Homer,"c'mon, kids, i went too far."
28340,Homer,"her luggage is inscribed ""h.r.h."" -- which means her real name must be... henrietta r. hippo."
23773,Homer,and the exits are sealed! go to plan b!
35326,Homer,i forgot why i'm doing this.
39894,Homer,uh... maybe. hold on a second.
16410,Homer,thanks boy. now be careful when you...
20221,Homer,mmmm... re-circulated air.
30890,Homer,"listen up, stonehenge. i made a drawing of the places on marge you can't touch. especially the hair."
16165,Homer,i gotta call burns! i gotta call burns. maybe i can still get that drink!
14172,Homer,"okay, bad example. so let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
15695,Homer,"yeah, syrup is better than jelly."
34067,Homer,classic.
16961,Homer,"son, i know you're upset because you thought you saw us on tv saying we didn't want you in our family. but those were just actors playing us."
27177,Homer,"sure, why not?"
26303,Homer,start the movie!
41015,Homer,huh?
37438,Homer,tell me about it.
27143,Homer,"marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children."
29375,Homer,"honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. remember, i did used to work at a science factory."
15581,Homer,yes.
36576,Homer,i like it when you don't say words.
24587,Homer,"hey, leave my daughter alone! c'mon, humans! we've wiped out entire species before. we can do it again!"
17490,Homer,dad? this photo is a blessing. it eases my pain.
35229,Homer,why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
16127,Homer,oh. then i learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
28380,Homer,birds!
39413,Homer,"me in charge of safety? this place could blow sky-high. nah. i'll concentrate on my work now. gee, this guy's desk sure is big. i can't let marge support the family. this guy's got the cleanest shirt i've ever seen. what should i..."
28817,Homer,investor confidence? perhaps this affects me -- i own two hundred and thirty million shares of ziffcorp stock.
22248,Homer,a lion!
16814,Homer,yeah.
24060,Homer,quit hogging flanders. i want to comfort him.
29488,Homer,catch your flight?
24386,Homer,wooo! i like mu-sic!
35922,Homer,"welcome back to ""gut check."" i have something very, very pro-american to share with you. come with me."
32742,Homer,have you ever wondered what i do in that locked room?
39853,Homer,uh-oh. wait a minute. wait a minute. stop the music... quiet please... i have something to say. quiet!
28737,Homer,i don't understand.
22611,Homer,who's fonzie?! don't they teach you anything in school? he freed the squares.
20060,Homer,"it's not a plant, marge, it's a tree, and i've nearly chewed through it. now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
16026,Homer,lousy speed bumps.
15627,Homer,ugly... wiener... crater face... soo-ee! soo-ee!...
41400,Homer,are you god?
28412,Homer,"that is so cool. all right, you can come."
26894,Homer,"lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!"
24886,Homer,i'm mr. x! gimme! gimme!
14863,Homer,never mind.
23394,Homer,"good-bye lisa, remember me as i am... filled with murderous rage."
31536,Homer,"and to think, he and i once shared a shower."
29862,Homer,i wouldn't ruin a surprise for lenny.
33476,Homer,"let's go, kids. i can't watch any more."
21019,Homer,see ya in a week.
40613,Homer,"oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!"
23677,Homer,beautiful.
32113,Homer,this is our relish tray. i'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.
26585,Homer,check please.
30007,Homer,"don't lose hope, sweetie. i'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. and that's not just the beer talking. your father's in here too."
33017,Homer,i can't take another word out of you!
22574,Homer,oh no. i'm out of popcorn.
35549,Homer,"no, not the middle seat!"
13355,Homer,i put it there.
37566,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
35495,Homer,"yeah, right. a baby shot a guy."
35191,Homer,flat tire? no problem!
34284,Homer,can i help you with that?
14618,Homer,but it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
41230,Homer,what does that mean? better say something or they'll think you're stupid.
28169,Homer,"no way. forget it. i might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but i am not a grim reaper."
40367,Homer,"do you wanna try a little harder, son? come on, give it a girl's name."
24984,Homer,what in the hell are you talking about?
36247,Homer,it's a simple question! are you a: working hard or b:
34510,Homer,"okay, maybe i lied. but you've been so needy... ""i'm hungry,"" ""i'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
20729,Homer,oh. bart?
17035,Homer,"well... i can tell the difference between butter and ""i can't believe it's not butter."""
28983,Homer,"and look at me, i'm reading ""the economist."" did you know indonesia is at a crossroads?"
23036,Homer,"it's just that you and maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while i got marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive."
27713,Homer,yes!
36850,Homer,"thanks, baby. here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
29543,Homer,dammit! will you take a check?
34549,Homer,"be careful! if you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
26034,Homer,nobody's gonna kill you.
35276,Homer,"please, marge, no! the other negligent dads'll make fun of me! they're so cliquey!"
38811,Homer,i don't wanna ruin the magic and i certainly
32341,Homer,"moe the tavern, not moe the person."
23864,Homer,"oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? oh, there's no such thing."
31280,Homer,"hey, that's great. let's look at it after."
28959,Homer,"marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and i became one."
30576,Homer,"son, i need to find a new friend for your mother. so you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself."
36240,Homer,"mr. burns, before i leave, i've got a few things to get off my chest: one: i liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". you don't have to know how long. two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? you know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. so to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
34833,Homer,"tell her ""no deal""."
30780,Homer,huh?
23167,Homer,i'm on it.
17199,Homer,"i've got a problem. once you stop this car, i'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then i'll never be able to let you go."
38516,Homer,"awaiting your orders, mr. midshipman!"
27878,Homer,"which one was better: ""livin' la pizza loca"" or ""another one bites the crust""?"
15141,Homer,"all right, all right. young man, since you broke grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
24292,Homer,"marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... oh, it's just barney."
13792,Homer,you think it's him?
18934,Homer,"no, marge. apu convinced me that proposition 24 is a big mistake."
14908,Homer,"match point, homer."
35392,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. all day long i have to listen to women talk."
13985,Homer,"uh, let's see, bart's friends... well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
17342,Homer,"come here, you butterball."
33779,Homer,enough to build a washington monument.
27266,Homer,"hm, off again. maybe i can hear what's going on."
27341,Homer,what a rip! you all should be ashamed!
41275,Homer,"no, no! he'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
16234,Homer,"marge, it's public tv! they never have anything good. where are the geraldos? where are the eubankses-es?"
31325,Homer,go on.
19997,Homer,i don't know. i'm kind of dizzy. i should probably go home sick.
22628,Homer,"ooh, anything spicy?"
31911,Homer,wanna suck on the receipt?
36284,Homer,"flanders, i don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. i look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws."
17923,Homer,"look, all i ask is that you be fair."
23671,Homer,"free baby cola? apu hits the jackpot, and i'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets."
22447,Homer,"this is our chance to rub elbows with springfield's young, hip power couples... like me and debbie pinson."
30912,Homer,i'll show you all. i'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!
19992,Homer,"no, run around in circles!"
19440,Homer,"huh? sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset / sunrise, sunset..."
35757,Homer,"well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
30569,Homer,"you're like all easter bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. oh, hey marge."
17787,Homer,"ooh, i've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
15926,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna miss you so much. and it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. but mostly, i'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
15530,Homer,do you want to change your name to homer junior? the kids can call you hoju!
40202,Homer,"uh... uh yes, sir."
14445,Homer,she's startin' to give.
38254,Homer,"that's all right, brain. if i die, i'll be doing the thing i love the most: trying not to get killed."
38671,Homer,my bowling buddy.
28235,Homer,"i mean, i'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. hell, i torched a blood bank. one cookie my ass! please, please, give me back my mommy."
20353,Homer,pull!
28864,Homer,i'm in no condition to drive. wait -- i shouldn't listen to myself. i'm drunk.
15015,Homer,"boy, everyone is stupid except me."
37601,Homer,heere's the climax
22592,Homer,woo hoo! let's party!
24617,Homer,i accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose!
18087,Homer,but you thought they were.
27287,Homer,"uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, i'd like to buy a copy of jugs and ammo."
35043,Homer,"oh, you beautiful man."
16418,Homer,i mean... you know if we wanted to... not that i... ever did.
34554,Homer,haven't you learned anything from watching bart drive?
13251,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa. i'm just trying to get in. i'm not running for jesus."
38557,Homer,please tell me i'm still beautiful!
29476,Homer,"thanks, honey. my mind is completely at ease."
23120,Homer,"hmmm, i'm not certain about lenny."
17413,Homer,not with that attitude.
36575,Homer,"oh, like what you see, huh?"
27135,Homer,"well, you're very sweet, mick, but the only rocking i want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family."
24374,Homer,a mother can't die. and i'm a mother. see?
17041,Homer,"yes, lisa. daddy's a teacher."
22672,Homer,like what?
41392,Homer,why not?
14366,Homer,"that's right. my god, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
31047,Homer,i do eat a lot of crap.
13350,Homer,why? what'd you do?
18062,Homer,"lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, i recommend getting a tattoo. it preserves the things you love."
40164,Homer,"oooh, a feast."
28535,Homer,just like the pope!
38370,Homer,hey!
33542,Homer,a boat!
19182,Homer,"hey, what's this?"
22770,Homer,"uh, um, uh... i think we should see other people?"
40292,Homer,"with the fickle fans already forgetting me, i was ready to take the biggest step of my life."
36587,Homer,"for the third time this year, yes!"
32101,Homer,i'm so happy!
17120,Homer,"don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer."
19020,Homer,"you know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- christianity."
23986,Homer,what-everrr!
20799,Homer,wait - i'm confused about the movie. so the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
34621,Homer,"into the playpen, sweetie. and if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
23872,Homer,i see the light! it burns!
28261,Homer,"yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. but i'm not gonna leave you."
13415,Homer,same as usual. perfectomundo.
25904,Homer,"ah, son, it's a little chilly. maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
23353,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
18169,Homer,were you the ugly one?
21715,Homer,the kid's gotta die.
37327,Homer,"oh. well, you know how in the special olympics they give medals just for showing up?"
22754,Homer,"relax, i found it in the dumpster."
13610,Homer,hmph?
16100,Homer,"i'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. the dean'll go nuts!"
36030,Homer,then why am i paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
24908,Homer,so i'm a prisoner? how come?
32212,Homer,"keep reachin' for the stars, kid."
13175,Homer,you're superior to me in every way!
32705,Homer,"sorry, maggie."
22508,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i got something really special planned for valentine's day."
24940,Homer,the dog thinks so...
31891,Homer,what's wrong with it?
29009,Homer,"marge, i guess we'll just have to make love in heaven. i'll bet it always works up there."
31767,Homer,"tick tock, sweetie."
36266,Homer,"okay, i'm up again."
23020,Homer,i am.
24014,Homer,"man, i got more trophies than wayne gretzky and the pope combined."
29601,Homer,"have you read them all? okay, good."
26911,Homer,exactly.
34409,Homer,porky pig?
35285,Homer,wha-wha-what are you doing?
18960,Homer,"nobody knows the band, grand funk? the wild shirtless lyrics of mark farner? the bong-rattling bass of mel schacher? the competent drumwork of don brewer? oh, man."
39854,Homer,"quiet! i have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. it's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. no, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. and you know something, folks? as ridiculous as it sounds, i would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as i sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's g-string. am i wrong, or am i right?"
30995,Homer,i've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
21544,Homer,bringin' up the rear.
15228,Homer,"no! mr. burns, i'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
18424,Homer,"this may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! i'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! the overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. and they're gonna make their voices heard! all they need is a leader!"
28276,Homer,i win!
16524,Homer,"aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it."
26092,Homer,"ooo, mama celeste."
23829,Homer,"well, i think we're on the outs with him, but i know someone who's even holier than jesus."
15304,Homer,almost time for our commercial.
34650,Homer,thirty-nine.
13628,Homer,free food?!
18661,Homer,this is gonna be sweet. two hundred bottle rockets and george bush doing toe touches by an open window.
21835,Homer,"okay, okay, it was me. i'm sorry i blew your secret. but you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. i just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. reflected glory!"
37974,Homer,really? don't you ever look up at the sky?
17835,Homer,"psh, that's no reason to block the tv."
34055,Homer,bonjour.
39954,Homer,you might say that. my wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks i'm a pig.
32011,Homer,"rice krispie treats? way to phone it in, sarah wiggum!"
28067,Homer,"you could be on to something there, doc..."
38955,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
15600,Homer,"hmm, i keep thinking i'm forgetting something."
32553,Homer,remembrance of things fast?
19194,Homer,"brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
33746,Homer,"well, i know when i'm not wanted. am i wanted?"
15656,Homer,oh. right.
16089,Homer,"look, i'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."
33903,Homer,"let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. lisa?"
29080,Homer,"mr. simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
32771,Homer,fatherhood hurts my brain.
13372,Homer,"hmmm, bait."
21497,Homer,thank you...
25433,Homer,wait a minute. will this erase my memory?
13526,Homer,"oh thank you, marge -- pink?"
22289,Homer,"oh, my god! look what those rotten kids did to my car!"
32583,Homer,"and goodbye, cruller world."
39705,Homer,"make it, make it, make it, make it."
27408,Homer,the man who framed you is a crooked detective. who i hired!
19242,Homer,"what... but... marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
13765,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
37947,Homer,marge and i get along perfect. we're like george burns and john denver.
39734,Homer,huh? whuh?
31472,Homer,recording that fake fight was a great idea.
33924,Homer,"what'd you think, kids?"
22921,Homer,"welcome to the kitchen of tomorrow today! marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?"
36844,Homer,"no, i'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. i never want to see these again."
19039,Homer,i left a few helpful notes around the house...
36857,Homer,t-rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
20811,Homer,"marge, when i join an underground cult, i expect a little support from my family."
16740,Homer,i'll take care of this.
17005,Homer,oh.
28744,Homer,it doesn't matter!
28624,Homer,the business of being a dad. can you hand me that magnet?
25974,Homer,i thought you said you had to go.
27136,Homer,"nah, i've got something to remember 'em by."
31056,Homer,i'd better get ready -- i'm next!
23509,Homer,"i wish i could make a difference, lisa, but i'm just one man."
24877,Homer,no!
19950,Homer,lisa! you have a guest!
26061,Homer,windowsill.
24782,Homer,no!
33492,Homer,yes.
29777,Homer,why you little...!
15559,Homer,but i wanna go to duff gardens. right now!
22883,Homer,killer umbrellas? of course. exquisite.
13530,Homer,you! you did this to me!
17363,Homer,"no, wait! i love lisa!"
37709,Homer,"i don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but i feel great."
28058,Homer,"it's okay, marge. it would have been a lot worse if i hadn't been carrying this bible in my crotch."
30710,Homer,only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
29354,Homer,yeah. nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.

16240,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. it was worth it."
31699,Homer,"oh, spirit. are you gonna show me my future? my snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? well, it's not too late for me to change!"
35464,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. daddy will put jack back in the box."
14047,Homer,"bart, why are you still up?"
36916,Homer,he knows i love him. and he loves me.
19838,Homer,don't laugh at me! i was once like you!
38013,Homer,wait a minute. marge said we were out of ice cream.
24743,Homer,"this is your fault, with your non-threatening bobby sherman-style good looks. no girl could resist your charms."
17053,Homer,okay. but then we've got to get to work.

15661,Homer,"first, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. that's when it's time to kick some back."
21588,Homer,"ohh, that's where you're wrong, marge. he was a shameless self-promoter."
22487,Homer,"oh, don't make me choose."
18908,Homer,we're here! we're queer! we don't want any more bears!
14025,Homer,"i'll just sit here in ""li'l lightnin'"" -- which the simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, i had a son."

32478,Homer,"listen marge... i've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? let's face it... you could do better."
20794,Homer,what kind of beer?
34983,Homer,"sorry, boss."
26253,Homer,mm-hm.
33361,Homer,"because when vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life."
25099,Homer,huh? what is this crap?
40796,Homer,"marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
27789,Homer,talking won't get you there.
17406,Homer,"...somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed, she was sitting on the gummy venus so i grabbed it off of her. oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. i just wish i had another one right now. but the most important thing is..."

25826,Homer,"ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves."
38993,Homer,can we cuddle for a little while?
28435,Homer,time to whiz in a foaming bowl of china...
28975,Homer,why you little...
29179,Homer,these batteries have to power everything in our house!
25986,Homer,what's the gag?
26107,Homer,do me! do me!
40573,Homer,a million dollars. my wife cost me a million dollars.
20743,Homer,it's a ring toss game.
18933,Homer,"hey marge, look what i brought home."
18242,Homer,aww.
40728,Homer,"ugh, gross. ecch."
40206,Homer,"i bet you could afford it, though."
32207,Homer,and the home of the bra-a-ave!
18978,Homer,"i went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music i'd never heard of. it was like the store had gone crazy."
36760,Homer,i left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
25117,Homer,there's a crayon in my brain?!
41550,Homer,"we are sadgasm, and this song is called... ""politically incorrect."""
23531,Homer,i don't know why we ever left in the first place.
15540,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
17950,Homer,"yeah, well i won the belching contest at work."
35888,Homer,i regret nothing... except this part!
33673,Homer,"now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
21351,Homer,la la la la la la la la...
28591,Homer,"hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day."
17183,Homer,go to hell!
25828,Homer,"i know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, irish-style!"
36471,Homer,"he took the time to press the shift key, marge! i think he knows what he's talking about."
30244,Homer,"it's not my fault the raiders lost, it's professor pigskin's!"
36208,Homer,there's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!
18357,Homer,"yes, sweetheart?"
19423,Homer,"hello, chief."
40996,Homer,"wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. let me see if i got this straight... it's christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach..."
13246,Homer,what the hell was i thinking?
24444,Homer,sorry.
16258,Homer,lumber has a million uses.
18999,Homer,"you know, marge, in some ways you and i are very different people..."
18355,Homer,"i'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. but try to see it my way. all my life i've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
26883,Homer,i want to confess. i killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. marge is completely innocent. the only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder i did.
13365,Homer,"oh, well, it's very tempting. really a wonderful idea."
22022,Homer,"well now that's what i always thought, but somehow..."
40640,Homer,be intimate with marge.
25440,Homer,"i don't mind being called a liar when i'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. but not when i'm telling the truth."
24993,Homer,in a way. but i also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. plus the baldness.
25770,Homer,all my love has come back in trophy form.
29197,Homer,"and while you're there, can you get my frisbee off the ledge?"
27750,Homer,"no, it's entirely within my power. furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. check and mate. now, king me!"
37922,Homer,consulate.
34000,Homer,"now remember, no loud noises. oh man, that breeze feels good!"
14019,Homer,"loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
19292,Homer,"what are you doing, marge? didn't you hear the song?"
30389,Homer,oh yeah.
21591,Homer,"from this day forward, i am an inventor!"
18191,Homer,"now wait a minute! okay, i'm not gonna win father of the year. in fact, i'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. wait, can i start again? fathering children is the best part of my day... i'd do anything for bart and lisa!"
16657,Homer,woo hoo!
36790,Homer,which of you is the youtube of the kid high on dentist's gas? is it you? is it you? is it you?
20373,Homer,"oh, i see bart gets to have a gun."
13169,Homer,i don't belong here!
37341,Homer,"listen pal, this may sound kinda kinky, but i would like to, uh, please my wife."
30924,Homer,hurry up and kill it! i have to be at the opera by seven!
14568,Homer,one thing i'm good at and i can't do it anymore.
27942,Homer,fresca?!
41293,Homer,"okay homer, don't speak. if you must make a sound, whistle."
18244,Homer,shut up.
36283,Homer,when i'm done with my robo-botomies.
41175,Homer,"if you need me, i'll be in the refrigerator."
40170,Homer,huh?
26778,Homer,"...so anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
27461,Homer,"no, actually, i'm going to eat twice as much."
41331,Homer,go ahead! give in! beer! beer!
16998,Homer,"maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
34820,Homer,"no child of mine will go without anything, ever! except quality healthcare!"
21192,Homer,"you're pushin' me, baby."
25083,Homer,pick me! pick me!
35185,Homer,"oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""
37498,Homer,carl's family was even worse than people thought.
30030,Homer,it's called smoozing!
20389,Homer,"oh, marge, there's so many things i want to yell to you!"
24502,Homer,you're almost there.
23405,Homer,"ooo, you don't want to get zorro mad."
36254,Homer,"i just have to press this button, right..."
19248,Homer,"it'll be okay, honey. there's lots more oil where that came from."
32228,Homer,marge!

17262,Homer,"hm, not a drop in the house. what do you know?"
14318,Homer,"well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."

27444,Homer,don't worry. everything is fine. what the hell is that?
37325,Homer,"i'm planing down that door that always sticks. i put training wheels on bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
15156,Homer,i'unno.
24184,Homer,"come on little friend, make a wisecrack. you know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."

32172,Homer,i wanna say one.
40031,Homer,hmmmm
34292,Homer,how's this for a date night?
31231,Homer,"this doesn't look easy, but i'll bet it is."
29063,Homer,"what if he started pieing good people? not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
38455,Homer,who the hell is that?!
25688,Homer,do i detect a hint of cinnamon?
36487,Homer,i appreciate that.
16794,Homer,heh heh. ow.

36444,Homer,"yes, sweetie?"
28199,Homer,"honey, this is your moment in the sun. and i couldn't be more pleased for your happiness."
21931,Homer,heh. that's what i thought at first. but then i found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
35577,Homer,"the least i can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. it's kind of my way of sending a christmas card. happy holidays, everyone! family's fine!"
15903,Homer,your daddy hit the referee.
31045,Homer,i'm your husband!
15957,Homer,just leave it to me.
41135,Homer,"all right, everybody stick together. we don't want to get separated..."
40050,Homer,out of tartar sauce.
33180,Homer,"look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. you have all your hair... unlike me. no kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... oh, god, i hate my life!"
28228,Homer,"you sure know me, mom."
34112,Homer,"i know you miss him, boy. so let's you and me spend some quality father and son time."
35079,Homer,can't lose that. it's the best picture of me i have.
21547,Homer,and now we wait. so... is this your school?
33226,Homer,"well, i had a little help from this guy."
22726,Homer,the trucks drive themselves?
39927,Homer,"sorry, pal..."
36199,Homer,quick! gum up the gears with moes!
27080,Homer,i am so excited i couldn't fall asleep! i even took some pills i found on the floor and still nothing!
35258,Homer,"well, this has been great. we should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting."
35419,Homer,and these keys are from all my jobs.
34072,Homer,stomp it! crush it! kill it!
20023,Homer,it's him! it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
32571,Homer,"it's okay -- we're not really your kids. we're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
39469,Homer,probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
30970,Homer,"i'm so bored, i figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats."
13993,Homer,"you don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
14124,Homer,sell! sell! sell! woo hoo! twenty-five dollars!
39828,Homer,"i don't really know, sir."
15105,Homer,did you wreck the car?
15832,Homer,i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
37662,Homer,people called him the sixth simpson. not sure why.
18275,Homer,"i don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
39043,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! you saved my life. which is gonna make what i'm about to say even more awkward...
27851,Homer,"no, no. this is nothing like milhouse's parents. now if you need me i'll be staying with milhouse's father."
29796,Homer,"oh my god! that man might be hurt! guards, there's a prisoner in there!"
21399,Homer,stay there! i'll come down and save you!
13277,Homer,i do not miss bart at all.
28622,Homer,"you think you've got problems, look what i just pulled out of my arm!"
24507,Homer,i want to set the record straight. i thought the cop was a prostitute.
24671,Homer,"but those olde springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like keith partridge."
14085,Homer,"how could you do this to me, moe? this bar was going under and it was the drink i invented that saved it."
35248,Homer,okay. i'll go get some stuff.
23297,Homer,whew.
26009,Homer,i'm gonna tell moe exactly what i think of his...
34513,Homer,everything.
34399,Homer,"this really means a lot to you, huh?"
27890,Homer,"but it was marge. my first and only love. i'm like david spade without chris farley, alone and useless!"
29045,Homer,"so it would seem. anyhoo, i'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? mild-mannered homer simpson..."
34430,Homer,"i'm more than okay! i am the messiah, come to save the world! look upon me and shudder!"
21487,Homer,okay!
13989,Homer,next.
36231,Homer,"oh man, i'd better have some coffee and iced tea."

34954,Homer,don't tell me i'm not capable of good behavior!
32597,Homer,marge put so much work into that party. the least i could do is be surprised. if only i could forget what happened today.
19449,Homer,"marge? marge? oh, now what? if you're still mad at me, i'm gonna be really mad."
25558,Homer,the simpsons are going to africa!

39882,Homer,"affectionate little albanian, isn't he?"
31003,Homer,"all right, i can see this is all up to me."
18751,Homer,"oh yeah? well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
18457,Homer,why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
29864,Homer,"hey, watch what you say about him. i think ray could be the one."
18863,Homer,"oh, that'd be great! sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... it'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
33385,Homer,"now, dondelinger, i want some answers."
31824,Homer,never!
27020,Homer,"you know, you're not helping."
19566,Homer,look! there it is!

28623,Homer,"that's what we in the business call ""a biggie."""
26050,Homer,"these fortunes are terrible. they're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
31812,Homer,clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
37652,Homer,"those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. now, the toast..."

19306,Homer,shut up and let the woman talk.
15842,Homer,"now, come on. you're gonna learn how to shave."
17227,Homer,i'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
25505,Homer,"oh. okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
16607,Homer,"well, mr. cat burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? there's just one little problem. thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named homer j. sim -- oh my god! underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
30153,Homer,wait'll i tell everyone about this! i'll feel important without drinking! that'll be weird.
40064,Homer,"no, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye."
30205,Homer,mickey mouse's dog?
29176,Homer,stupid women drivers.
37413,Homer,the crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
18504,Homer,"now you, boy!"
30335,Homer,i can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
31823,Homer,"oh marge, you gotta get on the net. it's got all the best conspiracy theories. did you know that hezbollah owns little dolly snack cakes? this stuff will rock your world."
16886,Homer,"plants, eh?"

41182,Homer,"come on, marge. paint. i think you can do it."
28138,Homer,... daddy feels rejected / he's gonna eat some cake.
33154,Homer,"marge, when i'm with you, i get that feeling like when i got that smart kid's report card by mistake. for a minute, i thought i had all a's. and that my name was howard simberg."
30011,Homer,"of course, sweetie. you and i are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken hellhole."
25289,Homer,"lookin' good, honey. i think you and i might just win this tournament dealy."
15359,Homer,when the working day is done / girls just wanna have fu-un / that's all we really wannnnt...
21997,Homer,"it's because they're stupid, that's why. that's why everybody does everything."
15140,Homer,"but marge, look at that hangdog expression. he's learned his lesson. let's get him a present."
33359,Homer,no. yes.

16066,Homer,something i should have done a long time ago...
26798,Homer,it was magic. he took a cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
28540,Homer,ewww.

14524,Homer,beer! how did you know?
27098,Homer,"well, whaddaya think?"
37308,Homer,"well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch."
16045,Homer,the bee bit my bottom. now my bottom's big! oh!
15258,Homer,"no, that's not it. what's his name? the man of la mancha."
39458,Homer,"look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. we've got to do better as a family. so tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the tv. we're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
30371,Homer,"oh. you always gotta work blue, don't ya marge?"
16443,Homer,"ah, home to my loving family. what more can a man ask for?"
41127,Homer,but you could lose everything. come on.

26714,Homer,my ice cream sandwich! then where the hell's the remote?!
23464,Homer,"oh, that's just superstition."
21258,Homer,woo hoo!

25525,Homer,"""olive oil?"" ""asparagus?"" if your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
39571,Homer,"bart, go easy on me. i'm your dad."
23486,Homer,it's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
26176,Homer,"one, two, three."
31440,Homer,"sweetie, i can't abandon my route even for one day. if those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, i am screwed. but i'll be back in time for your show."
23529,Homer,mindy?
35716,Homer,"all right, that's it! forget it! no toys for anyone!"
31889,Homer,"and remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. okay, who else is dead in bed?"
32716,Homer,what?! i'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
17587,Homer,i felt so left out.
32974,Homer,"now, let's think about this. if you shoot me, i won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. but someone may come after you. probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. what i'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
36592,Homer,"so, you're not totally unqualified."
16048,Homer,just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
15872,Homer,what can i say? it hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
32432,Homer,"fine, i admit it. i'm drunk!"
19895,Homer,the guy who took your job.
35887,Homer,"you can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! and why is there moisture between the windows?! and don't wake me up to land! just land!"
15372,Homer,my cousin frank did it.
37474,Homer,"just say he's black, moe."
30699,Homer,"ha-ha! that's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
28588,Homer,here we go. now it starts with the fees.
37199,Homer,"there's other p.o.s? uh-oh, better put on my game shades."
15412,Homer,"please, please, please, please, please..."
40156,Homer,"that should just about do it. man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection..."
15388,Homer,your what-what?

22282,Homer,"hey, a baseball field! batter up!"

31432,Homer,"marge, i... folk art!? that's my favorite kind of folk medium!"
25702,Homer,i think ned is gonna be all right...
40341,Homer,"no, no, marge. don't backpedal. you were right the first time. he's perfect. perfect in every way."
26083,Homer,good fire. good fire. keep burning. almost there.
39189,Homer,"all right, as long as it's just questions."
28814,Homer,all of them.
25585,Homer,it's a flower.
21789,Homer,"yeah, tell you the truth, i'm not even sure."
32373,Homer,"now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
33741,Homer,"up-bup-bup. no jell-o for you, bart -- it'll keep you up at night. like last week when you crawled into bed with me and mommy?"
15377,Homer,i can't afford that!
37614,Homer,see?
36311,Homer,it's programmed to my specifications!
22612,Homer,where? i don't see that.
17494,Homer,so are you gonna say something nice now?
26863,Homer,o-kay.
22829,Homer,"uh... all right! just go ahead and sue me. everybody else does! the average settlement is $68,000."
36767,Homer,i'm sonny bono. watch out for that tree!
29119,Homer,don't forget maggie!
18474,Homer,i 'unno. i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
16518,Homer,"wait. i see what's happening here. you're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. well, that's just sad."
35850,Homer,"hey, i got a b-mail too! ""you have won a valuable prize! open now""..."
20133,Homer,"oh no, it's getting dark. well, that's it. i'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!"
17039,Homer,"look, everyone! now that i'm a teacher, i've sewed patches on my elbows."
28164,Homer,"death, death, we miss you so much. you were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. and you made nascar racing exciting."
37210,Homer,"yeah. gay rights are human rights, baby."
17381,Homer,"run, marge! save the booty!"
38170,Homer,oh it is.
31673,Homer,"why would i go to utah? i love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
24983,Homer,"a singing rubber fish, of course."
32258,Homer,that's my car!
40815,Homer,what?
37394,Homer,is that the radon detector?
39154,Homer,and you gave it to him?
18110,Homer,"well, what do you call it?"
40401,Homer,woo-hoo-hoo!
29078,Homer,"eww! i kissed that sad, weird kid!"
26117,Homer,"wait a minute. i remember falling in the mud, but i don't think that's why i've been screaming..."
18447,Homer,sixty-one... sixty-two... sixty-three...
29707,Homer,"wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate."
32274,Homer,"man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life."
15738,Homer,i never realized how boring this game is.
41584,Homer,"ketchup, please."
17204,Homer,embarrassed? what are you talking about?
27388,Homer,mom? don't you think i could read the report by myself?
32531,Homer,"maggie? has anyone seen anyone?! oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. without me!"
22721,Homer,okay-we're-all-set-let's-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal!
21875,Homer,but i can't ask mom. she's on the run from the law.
23880,Homer,can't make a float without flowers.

17393,Homer,oh that. no. i was just grabbing a gummy venus de milo that got stuck to your pants.
29433,Homer,"all right, i'm comin' back there."
38260,Homer,i've never seen anything so beautiful.
31828,Homer,"hey, lisa, self-conscious about your shins? in my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
29298,Homer,really? frankfurter... is that anything?
25197,Homer,"hey, it feels a little better."
21440,Homer,"no, no. don't do that."
36701,Homer,that's how wolves die in the wild.
30668,Homer,or a place run by a hindu!
41334,Homer,or was it?
16676,Homer,"uh, i like to keep a lollipop there."
36153,Homer,how ya doin' there?
39785,Homer,tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman i love. and i won't be back for ten minutes.
27678,Homer,yeah. and to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
24906,Homer,how did i get here? what is this place?
30107,Homer,but my prediction says--
38523,Homer,"my one weakness: the third ""really."" come with me."
14658,Homer,that's right.
22119,Homer,you... monster! how could you do that to the children?!
20753,Homer,cooder! what have you done to our house?
17419,Homer,"oh, marge. it's a miracle."
18904,Homer,"all right, that does it. if i'm gonna be trapped inside the house i gotta go out and buy some beer."
26727,Homer,"oh my gosh, you're right. i'm a rage-aholic. i just can't live without rage-ahol!"
33188,Homer,anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
19923,Homer,"no! bart had his turn, let me! i can't resist his charms."
39619,Homer,"oh, well, i don't know. would it be alright if i conferred with my family?"
15153,Homer,"me, me. i was here first!"
15770,Homer,"hey, lenny, can you get this sugar daddy off my back?"
33519,Homer,"kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy."
27977,Homer,"i want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. marge, prepare the emergency ham."
20049,Homer,"change the channel, marge."
24625,Homer,there. we're officially a city. now we just sit back and wait for an nfl franchise.
15685,Homer,really?
14518,Homer,"what do ya think, lisa?"
25308,Homer,don't touch me. your hands feel like salad tongs.
38324,Homer,somebody kill me.
22153,Homer,really? would you say i was magnetic?
22527,Homer,"sir elton, my noble friends and i would like to dub you a knight of the... grand concourse."
29031,Homer,"what's wrong, son?"
24760,Homer,"okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. what are you gonna do about it?"
16709,Homer,"one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock. five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock!.."
35839,Homer,what about mimes?
34578,Homer,you like sharks?
39913,Homer,gee whiz. adil would get a kick out of seeing this.
30351,Homer,"finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house."
39451,Homer,wahhhhhhhhh!
33918,Homer,a montage of me turning a ragtag little league team into state runners-up?
38312,Homer,"i'm sorry, that's all very nice. but i can't forget what you said."
15642,Homer,pepi.
20018,Homer,"oh, what'll i do, moe?"
35133,Homer,okay... i'll take some of... that.
32408,Homer,"i want to, but i can't!"

33550,Homer,were you listening at all?
41518,Homer,what the heck is that thing?
37256,Homer,we really appreciate that.
31261,Homer,"we need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
30023,Homer,"hey, these are red vines. here you go, sweetie. daddy got you your candy."
27169,Homer,"you know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
33211,Homer,have i made the bet yet?
38702,Homer,ooh! how 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
38987,Homer,"y'know, i used to have this friend... i told him all my dreams. really, really great kid."
28601,Homer,wait a minute. what is it my dad always said to me?
21072,Homer,y'ello.
24859,Homer,"no kiddin'. what do you think of my page, lisa? be honest. it's great, isn't it? go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
39940,Homer,"the reason i look unhappy is that tonight i have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as i call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
13444,Homer,"what's the problem, boy?"
27836,Homer,yeah.
27772,Homer,"c'mon, boy. you're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor."
25962,Homer,"yes. eventually, i became king of the morlocks."
15841,Homer,they're fine.
24381,Homer,"well, enjoy your sightseeing. i promise i won't leave this bed."
40379,Homer,"oh, yeah? wanna bet?"
39101,Homer,"guys, i'm comin' back in. suck in your guts."
39029,Homer,so... what kind of lunch do you pack?
37437,Homer,"hair, no hair, i don't really think about it."
22969,Homer,"don't worry, mr. burns. we're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. besides, i'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
39732,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
37205,Homer,why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
29855,Homer,"aw, that's it. i'm going to moe's!"
22057,Homer,whew.
37998,Homer,"hey, everybody!"
33458,Homer,this counts as that.
14968,Homer,yesss!
40720,Homer,"all right, all right. time for dr. tv to perform a little surgery."
32665,Homer,"yep, that professor couldn't keep me and marge apart."

31370,Homer,don't forge? don't forge what?
28027,Homer,i did it. i walked all the way to moe's from my house.
20683,Homer,"something very close, exactly along those lines--a clint eastwood - lee marvin shoot 'em up western!"
22377,Homer,phone?
32529,Homer,"hey, kids! have you seen your mother?"
14489,Homer,"marge, dogs love the outdoors."
25838,Homer,"yeah, that's the price of success."
27103,Homer,noooo!!

16459,Homer,"oh mindy, you came and you gave without flaking. but i sent you ben-gay, oh andy, you kissed me and stopped me from something, and i..."
31070,Homer,"it was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know..."
36216,Homer,all right.
35160,Homer,uh-oh.
28860,Homer,"ahh, the germans. you just can't stay mad at 'em."
20973,Homer,"pff... ""simpson gene!"" somebody's got to set that girl straight. and i know how to do it."
26128,Homer,and someone has eaten the flesh.
15155,Homer,oh yeah. the trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
41223,Homer,okay. don't use reverse psychology.
31258,Homer,"look, i understand that you're mad. which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old springfield roller coaster."
17831,Homer,ta-da!
40046,Homer,great! great! great! how much? how much? how much?
24735,Homer,"ah, the luftwaffe. the washington generals of the history channel."
15343,Homer,"well, i guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
37456,Homer,i hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
35456,Homer,it's worse than you think. i have to buy you a new anniversary present.
33295,Homer,thank you.
15959,Homer,"the next day, we started auditioning for chief wiggum's replacement..."
32399,Homer,"marge, give me a break! i don't notice the color of people's eyes! i just judge them on the color of their skin."
27644,Homer,"hey, don't blame me, i voted for the green m&m."
38080,Homer,fine. i'll take you. they have this cool psych class at the campus i sat in on.
27310,Homer,i did it!

39687,Homer,"they've got us cornered, boy. we'll never get away. give me the head."
29049,Homer,i'll show him.
20538,Homer,sheesh! you're the most paranoid family i've ever been affiliated with.
32880,Homer,why would a robber make pie?
37072,Homer,that's some impressive flute-nastics.
29600,Homer,"eh, who needs tourists? they never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
30972,Homer,my life's work ruined.
16950,Homer,okay. lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
15166,Homer,"damn right. bart, you can't go to see that itchy & scratchy movie. ever!"
21219,Homer,"don't come off all high and mighty with me, patterson. you can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
20082,Homer,"well, bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?"
38865,Homer,look at all these knobs and buttons. they are clearly a superior race. but maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
35511,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him, expecting him to be larry right away. by the way, where is larry?"
41145,Homer,"but i'm going on a diet. from this day forward i pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! as god is my witness, i'll always be hungry again!"
19429,Homer,outstanding.
19283,Homer,"hi! now, marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about bart working in a burlesque house..."
34312,Homer,"credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?"
39555,Homer,lisa?
34496,Homer,chief... me too.

21181,Homer,"no, no. he's fine. go on, mojo, show marge your happy dance."
15025,Homer,"no, don't tell me, i'll get it... oh, i know! the lord is vengeful! o spiteful one! show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
39629,Homer,pfft. maps.

14385,Homer,tut-tut. only the best for my family.
13250,Homer,"no, not really. marge, you gotta help me. i have to do one good deed to get into heaven."
39228,Homer,"it's true. the jar's empty. oh, my god, we're ruined. christmas is cancelled. no presents for anyone."
39030,Homer,"wow. elon, you're like willie wonka without the underpaid munchkins."

14406,Homer,"look lisa, honey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings. but i really had a good time watching football with you. and i think you had a good time with me."

26783,Homer,"mmm, caramel baloney."
35388,Homer,"marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. it's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
33401,Homer,"i do! oh, right."
18788,Homer,it's mr. smithers. he's calling for you.
16291,Homer,"i miss you, marge."
25346,Homer,"you know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff."
39606,Homer,does it have a deep fryer?
26252,Homer,"wow, my vision is coming to life!"
34145,Homer,"hmm... i'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""
19881,Homer,"hey, banner, how's it hangin'?"
27928,Homer,three.
14827,Homer,that's right. there's no way my life could possibly get any worse.

31737,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
37979,Homer,woo-hoo!
23197,Homer,"hey, mel. i fell out."
30347,Homer,"tragically, yes."
38084,Homer,"marge, teens can't control their urges. it's why there's never been a teenage president."

38864,Homer,let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
39331,Homer,"doc, this is all too much. i mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?"
32536,Homer,"what's going on, why are you attacking me? look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in good 'n' plenty colors!"
40305,Homer,"right, mr. goofball."
22991,Homer,"oh, right."
33342,Homer,is it a place i'd look overdressed if i did wear a tie?
28314,Homer,thank you.
39668,Homer,no.
31639,Homer,"no, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it."
40914,Homer,"i'll tell you one thing, greasy joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me."
16565,Homer,i'm someone else!
34205,Homer,i'm alive! and surrounded by the...people i love the most in the...
36303,Homer,"now, to save on calories, i won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie."
33938,Homer,"marge, speak to me."
35238,Homer,let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. we've got something more important to attend to.

20157,Homer,"okay, once more. where are we going?"
19517,Homer,"it was an alien, marge! it appeared in front of me and said, ""don't be afraid!"""
21054,Homer,and you're like the father i never visit.
19597,Homer,"you must hate me, marge. every time i try to help, i just fail miserably."
32581,Homer,my life is ruined.
29660,Homer,"hey, why'd you lock the door? we're still inside!"
19369,Homer,"what is it, boy? fire? earthquake? hippies?"

15912,Homer,"gotta get a juicer. gonna drink juice, lose weight. won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore."
17305,Homer,"hey, where is everybody?"

39609,Homer,"yeah, how much is it?"
39554,Homer,"what did you do this time, you little hoodlum? oop. get out of the way."
18113,Homer,"herman, how could you? we've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? hard working designers, like calvin klein, gloria vanderbilt, or antoine bugle boy. these are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
39313,Homer,hey! no abbreviations!
24349,Homer,it's not bad.
30721,Homer,"boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
29771,Homer,"if you need me, i'll be in my trailer!"
25731,Homer,"oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. stupid flanders."
24157,Homer,"craig and amy, craig and amy. why don't you just marry craig and amy?"
22475,Homer,what?
31792,Homer,"well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
19799,Homer,"me too, son."
39980,Homer,bye kids. watch out for the boy.
27880,Homer,it would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
14997,Homer,"well, i wasn't sure i was doing the right thing. but then god himself told me i should seek a new path."
24901,Homer,what's going on?
29939,Homer,what are you talking about?
29506,Homer,'cause i want a sandwich
15852,Homer,"marge, i never graduated from high school."
22263,Homer,"oh, stupid isotopes. hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
19602,Homer,so burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
35897,Homer,almost a winner!
21066,Homer,"yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
38429,Homer,"see, marge. problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone."
36588,Homer,woo hoo!

41517,Homer,"hey, what happened to all the water?"
18240,Homer,"come on, eat the can. come on."
24778,Homer,whopping?
15858,Homer,i can't believe i ate the whole thing.
14106,Homer,i guess so.
26290,Homer,"no marge, i love when you do that. you're a regular carin' a-lot-ovich."
13381,Homer,"none of your business, flanders."
14979,Homer,and don't you think that the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
22388,Homer,"y'ello... yes, this is the original homer simpson. who's this?... the debbie pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... yes, i'm still available."
27453,Homer,"listen kids, your mom is going to be living in the basement. but with our love, she'll get better soon."

39647,Homer,"well, might be a few. but don't worry about it. if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
19302,Homer,"marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
41204,Homer,"hey, good evening, hezron, carver of graven images."
34052,Homer,i will! edamame?
25292,Homer,per-fect.
28853,Homer,"all good points. sleep tight, my drunken angel."
19689,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
31726,Homer,"what are you doing here, patty-or-selma?"
30949,Homer,are you kavi?
27054,Homer,"of course. it was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."
34629,Homer,"marge, have u left me 4..."
24971,Homer,there ya go! we'd be stealing from people we know. it's just like the seasons.
22872,Homer,i'm just gonna rest for a minute.
32481,Homer,no thanks -- just here for a battery.
28706,Homer,"marge, i've got it all figured out: lee harvey oswald wanted to steal the jack ruby."
27043,Homer,i've had just about enough of you.
27742,Homer,"i have a plan to get to the top, but i have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. i'm not sure i could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
18267,Homer,i know.
27794,Homer,"no, of course not!"
32233,Homer,"julia, wait!"

37715,Homer,eduardo. i haven't felt this good in years. you're like the tooth fairy except you don't collect human bones.
30741,Homer,you little monster! show your face this minute!
29020,Homer,"hey, i know that country!"
41283,Homer,don't you get it? they're using us as patsies to make the army look good.
34918,Homer,you don't want a christmas tree? that's crazy! next you won't want a christmas ham.
15109,Homer,"why? oh, the zombies. no."

40699,Homer,"faster, barney, faster."
24039,Homer,how come bears can crap in the woods and i can't?
16402,Homer,"all right, well that's okay. when they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
27982,Homer,"who are you, my biographer?"
40879,Homer,seen it. seen it. seen it. seen it. ugh! soccer. seen it.
14807,Homer,"tut tut, gentle marge. for here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
40148,Homer,"aw, come on, marge. you said you'd sleep on it."
32069,Homer,woo hoo!
20750,Homer,"oh, it won't be long. once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. the older one can pull out his left eye."
20348,Homer,only if you clean your room.
16299,Homer,"but please marge, don't drive into that chasm!"
29165,Homer,"if that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. we'll lose tourists! and then who will buy my roadside corn?"
35423,Homer,fine.
41043,Homer,stupid dog.
16482,Homer,"heh, you know, i was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but i think as long as we're not alone together..."
24614,Homer,"uh, i have a question, phoney."
37549,Homer,you think we'll last twenty-five years?
41444,Homer,"ouch! oooch! eeech! ouch! ooch! oh, stop it!!"
15056,Homer,but i think she'll win.
14928,Homer,"because i don't care, okay? i can't fake an interest in this, and i'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
35926,Homer,"when march madness spills into april -- that's the gravy! when someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! when you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"
41328,Homer,woo hoo!
25810,Homer,"wait, this is just a shaved puppy."
26146,Homer,i would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
18695,Homer,huh?

21529,Homer,"hey, what the...?"
17538,Homer,it's raining men!

36714,Homer,you wha?
36386,Homer,"oh man, marge is pissed. look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."

40333,Homer,i wouldn't stay on a bet!
29005,Homer,"and yet, i've never been to me."
40560,Homer,"oh, dr. hibbert from johns hopkins medical school?"
16367,Homer,explain how.
23043,Homer,"i'm squeezing... i'm squee-zing it. hey, i squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
32884,Homer,i'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
33878,Homer,"he who laughs last, laughs dead."
34131,Homer,"hmm, while i'm up there..."
37931,Homer,at first my wife didn't believe in me. maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
20218,Homer,no need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
21134,Homer,"uh, yeah, sure. that thing."
18201,Homer,that's it.
31406,Homer,what'd i do?
40541,Homer,"hey, yeah! who are you? i saw you chasing bart's ambulance..."
15471,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best... aw, forget it."

19516,Homer,uh!
29487,Homer,"well, i can go all night, baby. i could listen to you two, maybe three, times."
33563,Homer,"um... no problem, sweetie."
20419,Homer,you're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
31149,Homer,just sign your name above president lincoln's.
13252,Homer,"okay, good deed, good deed... hello!"
34508,Homer,fine! i'll stay a little more.
27625,Homer,hey! don't borgnine my sandwich.
19963,Homer,who cares? this is the best part of the week!
13476,Homer,"""dear mr. burns. i'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your caard was just great. in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic. you stink!"" could you read that last part back to me?"
38933,Homer,"eh, they'll grow back."
13380,Homer,hmmmm. gentlemen: i am going to catch general sherman!
21421,Homer,it is? well... that's a good song too. do do do do-do do do...

19749,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no..."
24879,Homer,not even a little one?
24810,Homer,i retract my statement.
35972,Homer,but i'm invested in the characters.
25074,Homer,"hey, this car's got cruise control."
21276,Homer,"look at that beautiful garbage! other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
32462,Homer,do you like guys who are... attractive?
13529,Homer,"oh no... pink. pink! pink! it's all over, marge. it's all over."
32156,Homer,i drove a car over a cliff once. how different could it be?
17550,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. first, what are your qualifications?"
39675,Homer,femmmmm! wah! gnnn! hrmmerhrr!
28271,Homer,"ooh boy, casino night! finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six."
21255,Homer,"well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, pops."
35368,Homer,"that's a wife ring? marge, don't look!"
20982,Homer,you get it after you leave. now get out of here.
19005,Homer,our first job is to entertain...
22386,Homer,wow. they've captured my personality perfectly. did you see the way daddy caught that bullet?
23212,Homer,"son, let's forget all about that drug thing. why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
32089,Homer,i'm aroused and confused.
19461,Homer,"hey, wait! come back!..."
19095,Homer,"just bring the rut with you, honey. come on, take a look."
20155,Homer,"not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
34763,Homer,"ridin' high! sinkin' low! top of the heap! down i go! on top for good! oh, cruel hubris!"
37276,Homer,"but, there is one condition..."
41498,Homer,you taping it?
27075,Homer,what was that?
39332,Homer,"how 'bout a tie, son? everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties."
14967,Homer,"oh, well... can't win 'em all."
21669,Homer,ball two. this bozo's gonna walk me.
17636,Homer,i'm out.
13329,Homer,how do i look?
16484,Homer,is there any way to get out of this?
14974,Homer,"ah, my beloved family. how was church?"
23900,Homer,"bart, do your thing!"
37163,Homer,"whatever you say, sir."
25250,Homer,"dad, i love you this much."
20276,Homer,he's crazy.
37273,Homer,every time i try to fix things it just makes things worse. but i'm gonna fix this!
23281,Homer,we make a good team. a groin-grabbingly good team!
29945,Homer,"and if i wanna see it, what time should i watch it?"
26151,Homer,"five, four, three, two, one... countdown!"
35804,Homer,"of course, of course. family is everything to us company men. now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
18272,Homer,"bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
29785,Homer,cool.
31126,Homer,"don't worry, i'll use the money i make to buy tickets from a scalper. then i'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! rich! we did it, baby! we made it through the rain!"
36559,Homer,we've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
18975,Homer,"you wouldn't understand, dad. you're not with it."
36746,Homer,"yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now."
33686,Homer,"in a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
24143,Homer,hmm... this doesn't look so bad.
35595,Homer,"now, how would that work?"
35841,Homer,everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
40809,Homer,"hey, i paid for this car. i paid for this tuxedo and i paid for the two dinners. we're going to the prom."
23574,Homer,"yes, the girl bart has a crush on."
22397,Homer,"no, no, he can't be. i know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. yeah, that's gotta be it."
36294,Homer,i'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
17145,Homer,"in america, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
20718,Homer,"hey, that's not fair! i wanna be a carny, too! can i, mister? huh? can i? please?"
41166,Homer,"marge, marge. look at me! my clothes are just hanging off me!"
19688,Homer,"around the house, i never lift a finger / as a husband and father i'm sub-par / i'd rather drink a beer than win father of the year / i'm happy with things the way they are."
14818,Homer,"oh, the usual. stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
28395,Homer,are you a care bear?
37160,Homer,"okay, now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
13660,Homer,"hmm, let's see."
20577,Homer,absolutely.
37246,Homer,but the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
32179,Homer,"mmmm, au jus! not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
26186,Homer,"okay gabriel, this is a ""bar."" it's where i go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."
37411,Homer,"no tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. thank you, fashion police."
36016,Homer,thanks for reading it to me.
41046,Homer,"yes, master."
22782,Homer,"ohhh, my back. so this must be that pain thing."
18148,Homer,"stop it, stop it, stop it! stop it!"
28808,Homer,no way! he's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
20651,Homer,"wow, this really restores your faith in..."
16812,Homer,now you got a law suit on your hands. just kidding.
22843,Homer,"moe, this is astrid, my ""dealer."" and these are my fans, gunter, kyoto, and cecil hampstead-on-cecil-cecil."
22258,Homer,would you rather tell maude the truth?
32831,Homer,i'm a human being -- let me go!
27327,Homer,which i did.
31799,Homer,now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!
25444,Homer,"my hunger strike will not end until duff admits they're moving the team. bart, my chains."
22032,Homer,"well, actually i-- hey! quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
36635,Homer,"exactly. well, we're all set. let's make a thad supersperm junior. with a name like that, he could be president."
40511,Homer,"hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?"
17810,Homer,"i'm telling you, marge, this will work. they'll think i'm krusty and give us free stuff. i've been gettin' free stuff all day. look at this swell bucket of house paint."
24761,Homer,can we go now?
28102,Homer,"but i was chosen by the great spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, i'll be at moe's talking normal."
36777,Homer,aww. that'll be my screensaver.
31319,Homer,that's alien talk!
24414,Homer,"the only thing we can do. sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
29701,Homer,a.
18565,Homer,the all igh-ty ollar? i get it.
31466,Homer,"oh my god. she's gonna jump. marge, don't do it! give divorce a chance!"
40885,Homer,"bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! now go to your room."
20301,Homer,woo hoo! i accuse goody flanders.
37120,Homer,finally! a supervisor!
34268,Homer,"let us curl, m'lady. let us throw and sweep a'twain until the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! and afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. and if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of november, we shall proclaim that we were curling!"
23477,Homer,"oh, you're right. i'm a coward. i've made such a mess of things. if only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
17938,Homer,mmmmm.
24427,Homer,"yep, this place is great. and someday, when lisa and bart get married, it'll all be theirs."
28631,Homer,he knows just how i like my martinis... full of alcohol.
40626,Homer,"oooh! it's good news, isn't it?"
34307,Homer,"listen, wrinkles! if you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. or i can make things very uncomfortable for you."
31347,Homer,"stay crunchy, men! stay crunchy!"
13888,Homer,"marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
36082,Homer,"hey lenny, welcome aboard."
22221,Homer,"oh, yeah. two more of these, please."
30110,Homer,"oh, i'm wrong again. i'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
14132,Homer,you heard?
24858,Homer,"you'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not."
16673,Homer,"okay, okay i'll let him. but then i get a chipwich, okay?"
34917,Homer,"kids, remember when i promised to feed us from that victory garden? well, instead i grew this tree!"
22162,Homer,wuss rock?
18839,Homer,"i know! i know! it's selma, right?"
22313,Homer,passing out in the ocean...
27004,Homer,i come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. grab your guns and follow me!
30160,Homer,"uh, we're watching the latest photos from mars. ho, great stuff. worth every billion."
35785,Homer,"god, what a great game! and you too can be on the winning team, mr. mayor. the springfield nuclear team."
29687,Homer,"wow, it makes the lincoln memorial look like crap."
24241,Homer,i am an angel from the future.
38270,Homer,but i did learn something from all this. the sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
14239,Homer,well... it takes me a long time to learn anything... i'm kind of a goof-off...
23691,Homer,nah. we'll go next month.
25927,Homer,easy... easy...
33584,Homer,"okay... ""pitch in the negro leagues,"" i can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
14708,Homer,"really? well, i should warn you... i'm not great with figures..."
33044,Homer,no problem.
16247,Homer,must... get to ballet...
19846,Homer,"oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. what about that freezer lady in georgia?"
21298,Homer,i've never seen bart so ashamed of me.
23513,Homer,"oh, yeah. let's take it."
29241,Homer,and check this out.
36961,Homer,"apes... deep down we're all savage apes. leave your body, homer."
26475,Homer,"dad, get up."
21220,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. put on a big show for the cameras."
22064,Homer,"all right, this is it. no more living in shame. i'm going to show my family the kind of man i really am."
32823,Homer,"son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. also, don't be a cow."
26977,Homer,clone?! that's ridiculous. where am i supposed to find a... wait a minute.
40696,Homer,"guys, keep it down. i got some last words. i never told you this before, but sometimes when i'm at work, i think of you and smile. so often i think that ... oh, words won't do it. i love you, moe."
26183,Homer,a heavenly choir. you must be an angel!
33429,Homer,"absolutely. insurance is the greatest deal ever. if i get hurt, i get paid. and man, do i get hurt."
29392,Homer,"you give my son what he deserves, or i'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
22950,Homer,"oh, arthur fortune!"
18571,Homer,"excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
24013,Homer,woo hoo! in your little faces!
18023,Homer,"yes! come on, you little horse!"
20323,Homer,"oh, yeah."
35750,Homer,"how could the publishers change our book? if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!"
28668,Homer,marge! we're out of bath towels.
17530,Homer,i'm sure it's nothing.
38367,Homer,eat the nuts! they're your dinner!
26569,Homer,so hot snow falls up?
13521,Homer,"save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock."
20043,Homer,"lenny, tell mr. burns i've gone home to work on the contest."
22097,Homer,nooo!
24355,Homer,"""yes."" ""are you a good lover?"" ""yes."" oh, i'm doin' great!"
13882,Homer,"look, i let you down and i apologize. i know that doesn't make it right, but i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
14086,Homer,"if there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
38700,Homer,what about mosquito cove?
29397,Homer,"not so fast. i also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of bart's t-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat."
37284,Homer,now do me wearing a sombrero!
38297,Homer,"yes, well it's a special evening. and i thought it best not to look like a monkey."
13407,Homer,"uh, oh."
39645,Homer,"uh-huh. okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. you girls just stay here and relax."
35468,Homer,"yeah, language."
22532,Homer,"hey, you with the scarf! stop skywriting!"
18251,Homer,"wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? what about bacon?"
21305,Homer,"look, son. daddy got in shape. e--"
16381,Homer,heh heh. you don't have a son.
32334,Homer,"oh, hello, marge. i'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. am i disappointed? yes. am i surprised? no."
35578,Homer,i'm fine.
37670,Homer,"aw, don't cry."
14913,Homer,"marge, your ride's here."
20862,Homer,"oh, right. i reluctantly accept your proposal."
27066,Homer,"hey, what's this suitcase for? are we going on a trip?"
18543,Homer,"i know how you feel, bart. when i was your age, i wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. well, goodnight."
22435,Homer,"and if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
22311,Homer,"see ya, kids. me and my val-u-qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! i'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and i'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic."

36796,Homer,"huh. ""hope."" is this one of those coincidences like jesus on a tortilla or george washington on a dollar bill?"
15427,Homer,what the hell is this?
19695,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin' ""howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."

38916,Homer,they have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
14372,Homer,sure! you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
30615,Homer,"eh, there's a picture of it on my cup."
25421,Homer,i'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. is this the executive office of the ball club?
39933,Homer,"well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty."
17073,Homer,"son, i know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
20554,Homer,ahh. we elected the wrong carter.
27737,Homer,revenge? on mr. burns?
39106,Homer,"i've never written an eulogy before, but this time i did. unfortunately, i left it at home."

38028,Homer,"uh, i'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
21432,Homer,"you know, um, it is a special occasion..."
27265,Homer,"hm, the water's off. i'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
17661,Homer,"well, i'm glad you asked. it's actually a very interesting story."
29820,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i got you into this mess. can i snitch on my heart and say... ""i love you""?"
23951,Homer,who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
20781,Homer,i see. and when is it?
18418,Homer,i got someone to cover for me.
16412,Homer,according to this map there's a krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
14368,Homer,"you'd think that wouldn't you. but you see lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. even though they say it's okay in the bible."
21506,Homer,"uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
23136,Homer,it symbolizes that she's my property and i own her.
20216,Homer,"oh, marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! and our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
27632,Homer,it came out again.
17662,Homer,"it all began about two years ago, before maggie was even born. bart, you were lisa's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago."
18132,Homer,i'm okay.
35733,Homer,do you have a computer?
41431,Homer,that's renaissance homer.
31448,Homer,"oh my god, i've only got nine seconds till marge's show!"
20187,Homer,"and that, my children, is the story of bart's first day of school."
16699,Homer,"no need to apologize, apu. it was as much my fault as it was yours."
17600,Homer,is he the leader?
18878,Homer,"all right, i have thought this through. i will send bart the money to fly home, and then i will murder him."
18511,Homer,there's nothing to worry about. now everyone go to sleep. good night.
27300,Homer,woo hoo! good things do happen to bad people!
23162,Homer,those movies sucked. i only saw 'em to get marge into the sack. ps: mission accomplished.
23383,Homer,i'm caught on something!
25531,Homer,"y'know, i always felt sorry for marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."
40188,Homer,"come back here now, raven"
31662,Homer,bart... buddy! it's your dad! i need a ride! i think i'm in chinatown. not our chinatown.
14918,Homer,salt me.
29193,Homer,"see, lisa? instead of one big shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks xeroxing their worthless opinions."
22544,Homer,"c'mon, mom / flanders, woman!"
14625,Homer,what?
25453,Homer,"nice try, god."
30461,Homer,but i'm watching television. a lot of people worked hard on this show!
29322,Homer,"chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything i've ever had at this table."
33091,Homer,marge! i love this guy!
39051,Homer,nothing.
24395,Homer,"guess how many boobs i saw today, marge? fifteen!"
13160,Homer,"elvis? what the hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right."
26530,Homer,victory? we're french! we don't even have a word for it.
22356,Homer,woo hoo!
22503,Homer,gimme that!
28532,Homer,"all right, now you're startin' to creep me out."
29863,Homer,i'm sorry. i'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
17238,Homer,"lisa, don't contradict your elders."
32691,Homer,"son, i know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. but since then, i've really come to respect you. and unlike love, respect can't be bought."
35331,Homer,"i'll save you, lisa!"
17420,Homer,i need a hug.
38187,Homer,but our cushion...
25791,Homer,the simpsons are ridin' the rails!
24493,Homer,but we never saw people like us on tv.
37831,Homer,what the?
25375,Homer,"not ""mad""! that's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine."
35353,Homer,i'll dispose of those for you.
32066,Homer,apu sang a song. what are you gonna do?
15723,Homer,"thank you, that'd be nice."
38686,Homer,"marge, please don't say anything. it never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs."
26315,Homer,i was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
33161,Homer,i don't want to let go of our special carving!
15806,Homer,arrrgh!
15289,Homer,wow! just think what i could do with that plow.
34255,Homer,and you like tomato...

17918,Homer,"hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. i'll be that carl reiner guy, you be what's his face."
29310,Homer,prove it.
32208,Homer,"wow, praise from placido domingo."
33124,Homer,"why flanders, you rogue."
36066,Homer,excellent.
15582,Homer,i don't care. i'm going to duff gardens.
16873,Homer,y'ello?
38676,Homer,"hey, i haven't had a drink in a thousand years."
31807,Homer,how could you publish this? i thought we were friends!
33941,Homer,uh-oh.
30499,Homer,"no, no, no, it's great. i'm done with it now."
28326,Homer,saying what?
19596,Homer,look at him. he's gonna do something. and you know it's gonna be good!
27776,Homer,mr. burns! where's mr. smithers?
31357,Homer,rise my pretties! find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
40452,Homer,"i have an announcement to make. as a family growth thing, bart and i think we should all go to the monster truck rally this saturday."
22297,Homer,"well, turn something on. i'm starting to think."
19346,Homer,"no, it's a second wedding, honey. our first one was so crummy, i had to make it up to you. i really love you."
35256,Homer,all your money and all your stuff.
24089,Homer,yeah.
16332,Homer,that's not fun!
40254,Homer,"oh, no. marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
22169,Homer,did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
23323,Homer,are you crazy? a dog can't type. unfortunately.
22005,Homer,"but it's funny, marge. the guy's sick."
22046,Homer,hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
18921,Homer,"well, anyway, i'm still outraged."
23617,Homer,daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. yes he is. yes he is.
20667,Homer,"relax, marge. this'll all blow over."
19790,Homer,"that is a very immature attitude, young man."
27308,Homer,oh my god! attention drunken idiots: this is your king! sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
19237,Homer,don't you care about your son? this is more important than money!
23772,Homer,our junk!
23096,Homer,"well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
21285,Homer,hi moe.
24694,Homer,fire in the hole!
19468,Homer,"hi, kids."
14715,Homer,no... i think it was lenny.

33589,Homer,gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
28077,Homer,pick one.
34482,Homer,from fast food to fine dining?
32446,Homer,old one?! they're convincing marge to dump me!
36096,Homer,"man, oh man, look at this place! finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something."
25597,Homer,help! bad monkey!
17285,Homer,get it off! get it off! get it offf!!
36975,Homer,just go play your saxophone while you can.
29396,Homer,are you prepared to take that chance?
40921,Homer,all right.
14703,Homer,"well hi, lurleen. we were just talking about you. uh... i think i can come over. let me ask my wife."
26359,Homer,yeah. homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
36332,Homer,"marge, there're so many mysteries that i need to have solved."
17913,Homer,"oh, no wonder i didn't hear about bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
32038,Homer,"absolutely, all the time. i go to the floss store and they're like, ""whoa, there he is again."" 'cause i buy so much floss."
32132,Homer,"uh, yeah -- i have no job and nowhere to go. what do i have to buy so i can sit here all day?"
23881,Homer,yeah.
18177,Homer,"ahhh, that's better. now that we're alone, papa bear has a li'l honey for his mama bear."
31368,Homer,"c'mon, memory, wake up!"
36389,Homer,"no, just my marriage."
23091,Homer,is the answer japan?
34563,Homer,it was my idea to put the whale in the water.
40007,Homer,"just a minute, young man. i don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but i just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --"
18984,Homer,"hey, a freak show!"
27540,Homer,it's such a mess. watch the teeth!
39358,Homer,"well, i bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. come on, son."
31537,Homer,"a hundred and seventeen degrees! ooo, that reminds me."
19854,Homer,i've got it!
31228,Homer,this doesn't taste like i thought it would.
40938,Homer,"hey, selma's no prize pig herself you know."
28020,Homer,"i am so screwed. i can't drive to work, i can't drive to the store, and i certainly can't drive to the store at work."
21454,Homer,"eh, i never thought i'd live this long."
33198,Homer,"well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. now if you'll excuse me..."
13670,Homer,"wouldn't it, flanders?"
14962,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson."
31574,Homer,watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
34950,Homer,ten minutes? i can't wait that long! i left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!
17059,Homer,"come on, marge. let me in! there's crickets out here."
40709,Homer,"goodbye, bart -- i like your sheets."
21489,Homer,"honey, my shoulders are separating."
28618,Homer,uh...
31619,Homer,this is my lucky day.
37447,Homer,"guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery."
32040,Homer,"i know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth."
16211,Homer,"marge, look at all this great stuff i found at the marina! it was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
29675,Homer,"great, another job lost to a foreigner."
34521,Homer,"now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa."
14672,Homer,oh no.
14849,Homer,on... off... on... off.
38608,Homer,some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. but what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
41087,Homer,"oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. hear what? oh, sure. c'mere, boy! put that prowler down. come here! come on boy! say it, boy! say ""i love you"" for the nice man! i lub you. good dog! good doggie! isn't that amazing? see you soon. woooo! wooo!"
33507,Homer,"according to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" finally, a practical use for my father."
36732,Homer,on vacation he digs wells in darfur!
39985,Homer,because i'm so carefree?
16413,Homer,never mind the fog! that way. steer! there isn't much time!
19175,Homer,you really think i could do it?
40943,Homer,"... and thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. amen."
29830,Homer,why? is it messing you up?
29378,Homer,"hey, maybe the internet has the information i need! it certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement."
18153,Homer,"berserk is right!! may i have some iced tea, please?"
26731,Homer,"i gave up anger forever. from now on, i'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers."
14766,Homer,to the simpson mobile!
20087,Homer,"hey everybody, i'm peter pantsless!"
34437,Homer,celebrate your commonality. some of us don't eat pork. some of us don't eat shellfish. but all of us love chicken!
19542,Homer,"well then, good night!"
24899,Homer,"gimme a hundred lotto tickets, apu. because mr. x is on a roll."
13537,Homer,o-kay.
16743,Homer,who's doin' what now?
38174,Homer,"with that painting we could have what these people have. a money cushion. no more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
13191,Homer,screw you!
17845,Homer,"really? look, boy! now i'm in australia! now i'm in america!"
30672,Homer,"so this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""m"". moleman? mr. burns? m. night shyamalan? that would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
20372,Homer,and i'm a wonderful man.
15759,Homer,"and gummy joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
22362,Homer,football!
26698,Homer,"all my other senses are getting sharper. bart, you had pizza for lunch. lisa, you're extremely depressed."
25475,Homer,the truth never tasted so good!
13314,Homer,"come on, you're holding out on me."
41180,Homer,"hello, what's this?"
18415,Homer,"hey, what are you kids looking at?"
27994,Homer,"well, boy, now that we got you back, i'm never gonna let you go again."
38486,Homer,you are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. and i'm going to sit right here until you do.
18486,Homer,"it's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. but who are you, and why did you tip us off?"
20198,Homer,get the hell out.
18860,Homer,"well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here i trust. ready?"
25315,Homer,i think you're underreacting.
32146,Homer,"honey, there's something i have to tell you..."
31151,Homer,i stole a rack of fur coats. i sell one a year to pay for christmas.
14927,Homer,probably not much of it.
15220,Homer,"marge, get my gun."
16326,Homer,"checkmate, mr. trampoline."
29739,Homer,"well, i'll get a lawyer on that. no, a whole team of lawyers. who will dine on mustard flown in from the orient."
36933,Homer,"well, that's just the way dogs are. the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made."
24732,Homer,i knew this day would come. the cows are taking back what's theirs.
28993,Homer,occupied!
37574,Homer,"yes, back to normal."
37850,Homer,"you know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful."
21498,Homer,"marge, uh, can we not land here?... honey?... baby doll...?"
41034,Homer,no! no! no! no! no!
38545,Homer,"marge, come on, let's celebrate! it's your first day!"
26986,Homer,"twenty-three. now, today i'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with bart and girl it up with lisa."
29800,Homer,"well, i am a sucker for a little hat."
13677,Homer,"i'm telling you, flanders' store was dee-serted. so what do you think of your bestest buddy now, marge?"
20317,Homer,"oh, let's get that."
41159,Homer,"hey, hey, now you're talkin'!"
37156,Homer,spot the hidden objects.
38320,Homer,legs pumping! blood flowing!
35267,Homer,"oh, i don't know if i can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. i-- whoo!... but i sincerely whoo!"
32243,Homer,kick my heels up and
27349,Homer,watch and learn.

39433,Homer,"afternoon, mr. burns."
40748,Homer,"but, dad, i don't drink..."
16927,Homer,now i'll pull my arms out with my face...
13303,Homer,"did you hear that, marge? she called me a baboon! the stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
22510,Homer,everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. see the problem's communication. too much communication.
15018,Homer,"flanders, you saved me. why?"
31342,Homer,that's an odd way to start handing out medals.
37836,Homer,yes. what's skinner's weakness?
18804,Homer,"i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job was all he had. imagine how you'd feel, marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
18218,Homer,i'm not ashamed.
16604,Homer,he'll show.
21573,Homer,"really? a restaurant? well, now i don't know what to think."
27991,Homer,"now let me think. how did that beautiful young naked lady in ""jaws"" make it out alive?"
38684,Homer,i won't laugh at you. let's see--
19353,Homer,whaddya mean?
17460,Homer,you want me to spend more time with dad? what about my new year's resolution?
41529,Homer,you applied to college? why didn't you tell me?
21121,Homer,"why do you keep picking on me? marge's name was on that tax return, too."
35659,Homer,"man, how many quarters does this game take?"
33020,Homer,"marge, i can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. but withholding sexy cake? i know we have to move past this, but i don't see how."
38234,Homer,red card!
15490,Homer,"dear lord, i'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. if something happens, please look after marge, and make sure my kids grow up right."
13922,Homer,"well you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
31485,Homer,chapter one: the rubystone in the door-portal. are you asleep yet?
34321,Homer,hey! you're supposed to be doing your homework! no more tv for you!
34358,Homer,must... squeeze... harder!

38275,Homer,"yes i did! i heard ""competitive eater""!"
19123,Homer,"mr. scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."

16887,Homer,"hey, any more arboretums around here?"
36478,Homer,don't tell me what our thing is.

37810,Homer,oh.
13901,Homer,i'll take it!
19960,Homer,"oh, i'd love to go with you, honey, but i've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
19198,Homer,"ooh, ""general!"" who's drederick tatum, anyway? is he another hobo?"
33089,Homer,"marge, i thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" it's a combination of biking and making out."
39891,Homer,none of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
17563,Homer,"aw, it didn't work."
36370,Homer,"boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
22392,Homer,all right. and what's the name?
27487,Homer,it's not fair. i always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
23506,Homer,"you're scaring the customers, honey."
28994,Homer,"at last, we're alone..."
29528,Homer,"you're goin' down, you potato-eatin' pansy!"
41397,Homer,"after we eat it, can we let it go? can we catch a submarine?"
35351,Homer,"come on, bart. we've been out here for hours."
30460,Homer,you want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?
28275,Homer,woo-hoo!
16885,Homer,shut up.
16539,Homer,"you promised lisa to help her with her costume. you made her cry, then i cried. then maggie laughed. she's such a little trooper."
26043,Homer,"hey, who invited the hippies?"
35947,Homer,but gravy is the freedom where--
40040,Homer,"hey, i'm still beating you, boy."
13333,Homer,"hey, flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
30507,Homer,her first words! play along. it's fifty cents less for babies!
32279,Homer,really? what's your handicap?
28561,Homer,maybe she was you and you're not! how many kids do we have?
40378,Homer,"ah, ""may the best man win"". the mating call of the loser."
36382,Homer,now that's what i call a snappy retort!

17776,Homer,it must be the first of the month! new billboard day!
41386,Homer,what do your rules say now?

14763,Homer,"hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
28014,Homer,even i think this is crazy.
28372,Homer,"wow! i never thought i'd say this, but you slags are all right."
37311,Homer,where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
22850,Homer,you're upset about something. is this about that trip barney and i took to machu picchu?
38900,Homer,i think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
30795,Homer,no unicorns.
14684,Homer,homer j. simpson.
20777,Homer,hmm. makes sense.
27369,Homer,"oh, my daughter hates me because i don't know anything about her."
27322,Homer,"we know. frank grimes, jr."
31077,Homer,"well, the rest of your life for sure."
35744,Homer,"we know, we wrote it."
40463,Homer,sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
28806,Homer,but i did delete him from my bulk email list.
37102,Homer,no one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that i never told you about... except i guess i just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!
14884,Homer,"marge, am i crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
28041,Homer,how 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
32947,Homer,"son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of krusty...which appears to be everything. hey, maybe we should give lisa this room. you know she works for krusty now."
25360,Homer,"stay out of this, lisa. marge, i've made up my mind. i'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. then we'll see who has it tougher."
16782,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. but they didn't have the guts."
33364,Homer,al gore?
15043,Homer,now that's not true! you're cute as a bug's ear.
24357,Homer,"quizmaster, yes... that would entertain me briefly."
25752,Homer,okay. is that all there is? / is that all there is? / if that's all there is / my friend / then let's keep dancing...
39146,Homer,"uh, just a second. hey, marge. yeah, i'm workin' late. yep, special project."
21571,Homer,"stupid movies. who invented these dumb things anyway? was it you, bart?"
36417,Homer,my dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'cause your hair looks really messed up.
27536,Homer,"everybody, look at the much-needed rain. thank you, god. now turn the rainwater into wine."
20207,Homer,"excellente! muchas gracias, señorata!"

28134,Homer,"no way! i'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. but if i lose maggie, i'm oh-for-three. i've gotta get her back."
23192,Homer,"how did the country lose its way, mel? when did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
27262,Homer,that's it! tv was the one good thing in my life and now i can't enjoy it any more.
31995,Homer,"well, i can breathe out okay."
40763,Homer,no way.
38969,Homer,"pff. wife? three kids? steady job? if i did, i'd secretly be very sad. you could tell by how much i would eat and drink and just sit on the couch."

24607,Homer,the who? i love bands!

16872,Homer,y'ello.
24102,Homer,"that's right, ned. those floozies we married in vegas were crazy about you."
31657,Homer,"hold on there, boy. if you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."
33540,Homer,why did i bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
18503,Homer,"jump, boy! i gotcha!"
15390,Homer,"wait a minute. that was a ""lucy"" show... okay, where were we?"
25495,Homer,those cats were fast as lightning...

38149,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
18880,Homer,"well, maybe we could order something from oak ridge..."
31460,Homer,"if it would win you back, i would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. i hope it doesn't come to that. could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
13465,Homer,mr. burns... he's okay! jackpot!
36213,Homer,goodbye.
14750,Homer,is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
26079,Homer,"wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"

25389,Homer,uh-oh.
30855,Homer,"why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? i like your hat, sweetie."
14988,Homer,i'm not a bad guy. i work hard and i love my kids. so why should i spend half my sunday hearing about how i'm going to hell?
13428,Homer,"no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?"

31972,Homer,you stuffed your horn?!
33246,Homer,"care to cut? watch this, lenny."
17910,Homer,"in that case, i'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. but no powdered sugar, i don't deserve it. maybe a little powdered sugar."

38062,Homer,because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
26843,Homer,now let's not get into who smells like what.
28260,Homer,"no, you're my mother and i won't leave you!"
34395,Homer,pan-thers!
16874,Homer,he's taking the elephant instead of the money.
16466,Homer,"mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, i think we should avoid each other from now on."

30652,Homer,"look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky eucharist. i wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
22682,Homer,"wait a minute. is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? i thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place."
31444,Homer,"attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love."
15487,Homer,who are you donating them to?
41490,Homer,let's all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes.
15570,Homer,all in favor of skipping the poem?
38715,Homer,we got a new tent from a guy who o.d.'d!
32232,Homer,"that's good. you've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. now, i think it would be best if you left."
34212,Homer,"here i am a millionaire, and i can't even help the woman who gave birth to me."
34900,Homer,it was still too much.
23784,Homer,flanders!
15702,Homer,"to overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. uh, thou shall not..."
38387,Homer,"let them play! we won't look, we'll turn away / go make love, then eat some hay..."
24689,Homer,"listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?"
29844,Homer,"son, say hello to edna."
23495,Homer,this better be good.
36065,Homer,"pish tosh, smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! nailed it!"
34154,Homer,"dad, i don't have the right words to say how i really feel about you, but at least i know how to beat up a guy who does."
13943,Homer,but i eat... oh.

13180,Homer,"hey, the manure dealership is just one of the things i got goin'."
33790,Homer,"ladies, we've got it all. rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys."

16717,Homer,"i'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. everyone listens to me! no matter how dumb my suggestions are."

17917,Homer,"oh wow! i can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, mel brooks! i love that movie, ""young frankenstein"". ...scared the hell out of me."
28856,Homer,no problem. we can still have fun without you drinking.
30844,Homer,"and now i'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later i can say that i already told you."
36420,Homer,what do i do? what do i do?
23445,Homer,zo-rrooo!
25110,Homer,"c'mon, marge. we're a team! it's uter-us, not uter-you."

19669,Homer,"well, so am i."
26609,Homer,"drop it in, don't cram it in. oh, forget it, i'll do it myself."

39392,Homer,"boy, this intersection is dangerous! someone ought to put a stop sign here."
15420,Homer,"y'know, maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back."
28911,Homer,"i sure am. here you go, son. i brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."
32100,Homer,why are you applauding them? we wrote it!

23306,Homer,"hm. this pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."
16454,Homer,"hee, hee, hee, hee. did you know hogan had tunnels all over your camp?"
40272,Homer,"nope, this was my own bright idea. c'mon, we gotta hurry. don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. save room for your nachos."

28457,Homer,"please welcome new panelist, barney gumbel."
26521,Homer,this truly is hell!
15749,Homer,"put it in the fridge, moe. i got a date with my wife."
27526,Homer,"oh, i love this song."
39614,Homer,"don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? i don't want to go away empty-handed, bob."

40797,Homer,"i'll take that as a compliment. so, will you go out with me? please say oui."
24044,Homer,"better do what he says, marge."
22257,Homer,"you're right, you're right. fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. they gang-probed you, while i discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved america."
14596,Homer,"you don't understand, marge. the lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. uh, the lottery and you."
32503,Homer,"mr. doobner, i have a complaint: i work hard, and when i go out with my family, i expect a certain level of basic--"
29305,Homer,they're a family again. and so are we. what happened?
15735,Homer,one for you... one for me... one for you... one for me...

29054,Homer,you're all so wise... i wish i could eat each and every one of you.
36981,Homer,"i wish. son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies."
20587,Homer,can you believe it? it's already been a year.
39304,Homer,"i didn't get my christmas bonus. i tried not to let it ruin christmas for everybody, but no matter what i did, i just couldn't --"

23921,Homer,"listen, i worked long and hard for this place. and no one's going to take it away from me. not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody."
15951,Homer,"every afternoon at moe's, chief wiggum, principal skinner, apu and i would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild."
28953,Homer,give her back to skinner! a fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
30131,Homer,"now listen, if you could just see your way clear to..."
38458,Homer,"then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!"
13373,Homer,"whoa, better get some gas."
35903,Homer,"but i do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. i bet chuck the cameraman and steve the sound guy know where i'm coming from."
14327,Homer,"that's all i can stands, i can't stands no more. i'm gonna get you outta there myself."

35582,Homer,"ah, halloween. the one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage."
13916,Homer,i've got it all figured out. by day it will roam free around the neighborhood. and at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
14579,Homer,huh?
25225,Homer,tom savini?
35519,Homer,oh. okay.
38406,Homer,"walking distance, marge. i've been looking forward to this all week!"

36155,Homer,"y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this."
37330,Homer,okay... this should do it.
29366,Homer,"i'm pathetic? because i take money from my ten-year-old son? well, let me tell you something: i still call the shots around here!"

34244,Homer,fine. let me just get my harness pads.
39077,Homer,"i have so many questions for you. first of all, is this floor reinforced?"
32688,Homer,c'mon. c'mon. oh c'mon.
30047,Homer,"um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. it makes your eyes twinkle."
21961,Homer,nothing's too good for my one and only.
37189,Homer,"son, promise you will never look like me."
18512,Homer,do i smell cookies? where's the cookies?
32062,Homer,"i'm sorry marge, but i won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."
15920,Homer,lobooo...
23645,Homer,"hey, there's someone else in here."

39094,Homer,"good. good. by which i mean bad, bad."
37959,Homer,"i know, mr. sparkle."
32791,Homer,"i'll see you later, honey."
23246,Homer,"but how do we know, marge? how do we know?"
36468,Homer,sorry.
36819,Homer,"get lost, pervs!"
30920,Homer,"y'ello. you want my opinion on current movies?! well, first of all, they're all perfect. also: when's the cap'n crunch movie coming out? and will it be ""r"" or ""hard r""?"
26392,Homer,you wait 'til next month! you wait 'til next month!
19177,Homer,yes!
38888,Homer,and away we go!
18723,Homer,"um, i'll have four tax burgers, one irs-wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a ficaccino."
40596,Homer,"tomorrow night!? friday!? pork chop night!? marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87."
32930,Homer,i don't think so.
25109,Homer,"i have a great way to solve our money woes: you rent your womb to a rich, childless couple. if you agree, signify by getting indignant."
31707,Homer,"look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. but the school's paying for five sessions and there's a chinese restaurant next door where i can get drunk."
40475,Homer,"oh, hi, kids. thanks."
34030,Homer,"...to a ""p"". spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks."
15061,Homer,"no, she won't. when it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, more! more! and if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
17805,Homer,oh no.
22384,Homer,this is better.
31813,Homer,listen to 'em. they're on top of the world while i'm sittin' here pretending i have a stool.
41073,Homer,"oh, so that's your little plan! get us addicted, then jack up the price! well, you win."
21376,Homer,"hmm. so you want to take the bus, huh? i don't know. that's a pretty big decision..."
21412,Homer,just a little higher...
39617,Homer,yeah!
39291,Homer,"don't you believe in me, son?"
37304,Homer,"and uh, how was your day?"
19863,Homer,"oh, i'm not going to lie to you, marge. so long!"
37740,Homer,"timing the elevators, eh? smart."
33024,Homer,and how did you know i wouldn't be there?
29380,Homer,"are you a terrorist? no. ""would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" no. i will never tire of the bar scene!"
26327,Homer,yep. nothin' to get excited about.
26272,Homer,i'm with you all the way. but first...
33809,Homer,"yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing i can do as a parent is simply check out."
15416,Homer,what?

16292,Homer,a lot of blue hair? heh-heh. what a freak.
23845,Homer,"bill, bill. oooh! llib! eh-- wait a minute. bill?!"
36353,Homer,"again with ""mr. steak!"" do you know why i go to mr. steak? because at mr. steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at mr. steak!"
36414,Homer,sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
34653,Homer,you're not leaving me?
22085,Homer,get out of there!
38930,Homer,"'scuse me, pardon me, what the hell?"
17146,Homer,"huh, wha?"
37925,Homer,you? how could you? you're my own flesh and blood!
16584,Homer,get him!
27850,Homer,"kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
26888,Homer,"this whole thing was a joke? oh, i've never been so relieved! relieved and angry."
14665,Homer,what?
28029,Homer,"no. from now on, walking is my beer. and feeling good is my hangover."
24022,Homer,my horse must lose?
20722,Homer,"yeah, he's telling the truth."

24088,Homer,"hey, ned."
33106,Homer,i know -- i was hoping the number might be zero.
32383,Homer,no one likes a know-it-all.
21701,Homer,who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
33513,Homer,"so, after i paid for the ice cream cones, i said ""thank you"" and was on my way."
13750,Homer,"hey, this is the only paper in america that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
20265,Homer,you want me? come and get me!!
20156,Homer,fair enough.
18439,Homer,stupid switch! i wish i had my reaching-broom!
23173,Homer,hel-lo.
38491,Homer,"marge, i want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team."
29602,Homer,"two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
25963,Homer,"you callin' me a liar, carl?"
14154,Homer,"oh, what am i gonna... hey, you! top being so unsafe! smitty -- safen-up!"
16863,Homer,all done.
15358,Homer,"yeah, tell it, mom."
19871,Homer,no you won't.
16615,Homer,"so, mr. molloy. it seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
16803,Homer,"hey, somebody sign an autograph. please, somebody!? sign an autograph. hey, would you sign... you fat, stupid jerks!"
39292,Homer,"come on, boy. sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going."
22551,Homer,"but that's not for awhile, right?"
23859,Homer,"so when dean peterson opens his door, this bucket of super glue is gonna drop right on his head..."
37168,Homer,where does it say that?
19831,Homer,"all right, all right, geez. okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
25073,Homer,you're the camel.

37360,Homer,"that's right, sweetie. it always comes from corporate."
15347,Homer,"hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat."
15113,Homer,i'm a-comin' boy!
32378,Homer,"can i help you, gentlemen?"

39218,Homer,"okay, kids. prepare to be dazzled. marge! turn on the juice!"
36234,Homer,crepes!
39779,Homer,"marge, may i speak to you?"
28081,Homer,so i threw you a fancy banquet / and now you can't stay mad / how 'bout a make-up snuggle? / it would be so rad.
24759,Homer,run!
21866,Homer,it's the job of tomorrow... today!

23359,Homer,"you know, i've never liked that little wiener milhouse."
23328,Homer,"oh. well, i'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
20350,Homer,"you couldn't be more wrong, lisa. if i didn't have this gun, the king of england could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. do you want that? huh? do you?"
25727,Homer,"this place is so boring. i've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. i know, i'll breed the pets. to each other."
17812,Homer,"well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"

41100,Homer,"oh, come on, dad, i promise we'll have more fun this time. we're gonna see lions."
36193,Homer,um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
18979,Homer,"that's fine for you, marge. but i used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. then it was every other day. now i'm lucky if i can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. i've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
24019,Homer,why are you talking like that?
41030,Homer,"i want a horn here, here and here. you can never find a horn when you're mad. and they should all play ""la cucaracha."""
41333,Homer,"yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!"

39826,Homer,"it won't happen again, sir. i promise. may i get out of your sight now?"
38160,Homer,"marge, you like kindness, right?"
24452,Homer,"less yappin', more zappin'."

37752,Homer,"oh! oh wait, there's more!"
30820,Homer,"he's headed for the old mill. no, cheatie, no!"
17142,Homer,and you didn't think i'd make any money. i found a dollar while i was waiting for the bus.
22801,Homer,a man in an apron!

32962,Homer,"mr. burns, my son and i have been collecting coins. it's really brought us closer together. that penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him."
19125,Homer,i can't buy that. only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. guys like me? i'm a guy like me!
13451,Homer,"i can't believe you guys. there's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. and you don't wanna cash in? that's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
31540,Homer,i've never seen marge want to go somewhere so badly. i'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a dvd.
38456,Homer,sometimes when we touch
17224,Homer,one adult and four children.
23836,Homer,"that it is. we'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married."
36228,Homer,i feel sorry for people without willpower. i truly do.

21909,Homer,ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. i brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
17503,Homer,"yes. cris-a-tunity. you're right! i've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. that's it. i'm going to find a new bar to drink in. and i'm gonna get drunker than i've been in my entire life! bart, where's my wallet?"
14031,Homer,"i'm not pouting, you are."
15334,Homer,i know! i'll do a rap. i'm mr. plow and i'm here to say: i'm the plowingest guy in the usa / i got a big plow and i move a lot of things / like your cow it you have one.

38921,Homer,what?! when were you gonna tell me?
34700,Homer,"ah, those guys are all crooks. they charge you for parts and labor? pick one, buddy! i can do this just fine by myself."
23100,Homer,"i love this show. take that, you stupid hosers!"
22363,Homer,you guys are following me? i was following flanders.
39805,Homer,"what are you on, pal?"
13679,Homer,"oh, come on, lisa. i'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. he's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... what's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
41546,Homer,what the hell is going on here? chanting?!
18836,Homer,troy mcclure? he's a washed-up movie star. he could be dating washed-up supermodels.
32538,Homer,"a ""forget-me-shot?"" never heard of it."

31754,Homer,where is he? where is he? i smell his aftershave!
24934,Homer,huh?
15437,Homer,"marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes."
22348,Homer,stop eating our tickets!
33060,Homer,i'm going to moe's.
24870,Homer,bring me two of every animal.
14759,Homer,"well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. they taste as good as they look. and they come in this delicious red sauce. it looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. but brother it ain't ketchup!"
21952,Homer,ooooh.
34888,Homer,"dearly beloved. i'd like to open this service with the words of emily dickinson: ""hope is the thing with feathers..."""
21229,Homer,"what am i, the answer man? just vote for me."

39930,Homer,yeah. wait a minute. it's the guy from tv. my kid's hero... cruddy... crummy... krusty the clown!
26743,Homer,who knew that anger was savin' my life?
22410,Homer,"the whole town's laughin' at me. even that cat out there. bart, kill that cat!"
40067,Homer,"i'll call you back, marge."
41492,Homer,this viking stuff is too dangerous. i'm going to become a gentleman art thief.
21862,Homer,"all righty, i'll just-- you stinkin' g--"
16462,Homer,like what?
31893,Homer,i'll write you a check.
32118,Homer,will you shut up? i can't hear the song in my head!
33003,Homer,now i believe you.
16836,Homer,"so, here's to my best friend, ned."
27479,Homer,"wow, i wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that."
27590,Homer,"i'm challenging you, hawk. in front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it."
39510,Homer,no.
19930,Homer,laddie?
22877,Homer,"no, no, andy, no!"
15555,Homer,wowww.
18382,Homer,i don't want to look like a weirdo. i'll just go with a muu-muu.

23447,Homer,"yeah, it'll be fun. fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
30376,Homer,why would you do that? are you a bad parent?
38746,Homer,"that was not my intent. okay, covercraft: hands in."
24780,Homer,"a laugh? okay, let's see, what's in the news today?..."
19015,Homer,no biggie. i'm cool.
28004,Homer,"you can't just ""get"" a cell phone."
15295,Homer,"if you're gonna get mad at me every time i do something stupid, then i guess i'll just have to stop doing stupid things."
38365,Homer,"what is your problem, boy?"
29033,Homer,"maybe you're right, lisa. maybe you're pie. pie-be you're pie."
30199,Homer,"catholic school, eh...?"

34164,Homer,no pink box?! wha -- what's going on?
31601,Homer,you moron! i'm already alive!
28742,Homer,you didn't sit on the toilet!
28692,Homer,just tell me how much of this is true!
34179,Homer,potato!
39848,Homer,thank you very much ma'am. we'll be out of your...
36321,Homer,seen it.
41478,Homer,i've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest.
41160,Homer,do i have to do anything?
16801,Homer,i am invincible! invincible!
40503,Homer,it's no trouble. i've got a whole garageful of tools i never use.
36367,Homer,sex on a family vacation? i never thought such a thing was possible!
32112,Homer,"wait, wait. uh, this is some of what i do, i think. sometimes i go places."
13894,Homer,buh.
40237,Homer,"look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. it's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. and i never want that to happen to me."
29315,Homer,what about that two-headed goat?
32539,Homer,"mmm, pickle..."
28961,Homer,"and now, padre, if you would do the honors."
20434,Homer,"congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
33078,Homer,"thank you, future bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!"
23659,Homer,"well, don't worry, i can help ya. i'm all about ideas."
36168,Homer,but isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
40094,Homer,"uh, well okay, what the hey?"
19298,Homer,"keep it down in there, everybody."
31282,Homer,"ooh, a space marshmallow!"
25283,Homer,"how embarrassing. you take over, bart."
26462,Homer,"the ""x"" is for extreme!"
34149,Homer,"""when i rode with abe simpson on the tinseltown starliner, i never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? at three o'clock on monday, abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
16181,Homer,do do do do doo...
39276,Homer,wait a minute...
31062,Homer,"when a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
13336,Homer,"oh, dr. hibbert. enjoying the party?"
40615,Homer,"and, oh, oh, i don't believe i've tried the flying fish roe..."
37944,Homer,"and miss the back half of jimmy kimmel? that's when he experiments, boy."
13617,Homer,yeah! damn right!
15709,Homer,"barney, give me your keys. you're too drunk to drive."
21163,Homer,"oh-ho-ho, i'm not handicapped. i'm just lazy."
15617,Homer,hit me.
24500,Homer,"every day i thought about firing marge. you know, just to shake things up."
38138,Homer,sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. or...
13411,Homer,"well, if that's the way you feel... i'll throw it back."
30944,Homer,"uh-huh... do i have to? okay, okay, i'll show the cow i adore it."
14877,Homer,woo-hoo!
20900,Homer,he thought he was gonna steal--
29854,Homer,around the loop of death...and out the mail slot! then it's the yard's problem.
37706,Homer,why are you doing this? wait. are you in love with me?
17011,Homer,now what's that rule?
25216,Homer,nooo! my spine-o-cylinder!
14392,Homer,"good, good... you call moe."
26677,Homer,"oh, man. oh, man. we killed mr. burns. mr. burns is gonna be so mad."
28265,Homer,nooo!
33655,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. i wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding."
40850,Homer,"read the pamphlet, honey."
27884,Homer,uh-oh. gotta even it out.
40411,Homer,bart! stop fighting with your sister!
28798,Homer,that's my girl.
23448,Homer,race ya to the swimmin' hole!
30599,Homer,"do, do, do do / do, dooo..."
23944,Homer,"we made it, son. international waters -- the land that law forgot."
29778,Homer,thank god for that turkish freighter. now we'll just go get 'em and...
16214,Homer,"heh-heh-heh. lisa, vampires are make-believe. just like elves, gremlins and eskimos."
31346,Homer,i will!
24420,Homer,woo hoo!
33796,Homer,must finish poet's corner... or bart will work for noah... with his hot mom...
26060,Homer,"c'mon, he's a total player."
36750,Homer,"life is too fragile. one minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer."
30415,Homer,"i'm a-comin', boy!"
18626,Homer,"uh, hey ned, lemme help you with that."
37681,Homer,today i'm glad that i sold that stock.
28429,Homer,"all right, all right i'm still thinking!"
26243,Homer,"wait, wait, wait..."
34300,Homer,"that's a great story, lisa! and you should stop reading right there."
24289,Homer,i'll be at moe's.
40142,Homer,don't be so stubborn! we're not talking about a few dollars! we're talking about a few thousand dollars!
14431,Homer,let me through! let me through! i'm her husband!
40634,Homer,"told ya. now, come on. you're gonna learn how to shave."
29836,Homer,hey! come back with my patio furniture!
20285,Homer,"bart, are you in there? have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
36259,Homer,that's exactly what i'm having! you guys totally get me.
40838,Homer,"oh, hey, hey. family, family, come here. i have an announcement to make. the simpsons have cable."
17036,Homer,i've failed again. everybody can teach a class but me. i'm an idiot. what am i gonna tell my wife and kids?
29304,Homer,"well, that explains a lot. who's hungry?"
31994,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to trick your sister!
20469,Homer,"hold on, i'm workin' it out."
38459,Homer,"believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem."
31285,Homer,"marge, i ate it, it's over."
13846,Homer,how do you know i was sleeping?
30146,Homer,"this theater sucks. my seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
36415,Homer,but i'm a married man.
29040,Homer,dammit!
41273,Homer,"oh, you don't want to know what i really think. now, look sad and say ""d'oh."""
31769,Homer,"i don't know. maybe the krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
30329,Homer,"okay, just let me clear some space."
13879,Homer,yeah! woo! woo! yeah!
39095,Homer,we never dreamed.
28979,Homer,"marge, let's do it."
27214,Homer,hm. better add some more nails.
32623,Homer,cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
30739,Homer,fine. but the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
26351,Homer,one squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
17124,Homer,"chlorine, eh?"
31121,Homer,"oh wait, it was a twist-off."
40557,Homer,"yes, son."
19184,Homer,why not?
38443,Homer,"now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."
14686,Homer,maybe. i'm not sure. i forgot it.
27841,Homer,quit changing the subject. how do you feel about me right now?
24528,Homer,what?
28741,Homer,"where's the ""ee-yow?"""
32035,Homer,why you little...
29665,Homer,"now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
39226,Homer,"oh, thank god for the big jar."
37396,Homer,"well, i can't part with a single one of my ""hoarders""! hands off my episodes of ""episodes,"" and if you delete ""revenge""..."
27064,Homer,"oh, i don't resent you, sweetheart. what i was trying to say, and maybe i didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
35204,Homer,"ooo, he's gonna say ""dave's not here!"""
27888,Homer,i gotta go.
23632,Homer,"and this riptide is certainly nothing daddy can't struggle against. help! help! somebody, help!"
29060,Homer,nooo! not community service -- i can't stand helping others! i just can't!
19165,Homer,"no, i'm not!"
33708,Homer,we done here?
37893,Homer,"what happened to the movies? first they got worse than tv, and now this!"
25158,Homer,"deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher."
38602,Homer,i know just the place.
28337,Homer,wait! we have to exchange insurance!
21266,Homer,"oh, the garbage man can, marge. the garbage man can."
36350,Homer,"lousy marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his tv show... i'd tell my best friend, but that's marge too..."
32937,Homer,"thanks, boy."
13805,Homer,"hey, aren't you a little old for this? you're not even wearing costumes."
24183,Homer,"now, if ""the flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
17705,Homer,"hey, wait a minute. what are all these presents? it looks like you're ""showering"" marge with gifts."
35455,Homer,all pooted out.
35720,Homer,it's not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head!
39273,Homer,yeah.
35236,Homer,"marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" well, sometimes people can be too."
41235,Homer,"that's it, i'm getting outta here."
28492,Homer,"first we'll buy gifts for each other. then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
26791,Homer,can i lick your fingers? meet me at the mail slot.
38340,Homer,why you little! i'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!
25303,Homer,traitors!
15548,Homer,"are we gonna die, son?"
31378,Homer,"moe, you live in a hotel? you're just like ""eloise""!"
26477,Homer,"oh, no. i'm not giving you my car. you'll probably drive it."
35049,Homer,huh?
17813,Homer,i want a free car because i'm krusty. krusty the clown! get it? krus-ty!
36773,Homer,"sorry, boss."
19524,Homer,lousy loveable dog.
28495,Homer,"oh god, it's so unnecessary!"
30136,Homer,ah... this is heaven.
15376,Homer,wow. how much? how much?
37583,Homer,moving my body.
25490,Homer,mm hm. hmmmm.
28299,Homer,"marge, this is why people don't tell you things."
38917,Homer,"look, i don't have time for childish games. if i don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
26693,Homer,i never found true happiness until i met marge.
24021,Homer,what do you want me to do?
33955,Homer,you're the first teacher that ever got me.
19642,Homer,"oh lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
38615,Homer,high-quality spanish language programming.
15830,Homer,oof.
17208,Homer,shark-boy!
23540,Homer,"waldo, where are you?!"
21821,Homer,"the important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. either one of you. it's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. ron howard's attached to direct."
24704,Homer,"fine, i'll just discuss heavenly matters. so, how's maude flanders doin' up there? she playin' the field? ooh... yeah, really? all those guys? amen."
24641,Homer,oh yeah?
27584,Homer,"psst, mr. hawk. may i have a word with you?"
23902,Homer,"this is my year, marge. everyone knows i'm what makes this city great."
31095,Homer,look at all those people. you know them?
26074,Homer,let go of her or i'll scream!
24046,Homer,flanders? since when do you like anything cool?
25385,Homer,check it out. i built myself a healthy apple.
38564,Homer,nooo!
33839,Homer,"well, i love to play, but i'm not very good. also, i always forget to cash my chips back in for money."
19709,Homer,quiet! you're missing the jokes!
40482,Homer,bart? bart?
17153,Homer,"ow! ow! oh, they're defending themselves somehow!"
20546,Homer,fossils shmossils. you can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. bones shmones.
38718,Homer,get... in... the tent!
13995,Homer,"oh, that's a hobby!"
34897,Homer,"oh, that's pretty sure. subscription rate, right?"
16668,Homer,oh.
27674,Homer,let him speak!
39498,Homer,arrrgh!
15940,Homer,"two wrongs make a right, lisa. ah, rex morgan m.d., you have the prescription for the daily blues."
35487,Homer,"flanders, hold up!"
36643,Homer,this one's cold.
34776,Homer,"marge, can i have a word with you in private?"
14319,Homer,"well, it's more than you did!"
13556,Homer,wow. how do you do that thing with your feet?
14195,Homer,you mean like will apes be our masters?
23781,Homer,where?!
37281,Homer,help me god!
23664,Homer,and that's my cue to exit.
26695,Homer,then came the day that changes every couple forever. the day we got our elephant.
22967,Homer,check.
23411,Homer,sh-sh-shh!
38258,Homer,"well, at least i'll die the american way. in a foreign country wearing short pants."
34330,Homer,what the?! then i wanna eat at moe's express!
16868,Homer,use only in a well ventilated area.
19172,Homer,big deal. i didn't even get my kid's belt back. the only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
25677,Homer,now for the awkward part. we gotta talk about money.
40939,Homer,"but' nothing, marge. she's a heifer, plain and simple."
13813,Homer,"c'mom pal, i don't wanna hear your life story. paw me!"
39067,Homer,please keep spinning it. i don't wanna look at it.
18651,Homer,"he spanked you? you, bart simpson?"
28333,Homer,"okay, let's see. oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
26300,Homer,"come on, show the movie!"
39211,Homer,sorry. i'm just a big kid and i love christmas so much.
21424,Homer,"oh, happy anniversary, marge."
36888,Homer,villageville. build your own authentic medieval village. i must have something better to do.
34264,Homer,this bromance just got interesting.
14891,Homer,"marge, since the kids left, i lost five pounds!"
38588,Homer,ooh... pork chops with gravy!
15204,Homer,"marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. we only have five hundred in the bank. that leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
24764,Homer,i think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
21948,Homer,"cherry garcia... honey bono... desmond tutti fruitti... lisa, help daddy find some normal flavors."
17307,Homer,"i mean, heeeyy."
38412,Homer,"well, as we say in russia: ""goodbye in russian""!"
16705,Homer,woo hoo!
41078,Homer,everybody in the kitchen! we're having a family meeting!
37410,Homer,"tent, eh?"
16527,Homer,"oh, nothing, marge. just a little incident involving the boogeyman. of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
30147,Homer,yes.
31776,Homer,krusty! how 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
18767,Homer,i think smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when i'm around.
29545,Homer,every single super bowl halftime show has been great.
32816,Homer,"ooo, i think he's a keeper."
13978,Homer,bart! you can't weld with such a little flame. stupid kid.
40944,Homer,"quiet, you kids! if i hear one more word, bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and lisa doesn't get to go to college."
15574,Homer,"boy, i don't know. you gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
30679,Homer,interesting. interesting.
15090,Homer,don't leave me alone with him.
26735,Homer,they call me mellow yellow... quite rightly! this fellow never bellows... quite rightly!
14130,Homer,"well, i happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
21020,Homer,"aw, that's sweet, honey. i'll bring you back a hat."
28383,Homer,"maybe you're right, marge. or maybe you're right, candy ball. no, marge. then again... no, marge. definitely marge."
19855,Homer,"we're going out, marge. if we don't come back, avenge our deaths."
17402,Homer,uh-huh?
37227,Homer,no i don't. if you pray to superman.
30500,Homer,"aw, isn't that cute?"
21025,Homer,i'm a freak!
17517,Homer,but i -
34994,Homer,ayyyy!
28032,Homer,"you see? before, i probably would have driven to the syrup."
26224,Homer,"well, that's the last we'll see of them. come on, we're goin' to moe's."
37992,Homer,marge...
24393,Homer,we built this city / on rock annnd roll! uh-oh.
38042,Homer,"okay, hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
22775,Homer,"oh, poor eve. what are you doing out there in that horrible place?"
19586,Homer,"yeah, my wife is raking it in."
16043,Homer,"oh, geez, i told you, bernie. to guard the bee."
27443,Homer,now dr. hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
24526,Homer,i literally chewed the scenery.
29656,Homer,i won't do it.
35758,Homer,"hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
34922,Homer,shut up.
34206,Homer,could you scooch over a bit?
30021,Homer,my little girl likes red vines! you little...
34398,Homer,that is going right on stupidflanders.org.
31279,Homer,"marge, i realized something when i was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. i'm just glad i have you as my safety bar."
18708,Homer,and all those other balls?!
15455,Homer,"well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge."
23514,Homer,we all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. the least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
19852,Homer,"maybe i do, chief. maybe i do..."
22338,Homer,"aw, thank god! now we can stop holding it in."
29052,Homer,"i'll keep my promise, honey."
29289,Homer,"that's ridiculous, honey. you're the cutest little girl i know. you just have what is known as the simpson butt. permit me to elaborate."
33166,Homer,she blew it again! woo-hoo!
24630,Homer,oh yeah? what is it?
29819,Homer,we'll be safe in the gas chamber.
27538,Homer,god's ignoring me.
36439,Homer,just like me on twitter!
29466,Homer,"marge, you can't go with me to moe's. i mean, how would you like it if i came with you to your mother's?"
31322,Homer,"lisa, that was just a radio show."
25970,Homer,"hey, where'd that painting come from?"
27778,Homer,"yes, yes. if i keep putting work first, i'll lose everyone i care about, just like you did."
13340,Homer,"you little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
30222,Homer,"look, marge, i know i was supposed to yell at that priest, but he's so cool. he plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
14571,Homer,where do you think you're going?
29381,Homer,"let's see, i can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano..."
38846,Homer,turn it off!
16340,Homer,me too.
31038,Homer,she doesn't recognize us!
34229,Homer,wait!
39244,Homer,what do you mean? all the time? even when they're nuts?
13426,Homer,no.
41158,Homer,hello? hello? hello taste... where are you?
39184,Homer,"well, i was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
37357,Homer,no need. i already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
14946,Homer,too cold out!
37884,Homer,emily-beth? we can't afford emily-beth! she brings her own puppets!
25181,Homer,"hey, where's your blue shirt?"
23623,Homer,"you're a tough cookie, maggie, but i'm gonna win you over. just like i did with lisa."
13573,Homer,was it raining?
21148,Homer,woo hoo! we can gamble!
32443,Homer,i do! i do!
21436,Homer,"i know, but let me get you started first."
29183,Homer,wait a minute. are you trying to get dirt on lisa?
38407,Homer,"you know, i have more cheeks."
19548,Homer,"now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
40537,Homer,"oh. what's wrong, marge?"
26668,Homer,going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
22020,Homer,"i said ""fine."" what is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
19385,Homer,"eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
24459,Homer,"now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
39895,Homer,"hey, lenny. does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?"
23927,Homer,"geez, way to burst my bubble, marge."
38267,Homer,best recess ever!
30445,Homer,oh no! i've been killed!
31740,Homer,"okay, but i'm not good at details. or the big picture. i also show up late, and drunk."
31503,Homer,now lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
40294,Homer,wow!
13720,Homer,"listen, flanders, do you still have that store?"
14412,Homer,"lisa, do me a favor. complete this sentence: ""daddy should bet all his money on..."""
34783,Homer,"they should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
16307,Homer,tram...ample...een! tram...baple...een!
24123,Homer,"maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in springfield are simple folk. we like our cars fast, and our banks closed. okay, fine, we'll go down there. but they're not going to be open."
23491,Homer,"all right, now don't panic. it's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."
31797,Homer,if you don't mind!
33912,Homer,"finally, the answer to my problem. what do you do?"
33902,Homer,great! do you want to see me naked?
36742,Homer,i don't want to see it!
29591,Homer,burn the truth. burn the truth.
30410,Homer,"well, i'd better go."
38895,Homer,"well, it is a great party."
20282,Homer,"oh, man that's good."
27234,Homer,"finally, i'm no longer a slave to the gillette corporation."
26056,Homer,"yes, mr. burns."
33806,Homer,"yes! yes! in your face, losers! this helicopter is taking off!"
25392,Homer,it's what i always tell them. i told them that twice yesterday. and then again as they were going to sleep.
28632,Homer,"bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside."
17779,Homer,clown college? you can't eat that.
39723,Homer,then run along you little scamp. a boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
14975,Homer,"i, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. and i owe it all to skipping church!"
39335,Homer,"it could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. lisa, maybe you should try some of this."
37398,Homer,nothin's gonna delete these!
19856,Homer,"right. now remember, don't mention this to anyone. not your mother, not rex banner, not anyone."
22627,Homer,"that's right, ""the odd couple."" so meet your comically mismatched roommate, bart simpson."
24441,Homer,too late.
36943,Homer,is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
23798,Homer,take that! woo! woo! h-hey! hey!
40096,Homer,what?
21203,Homer,"no room for you, jell-o."
15970,Homer,"baby on board / something, something burt ward... this thing writes itself!"
17473,Homer,you're the screw-up!
39221,Homer,"it's too bright. that flanders, what a big show-off."
27722,Homer,"you, let's love. now!"
15447,Homer,what an age we live in!
31215,Homer,"woo hoo! what's next? a contract with groove-tone records? take the g-train, baby. groove-tone!"
19216,Homer,"ooh, let's pick him up!"
24682,Homer,"well marge, looks like your insane experiment is over."
16318,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll take care of it."
33240,Homer,but we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
31178,Homer,whyba youba doba thatba?
40757,Homer,me? i'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
24838,Homer,uh... i guess i'll take that one.
31868,Homer,"i got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
34625,Homer,marge! are you running off with moe?!
41403,Homer,and we're off!
33114,Homer,or you!
33498,Homer,fine. you're mad. what are you gonna do about it?
27106,Homer,never!
29439,Homer,katharine hepburn?!
37364,Homer,"probably one of bart's dirty friends! boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
24875,Homer,no!
37626,Homer,shut up.
37780,Homer,"oh, it's cool. we did it in an elevator."
38046,Homer,do you have my money?
30825,Homer,a living duck! i wished too hard and he became real!
13700,Homer,twenty dollars?
32395,Homer,and what color would that be?
39087,Homer,"no, marge! you have to listen! that place you sent me to changed my life!"
15323,Homer,"ah, white gold."
37728,Homer,"no matter what, homer simpson has done it. and soon i hope i remember who homer simpson is and his relationship to me. but i have no regrets. in fact, all this has given me a sense of calm i've never had before."
28500,Homer,"it's fine. everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio."
17914,Homer,i'll never pay off that debt.
15728,Homer,deer.
22554,Homer,"aw, crap! it's a girl's car. i can't drive this."
26480,Homer,"you're slow to react, dad."
36285,Homer,sonofa-- why did you do that?
16028,Homer,"hey, kids! wanna drive through that cactus patch?"
19824,Homer,"uh, gee, i'd really love to want to help you, flanders, but uh, marge was taken prisoner in the... holy land and uh..."
34053,Homer,french nuclear commissioner etienne ducharme.
37607,Homer,i'm not blowing up the plant. just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to mother earth.
24718,Homer,for a casual acquaintance like you? absolutely.
23401,Homer,tom arnold?! what the hell's going on?!
21161,Homer,do they do any other tricks?
41200,Homer,"well, if she's so wonderful, give her an a."
33785,Homer,"hey, how hard can it be? all we have to do is follow the directions."
29807,Homer,"well, if you really must know..."
22051,Homer,"oh, i'd like to apply for a job. any job. if you don't have a captain, i could be that."
24027,Homer,"oh, it is, it is. but we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
21316,Homer,i have been working out secretly at night. and look at me now!
17650,Homer,"you know, marge you're right. the simpson family is the best possible club i could belong to."
28469,Homer,why should america consume ninety percent of the world's resources? argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
26494,Homer,we've gotta go after them.
28609,Homer,various bug bites and wounds. now stop interrupting your brother.
15901,Homer,"yes, honey."
22813,Homer,"english side ruined! must use french instructions! ""le grille?"" what the hell is that?!"
40087,Homer,"well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and i always run out."
39369,Homer,comin' through.
30312,Homer,rubes.
25508,Homer,reach into these holes. i use a carrot.
24996,Homer,"well, before she died, she ordered this bible especially for you."
37375,Homer,but this paper towel feels so good.
20622,Homer,stop it!
36673,Homer,"or a spy from a rival gang! hey, what are you doin'?"
17469,Homer,wow. let's go find that hot dog tree i planted.
29981,Homer,oh boy.
25121,Homer,"hmmm. increase my killing power, eh? let's do it."
36223,Homer,yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. i did it when i was in that alcohol-induced coma.
38562,Homer,"oh, that's fine then."
38862,Homer,potato chips!
24113,Homer,"yes, i'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. from... anonymous."
32622,Homer,this must be how the rich toss out their gold. and as long as i'm cleaning out the family chariot...
38204,Homer,rockin'
32071,Homer,woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals!
15122,Homer,all right. tell you what. i'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
32745,Homer,some of that is cow blood.
23388,Homer,in death you saved us all.
35605,Homer,"assistant? well, i have been pretty overworked lately."
14358,Homer,"good, good. moe, fifty dollars on the miami dolphins."
16983,Homer,"uh-huh. and ""if""?"
39768,Homer,"sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
32461,Homer,a smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
26797,Homer,woo!
19006,Homer,...and i like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
39830,Homer,anybody home?
39085,Homer,"ditto. you know i've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and i think you just might be the guy."
16468,Homer,oh no! i'm sweating like roger ebert.
39800,Homer,"i'm sorry, i don't usually laugh like this."
20253,Homer,"geez, what's with all the death?"
23101,Homer,undo! undo!
26871,Homer,i'd stab somebody for a pickle.
30070,Homer,"marge, the rapture is nigh. these books will help me figure out how nigh."
41009,Homer,what's that?
15987,Homer,oh. thanks.
33136,Homer,"marge, what are you doing here?"
24800,Homer,huh? help! mr. burns!
36340,Homer,the kids are away and maggie's napping...
20656,Homer,what a deal! i'd be a sucker not to get it.
32700,Homer,my old car!
29495,Homer,marge!
31176,Homer,"wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!"
31457,Homer,"oh, i see. you'd prefer a wire transfer. what's your routing number?"
28037,Homer,look at those suckers in their metal coffins. i can go to work any way i want.
28348,Homer,a secret tunnel? i don't know. won't that get me in more trouble?
39018,Homer,"""ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" it's as old as the bible."
30916,Homer,maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
39846,Homer,"i also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. i want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
13842,Homer,you both toilet-trained?
15010,Homer,"wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
32401,Homer,spaz.
15889,Homer,not me!
18544,Homer,"gotta change maggie! dear god, we gotta change maggie!"
13443,Homer,my beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
34637,Homer,why you--
37880,Homer,"they're talking about the movie! hurry up, you idiot! no, no, don't stop! i'm sorry i got mad. i'll do that thing you like."
19161,Homer,yeah yeah.
37558,Homer,you deserve what you get...
36497,Homer,"okay, i'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... i'm on the wrong tree... okay, try again... here we go, okay..."
15743,Homer,nooooo!
14135,Homer,fifty-two hundred dollars? what are you talking about?
19826,Homer,going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
35510,Homer,sheez!
32558,Homer,what the hell?
18001,Homer,"you look great, sweetheart."
13331,Homer,what are all our friends names again?
17044,Homer,it's all right! i'm a teacher.
25967,Homer,"now, ya see, that's what i'm talkin' about. you're always pointing that shotgun at us."
20011,Homer,"acid, eh? gee, that would have been stupid. boy would my face have been red!"
18900,Homer,"oh, can i come?"
32944,Homer,bart's having girl trouble. you better go talk to him.
16620,Homer,"well, i guess i'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
20390,Homer,o-kay!
18535,Homer,"but it won't make you unhappy, right? hey! space food sticks! oh, i wish i had these on my space adventure! did you know i was blasted into space two years ago, mom?"
40568,Homer,i'll tell you what i think. i think he thinks i'm an idiot. the only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
28282,Homer,"oh, what a delicious quiche! i drive a pink miata."
31425,Homer,"son, i will not stand for intolerance!"
14952,Homer,"whyyy, oh whyyy... delilahhh?"
35453,Homer,why you undead little...!
23386,Homer,"implied, lisa? or implode?"
39753,Homer,"well, if you don't want it, i know someone who does."
31334,Homer,are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'cause mine is i care too much.
16786,Homer,huh?
37808,Homer,"i guess this is it, little guy."
16724,Homer,inanimate huh? i'll show him inanimate!
34529,Homer,"yeah, so is getting a real job."
38810,Homer,wow.
22437,Homer,"homer sim-- uh, max power."
37500,Homer,attention everyone in iceland! we have an important announcement!
30483,Homer,"lord, i'm coming home to you / alabama!"
13854,Homer,umm. spaghetti.
33887,Homer,that's inspiring. what's that from? x-men 2?
34764,Homer,"man, it's been a crazy morning. champagne?"
19110,Homer,"yes sir, i will notice that. very casual, mr. scorpion."
23125,Homer,at least the jimmy stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
21557,Homer,marge! i've wasted half my life.
25532,Homer,"wait, i changed my mind."
40800,Homer,ow.
38323,Homer,i'm number two!
20843,Homer,"scratch, eh?"
30220,Homer,right. and how do i join? do i whale on some unitarians?
34536,Homer,oh my goodness! it means we're traveling back in time! i can warn president lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
24966,Homer,is that a steak?
26434,Homer,"hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
27465,Homer,"listen, my bulky flower, i-i have an early day..."
33388,Homer,huh? who said that?
20393,Homer,"it's gone for good, marge. i finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
31100,Homer,all right. just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
30411,Homer,"you know the four seasons? well, i'm experiencing them first hand, because i'm living in the park."
32956,Homer,this is a classic nineteen seventy-eight pizza hut! mmm... terrible.
36214,Homer,"woo-hoo! i'm dry! come on, everybody! feel daddy's underpants!"
34636,Homer,what the--
40744,Homer,it was worth it.
20132,Homer,"what? ""failure to wait by vehicle: $250."""
29738,Homer,directory assistance?
27557,Homer,see you in court.
38805,Homer,gimme another one.
37113,Homer,"instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living."
30845,Homer,"oh, you're so right. i guess i should be more concerned with bart's safety than covering my own butt. and maybe i'm talking like this because i can't stop. help me, lisa! i have serious mental problems!"
39714,Homer,marge. they're only space mutants.
36962,Homer,what the hell was that?
34738,Homer,"good afternoon. i'd like to return this merchandise. wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain."
29472,Homer,just what are you inferring?
14790,Homer,that guy has gotta go.
32653,Homer,"we didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."
25779,Homer,uh... for frosty chocolate milkshakes. frosty chocolate milkshakes!
13364,Homer,hmmmm.
33149,Homer,"ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
40821,Homer,marge?
40662,Homer,"no, thanks."
31718,Homer,"of course, you idiot, 'cause i'm wishing for more money."
14787,Homer,"son, come here. heh, heh, heh. of course i'm not mad. if something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. you just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch tv."
35760,Homer,so... why are you here? is it about that unauthorized krusty lookalike i hired for lisa's first communion? what was his name?
38350,Homer,"lookin' good, santa's little hybrid."
21536,Homer,"all right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. let's bow our heads in prayer."
30691,Homer,"marge, i found my real father! his name is mason fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""homer, please do that in the loo."""
21415,Homer,uh... not this exquisite.
27318,Homer,frank grimes...
41471,Homer,don't act like i'm the first person that ever said that!
41075,Homer,"now marge, honey, honey, honey. come on. come on, don't get upset. it's not the end of the world. we all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to..."
31031,Homer,"son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, entertainment weekly. now, for once, i'm getting' rich-person mail. you wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?"
26779,Homer,"okay, this isn't easy, so i'm just gonna come out and say it."
32017,Homer,here! it's yours!
21274,Homer,"okay, before i show ya, who wants to guess how i got the money?"
34463,Homer,smithers. what a marshmallow.
34956,Homer,"all that time i'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise..."
40495,Homer,don't you think i know that?
35633,Homer,"since i got demoted i have to show my i.d., but the picture was taken so long ago i put on a lot of weight, so i have to stretch out my face and say ""i used to look like this..."""
14910,Homer,"bart, don't ask stupid questions. is there any frontal nudity?"
24793,Homer,baby made a boom-boom.
23054,Homer,"that's not how i remember it. besides, if we want to see japanese people we could have gone to the zoo."
35639,Homer,"i'm having problems with my new boss roz. she's the most evil person to come out of ohio since lebron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
14527,Homer,"oh, marge. i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted to hear."
34732,Homer,"hide a sandwich in this hat. ""mary poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."
22108,Homer,"oh, honey, don't be so naive. that's how the world works. sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
26052,Homer,you will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
32277,Homer,"ah, my first tow."
30259,Homer,where are you going?
34098,Homer,and it's not over yet.
25153,Homer,i'm a spaulding gray in a rick dees world. change me back to the blissful boob i was!
13503,Homer,"hello, my name is mr. burns. i believe you have a letter for me."
18895,Homer,maybe it's time we put grampa in a home.
34140,Homer,"marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? it's impossible. watch."
28180,Homer,"okay god, i bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. now release me from this ghastly vocation."
19560,Homer,uh... the second one. zilliphone. next question.
17856,Homer,"yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"
23897,Homer,"oh, right. the ice pick."
15138,Homer,"then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 minutes."""
33750,Homer,well i hope your son enjoys being driven around by the president of the united states.
20224,Homer,"well, moe, this is it. today's the day i get my new air conditioner."
34723,Homer,"after bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made."
13688,Homer,"apple, apple, apple... come on candy bar. hey, i know you! you're that first apple i didn't want. that sinks it. i'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
26788,Homer,yeah! 'cause if they don't...
26704,Homer,secrets and lies...
39231,Homer,"oh, good. because i do love you and i don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."
24655,Homer,guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
17222,Homer,"all right, we're here. let us never speak of the shortcut again."
23360,Homer,but you got to kill...
18250,Homer,"lisa, get a hold of yourself. this is lamb... not a lamb."
27966,Homer,move the net under the window.
29019,Homer,judge a pig competition?... but i'm no super-genius! or are i?
36071,Homer,the old homestead. remember when we moved in and i talked like this?
37441,Homer,what the--? change the channel? but i'm watching soft-core tennis!
39104,Homer,"but marge, i don't want you to ever stop caring about me."
15215,Homer,wha dey do?
20531,Homer,"don't worry, apu. some day you'll meet someone you really love."
16106,Homer,"of course he does. he's a cute little piggy. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
34226,Homer,you're right. i have been acting like telethon jerry lewis when i should've been acting like rest-of-the-year jerry lewis. will you teach me how to put myself first?
15698,Homer,"roll in at nine, punch out at five. that's the plan."
22317,Homer,really?
22452,Homer,"me, too. let's sing the cinderella song."
26777,Homer,i think he's building to something.
21711,Homer,you are sooo dead.
25841,Homer,"yeah, she's cool."
21251,Homer,who should handle all your dirty jobs?
29278,Homer,"would you excuse us, milton?"
20487,Homer,i have this much.
30077,Homer,the world will end next week! spend your children's college fund! thaw that turkey now!
28050,Homer,"top of the mornin', ladies."
19616,Homer,that worked sooo well.
27232,Homer,"wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!"
13263,Homer,"yes, i have returned from the dead."
22140,Homer,"mayor, fat tony asked me to give you this--"
21836,Homer,but where will i bask?
37946,Homer,"c'mon, buddy. i gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
15106,Homer,did you raise the dead?
37565,Homer,i'm gonna have forty key chains! / and i don't even have forty keys! / swag!
14016,Homer,"you know, marge, that bart of ours is a little miracle. his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... he reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
29540,Homer,it soaked through to the other side!
18058,Homer,"remember, honey?"
40551,Homer,hey! lionel hutz...
41240,Homer,don't think about beer.
17325,Homer,"tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
24118,Homer,"that's it, boy! go get help!"
25794,Homer,"all right, but your next story better be worth it."
14465,Homer,maggie?
22722,Homer,"i whole-heartedly-agree. oh-man-i'm-really-wired. this-is-a-big-mistake-i-can... ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. so drowsy. pep-pills-perking-up-again. i-could-drive allll niiight..."
18104,Homer,i choose to waive that right.
18541,Homer,"or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst."
15439,Homer,"oh ni-ight, di- vine. hey, my voice just changed."
18738,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye! what's for breakfast?"
21306,Homer,"i've got to keep trying! or i could just move that picture. no! the picture looked good where it was. boy, drag me back outside."
41109,Homer,yell-o.
31985,Homer,i'm lost and i'm starving!
32524,Homer,yeah. the only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
16634,Homer,that's not a job. it's a waste of time. what can poor people pay ya? nothin'! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? none! who wants to help poor people anyway? nobody!
15785,Homer,who keeps saying that?
35443,Homer,"hey, kids!"
20078,Homer,"son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
32054,Homer,that's me!
31973,Homer,"where the hell is abigail adams?! oh, there she is. where the hell is mary todd lincoln?! oh, she's right there. where the hell is ida saxton mckinley?! oh i see. where the hell is--"
37280,Homer,this is praying?! let me outta here!
28209,Homer,"""peace talks break down."" no. ""for sale, ford festiva..."" i'll put that in the ""maybes."" i gotta get that t-shirt."
34649,Homer,she's packing her bag!
21565,Homer,oh. i see you're having a party. i'll come back later.
30098,Homer,"aw, that's my girl."
17798,Homer,"i'm beat, and after work i've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the ace awards."
22103,Homer,they'll be fine in half an hour.
39362,Homer,"why, you little -- !"
36308,Homer,gotta have that!
25230,Homer,"sorry, son."
26947,Homer,"if that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, i love this song."
32982,Homer,it's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
39371,Homer,"but, sir, i --"
30503,Homer,i still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. it's my day.
27324,Homer,bart! turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
36232,Homer,what about this lemonade?
36989,Homer,um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.
21676,Homer,i hate folding sheets.
40013,Homer,"honey, can we make up again?"

51106,Lisa,but how did you get the key?
49848,Lisa,you'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
49058,Lisa,come on!
47101,Lisa,"he's right, dad. we're missing that singer's head!"
48821,Lisa,there must be a website that can help you deal with a clingy baby.
44686,Lisa,"okay, let's see, it's not egyptian. it's not prince's names."
45129,Lisa,but what i did was wrong.
45743,Lisa,stop kicking me!
48716,Lisa,"feel better now, bart?"
42410,Lisa,i thought you'd like it.
50057,Lisa,you're quitting school?!
45111,Lisa,bart?! shouldn't you be in class?
45429,Lisa,bart! the internet is more than a global pornography network. it's a...
48197,Lisa,"dad, you're driving on an ancient roman aqueduct!"
44631,Lisa,"yeah, mom, c'mon. you let us stay up to watch troy mcclure in such other bible epics as ""david vs. super goliath"" and ""suddenly, last supper."""
47739,Lisa,did you know back in high school that she'd be such a star?
42822,Lisa,me too.
44059,Lisa,"yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the hall of records was mysteriously blown away!"
42597,Lisa,"uh, dad, that's his crotch."
42749,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons. my advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
45167,Lisa,"is he, mom? you can tell me."
50405,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart! take the last truffle... do whatever you want. sell it, eat it..."
47466,Lisa,time to show them the new me. no one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.
48883,Lisa,sideshow bob!
48208,Lisa,"i don't know, dad. this time of year everybody does it, 'cause you don't have to pay for the music rights."
49112,Lisa,"wow, i guess nelson's the hot thing now. my movie will probably never be seen."
48793,Lisa,one... two...
46598,Lisa,"mom, there's no gambling in branson. it was designed as a family destination."
45464,Lisa,ewww. mom!
45080,Lisa,"ah, this is my kind of aisle -- soy substitute... whizless cheese... oven-roasted cud!"
46941,Lisa,"dad, it's just a bug."
43123,Lisa,aw.
48761,Lisa,jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. but i can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.
47402,Lisa,i have to research a paper. where did all the books go?
46993,Lisa,"except when pronounced like ""a,"" as in ""neighbor"" and ""weigh."""
44623,Lisa,yaaay! here comes the leader!
44277,Lisa,"well, i won't tell mom and dad, but only because i want the dog back. just try not to freak out the blind man."
49614,Lisa,there must be a better way.
50454,Lisa,how much?
42514,Lisa,"excuse me, but i think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean."
48270,Lisa,you worked at moe's?
49890,Lisa,there's only one ant left!
48258,Lisa,oh no!
52246,Lisa,"another barrier broken. right on, sister!"
45673,Lisa,"dad, bart, i played a horrible trick on you and i'm really sorry. you don't have leprosy. it's just oatmeal."
49638,Lisa,that's it? just t.p. her?
48958,Lisa,"what do you mean ""what's up""? why would something be up?"
52082,Lisa,we got money!
51521,Lisa,he worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
43095,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
47908,Lisa,they're saying springfielders are stupid hicks.
52277,Lisa,"please, dad."
49773,Lisa,"sorry, but i was planning to stop by the olympic pin center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. y'know, just to get me through the day."
50704,Lisa,dad? dad?
45691,Lisa,hey!
46251,Lisa,that's terrible!
50428,Lisa,"milhouse, i... i..."
48547,Lisa,"angelica button and the dragon king's trundle bed. it's the ninth book in the ""angelica button"" series."
51655,Lisa,no! no! no! no! that's super hell!
49794,Lisa,family records for a school project on genealogical--
44151,Lisa,"but, dad, it's barbaric! how does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
46668,Lisa,as if.
44154,Lisa,where are the dice?
49723,Lisa,i do! it enrages me!
46378,Lisa,you are not.
42260,Lisa,ew!
44861,Lisa,22a?! then where the heck am i?
46675,Lisa,"as head of the student activities committee, i have an idea."
49386,Lisa,...we have received your manuscript 'the chronicles of equalia'...
46631,Lisa,why must you fight with every utility?
50244,Lisa,... ... ...
52032,Lisa,"female carrier, bart."
48074,Lisa,grampa?
47890,Lisa,"neat! when i sleep at dad's, i call this bed."
50214,Lisa,"or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner."
42091,Lisa,"come on, bart. in your pre-fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
46152,Lisa,uncle sam? let me play this backwards.
44995,Lisa,what happened?
45296,Lisa,"gee, i should cut dad some slack. after all, he did take me to the ballet, and the smithsonian exhibit... in fact, he takes me lots of places he hates."
47564,Lisa,"something's fishy. they're not in dayton, they're somewhere fun."
42902,Lisa,i'll do whatever it takes.
45162,Lisa,"dad, we hit don rickles!"
44965,Lisa,you guys have dates?
44604,Lisa,we just saw the most amazing camel!
43245,Lisa,oh mom. thanks.
42533,Lisa,wow an original malibu stacey from 1958. oooh.
49409,Lisa,"yep. in the future, people will look at this and they'll say ""whoever he was, he must've mattered."""
42733,Lisa,all right! now all we need is a name.
47492,Lisa,"mom, dad! i'm so sorry i got you into this!"
48714,Lisa,"he died, bart. dad buried him in the back yard. but not in that order."
50885,Lisa,where'd you get that shirt?
51177,Lisa,yay!
48953,Lisa,i'm saying this is worse than a million a-minuses!
43775,Lisa,"dad, you tell everybody everything. even moe knew when i threw up on the dentist."
43443,Lisa,oh boy! really?
42454,Lisa,eww.
44040,Lisa,"you got rid of them! and you did it like a gentleman, without any violence."
48857,Lisa,"oh really? the more you deny it, the more i know it's true."
49121,Lisa,"you know, it's a boy dolphin."
48036,Lisa,catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
46815,Lisa,m-m-minus?!
41617,Lisa,"wait a minute, who killed maggie?"
50814,Lisa,"well, i'm smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not ""mean funny,"" and i never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away."
51264,Lisa,you've presented me with quite a conundrum.
46342,Lisa,yeah. / pretty much.
44197,Lisa,"bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
49144,Lisa,yo ho ho and a bottle of fun!
49736,Lisa,what will that do?
50801,Lisa,can i please be alone?
47268,Lisa,skinner betrayed me!
46903,Lisa,just buy me the friggin' toy.
48898,Lisa,"it was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!"
44507,Lisa,everybody! come quick!
45020,Lisa,"uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?"
50356,Lisa,from the great raymondo.
50017,Lisa,part two...
48769,Lisa,"bart, are you all right? bart?"
51308,Lisa,a lincoln republican?
43577,Lisa,"i wanna meet the first female stealth bomber pilot. during the gulf war she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is lisa, too!"
51592,Lisa,i would've found a friend eventually. you couldn't wait a damn decade until i got into college?
46367,Lisa,release the dragon!
44431,Lisa,"""dear lisa, may your new saxophone bring you years of d'oh!"""
47684,Lisa,"""...but screw them, you're in! congratulations!"""
46423,Lisa,now you've done it. you really humiliated mom.
50620,Lisa,"oh, dad! i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason."
44624,Lisa,oh yeah! / absolutely! / at least twice as much!
47415,Lisa,"ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants."
43539,Lisa,da-ad!
44413,Lisa,no!
43382,Lisa,"dad, how can you work for a man like mr. burns?"
44971,Lisa,hello?
46392,Lisa,a hole for what?
42705,Lisa,"it's not funny, bart! millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! that they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
47420,Lisa,geronimo!
46623,Lisa,"is that true, lord?"
43624,Lisa,"oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like mary hart!"
48996,Lisa,oh.
42115,Lisa,just tell me when the scary part's over.
52443,Lisa,ewww. gross.
44617,Lisa,"dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
43088,Lisa,"dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
45322,Lisa,we'll never be able to swim that far.
47242,Lisa,you wanted to see me?
51414,Lisa,how does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
46273,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
44838,Lisa,"bart, did you glue those on?"
43893,Lisa,aye carumba!
44526,Lisa,but--
51125,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so i made cookies. but i didn't know what kind you liked, so i made you seven kinds. i've become my mother! well, common sense never goes out of style that was too easy!"
49196,Lisa,you're just digging yourself even deeper.
50474,Lisa,you know i hate surprises!
52280,Lisa,"please, dad."
46387,Lisa,we promise.
45823,Lisa,why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
48239,Lisa,"no! c'mon, willie. i believe in you!"
43343,Lisa,how come it won't stop hurting?
45698,Lisa,"no, something fresh and bold."
43082,Lisa,what do you think mom and dad are doing right now?
44709,Lisa,that didn't answer anything. i need more information.
45068,Lisa,ready.
49194,Lisa,"okay, listen, you. i don't know who you are or what you've done with the real bart. but... god help me, i want him back."
47257,Lisa,"you mean i can come to the school after hours, weekends, even during the summer?"
42588,Lisa,look!
47751,Lisa,"hello, u. n. women's conference!"
42114,Lisa,"""honey, i hit a school bus""!"
48205,Lisa,cyrus? you never mentioned him before.
46191,Lisa,"and you like the same one i like -- with the grad-student glamour pack... just like the one in my... ...locker. that's mine, isn't it?"
46803,Lisa,"are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, dad?"
49289,Lisa,"oh, such beautiful packaging! i never thought a company could be my soul mate!"
47834,Lisa,"well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
51896,Lisa,where's he going?
46611,Lisa,"that's just you, bart."
45077,Lisa,"dad, do you mind? your feet are really close to my potato."
41782,Lisa,yes!
51518,Lisa,...isn't rich...
49044,Lisa,awww.
49007,Lisa,fresh air.
47573,Lisa,i guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.
43927,Lisa,tiny little people!
49881,Lisa,"nothing! look, do you want to do it or not?"
48424,Lisa,"shake it off, buck!"
44801,Lisa,stop talking like that! stop it!
47023,Lisa,wha?
50726,Lisa,...you promised to help me write a haiku...
48041,Lisa,"i'll ignore that. in fact, i'm gonna help you. i have a pretty good idea where they are."
44117,Lisa,it's the american wayyy!
42654,Lisa,"i'm not a state, i'm a monster!"
48770,Lisa,"my god, that's a class-five stench-dispersal unit! we have to short out that fan."
41944,Lisa,one of the economic powers of the world--
48378,Lisa,what have i become?
50506,Lisa,"bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?"
52057,Lisa,with all our hearts!
50591,Lisa,"we did it, bart! i'm a mentor!"
46318,Lisa,that was great. i can't believe she found a rhyme for hezekiah.
41844,Lisa,"bart, you're not laughing. too subtle?"
49442,Lisa,dad! come in the kitchen! quick!
52402,Lisa,"oh mom, i can't believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher."
46824,Lisa,"he thinks he's really cool, but frankly the other kids are starting to wake up and smell the cooties."
42129,Lisa,"i think you have to be more aggressive, sir."
48698,Lisa,ow! she tripped me. ow! owww!
49031,Lisa,and i used rhetoric in my answer!
47077,Lisa,i'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
49051,Lisa,okay. meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
42893,Lisa,you're a wonderful person.
43558,Lisa,"oh, i just keep them out to bug bart."
47621,Lisa,"i don't know whether it's the lack of sleep, the sodium pentathol, or that it's the only cartoon i've seen in two months. but this is what i believe in now."
47174,Lisa,yay! i wanna amble!
50242,Lisa,"so i never want to see another christmas tree... until mom comes back, safe and sound."
49786,Lisa,"ooh, family trees -- the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure!"
46917,Lisa,because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. take a look for yourself.
41628,Lisa,"oh, can that tuna! we can get your brain to work the same way you always get the tv to work -- by hitting it!"
51798,Lisa,"yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was michael jackson."
49930,Lisa,she doesn't like lying on the beach! she likes being in the ocean!
43196,Lisa,"goodbye, mr. sherman. if i ever play carnegie hall, i'll give you a call."
42035,Lisa,thanks mom.
45073,Lisa,"don't blame us, dad. the celebrities are the ones who canned you."
52039,Lisa,"hi, daddy."
47679,Lisa,"dad, would you like some of my snicker-bar cheesecake?"
52298,Lisa,why you cagey ol' dog.
42806,Lisa,"so bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?"
45513,Lisa,"your collecting days are over, collector..."
41940,Lisa,"come here, maggie."
46093,Lisa,it is!
52360,Lisa,very impressive!
49503,Lisa,"""at mcellis island, returning immigrants who are sick of america are processed by irish authorities."""
51865,Lisa,how 'bout this: supervising technician at the toxic waste dump.
48317,Lisa,grampa must've set them free!
48537,Lisa,comic book guy! have you seen our mom?
44055,Lisa,"hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind..."
49813,Lisa,"well i am reading it, and when i'm finished, i'm going to use eliza's diary for my ""black history month"" presentation!"
42293,Lisa,but i'm a real tightwad. can i afford this remarkable system?
45339,Lisa,"oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the california highway..."
49054,Lisa,don't worry. i called some animal activists who can help us get in. i'll just give the signal. milk is murder!
46830,Lisa,wait! wait!
46782,Lisa,break into the bank and snatch that dough...
52358,Lisa,wow. neat. it smells historic.
41851,Lisa,"he's just a little nervous. he has to give a speech tomorrow on ""how to keep cool in a crisis."""
51808,Lisa,but when you think of the things we lack...
47234,Lisa,i'm doomed.
48635,Lisa,am i to understand you're purposely denying education to these children?
45852,Lisa,sorry. i'm just frustrated.
43770,Lisa,okay. time for truth or dare. you go first.
42430,Lisa,got it.
48400,Lisa,"i'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history, mom."
42997,Lisa,"bart! we did it! now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
46089,Lisa,and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
46627,Lisa,"look, this story is more interesting than you think. it starts with hamlet's father getting murdered."
44334,Lisa,did you see that?
42421,Lisa,how can a hamster write mysteries?
44973,Lisa,"hey, guys."
43284,Lisa,he's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!
50319,Lisa,look!
42608,Lisa,"mr. hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?"
47090,Lisa,"in his sleep deprived state, he's very suggestible. okay dad, you are now playing patty-cake with maggie."
51325,Lisa,"isabel! i want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship..."
49163,Lisa,it always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
42873,Lisa,mom.
49987,Lisa,that doesn't work on me.
46004,Lisa,"oh, seven o'clock. the family's just sitting down to dinner."
51367,Lisa,i mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. even spongebob did it.
44962,Lisa,i am not wearing this.
48747,Lisa,"no, boy, that's hanukah."
48066,Lisa,"wow, look at all these worthy americans..."
50250,Lisa,"du grunst nicht nur zur sommerzeit, /"
50667,Lisa,"um, i should probably get back to my mom. by the way, my name is--"
47642,Lisa,it's not fair!
51127,Lisa,bart! milhouse!
46108,Lisa,i'm gonna wear my apron on the fourth of july.
45132,Lisa,intendent--
48582,Lisa,it's not over yet!
47247,Lisa,this grown-up makeover / has made me a super-tween / for they are my people / and i am their queen!
45853,Lisa,"i'm just walking. listen, i know i said i wanted to be a dancer, but..."
41853,Lisa,"no, dad, krusty is our guest. your pratfalls and punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
51517,Lisa,my hero isn't famous...
41701,Lisa,"so, i guess this is it? it you don't mind i'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
51378,Lisa,"no, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
45769,Lisa,yeah. did you even call about that messenger job?
48432,Lisa,"well, you're not gonna find any here."
51167,Lisa,happy birthday dad! / happy birthday grampa!
51056,Lisa,chauncey!
44622,Lisa,we love the leader!
47039,Lisa,"yeah, and entertainers are always winning elections. jesse the body ventura, sonny bono, gopher from love boat, mary bono..."
51257,Lisa,i guess i'll be getting some extra credit for this.
43532,Lisa,"um, i would also like to take your coat."
49591,Lisa,"mom, i'm glad you brought me here, but isn't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful?"
50123,Lisa,"okay, okay, he's stolen third. but surely that's the limit of his cockiness..."
44920,Lisa,i'm just a little girl.
43091,Lisa,hawaii!
50162,Lisa,"mom, is something wrong?"
49967,Lisa,it's better to just fit in with the crowd.
50369,Lisa,my friends call me lisa.
48252,Lisa,"i think this is the perfect job for the new you, willie. it requires sophistication, tact, and you get to meet the highest class of people."
42101,Lisa,it's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
49886,Lisa,"well, i'm so glad i'm not your mom."
48666,Lisa,"dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!"
41992,Lisa,"goodnight, dad. i had a really nice time today."
42001,Lisa,let's see... football... football: homo-eroticism in... oddball canadian rules... phyllis george and...
48231,Lisa,and...?
44227,Lisa,what are you doing now?!
51079,Lisa,can you sign my yearbook?!
50108,Lisa,don't swing.
43835,Lisa,"wow, it's like woodstock. only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards."
50849,Lisa,huh?
43640,Lisa,with tax or without?
52150,Lisa,what?
48645,Lisa,mistos and lattes and grandes and ventis / browsing at bookstores with fat cognoscentis!
43221,Lisa,"beautiful dinnerware, mrs. parkfield."
45220,Lisa,"oh, how romantic!"
50384,Lisa,ricky jay? david copperfield? penn? teller?!?!
46851,Lisa,"yes, but now that it's hip, all the ex-presidents are doing it."
43143,Lisa,it blew up the bridge!
42657,Lisa,"bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. that saxophone was my one creative outlet. it was the only way i could truly express myself."
48070,Lisa,i didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
44368,Lisa,why'd you say that?
50230,Lisa,you do for me.
50819,Lisa,on a one-way train to be milhouse's bride...
50122,Lisa,"no! no, don't steal!"
43849,Lisa,"you know something, beezee? i think you're right."
42969,Lisa,that sounds like sideshow bob!
45659,Lisa,we better check with a doctor.
52219,Lisa,"hey, bart, stop it!"
44782,Lisa,"what is ""zazz""?"
47168,Lisa,it's good to have you back with the simpsons.
44766,Lisa,"who needs college, mom. we're trillionaires! let's buy dune buggies."
48577,Lisa,after brazil.
51788,Lisa,i just wanted to see if there was a better life. even for a little bit.
43466,Lisa,no.
52478,Lisa,mom... you're the best!
41959,Lisa,"dad, can i have some money to buy bart a birthday present?"
47816,Lisa,hmm... the tv changes channels every time the dog barks.
50491,Lisa,"""d, e""... amazing! oh, but before we continue..."
42304,Lisa,my first word.
51643,Lisa,"this is so sad. in his homeland, dad was a nuclear engineer."
46701,Lisa,president kennedy!
44080,Lisa,i think there must be a more logical explanation. and i think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
49480,Lisa,...lisa?
48174,Lisa,milhouse is teaching me / to speak so prettily / i'll quip so wittily / when i'm in italy...
42526,Lisa,he's a big tv star.
51259,Lisa,i got bart's backpack.
43551,Lisa,"hey, leave my dad alone. just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. he's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
41904,Lisa,it's not my fault. it's the reed.
50918,Lisa,this is such a big step!
50904,Lisa,"can't breathe... i've lost, i've lost everything."
50184,Lisa,did you get that the pony was actually me?
49691,Lisa,change it! change it!
52222,Lisa,baaarrtt!
42496,Lisa,yeah.
43817,Lisa,that's the home-owner tax.
43391,Lisa,could not!
41616,Lisa,in i.q. only!
41710,Lisa,"look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
49541,Lisa,tofu cubes... tidy joes... chili con cottage cheese...
45666,Lisa,"lazy, no-good lepers... making me clean everything myself..."
48050,Lisa,all we've got is ketchup.
48325,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, dad. you're the first man to ever outsource the american worker's sense of entitlement and privilege."
49737,Lisa,"chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!"
49496,Lisa,"hm. there was a note on the fridge marked ""urgent."" funny word: ""urgent."" ""urrrgent."" urgent."
49621,Lisa,asterisk! asterisk! asterisk!
48850,Lisa,spider burps!
48858,Lisa,"god, that was lame! where did you get that?!"
51946,Lisa,i choose not to participate.
43035,Lisa,you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
45385,Lisa,you won second place?
46253,Lisa,"hey, mom."
47329,Lisa,aww.
45845,Lisa,"oh, mom. i want to be a dancer!"
47313,Lisa,grampa! you have a job?
50916,Lisa,but i'm a vegetarian!
48520,Lisa,i'm not here.
45718,Lisa,that doesn't sound like bees.
44603,Lisa,that was just confusing.
46597,Lisa,"well, how do we get to branson?"
41814,Lisa,"i would like to read a different essay, if i may."
47280,Lisa,don't cry for me kids of springfield / you can still reach me through e-mail / at smart girl six three / underscore back slash / at yahoo dot com / at yahoo dot com...
45040,Lisa,"i don't get it, bart. you got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all."
49169,Lisa,what'd you get for me?
51461,Lisa,you're going to take dna from these historical figures and add it to your own?
49946,Lisa,hey!
52276,Lisa,"please, dad."
42855,Lisa,"i'm goin', i'm goin!"
47120,Lisa,i'm sick of this horse slapping and cow taunting! i'm going to my room!
47975,Lisa,"no, we did it, dad."
52354,Lisa,get my homework from mrs. hoover.
41715,Lisa,"but mom, i want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
43862,Lisa,maybe you're getting stronger.
46218,Lisa,shh. it's working. look.
45534,Lisa,are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
42415,Lisa,the very same. i think this tomato could wipe out world hunger.
46601,Lisa,this has been a gracie films pray-sentation!
44940,Lisa,"guys, this is alex."
41912,Lisa,"dad, i think princess belongs in a stable."
42914,Lisa,"not exactly. they pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth."
51217,Lisa,but i saw you praying to mecca!
46073,Lisa,"i dunno, mom. i think they're up to something..."
44956,Lisa,"yeah, it's great. we have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple-bobbing, apple-picking, apple everything."
49105,Lisa,"oh... hi, mr. jarmusch."
43850,Lisa,"in the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. i hope everyone still has theirs."
46988,Lisa,it was so exciting -- i actually got applause for being smart!
52404,Lisa,maybe you could take a class at springfield community college.
47418,Lisa,"that's not true, bart. mom and dad value us equally, and... oh, you're right. 'kay, go ahead."
48271,Lisa,i understand. i'll just read a magazine.
48282,Lisa,ready!
48190,Lisa,bravo! bravo! bravissimo!
46763,Lisa,"dad, make him stop!"
52522,Lisa,"ignore, ignore, ignore... ooh, martin prince is now ""marcia princess?"" no, i've got to find zia."
50390,Lisa,"dad, aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
52467,Lisa,merry christmas from the simpsons!
49158,Lisa,"i need to get out while i still can. thank you, mel."
46637,Lisa,"when i sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video."
47439,Lisa,bart will make your bed for a week.
49596,Lisa,there's crabby...drunky...hungry!
46594,Lisa,he must have dropped this.
48798,Lisa,"yay, dad!"
52161,Lisa,"but mom, we've become the tools of evil."
52472,Lisa,sometimes i wish strangling your kid was still legal.
50189,Lisa,i see what happened. there was no scholarship. they said i could attend if you did all their laundry. i can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge.
50955,Lisa,"dad, i just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
52392,Lisa,this is a rather shameless promotion.
50251,Lisa,"nein auch im winter, wenn es schneit..."
47448,Lisa,"it used to be the ""leaning tower of pizza."""
52499,Lisa,that is so typical of you.
46465,Lisa,"well, i'm looking for a new faith. one that isn't so materialistic."
44941,Lisa,"okay, i'll go get our lunches."
51813,Lisa,i gave it to you!
45816,Lisa,"dad, help!"
50786,Lisa,fifth-graders? ooh-la-la! they get to put their desks in a circle!
42525,Lisa,dad...
50884,Lisa,"dad, please!"
50452,Lisa,"hi, my name is lisa simpson."
46650,Lisa,guys!
51588,Lisa,you don't want to be here.
44729,Lisa,"yeah, while you still can... thanks!"
51770,Lisa,"listen, homer. i just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me."
50066,Lisa,"well, clearly, you're an exception."
43403,Lisa,"well, he did vow revenge. but i can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! he's a celebrit--"
43207,Lisa,aaagh. him again.
51487,Lisa,i've tried to give pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat:
50366,Lisa,"students, teachers, detentionees...prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged!"
41690,Lisa,do you know where i could find him?
48971,Lisa,i can't take it anymore! the stress is killing me! i'm on a freight train to crazytown!
46818,Lisa,i'll take ashley!
45262,Lisa,"until you taped over it, ""the little mermaid."""
50673,Lisa,"mom, i have a crush!"
52111,Lisa,an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
50334,Lisa,"aw, come on, bart, it's fun!"
45728,Lisa,agreed.
49977,Lisa,how shortened?
44219,Lisa,ba-art!
49358,Lisa,i'll go get her!
45034,Lisa,"one, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards."
51435,Lisa,"overreactor dot org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are ""genetically modified organisms,"" whose effect on humans is... unknown!"
44002,Lisa,"milhouse, i've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but i've never felt this way before. i think i have a crush..."
49934,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! ew! ew!
51823,Lisa,eight.
50054,Lisa,"hi, nelson."
42208,Lisa,i'm an ugmo.
45370,Lisa,"yeah, me too."
43285,Lisa,bart!
47780,Lisa,done and done. i'm going to the organic market!
51182,Lisa,mom! bart's twisting facts in an orwellian fashion!
49371,Lisa,how did you find this place?
45441,Lisa,it's breathtaking.
49888,Lisa,if they're anybody's children they're mine!
43375,Lisa,tutoring? the only thing bart's teaching is guerilla combat in shelbyville.
46753,Lisa,"dad, no. we're trying to conserve energy."
44882,Lisa,"dad, grab onto it!"
51954,Lisa,is not.
42288,Lisa,"dad, that's not the real batman."
47431,Lisa,bart! i cracked the code of the pictograph. it says there's a curse on the mound. of course i don't believe in...
51119,Lisa,why am i doing this?
50605,Lisa,they self-reference each other.
50036,Lisa,"what i don't get is, why all the lies?"
51242,Lisa,"well then, i guess i have no choice."
41683,Lisa,ah.
51085,Lisa,sorry.
51515,Lisa,near tears.
50949,Lisa,at the art walk we walked into a gallery and it was just a guy crying -- that was the art!
50252,Lisa,this is the last time i bring these two to bed at the same time.
48943,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna get it!"
46468,Lisa,that would be so great.
44784,Lisa,"but that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. i mean, let's be honest. bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
48957,Lisa,don't you weasel out on me!
51615,Lisa,"so bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
48934,Lisa,the radio lets me contribute directly to npr.
43885,Lisa,"okay... thanks. that's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
41739,Lisa,"she means you should get a job, stupid."
52501,Lisa,"mom, i've gotta know. once and for all, what is the secret? why did you stay with dad so long?"
48244,Lisa,"dad, get your own song."
42945,Lisa,we're going to itchy and scratchy land!
45138,Lisa,"because after all, education is the search for truth..."
42049,Lisa,"wow, thanks sparkle. wait, this isn't you."
42012,Lisa,what about daddy-daughter day?
49645,Lisa,"it's pronounced ""d.n.a.,"" you idiot. and we are not the same -- i am not a murderer, and i never will be!"
52437,Lisa,"oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
52342,Lisa,pony ride!
41990,Lisa,"really, where?"
47817,Lisa,i think he swallowed the remote.
50954,Lisa,"i love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name."
47167,Lisa,"now's your chance, duffman! you can save my dad and look like a hero!"
44991,Lisa,"ah, it's gonna be a long night."
43016,Lisa,"i can't believe it, bart. i'd always thought jessica was so sweet."
49818,Lisa,that's eliza's mother!
51698,Lisa,we're sorry.
42959,Lisa,okay.
48808,Lisa,we should get out of here. come on.
45449,Lisa,now can we do something japanese?
50324,Lisa,is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the blockbuster used to be?
48264,Lisa,"hello, mr. bighorn sheep!"
45128,Lisa,she doesn't know. you're the only one i've told.
48152,Lisa,"yeah, i warned you about that."
44424,Lisa,wave of da future!
46694,Lisa,you're the jerk.
45592,Lisa,really?
45468,Lisa,"hey! i'm not a ""time burglar!"""
44851,Lisa,"look! it's the bus! the bus! come on, you're gonna miss the bus!"
46426,Lisa,"well, the yaqui indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
43200,Lisa,"wow, you can see into the... present."
44896,Lisa,ohmigosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis.
41656,Lisa,"geez, why is lisa so mad at me? i only came to this dump so i could be with her. and, what happened to my big sandwich?"
46030,Lisa,just a cotton-pickin' minute. i've been getting a's since gymboree.
47903,Lisa,we're going downhill... and i can't reach the brakes!
51894,Lisa,the dad has a shirt on.
46476,Lisa,no.
45732,Lisa,"oh, no!"
49243,Lisa,"my only fear is, i always sabotage myself when i'm on the verge of happiness."
41889,Lisa,i had a bad dream. could i sleep in your bed?
48446,Lisa,"yes, i am."
45250,Lisa,"look, they have lincoln's hat!"
42974,Lisa,"i meant your other mortal enemy, sideshow bob."
49043,Lisa,"aw, cheer up, you've still got your talent, and that new song you wrote is gonna be a really big hit."
49229,Lisa,"""eye care!"" ""optician's concern."" oh, thanks for your help, bart! ""bart?"" ""san francisco people mover!"""
45219,Lisa,"dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the sunday paper."
51039,Lisa,scorrre!
44643,Lisa,who wants rations?
44238,Lisa,"please, maggie, please go to sleep!"
45947,Lisa,"that says ""corn,"" bart."
48040,Lisa,everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like i chose buddhism.
50272,Lisa,i'm busy.
47360,Lisa,"ms. naegle, even though i disagree with your principles, i certainly admire your success."
52090,Lisa,"oh, no!"
50235,Lisa,"oh really? well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet santa?"
45989,Lisa,"oh, it's so decomposed! do you think i could join dirt first?"
43681,Lisa,but it's all true!
50935,Lisa,"okay, mom. i think that's far enough."
51008,Lisa,bart? you wanted to show me something?
42845,Lisa,what are you writing here? a play?
50300,Lisa,"now they're aggressive again! i'm sure there's a correlation, but could there be a... causation?"
46479,Lisa,i just came down for a glass of water.
44767,Lisa,"oh, my gosh! today's top story: ""little girl on cloud nine as dream comes true."""
46049,Lisa,"oh, dad. you sold your soul."
47509,Lisa,"must be the pipes. what do you think, bart?"
44738,Lisa,why bother?
52320,Lisa,"dad, we may have saved your soul."
51192,Lisa,bart! why is the dad i always wished for creeping me out?
43190,Lisa,"uh, i wasn't talking about you, dad."
49353,Lisa,my best friend is so cool!
41868,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
44362,Lisa,"oh, grampa, you're not busy are you?"
48177,Lisa,grazie. idioto!
42363,Lisa,must you be forever dialing that phone?!!!
42095,Lisa,she wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition.
42359,Lisa,"yes, principal skinner."
51876,Lisa,yeah!
42889,Lisa,why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
50651,Lisa,sherri? terri? hopscotch? double dutch? ringolivio? anyone?
44958,Lisa,"um, i don't know. the ponies might be startled by the loud music."
48343,Lisa,i love the use of streamers as blood. it robs the violence of its power.
47523,Lisa,"don't worry, they're just getting the plot out of the way so it won't slow down the ."
47730,Lisa,a media circus.
48573,Lisa,"dad, there aren't any places left to sit."
43783,Lisa,"but bart, that'll cost a fortune."
43932,Lisa,"so, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? oh my gosh!"
44788,Lisa,"bart, i really think we should stick--"
49236,Lisa,bald man's basketball league?
42759,Lisa,"he's hungry. here you go, stampy. eat it slow. it has to last for..."
43303,Lisa,"but dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
43796,Lisa,why me? yuk! i smell like a sandwich.
48233,Lisa,bart! willie could have a better life! if only someone showed him how...
43758,Lisa,it's not fair! i'm the best student in school. how come i never heard about this competition?
45763,Lisa,"hey, that's my helicopter!"
48788,Lisa,"one thing i've always wondered: how can fox news be so conservative, when the fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? they don't fit together."
45027,Lisa,what the heck's going on?
45019,Lisa,"move it, poky."
50685,Lisa,we could take this boat.
46882,Lisa,what about books?
51240,Lisa,why bart? i thought we were friends!
47130,Lisa,"look, cookie! there's a dance tonight!"
45095,Lisa,"no, pause, pause!"
52386,Lisa,it seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
41945,Lisa,"no. because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
48023,Lisa,"hey, i won four free movie tickets! and it starts in half an hour!"
44075,Lisa,all right! it's time for abc's tgif lineup!
43164,Lisa,hey! i need that!
45300,Lisa,lousy meat-eating scum.
52514,Lisa,"oh, isn't that a little dangerous?"
44499,Lisa,"my attorney, lionel hutz, calls your attention to municipal code 147-c: ""protection of antiquities and fossils."""
52519,Lisa,butt out.
45574,Lisa,"principal skinner, i thought public schools were required to have access ramps for the disabled."
42191,Lisa,"hey, mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
48119,Lisa,they're tearing down the pier!
48484,Lisa,"bart, skinner's gonna be really mad at you."
50926,Lisa,you don't feel any pain.
45551,Lisa,"hey, there was no accident at the plant. dad just wanted to go bowling!"
51873,Lisa,"what, dad?"
51565,Lisa,what if i just taught you how to whistle?
52418,Lisa,and there weren't any jewish cowboys.
45644,Lisa,"look, they're rusted through."
50391,Lisa,my lick.
46236,Lisa,my teacher said i need cupcakes. cupcakes to learn.
44539,Lisa,hardly. anyone could have written that.
46351,Lisa,we're gonna visit the place where j.c. penney sends their damaged merchandise.
50902,Lisa,what? he didn't fold? but that's insane unless he has...
42762,Lisa,"he can't just eat peanuts, dad. he needs plants to live."
51028,Lisa,"guys, look!"
44381,Lisa,"i can't, they're stuck."
42388,Lisa,what if he wants to hold hands?
43107,Lisa,"ow! cut it out, bart."
44015,Lisa,"it's okay, i invited him over. nelson's my new... friend."
49468,Lisa,tell me all you know about the gem.
44502,Lisa,"principal skinner, remember how i didn't sue when i found that scorpion in my applesauce? well, i'm calling in a favor."
41973,Lisa,"i don't know, the dolphins."
44245,Lisa,"dad, i'm not on drugs. i was just trying--"
47299,Lisa,"mom, you said macbeth!"
52505,Lisa,"no, that's what happened in your false memories."
43827,Lisa,"you know, apu, in a way, all americans are immigrants -- except native americans."
52481,Lisa,he took the boys out.
47261,Lisa,"boy, this key opens everything."
49392,Lisa,homer simpson...
51479,Lisa,"this one's nibbling a sunflower seed! look at that hair -- oh, i just wanna comb it forever! have you seen a pinker nose? i have now!"
51950,Lisa,"i'm just wondering, what's the point? would it make any difference at all if i never existed? how can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?"
52079,Lisa,"bart, there's one left and it's mine!"
48600,Lisa,"milhouse, don't you see... you're addicted to revenge."
43527,Lisa,"good-bye, bart!"
50745,Lisa,two diplomats' sons are in love with me. who will i choose: ghana or portugal?
45799,Lisa,what about me?
44066,Lisa,"wait. listen, everybody!"
45400,Lisa,wow! i'm so honored you wanted me.
49626,Lisa,thanks... but i'll pass.
42562,Lisa,i heard about this. this is the one where scratchy finally gets itchy.
52171,Lisa,the pennyloafer!
46233,Lisa,a gift certificate from j.c. penney?
46595,Lisa,but how? branson is a thousand miles away and we've got no car.
45851,Lisa,"yeah, well, no offense, but maybe i need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
46949,Lisa,i'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
48658,Lisa,pong!
42737,Lisa,"dad, did you hear something?"
49640,Lisa,bart?!
45768,Lisa,i can't relax! being president is hard work. maybe you should try doing something with your life.
52377,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna learn it now. don't spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature. have some fun, frolic with him. go get it, boy!"
51292,Lisa,"'cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do / one is the loneliest number, worse than two... and one-- you know, i really think i've made the point."
51884,Lisa,"hey bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!"
42345,Lisa,look! it's the seven duffs!
43806,Lisa,you already put him in a home.
43314,Lisa,bleeding gums murphy!
46020,Lisa,he cut off his favorite dread!
50852,Lisa,"um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog."
49994,Lisa,quiet! it's time for the noblest nobel prize of all: the peace prize.
50860,Lisa,and i have to ask... has anyone seen the cat?
45968,Lisa,"i'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering."
51614,Lisa,"bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did."
50051,Lisa,"well, whoever your mysterious donor is, he, or she, really wants you to succeed."
46547,Lisa,mmmmm.
49832,Lisa,but i need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to colonel burns!
44145,Lisa,"wow! an actual robot from the movie ""clank! clank! you're dead!"""
43177,Lisa,"you're certainly in a good mood tonight, dad."
45958,Lisa,what's going on here?
52047,Lisa,i'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
44082,Lisa,you want an alien? this is your alien!
45203,Lisa,"but it clearly says ""feet included."" they have to be here."
47648,Lisa,"i'm sorry mr. burns, but my paper's not for sale."
46914,Lisa,"is that miles davis' ""birth of the cool?"""
41948,Lisa,is anything wrong?
47943,Lisa,"ooh, dalai lamanade!"
51551,Lisa,"um, can i just have a slice?"
52180,Lisa,"i know. it's times like this that i'm thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do. bart, i think i can help you."
41880,Lisa,"dad, that's monaco."
49118,Lisa,professor.
43331,Lisa,bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
47968,Lisa,how did you write a song so quickly?
51627,Lisa,"i've been listening, and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes. mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him?"
43943,Lisa,"bart, noooo!"
42403,Lisa,"dear, dear george washington. can this liberty you dream of be worth all this bloodshed?"
49686,Lisa,they didn't blind anyone -- i have proof!
41792,Lisa,why? what's wrong with it?
48734,Lisa,he is stealing!
47289,Lisa,"bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!"
47860,Lisa,"mom, i don't mean to be mean. but every time i think about forgiving him, i remember all the bad things he's done to me."
51814,Lisa,"we couldn't write a song. we're one-hit wonders! but, is that such a crime? look at j.d. salinger."
46331,Lisa,and i've got a rally for take back the afternoon.
49103,Lisa,"guys, guys! look, it's a documentary -- nobody outside of this festival is ever gonna hear about it."
47854,Lisa,you don't even care how upset i am! but this time you have gone too far.
48078,Lisa,"mom, i think there's a danger this time they might lose the ponderosa!"
48702,Lisa,"great. the one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life."
42061,Lisa,"""okay, okay... i cannot see you for the next five years, for i will be farming the ocean floor."""
48352,Lisa,"he forgot the volume of the carrot nose -- one-third base times height! oh math, i have missed you!"
50789,Lisa,give that back!
48210,Lisa,'cause christmas eve is here!
46874,Lisa,why don't we stay at a youth hostel?
42781,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet."
51633,Lisa,"these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. one of them, however, has the broccoli blended in."
49875,Lisa,jews don't believe in hell.
46522,Lisa,"here, have one of my fudge-stuffed toaster pies."
49555,Lisa,"no, there's a middle ground."
49215,Lisa,i guess.
43267,Lisa,"if it wasn't you, then who was it?"
51666,Lisa,this is clearly a fracking site. how are they keeping people away?
48250,Lisa,now you have a friend.
51699,Lisa,"excuse me, but buzzard's roost is a converted parking lot."
44315,Lisa,no! it's evil! please stop recycling!
46593,Lisa,"hey, i've earned their trust."
46408,Lisa,"and we should all be thankful to michael, peter and mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
42758,Lisa,you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
51185,Lisa,three kids with no money but plenty of love!
49684,Lisa,they're not evil! they believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like i belonged.
43498,Lisa,that's why i ran away from home.
45184,Lisa,great. this is all gold.
47736,Lisa,harper's magazine! i have a picture of lewis lapham on my binder.
48612,Lisa,"today the hitachees have dwindled to a handful, and our detailed genealogical records were cruelly destroyed by the white man. so, any attempts to research my tribe would be the ultimate insult."
47984,Lisa,daddy told me to be brave
42264,Lisa,"dad, i agree that bart should be punished, but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
45842,Lisa,"oh, he'll never dance with her. she'll have to settle for some mexican milhouse."
42479,Lisa,bart! our cartoon's on tv!
44341,Lisa,hi.
45406,Lisa,"oh dad, i just spent the day with the most wonderful people."
52058,Lisa,we'd kill ourselves!
43065,Lisa,ashley grant! you gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
47796,Lisa,that show's gone off the air.
47041,Lisa,no! connect!
50802,Lisa,"well, it worked once."
43722,Lisa,"what happened, dad?"
52506,Lisa,there is no cure for zombie-ism.
45213,Lisa,max power??
50640,Lisa,"so, since i had no friends, i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. did we become friends? no."
41773,Lisa,"oh! this is the best present i ever got. thank you, bart. thank you michael."
44646,Lisa,"milhouse, did you steal the food?"
51009,Lisa,wait a minute. didn't bart and i both watch this thing when we were little?
51918,Lisa,you're welcome.
44206,Lisa,uch! the idea that you would compare yourself to mahatma gandhi...
48854,Lisa,"milhouse, that was the bravest thing i've ever seen."
42604,Lisa,"lu, lu, lu / lu lu lu lu lu / lu lu lu lu lu lu lu"
43167,Lisa,"i know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
41915,Lisa,you're so beautiful.
46843,Lisa,i don't think i've done anything else.
42428,Lisa,hampster two... bart zero...
43610,Lisa,"i admit i haven't known mom as long as you have, but i know when she's really upset. her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. it absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
42074,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. i've got it all figured out. i'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the french. i'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but i do plan to have several torrid love affairs. and i may or may not die young, i haven't decided."
49189,Lisa,mom! bart's flicking boogers on me!
47181,Lisa,i see you braves received our smoke signal.
42881,Lisa,"i need help, mom. there's another girl at school who's smarter, younger, and a better sax player than me. oh i feel so average."
42317,Lisa,daaad!
46793,Lisa,another proud moment for the simpsons.
49474,Lisa,"look -- there's writing on the ""r!"""
48419,Lisa,"mr. flanders, wait!"
48191,Lisa,whoopsie. i'll just get it out with more wine.
46656,Lisa,we're never gonna find him.
49780,Lisa,nothing's going on. just sharing my music with the good people of vancouver.
43300,Lisa,"horrible news, mom!"
49680,Lisa,"hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
43330,Lisa,what happened to mr. murphy?
50728,Lisa,"dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function."
49795,Lisa,...dad's idea pad...
41864,Lisa,i didn't know that.
47892,Lisa,oh boy!
49350,Lisa,i'd love to!
52289,Lisa,why?
42401,Lisa,"ralph, i'm sorry i..."
51157,Lisa,"don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math."
45205,Lisa,"mom, this was made in 1967. they're probably out of business."
52195,Lisa,"let's try another one: if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?"
44097,Lisa,look! what's that?!!
50034,Lisa,tomatoes? what kind of artists are you?
42957,Lisa,oh yeah. they weren't very funny.
45047,Lisa,whoaaa!
46086,Lisa,"no, bart. for all we know, hundreds of rescue workers are digging us out right now."
45407,Lisa,"well, for the first time in my life i feel that someone understands..."
49318,Lisa,you don't?
51144,Lisa,mom's deleting old tv shows off the dvr.
48091,Lisa,but wait. how am i supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
45100,Lisa,"ah, i don't know. i mean, i could risk it, but..."
48743,Lisa,dad!
45218,Lisa,"ohhh, it sounds so real!"
42551,Lisa,sideshow bob!
48661,Lisa,"hey, mr. flanders, what'd you get?"
42472,Lisa,no way.
50712,Lisa,"yo, mysterious pranksters, it's time for dinner."
45991,Lisa,"you're welcome to come, too."
51717,Lisa,"wow, he's right."
41657,Lisa,these girls are brilliant! i finally found kids i can relate to.
45130,Lisa,but we can't accept that money. it's tainted.
50016,Lisa,"friday evening we performed ""angels in america: a gay fantasia on national themes."" part one: millennium approaches..."
48018,Lisa,we've got school tomorrow.
45320,Lisa,i know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.
42558,Lisa,no.
48820,Lisa,a little bit louder now!
51600,Lisa,"our lord, buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear."
48134,Lisa,i'm not a baby! a baby is zero to two.
42695,Lisa,what'd ya bring? what'd ya bring?
42834,Lisa,dad...
43181,Lisa,i didn't turn it on. i thought you turned it on.
46552,Lisa,"""springfield preparatory school?!"" dad, you told me there were no private schools in springfield!"
49538,Lisa,cinco.
47308,Lisa,i picked mom a bouquet of erigeron
50586,Lisa,genius.
49501,Lisa,"don't you mean ""pint""?"
48062,Lisa,"i believe in science and reality, not ghosts and monsters!"
46901,Lisa,"hey, i could really use one of those."
47248,Lisa,"well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason i can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
47652,Lisa,i think it distracts people from more important social issues.
44110,Lisa,"if maggie's fussy, don't avoid her."
47794,Lisa,"""the plywood pelican was larger than a football field. it weighs more than the state of new hampshire. it was only flown once, by its creator, mr. c. montgomery burns."""
43271,Lisa,"can we keep santa's girlfriend, mom?"
52198,Lisa,the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. all you have to do is hit the ball here.
44744,Lisa,"oh dad, i've never been happier to be your daughter."
50760,Lisa,that's nelson!
47149,Lisa,that's not mom!
44048,Lisa,i was foolish to think i'd actually changed you. maybe i was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
41671,Lisa,"oh my god, you've been challenged! well lisa, let's see how you respond."
51406,Lisa,the people of sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
42634,Lisa,"dad, i'm not gonna fall for that."
43942,Lisa,"listen, i can take care of everything. all you have to do is unshrink me."
48882,Lisa,"and ""wes doobner's world famous family style rib huts"" is actually an anagram!"
46415,Lisa,"some people enjoy being alone, mom."
47737,Lisa,"chloe, you've lived so many fascinating places."
51850,Lisa,like shine-ola!
51253,Lisa,"hello, children. i hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code."
49166,Lisa,toora loora lie
46256,Lisa,the left! go to the left!
48668,Lisa,"nelson, you came to our side in our hour of need."
43309,Lisa,"well, my teacher's a nightmare. three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener."
49901,Lisa,"no... i am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy."
42625,Lisa,"dad, sit down."
43619,Lisa,"no, grampa, don't!"
44155,Lisa,"this is about as tolerant as dad gets, so you should be flattered."
49388,Lisa,so you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
47361,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna lose. we have to do something."
46337,Lisa,it's my room!
46282,Lisa,i knew that. just testing.
45815,Lisa,ow!
47983,Lisa,my kitty died on christmas eve
45283,Lisa,"you know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. and just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!"
51228,Lisa,the fat in the hat!
47485,Lisa,two cents...
50696,Lisa,i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
46266,Lisa,"well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know that dr. bushwell is their best friend."
43760,Lisa,i'm learning about owls.
47540,Lisa,"dad, i still have a couple-a questions about this. mom never drives drunk, and the crash was in your car. also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach..."
51449,Lisa,let's splice some d.n.a.!
46925,Lisa,"blackening our hair was a great idea, dad. i look just like a powerpuff girl."
52016,Lisa,"yeah, what'd you get?"
44068,Lisa,"mr. flanders, with all due respect, bart didn't do anything."
42857,Lisa,it's my room and i can do what i want.
48459,Lisa,here's the only thing i've been on the cover of.
43530,Lisa,"sorry, dad. this is our spot."
51400,Lisa,they're gonna take dad! we gotta do something!
48433,Lisa,it's delicious!
45179,Lisa,"hey, there is one thing we could do."
51513,Lisa,everyone does that.
50186,Lisa,"that school is so great! teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. is mom gonna come up and say goodnight?"
45730,Lisa,dad?
42924,Lisa,glad you liked it.
52067,Lisa,you do? why?
51335,Lisa,i'm fine with rough.
48440,Lisa,it's so great that michael's doing what he loves.
49740,Lisa,"so grampa, you really saved dad's life?"
48627,Lisa,i made it all up! there is no hitachee tribe! i took the name from my microwave! but surely you can forgive a little girl who--
45805,Lisa,and it's still got a roll of film in it.
49188,Lisa,where's maggie?
47249,Lisa,"make it snappy, milhouse. i've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge."
49557,Lisa,"look at this: springfield elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."
43059,Lisa,hi mom! over here! mom!
45137,Lisa,"thank you. i know this giant check is very important to everyone here. but, what's even more important is the truth."
45977,Lisa,"oh, you're so heroic."
50398,Lisa,how many truffles did you get?
42396,Lisa,"no, thanks."
49047,Lisa,bart... you do know what happens next.
44540,Lisa,"will you leave me alone? it's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""judgment day""."
43856,Lisa,friends? hah! these are my only friends...
48404,Lisa,this is slander! darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time!
50627,Lisa,"well, i'll just buy one of these and build something different."
41821,Lisa,"dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?"
52287,Lisa,john shaft.
47024,Lisa,you mean you're all still proud of me?
44426,Lisa,i'm lisa!
45301,Lisa,not you.
42016,Lisa,"don't tell me what to do, sonny. i've been gambling since i was eight. and i've been hockin' jewelry since i was twelve. now give me some chips!"
50283,Lisa,"you can't listen to those women, mom. change threatens them. they didn't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color."
48160,Lisa,huh?
47019,Lisa,"dad, you do care!"
51345,Lisa,"okay, i'm a liberal. and sometimes that's a dirty word."
44099,Lisa,no.
44541,Lisa,"nothing is going to happen, mom. i hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
43599,Lisa,"do i understand you correctly, bartron? do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?"
47490,Lisa,i miss them all so much.
44786,Lisa,"between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb."
45693,Lisa,why are we cleaning this room? i don't think we were even in here.
48718,Lisa,"mom, put your glasses on."
46523,Lisa,mmm...
49445,Lisa,hello. i'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. may i join your order?
47532,Lisa,we come from the real world.
44379,Lisa,"oh, if only i were in springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. oh, god, i'm delirious!"
41598,Lisa,"it's so great that yale has finally forbidden men from taking science. now let's see, should i major in femistry or galgebra?"
44198,Lisa,even babies know how to open and close their mouths. you need a bib.
43582,Lisa,"bart, no!"
52059,Lisa,the cannon. the cannon. the cannon. the cannon.
43536,Lisa,dad--
41787,Lisa,"thanks for driving me to the contest, dad."
46085,Lisa,this couldn't have less to do with christmas! and i think that's a stagehand.
44753,Lisa,ralph! ralph! ralph! ralph!
46790,Lisa,there's no light rail in springfield.
44879,Lisa,"hang on, dad!"
50645,Lisa,hit refresh.
42110,Lisa,poor santa's little helper. i'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
51956,Lisa,is not.
49432,Lisa,"you want a cookie, dad?"
44338,Lisa,"look, it's reverend lovejoy!"
51320,Lisa,what are you trying to say?
51969,Lisa,"""i got a bratty brother / he bugs me every day / and this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / my dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / i'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."""
50702,Lisa,"well, i did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
50392,Lisa,my lick.
45436,Lisa,i don't think there's enough here for a vacation.
42850,Lisa,"thanks, nelson."
49679,Lisa,i'm thinking of joining.
44763,Lisa,that was last year's taxes! you have to pay again this year!
51581,Lisa,"at the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes, yes, yes!"
47695,Lisa,cheating!
52203,Lisa,nirvana.
47154,Lisa,"here's a role model for you, boy: rin tin tin. he was brave on and off the screen. he was the first openly gay dog in hollywood."
48284,Lisa,i wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home.
49345,Lisa,"hey mom, can juliet sleep over?"
51519,Lisa,...and isn't in any history books...
49123,Lisa,"uh, mom? we've got a code four."
49600,Lisa,"little did they know, their lives are about to be changed forever by a wicked queen."
51564,Lisa,"well, that's a relief."
49988,Lisa,i can see that down deep is a decent man.
41621,Lisa,we were just playing.
43947,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i just find that very cute."
50608,Lisa,looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.
51468,Lisa,"dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat grampa?"
45002,Lisa,"homer simpson, welcome to your life!"
46212,Lisa,"not talking, eh willie? just listen, then. i think i figured out what sets off that big ape francine... willie? willie?"
43621,Lisa,who are they?
42350,Lisa,they're all around me. no way out. no way out i tell you!
47307,Lisa,"yes, bart. an elephant's butt."
51941,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
50718,Lisa,we're actually entering dad's dreams?
44103,Lisa,me too.
46819,Lisa,ow! you are such an immature-- punch buggy white!
42976,Lisa,"this time, he's the lesser of two evils."
50981,Lisa,"spinach farm, huh? that's right, you talk in your sleep."
45873,Lisa,"oh, thanks, dad."
43203,Lisa,that's bad?
44017,Lisa,"oh, please. milhouse likes vaseline on toast."
44240,Lisa,hi. how are you?
50174,Lisa,cloisters academy?! that bus could pick me up any day of the week!
49588,Lisa,"people, i'm not who you think i am. i'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends. yes, i lied to you, but you only liked me because of a lie. so if you think about it--"
47971,Lisa,there's tires / on fire / a guy named apu
47139,Lisa,... so i sent luke's sister down the wrong trail and... hey! where'd all this water come from? there used to be a trail here! and there used to be a beaver dam there.
48630,Lisa,"oh fah-ther, my pony buttercup can jump ever so high-- hoo-boy, it's mr. burns."
51579,Lisa,"yeah, it kind of was. but i won't push it, i promise. see ya!"
47208,Lisa,have you stopped to think about who you're hurting with this rampage?
47666,Lisa,the homer times?
52302,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
49276,Lisa,um... i'm also returning this kitten calendar.
43721,Lisa,simpson! i need a ride to the library.
45357,Lisa,"now we're pulling into port. and who's waiting for us at the dock? why, it's all your childhood dogs! i see petey and blackie and schnoodle and..."
46655,Lisa,"excuse me, we're looking for this little boy."
46142,Lisa,i can't believe krusty's retiring. this is tragic!
51777,Lisa,dad no! elon musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!
49181,Lisa,i know! it's a complete violation of your rights. not to mention--
45820,Lisa,"well, at least we won the bike."
44890,Lisa,see the isis exhibit. but the museum's closed.
44530,Lisa,"you? but... you're an intelligent person, mom."
43504,Lisa,"i guess i have been pretty hard on a lot of people. especially my dad. thanks, you guys."
52438,Lisa,when?
42009,Lisa,"the happiest day of my life was three sundays ago. i was sitting on my daddy's knee when the saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
46669,Lisa,who's mark spitz?
42343,Lisa,there it is!
45931,Lisa,"well, at least stop basting yourself!"
46924,Lisa,"i was framed! you believe me, don't you dad?"
49823,Lisa,so they did the right thing -- my quest is fulfilled! our family has heroes!
42461,Lisa,you were in that coma for seven weeks.
45009,Lisa,fluorescent...
44190,Lisa,"you look so glamorous, mom! oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!"
45667,Lisa,"no, he isn't. i don't know where he is."
45621,Lisa,eep.
44732,Lisa,hello. my name is lisa simpson.
52362,Lisa,ew.
44993,Lisa,"all right, all right. d.m.y."
47217,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, sorry!"
46168,Lisa,but you made it out of ham cubes.
41834,Lisa,it's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
45529,Lisa,"the national weather service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling."
41627,Lisa,"declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--"
43861,Lisa,"a microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was i thinking?"
47038,Lisa,i've been saying it for three weeks! but every time i open my mouth...
44460,Lisa,dad! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. it has no meaning today.
42910,Lisa,what?
44632,Lisa,"aw, those poor badgers are soaked."
44864,Lisa,"okay, the museum's got to be north of here. now which way is north...?"
47322,Lisa,zoot suit... astronaut outfit... southern belle... renaissance dandy... country-western octopus...
46412,Lisa,"neither, thank you."
43280,Lisa,let's go find your babies!
43338,Lisa,"uh, maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
45639,Lisa,here you go.
52253,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart. but if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention i'd receive, i'd miss you."
43680,Lisa,"aw, thanks, dad."
52401,Lisa,"mom, these are really good. while i know first-hand how fragile young talent is, i'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed."
47435,Lisa,"well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
41695,Lisa,"oh, i mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
43293,Lisa,but they're ours! you stole them from us!
48028,Lisa,"well, at least your name's on the bowl."
42483,Lisa,"wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons."
46663,Lisa,it smells like the art teacher's office.
45840,Lisa,"dad, i've got maggie."
49429,Lisa,"for he's a fabulous flanders, which nobody can deny!"
51294,Lisa,"well, at least i'm getting some attention."
52390,Lisa,"i don't deserve it, grampa. no one here does. the people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. they're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony."
50441,Lisa,"no problem, just some cobwebs."
51433,Lisa,won't those vegetables go bad?
42864,Lisa,"hi, allison? i'm lisa simpson. oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level."
42373,Lisa,glad you liked it.
49126,Lisa,"grandma, i accept your gift."
47710,Lisa,noooooo!
49147,Lisa,"i don't know, i guess he forgot, but people seemed to like me last week."
48816,Lisa,shout!
44695,Lisa,"me, too."
49948,Lisa,"well, i am one: flattered and two: intrigued. lisa simpson."
50972,Lisa,"guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one? i for one am glad we're stuck with civilization and i think we will be for a long, long time."
42505,Lisa,"mrs. glick, who killed all those rats in your basement?"
50607,Lisa,we're not with him.
50579,Lisa,"and the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
43312,Lisa,"how're you feelin', big brother?"
45891,Lisa,"awww. / oh, no."
49616,Lisa,"hey bart, did you know that's a haiku?"
46626,Lisa,"what happened, dad? they didn't really burn her, did they?"
42963,Lisa,just keep taking pictures.
48125,Lisa,"fine, there's a daddy claus."
48490,Lisa,"bart, did your mystical jewish monster beat up those bullies?"
43728,Lisa,we've got to get seats for the itchy and scratchy parade.
42006,Lisa,the broken neck blues.
44263,Lisa,"oh, foreign language institute. oh, my german verb wheel!"
49499,Lisa,"well, ireland is at the forefront of europe's tech boom."
45850,Lisa,"what am i doing wrong, little vicki?"
52269,Lisa,"thursday -- meatloaf night. as it was, is now, and ever shall be."
47717,Lisa,"now, i can't have toothpaste tonight."
41788,Lisa,"when america was born on that hot july day in 1776, the trees in springfield forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. and as they were nourished by mother earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. thank you."
44894,Lisa,now i know how sir dudley winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the temple of isis.
50376,Lisa,"raymondo, i am so sorry. i got rolled by a pro! do you know what it's like to be the kind of girl that boys never talk to and then suddenly a boy talks to you--"
43072,Lisa,now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
44668,Lisa,"no, dad, it's to fight soil erosion."
42032,Lisa,"come on, dad!"
45504,Lisa,i still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
51647,Lisa,one florence nightingale in a box and make it snappy!
50010,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
43636,Lisa,"yeah, you look great! you can do anything with that sewing machine."
50328,Lisa,"so, how was your first day of school?"
48169,Lisa,my efforts!
45363,Lisa,they don't even seem to care that it's medication time.
51250,Lisa,what i'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
41854,Lisa,why don't we let our guest do it?
50675,Lisa,the boy i like is hemingway-esque!
44800,Lisa,"what does that even mean? mom might not see through you, but i do. you don't care about any of these people."
46499,Lisa,"bart, you're cheating!"
50694,Lisa,i pick up books like you pick up beers!
51558,Lisa,i'd love that. see you tonight!
43383,Lisa,"""marge, bart, lisa, and maggie."" dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
42003,Lisa,"c'mon, dad. it doesn't take a genius to realize that houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
48249,Lisa,hm... maybe there's room on my sports wall.
51835,Lisa,ooh.
44466,Lisa,and so is the bible!
47917,Lisa,snowball does tricks?
42155,Lisa,peek-a-boo!
45700,Lisa,anybody got a building permit? 'cause we nailed it!
46868,Lisa,it's a hockey game!
47776,Lisa,"if you're feeling depressed, do what i do and write something. a novel, a play..."
52235,Lisa,"was it because you hate me, or because you're bad?"
45878,Lisa,"oh, i love you guys."
49608,Lisa,i thought you were studying the lincoln-douglas debates?
43587,Lisa,"high-toned voice. bart, that's it. i know where sideshow bob is hiding."
42629,Lisa,"oh, bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
46258,Lisa,are we insane yet? are we insane yet? are we insane yet?
44411,Lisa,you'll practice me? what does that mean? is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
44885,Lisa,"i should have known i wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but i really wanted to see that exhibit. i'll never take another stupid risk like that again!"
47696,Lisa,"mom, if i don't have you to look up to, i don't have anyone."
50097,Lisa,"hey, dad."
47078,Lisa,does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
51213,Lisa,dad!
44346,Lisa,"it's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" i just don't feel challenged."
42221,Lisa,there's no way i can beat this girl. she's the jack nicklaus of the pageant circuit.
42953,Lisa,ow!
43206,Lisa,that man is instantly the most annoying person i've ever met. a soy-based snack will calm me down.
44863,Lisa,i should've got off in crackton.
48495,Lisa,"just write a scroll, asking him to stop."
43204,Lisa,guess so.
44951,Lisa,"but, dad..."
48434,Lisa,"no, it's great! except for the bee!"
50997,Lisa,i'm exactly the kind of kid he's pretending to be.
51181,Lisa,dad! do we have to ride like this?
46544,Lisa,she's not on drugs. she couldn't sleep because of dad's chronic snoring.
47727,Lisa,i'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
47114,Lisa,"hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas...non-christian friend..."
47615,Lisa,"i'm as patriotic as the next person, but changing the traffic lights to red, white and blue just seems dangerous."
47317,Lisa,what is that?!
49929,Lisa,oh no.
45102,Lisa,but i-i might infect the other kids!
45581,Lisa,they're spying on us. why would they do that?
52197,Lisa,it is time.
42289,Lisa,"dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? check it out."
50278,Lisa,"i love it. i know i use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
47813,Lisa,wait a second - i've read that you speak excellent english.
52319,Lisa,"thanks, mom. it doesn't seem to be going very well."
46555,Lisa,"you know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
42874,Lisa,why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
52327,Lisa,is too.
44774,Lisa,"come on, quit foolin' around, you guys."
42798,Lisa,you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
49440,Lisa,"we have totality, people!"
51540,Lisa,don't put more in there!
41926,Lisa,"dad, i understand the sacrifice you've made for me. that's why i gave up the pony."
41943,Lisa,"well, it's a country in europe --"
51635,Lisa,"mom, it's trash talk. you know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies."
49728,Lisa,larry!
45484,Lisa,"well, we went to paté labelle last week. how 'bout that?"
42826,Lisa,"look, i brought you some nice pudding."
50134,Lisa,"well, he is cute. but i'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
44916,Lisa,but it's all trash.
41699,Lisa,"i, i understand. mr. bergstrom, i'm going to miss you."
43697,Lisa,"there is one way: get the silver tongue. if jebediah's who i say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
44930,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll help her out. i remember how hard it was to be an outsider. always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like..."
49314,Lisa,"ooh, another grobanite!"
51554,Lisa,"no, i'm just, i... maybe you just haven't found the right food. huh? how 'bout ice cream?"
44683,Lisa,i'll get it in a second. don't worry.
48763,Lisa,"we have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts. martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid."
42392,Lisa,"well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me."
43877,Lisa,hi.
43630,Lisa,"all these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. it just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses i'm sorry. i gotta go!"
51504,Lisa,you're a... forger?
43183,Lisa,that spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. i wonder who he is.
47516,Lisa,yay!
51234,Lisa,"actually, there's a little more."
48331,Lisa,and i will make thee a hat from construction paper!
48362,Lisa,"yeah, i guess i do."
51096,Lisa,the trial's not over and gravy is dead animal juice.
49687,Lisa,when my father was attending the moonshine competition last saturday...
43724,Lisa,"don't worry, dad. mr. smithers is a resilient man. i'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants."
50353,Lisa,i'm not exactly flattered by that.
45752,Lisa,"as you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from president trump. how bad is it, secretary van houten?"
45860,Lisa,curtain puller?!
49041,Lisa,what lap?
43868,Lisa,"mom, come here. bring money."
52007,Lisa,"hey bart, where you going?"
44120,Lisa,but we're not sleepy.
47732,Lisa,the juice is still on the loose.
45097,Lisa,"no, you live in a different house."
49295,Lisa,save yourselves!
51572,Lisa,can i make an observation?
45293,Lisa,your snoring is disturbing the dancers.
44228,Lisa,"no! as your babysitter, i order you to stop hitting your head on the wall!"
46058,Lisa,"i'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. maybe you should quit while you're ahead."
48487,Lisa,i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world.
45394,Lisa,"oh, absolutely! well, you know, anything by jane austen..."
48344,Lisa,"yeah, one for boys and one for girls."
50360,Lisa,"oh, what's wrong?"
42704,Lisa,"come on, stacy. i've waited my whole life to hear you speak. don't you have anything relevant to say?"
47394,Lisa,"""captain mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes. 'mmm, blowholes,' he drooled."" sounds like dad to me."
43020,Lisa,"bart, be strong. you don't need that little hell cat."
52281,Lisa,"please, dad...please"
43212,Lisa,finished this page?
51657,Lisa,this house is haunted!
44042,Lisa,meet me at the back door!
52113,Lisa,dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
43007,Lisa,are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today?
43194,Lisa,"mr. gumbel, this is a girl scout meeting."
44745,Lisa,dearest log: i am me again! and i feel like there's nothing i can't do...except this stupid brain teas...
42303,Lisa,when are we going to get to my first word?
48623,Lisa,"slow down! you're too close to that car! your hands should be at ten and two, not three and nothing!"
51152,Lisa,"you're a hologram, aren't you?"
46978,Lisa,"skewed tour? the traveling festival of rock 'n' roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?"
42075,Lisa,can you tell me if i have what it takes to be a blues musician?
47033,Lisa,eww! i got bart's veal!
44396,Lisa,"actually, i think we're in chinatown now."
51767,Lisa,so... where is he gonna sleep?
44508,Lisa,"look, there's more. what the heck is this thing?"
47398,Lisa,what if they parody it on mad tv?
45625,Lisa,have you been in here all day?
52337,Lisa,marco!
49907,Lisa,"bart, please! i'm trying to hear dr. house's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!"
43879,Lisa,thanks. umm... you guys skate?
45119,Lisa,daddd...
50641,Lisa,"as the ceo of springface, i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
45705,Lisa,you mean state un-fair.
48568,Lisa,"oh, man. now he's even mooching our lunches."
45926,Lisa,i wonder where goldilocks was.
45242,Lisa,the book fair?
48327,Lisa,"i know one, about the most important sea voyage in american history. the journey of the mayflower."
46853,Lisa,"dad, what is that?"
47597,Lisa,"now up, the case of simpson v. simpson."
51214,Lisa,girl scout cookies get you in anywhere.
46223,Lisa,"for as long as there have been smart people, there have been bullies to prey on them. from galileo...to sir isaac newton...and even in the animal kingdom..."
49059,Lisa,"wow, you did learn a lot at 4-h."
42466,Lisa,"yeah, sort of."
50831,Lisa,oh brother. let's dance.
42530,Lisa,krusty! what have you done to yourself?
47213,Lisa,what the...?!
45923,Lisa,everything in this forest is from a fairy tale! and this book can keep us one step ahead!
44323,Lisa,it's the longest possible time before more church.
46349,Lisa,don't forget apple sauce.
52405,Lisa,"my mother would like to enroll in ""painting from life, 2-b""."
52134,Lisa,"look, i know that to you we simpsons are a lower order of life. we face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. we throw ourselves on your mercy. please return us to..."
47735,Lisa,"chloe, i really admire how you got out of springfield and became such a success."
49010,Lisa,"look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. but they're for losers!"
52037,Lisa,"yeah. eat it, bart."
45185,Lisa,"hey, look what i found. grampa's old radio. oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?"
50043,Lisa,"are you sure about that, grampa?"
47758,Lisa,"you're so smart, chloe!"
48224,Lisa,"oh no, bart blamed this on the dog! i didn't pet him for weeks! oh, i'm sorry i doubted you, boy."
48613,Lisa,oh... great! i'd... love to.
52041,Lisa,dad!
42719,Lisa,thanks.
45437,Lisa,"no, no, we're going to paris. i can feel it."
49867,Lisa,"""don't stop achieving just yet, lisa. you are not alone -- flotus-one."" ""flotus-one?"" who could that be?"
50993,Lisa,another surfer?
45922,Lisa,no! that bridge has a troll under it!
48466,Lisa,i never wanted that to happen!
41863,Lisa,"no, no. we're not converting, we just want to find a rabbi krustofsky."
50354,Lisa,hm.
50999,Lisa,there is nothing like your biological family.
47826,Lisa,"mr. alcatraaaz, my name is lisa simpson, and this is principal skinner."
47841,Lisa,you make those same stupid jokes every field trip!
47698,Lisa,i guess dad has to be my hero now.
49235,Lisa,i... i made them into a crossword.
50646,Lisa,i have a thousand friends! and only eight of them are milhouse.
46072,Lisa,how'd you do your act? you left your magic kit here.
42572,Lisa,i think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
45737,Lisa,"those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. and if bart gets a wowwipop, i want a wowwipop."
45990,Lisa,"oh, thank you, thank you!"
44146,Lisa,ech! think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
48720,Lisa,can't we?
44296,Lisa,"no, i'm not!"
45757,Lisa,what are you doing here?
44135,Lisa,me! / i would! /
49250,Lisa,and there's something different about him.
46200,Lisa,i just don't understand francine's motivation.
41961,Lisa,"quit it, dad!"
47384,Lisa,"i'm keeping you! you're snowball five, but to save money on a new dish, we'll just call you snowball two and pretend this whole thing never happened."
51334,Lisa,"bart, i need you to help me win the election."
50943,Lisa,"dad, pay attention to your children!"
46192,Lisa,how about jazz? do you like jazz?
47529,Lisa,"no, he lives at the ""cosmic wars ranch"" in northern california."
48493,Lisa,do you feel bad about what you did?
51691,Lisa,i can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.
52231,Lisa,bart...?! where are you?
44808,Lisa,"eww. thank you, milhouse. now it's time for today's special live edition of bart's people."
48008,Lisa,yay!
42918,Lisa,"yes, i do. and just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
52291,Lisa,why are we waiting for dad?
43693,Lisa,he wouldn't let me put it up.
51792,Lisa,"what's wrong, dad?"
45640,Lisa,slivered almonds for the green beans! i'll be right back.
51935,Lisa,"bart, you can't go on like this."
50654,Lisa,"as i was saying, springface was used in ways i never expected."
47874,Lisa,gimme that torch.
49478,Lisa,"no, that's not it! a secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
42086,Lisa,nothin'.
42104,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
45904,Lisa,"it was such an honor to be on the walk of fame. i mean, there we were with hollywood royalty, like milton berle and nelson mandela."
46673,Lisa,wait! what about maggie's memories? surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind.
47802,Lisa,way to build equity!
51124,Lisa,"well i wasn't sure, so i got both. who knows her little milhouse?"
46144,Lisa,"you got all your equipment, dad?"
47335,Lisa,"krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a bar mitzvah?"
50636,Lisa,hm...
50259,Lisa,did you get a good house-sitter?
42498,Lisa,let me see that.
47369,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure i'm ready for a new cat."
43357,Lisa,"i did the best i could, bleeding gums."
45558,Lisa,how can he rebel? he doesn't even know where he is.
41826,Lisa,"okay, okay."
51739,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
47044,Lisa,"dad, this is a kid's menu where you help yogi bear get to the washington monument."
48086,Lisa,"okay, gotta keep calm. if scooby doo has taught me anything, it's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers."
47977,Lisa,la la la la la la la laaaaaaa.
47450,Lisa,"maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. c'mon."
43970,Lisa,"hey, that reminds me, mom -- buckingham palace called. they want their hat back."
43290,Lisa,"bart, look! a laundry chute!"
45649,Lisa,"oh, couldn't be better."
50987,Lisa,no! outside the house!
50139,Lisa,"edmund's almost here, so please nobody be themselves!"
46548,Lisa,"hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn!"
48305,Lisa,"and i'm required to say ""come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor. yee ha."""
50979,Lisa,this is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
52417,Lisa,or italian?
45487,Lisa,"uh, i don't think so."
43049,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing in my room?"
50417,Lisa,why would a popular fifth-grader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse?
48785,Lisa,kent brockman said a horrible swear!
49290,Lisa,"oh, it's my first mybill. twelve hundred dollars?! but i only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
51742,Lisa,why does the last thing you say sound so ominous?
50976,Lisa,proctor clarkeson -- one student still hasn't taken the test!
47726,Lisa,i guess. but there's a long way to go.
46413,Lisa,no!
49906,Lisa,"but dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from flanders."
41887,Lisa,yaaayyy!!
41861,Lisa,a man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
52260,Lisa,all right!
42549,Lisa,hello moe?
50939,Lisa,"i bought you a ticket for the mypad raffle, dad."
44235,Lisa,complete confidentiality? oh. and i'm sure he's as good as dr. hibbert. it says so right in his ad.
50762,Lisa,do you actually serve those items?
50489,Lisa,"i'll recite the alphabet, and you tell me when to stop. a-b-c-d..."
48389,Lisa,"and i did get better at math, but it was only by abandoning everything i believed in. i guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is..."
43305,Lisa,"relax? i can't relax. nor can i yield, relent, or... only two synonyms? oh my god! i'm losing my perspicacity!"
50821,Lisa,some day i'll design a solar car!
42676,Lisa,i've got a weekend job helping the poor. and i'm only eight.
48366,Lisa,so... do you miss having the girls around?
42284,Lisa,"this wouldn't have anything to do with laura coming over, would it?"
43485,Lisa,"oh, then you must think i'm a monster."
51711,Lisa,look at all these monstrosities.
42357,Lisa,"dad, can i..."
43620,Lisa,"no, let's go to the nature company. they've got a tv assembled by hopi indians!"
49495,Lisa,i'll be less stressed! and i'm really freakin' stressed!
48597,Lisa,"milhouse, what's gotten into you?"
41618,Lisa,"i just had a worrisome thought! if there can be two incarnations of the simpsons, why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others?"
44570,Lisa,bail out!
44522,Lisa,quite preposterous. but no one will believe me until i can prove what it really is. can't you do a dna test or something?
46276,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
49973,Lisa,dad! that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
47487,Lisa,"oh, i'm tired, i'm hungry, red plastic sandals are not great running-away shoes..."
43859,Lisa,"we are best friends, mom. but i'm a kid. i need friends my own age, too."
48928,Lisa,i did not!
50305,Lisa,that's him!
52387,Lisa,"yeah, bart, get out and push."
42041,Lisa,that's alright. i think i'll just hit the hay.
51024,Lisa,"thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad."
44586,Lisa,oooooo.
43747,Lisa,santa?
49111,Lisa,"well, i uh..."
44855,Lisa,may i sit there?
50657,Lisa,you really want me?
43777,Lisa,langdon alger.
44779,Lisa,"sorry, bart, but you've got to take some things seriously."
50890,Lisa,huh. two queens. that's a great start.
42765,Lisa,i think they're trying to get some attention.
45347,Lisa,b-3.
48518,Lisa,who was that?
47783,Lisa,"it shows the history of nuclear physics, from marie curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor."
47515,Lisa,and it would be nice to have someone here i can beat up.
42137,Lisa,no. it's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. let's get you on the scale.
49125,Lisa,"wow, dad was so cute as a baby."
47277,Lisa,"chief wiggum, we're just like you policemen. don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
43171,Lisa,"mom, you said i could have one souvenir, right? well i want a didgeridoo."
43038,Lisa,"wow bart, i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion."
47235,Lisa,i can't beat nelson.
46352,Lisa,mini toothpaste.
49937,Lisa,"run! i mean, swim! i mean ."
47504,Lisa,"mr. leonard, how'd you get in a movie?"
49533,Lisa,"if you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!"
43657,Lisa,"it's hopeless, bart. we've searched up and down these docks, from pier one to that pier 1 by pier seventeen."
47459,Lisa,"but, but my iq is only 159! maggie's more intelligent than me?"
46001,Lisa,"it's okay, mom! i have a safety line!"
51361,Lisa,i didn't say anything.
44612,Lisa,"oh, no! the spit valve! release the spit valve!"
44158,Lisa,"hey, you said we were going to dairy queen."
50785,Lisa,forgive a fool her tears.

45934,Lisa,george cauldron? maybe he can fix me up with ed ladle.
47363,Lisa,oh my god! i just had my most brilliant idea ever!
44500,Lisa,"oh, but what if they missed something? you have to allow an archeological survey!"
42467,Lisa,"write a cartoon ourselves? bart, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
50195,Lisa,"hm, apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent."
49187,Lisa,you guys look exhausted. maybe you oughta rest for a while.
45861,Lisa,but my parents are counting on seeing me dance! and i've worked ever so hard.
47645,Lisa,chief is fine.
50742,Lisa,kidzone... let me guess: a broken foosball table and a game of clue missing its candlestick.
50917,Lisa,really?
47657,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful."
46640,Lisa,"not if we buy our tickets on the internet. it's really cheap if we change planes in phoenix, honolulu, sun city, and east st. louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
48369,Lisa,i have to go.
51960,Lisa,i was just playing the blues... ...dad.
42715,Lisa,"well, i'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
43773,Lisa,hmmm... truth.
49228,Lisa,"losin' it! ""risqué '80s teen flick!"""
45058,Lisa,"dad, you gotta get us out of here! use the remote!"
46841,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
46804,Lisa,networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
51288,Lisa,me too.
46969,Lisa,"good point, dad. what would jesus do?"
42610,Lisa,"i always knew some day mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
41761,Lisa,"bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
42166,Lisa,i'll write you every day.
52442,Lisa,wow!
43122,Lisa,why don't we all look at the photo album?
51685,Lisa,"what stopped you, bender? asimov's three laws of robotics?"
49129,Lisa,we can ignite it with these crystal earrings grandma gave me.
52164,Lisa,"yeah, you throw like me."
50483,Lisa,"dad, i'm going to entertain you with the help of ""the brothers karamazov."" ""alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which i shall describe in its proper place."""
42316,Lisa,"bart, that's gross!"
47668,Lisa,"this is so sweet, but i've learned one little paper can't make a difference in this world."
48021,Lisa,oh boy! this is what sunny sunday afternoons are for!
43592,Lisa,mom! i found sideshow bob's hide-out and i got a secret message to the police and i had a blimp fall on me and i was in an atomic blast but i'm okay now!
48725,Lisa,i can't believe you listened to this magazine. it's a larry flynt publication!
51650,Lisa,hey!

42865,Lisa,"you're younger than me, too?"
43977,Lisa,"oh, mom, please! you can make this my birthday and christmas presents!"
50393,Lisa,brother germs!
46724,Lisa,this place is amazing! kiosks! outdoor study groups!
47331,Lisa,and then we got him neutered.
50548,Lisa,can i have my allowance early? i need to buy some carbon-offset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books.
49218,Lisa,maybe you could use some help.
43903,Lisa,"ohmigod, bart, look!"
50147,Lisa,"someday when i'm a grownup, maybe i'll go back and look fondly at our house."
44012,Lisa,"oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. be the baby, kitty. go on, be the baby."
44056,Lisa,"here we are, chapter two: ""so your pressure is dropping."" --"
46742,Lisa,that's not a sunset. that's a bird on fire!
45662,Lisa,any exposure to unsanitary conditions?
46391,Lisa,why?
49449,Lisa,"no, i was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
48594,Lisa,no.
46584,Lisa,you know what? i bet he can't even fit into his old costume.
48905,Lisa,"look, we all care about quintile disparity, but the democrats can't win with another prissy brainiac."
51011,Lisa,what?!
44943,Lisa,"now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
51898,Lisa,why can't we have a meeting when you're watching tv?
42830,Lisa,"i'm really glad you're back, dad. i knew you could do it. now don't screw it up."
46760,Lisa,"well, you'll be happy to know malibu stacey's fine. i really appreciate what you did, dad."
50755,Lisa,hold that thought. i'm tuning my saxophone. sharp. flat. sharp.
50064,Lisa,"that's great, mr. zuckerberg, but i was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
43524,Lisa,"okay, but promise you won't be grouchy."
51514,Lisa,"okay, dad's my hero. why is he my hero?"
52083,Lisa,"oh, come on, bart, not again."
45257,Lisa,my room!
49837,Lisa,yes! i'm thrilled! we've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
43055,Lisa,bart started it.
47447,Lisa,yay!
48681,Lisa,okay.
47079,Lisa,yes.
49810,Lisa,what are you doing? i wanna know what happens next.
48506,Lisa,how many others do you have?
46197,Lisa,"yeah, she's a real purist."
50423,Lisa,you like my boots?
48660,Lisa,pong!
45155,Lisa,hi.
51416,Lisa,dad! bart's on my side of the seat!
49695,Lisa,"when maggie's nightlight goes out, her onesie becomes a funsie. this announcer has never seen diapers so dapper!"
48530,Lisa,"dad, no! i'm not mad at moe anymore!"
50329,Lisa,"grampa, you're not dead."
51575,Lisa,gus huebner? is that you?
47116,Lisa,or we could go to walter gropius's bauhaus village?
43865,Lisa,"well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... ha... i forgot to pack."
42263,Lisa,we got beets!
50614,Lisa,"um, none."
52409,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
44183,Lisa,once there was a robot named todd...
42300,Lisa,"tell it, mom. tell, it mom."
43579,Lisa,yay!
46395,Lisa,this is pretty far to go just to spite moe.
50907,Lisa,oh my god! you won the pot? you must have nearly a million dollars! i can go to college and live like a kennedy.
48441,Lisa,"why didn't you tell him it was an accident? it was an accident, right? michael?"
41884,Lisa,peace on earth.
44301,Lisa,"not good money, really. each can'll get you a nickel."
42644,Lisa,there's nothing to eat for breakfast.
46084,Lisa,yay!
41654,Lisa,whuh?
45888,Lisa,isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?
47659,Lisa,dad! mr. burns cut our power -- now i can't print my paper!
44870,Lisa,stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
51973,Lisa,how?
48211,Lisa,they must have just made this a toll road.
42107,Lisa,"close the gate, maggie."
45917,Lisa,"it really says ""die""? that sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
43139,Lisa,"don't you realize what's happening, bart? your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
43814,Lisa,it's just a stupid rock.
43397,Lisa,nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. and i've got an inquisitive temperament! maybe i could help solve this!
43178,Lisa,"how's dad, today?"
45310,Lisa,"dad's got it on the speed dial under ""fire."""
49639,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be sick.
51188,Lisa,"oooh, there's new marshmallows in the belfast charms!"
45976,Lisa,are you all right?
41847,Lisa,how zen.
43926,Lisa,ah.
45559,Lisa,are those real cobras?
52175,Lisa,but i can't go back! not after i've seen the bright lights of capital city. i'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
47718,Lisa,"this is the perfect test -- if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop, i'll know i've conquered food at last."
46016,Lisa,"oh, no."
43574,Lisa,"don't you remember, dad?"
48665,Lisa,what if we're not here?
43822,Lisa,"all right! now you've got all the simpsons behind you, apu!"
42278,Lisa,aaah!
45703,Lisa,"i hope you enjoy your plaque, cheater."
49064,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's marrying one of cletus' daughters!
47405,Lisa,why can't your heir be female? or-or why can't we elect our leaders?
47419,Lisa,but i know so much about it.
46021,Lisa,"no, mom. it's a memorial forest now. if i'm alive, they'll cut it down!"
46922,Lisa,what report?
46119,Lisa,uh-oh. dad's having an antacid trip.
50480,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
46703,Lisa,thanks. i'll see you in heaven.
43998,Lisa,"oh, how does bart do this every week?"
46839,Lisa,oh.
43328,Lisa,"when the jazzman's testi-fyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman, oh jazzman..."
43479,Lisa,mom.
46025,Lisa,i'm not dead! and neither is my sense of moral outrage.
47632,Lisa,"gotta go, sweetie!"
50603,Lisa,"ms. dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate krusty?"
45401,Lisa,oh. what do you produce?
45174,Lisa,hippo in the house.
47894,Lisa,"no, i don't see dad doing all that paperwork."
44822,Lisa,yes.
44517,Lisa,"dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. there's no proof of that."
47782,Lisa,it's my entry for the all-school science fair.
48918,Lisa,"mom, i didn't know you went to college!"
46860,Lisa,stop objectifying my mom!
47742,Lisa,"oh, mom, don't feel bad. everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, i'm late for my dinner... with chloe!"
43222,Lisa,"and i love that painting. judging by the clothes, i'd say seventeenth century."
47355,Lisa,"obviously, yes."
45168,Lisa,"with a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
45591,Lisa,you people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
49913,Lisa,"c'mon, everybody! a whale needs help!"
47744,Lisa,that was such an exciting night. morley safer has the biggest head i've ever seen.
50574,Lisa,"no need to thank me, boys."
45885,Lisa,"moe, can i give you some shrimp for the road?"
51070,Lisa,but why would my teacher be a bully?
49767,Lisa,come on. they're just pins.
42903,Lisa,relatively?
48825,Lisa,"they come to your home to help you raise independent, self-actualized children. the counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."
41876,Lisa,"there, there, rabbi. it's not too late."
49457,Lisa,"quaerite deum in corde et anima. that's latin... ""deum"" is god... and of course ""quaerite"" means ""seek""... ""seek god with heart and soul."""
41649,Lisa,"beh! mag-gie! hey, hey, get your sticky hands off me. owww!"
43971,Lisa,"hey, i think i got a pai gow!"
49351,Lisa,"i have a best friend! you heard me say that, didn't you?"
46952,Lisa,look! that's lisa leslie! she showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be six foot five!
45272,Lisa,"dad, why did you have to take away my room?"
46355,Lisa,isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
48314,Lisa,"grampa, i think you should give up the bullfighting."
51696,Lisa,"wait, wait, wait! you're the portal. how are you going to get to the future?"
49089,Lisa,"okay everyone -- just be yourself. don't look in the camera, pretend i'm not here, and... no toupees..."
44018,Lisa,"""nuke the whales?"" you don't really believe that, do you?"
44657,Lisa,look! we can hide in that cave!
51604,Lisa,hey! are you coming to the afterschool pool party?
44748,Lisa,wowww!
46899,Lisa,edna! edna! edna! edna!
48348,Lisa,are we gonna do any actual math problems?
43937,Lisa,"well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
48272,Lisa,"yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""hamlet."""
47147,Lisa,today balthazar will tell us about global warming in the land beyond the rainbow.
51831,Lisa,i know how much to tip a waiter.
47347,Lisa,"no, dad. this time you were just plain selfish."
50597,Lisa,"hm, they're selling off all the old tv relics."
48875,Lisa,no! no! prop eighty-seven lets big polluters off the hook!
42554,Lisa,"oh, no! dad's been drugged!"
48496,Lisa,what is everyone doing?
51756,Lisa,that's correct.
44692,Lisa,i'm finished. i've just got to...oh... there!
45180,Lisa,"wait, there's a commercial!"
47505,Lisa,"dad, i don't like this movie. can we go home?"
44271,Lisa,"a credit card? oh, i knew you were up to no good."
45539,Lisa,"wait, dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
44871,Lisa,yahhh!
44324,Lisa,me! me!
45679,Lisa,what have you got so far?
48776,Lisa,make room for jumbo.
45863,Lisa,i get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
45999,Lisa,it's lisa!
44977,Lisa,unbelievable!
49760,Lisa,why would you put it in the dishwasher?
50974,Lisa,you didn't?! is there no limit to your disrespect?
48675,Lisa,"dad, that's ridiculous."
52430,Lisa,"mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?"
51944,Lisa,"i'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. the iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. the west virginia coal miner, coughing up his..."
49273,Lisa,i didn't?!
48644,Lisa,and guess what -- ben and ken the street magic men are only the beginning! the city is a treasure trove of culture and multi-culture!
44860,Lisa,oh! but isn't this the 22?
50867,Lisa,it's moe with wings!
43172,Lisa,what?!
48774,Lisa,"oh, that's convenient."
43153,Lisa,"yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as tom bosley. but krusty!"
44527,Lisa,i am home.
50277,Lisa,"something wrong, bart?"
47275,Lisa,"mom, i was elected to make this a better school."
48039,Lisa,"strange as it sounds, dad, i agree with you."
42658,Lisa,"we are insured, aren't we, mom?"
51748,Lisa,right hand red!
43561,Lisa,"me, too."
47598,Lisa,how romantic. you and dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it.
51081,Lisa,wow -- he passed the maggie test. and remember how maggie solved cookiegate?
48242,Lisa,where is that ghastly flow?
41718,Lisa,"bart, grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
42158,Lisa,i've never gotten a b before.
49494,Lisa,i was so bored!
46288,Lisa,"can you take me to school, krusty?"
49226,Lisa,"fruit loops? that's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"""
47831,Lisa,i hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
49586,Lisa,"you know, i think those shirts should say ""insecurity."""
41933,Lisa,"but, dad, i can't find ""happy little elves in tinkly winkly town""."
45271,Lisa,i am trying to do my homework.
47902,Lisa,"yeah, kiss and make up!"
43615,Lisa,we are not wieners!
46371,Lisa,"help me, bart!"
44950,Lisa,"they only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... oh, and get this, mom, she drinks iced tea."
52068,Lisa,"no, why?"
49458,Lisa,heart and soul...
44669,Lisa,"dad, the zebra didn't do it. it's just a word at the end of the dictionary."
47160,Lisa,well i'm afraid the law is clear and dad did renounce all claim to ownership.
50862,Lisa,noooo!
50495,Lisa,i miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
43858,Lisa,"mom, why don't i have any friends?"
44038,Lisa,you'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man!
42717,Lisa,you're getting a job.
50915,Lisa,mmm! tasty! love the texture. what is it?
51026,Lisa,your intellect-deadening dvds turned my brother's brain to jelly.
49364,Lisa,"mom, stop! this is our thing, not yours!"
44717,Lisa,quit it... quit it... quit... you kids knock it off! mama's watchin' her stories!
44477,Lisa,"after all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig?!"
44868,Lisa,area 51? i found area 51!
49969,Lisa,you aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you're being convinced by the color of my hair!
51507,Lisa,"well... no, but now when i look at it all i'll see is a fraud."
50015,Lisa,friday morning andrew lloyd weber and elaine stritch helped us make wallets.
48750,Lisa,the sixth-grade security camera shows three empty desks!
47589,Lisa,"dad, this is the basement. here's the iced tea i left down here this afternoon."
50623,Lisa,"i knew you were, dad. i always knew."
52340,Lisa,you weren't watching! you weren't watching! you weren't watching!
42179,Lisa,"and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. so i close by saying, save us! save us now! bart and lisa."
44327,Lisa,it looks japanese.
43562,Lisa,"oh, you didn't dumb it down! you said ""rapport!"""
43287,Lisa,we've gotta get you outta here!
48566,Lisa,kinda.
43746,Lisa,ah-huh.
47497,Lisa,"go on, maggie, you can do it."
49659,Lisa,"so, i'll hide and you guys count to a hundred."
42088,Lisa,shove it.
44465,Lisa,"can we go swimmin', mom?"
46808,Lisa,"you should know, it's on the test!"
45466,Lisa,"no way... ""the seven habits of highly effective pre-teens?"" is this all because of the...?"
51837,Lisa,but mom had to spend all the christmas money having it surgically removed.
46213,Lisa,"come on, people! move it! i want to see some sweat!"
46963,Lisa,"molochai desiratum maledictu... nosferatu ascendum corporalis...,molochai desiratum maledictu nosferatu ascendum corporalis,6

46456,Lisa,"mom, i know it's you."
41749,Lisa,"oh, yeah? what's my shoe size?"
51093,Lisa,why are you here?
41827,Lisa,but bart --
45643,Lisa,you said that four days ago.
46064,Lisa,are you really gonna drink that?
49370,Lisa,okay... best friend.
51363,Lisa,"good one, ding dong!"
43565,Lisa,"just shut up and listen. there's something fishy about grandma. whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. and just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
42133,Lisa,"dad, what if i told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
45364,Lisa,how could you miss that huge boat coming right at us?
45881,Lisa,"oh, mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
45304,Lisa,"wow, dad and bart have been everywhere! they've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies."
51341,Lisa,that's impossible. we've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
43607,Lisa,hmm. that looks entertaining.
48149,Lisa,"look, as the safety salamander, you are beloved by all. and if you were the mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do."
44319,Lisa,"wow! i've never seen so much money! oh, but i can't accept that, knowing where it came from. can i, mom?"
49477,Lisa,"crimes... ""kill"" ""holy""... ""sage""..."
47703,Lisa,what?
42516,Lisa,"oh mom, i've missed you so much."
45755,Lisa,bart!
50248,Lisa,"but until then this tree will stand for everything mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
46450,Lisa,like the whore of babylon?
50863,Lisa,you tossed your car keys in my bean plant!
44020,Lisa,you play the guitar?
48997,Lisa,"mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream! martha graham danced well into her seventies."
46575,Lisa,"dad, it's a documentary on the homeless."
47243,Lisa,what would you change?
42154,Lisa,i think we owe a debt to unky herb. he took us into his home and dad destroyed him.
47190,Lisa,"way to go, mom. homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce!"
51389,Lisa,"stop it, stop it! why in the world would you burn a book?"
44006,Lisa,"would you do me a favor? when you get back to class, just give him this note."
49407,Lisa,"i don't know, but he's algaefying."
42296,Lisa,promise you'll never do that again.
46469,Lisa,"""nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... no creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
50254,Lisa,i'll go outside and make snow angels.
44552,Lisa,ah! dad! doesn't this car have seat belts?
50896,Lisa,shoo!
50090,Lisa,"okay, bottom line: i need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers."
43184,Lisa,"bart, i am so proud of you. you showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. from this day forward we are kindred spirits."
48467,Lisa,i won't get tired of him!
48741,Lisa,maybe there's something in dad's backpack.
45884,Lisa,thank you.
41822,Lisa,"it's the german term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
47554,Lisa,"no it doesn't! this movie is drivel! she's wooden and unpleasant, and no matter what he does, he's still ryan o'neal."
51574,Lisa,after this we'll do makeovers!
46517,Lisa,"i'm so sorry, grampa."
41696,Lisa,you can't go! you're the best teacher i'll ever have.
52255,Lisa,"but, mom! if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots."
46813,Lisa,get out!
46927,Lisa,"dad, we are there."
48409,Lisa,"mom, you really have to choose here, between science and belief."
45702,Lisa,glow sticks? but visual aids are against the rules!
42192,Lisa,"big daddy, would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit?"
51237,Lisa,you're rotating it in the wrong direction!
51805,Lisa,"but to be frank, there's not a lot to recommend it..."
44903,Lisa,"thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, dad."
52461,Lisa,got a new dance and it goes like this / and the name of the dance is the peppermint twist! yeah!
48373,Lisa,eep.
46679,Lisa,ooh! here's a wonderful speaker! geoff jenkins!
47624,Lisa,yes.
48436,Lisa,mom!
46201,Lisa,why does she only go after the smart ones?
52172,Lisa,capital city -- yeah!
47604,Lisa,that's not what dogs do.
47932,Lisa,my hamster!
43787,Lisa,"bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove milhouse, nelson, and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and bart's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong."
48779,Lisa,"bart's makin' faces, dad."
51860,Lisa,"i don't care what that stupid test says, bart. you're a dimwit."
42481,Lisa,"grampa, we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways."
51044,Lisa,"please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons."
49523,Lisa,that's horrible. what else?
51676,Lisa,judge-judge-judge--
49484,Lisa,"oh, fine, fine, finish your song. i can be patient -- after all, i am the gem child."
43575,Lisa,he framed krusty. he tried to kill aunt selma. he rigged an election.
49317,Lisa,apparently not feisty enough. future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. i am not just asking you to save the bees. i am asking you to save your souls.
45341,Lisa,"no, dad, no. my point is you have to do something big and daring."
44383,Lisa,for satisfactory completion of the second grade.
43304,Lisa,"i've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far."
49335,Lisa,"so, how come i've never seen you around the janet l. muñoz-robbins rec center before?"
52152,Lisa,"well, it was written in 1845. maybe people were easier to scare back then."
48740,Lisa,no you didn't -- your plan was to burn the corn.
44955,Lisa,absolutely.
47187,Lisa,the venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
47231,Lisa,hey... student body president...
48949,Lisa,"bart, martin could be seriously hurt, or worse."
47357,Lisa,"e'll-shay uy-bay em-thay, upid-stay."
46577,Lisa,i met one of my heroes today. she started the f--
52086,Lisa,"mom, you look so glamorous."
41857,Lisa,"poor krusty, he's like a black velvet painting come to life."
49536,Lisa,"dad, no!"
42991,Lisa,i have a plan. i think we can trap him.
44831,Lisa,"dad, what have you done to your stomach?"
46082,Lisa,they made an elephant!
51269,Lisa,did you know some historians think american football is based on an ancient aztec game?
51498,Lisa,she is?
48207,Lisa,santa must have left it.
47233,Lisa,"nelson, you're running for president?"
45587,Lisa,"bart, they lied to us. instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. aren't you outraged?"
42907,Lisa,"it's the beating of that hideous heart! i mean, i think i hear something."
48370,Lisa,"nelson, you're not really angry at me. you're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
49251,Lisa,he bought new shoelaces. with fancy metal tips!
49771,Lisa,oh my god! dad threw too hard!
44504,Lisa,"okay, everyone! back to work! you never know when we might uncover a tyrannosaurus."
50342,Lisa,wonder who's in there. could it be oscar the...
45598,Lisa,boycott funzo. he's a toy-killing machine!
49804,Lisa,"""saturday, april 14, 1860. dear diary, i must be brief, for tonight is the grand ball..."""
41908,Lisa,no. i didn't.
43999,Lisa,it's your fault! i accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
52293,Lisa,no!
41823,Lisa,sour grapes.
47246,Lisa,this cute-ing-up suits me / there's beauty within me / so let's olsen-twin me / give them someone to love
49175,Lisa,what are you two doing in the laundry room?
44743,Lisa,so i'm not doomed!
47584,Lisa,"i'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the pie man."
48879,Lisa,"i see no grill, oven, or food of any kind."
44149,Lisa,"mom, john likes ""itchy and scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
49658,Lisa,possum?!
49464,Lisa,well? did you get it?
48786,Lisa,i'm not sure brockman's out of the woods yet. there are a lot of religious watch-dog groups out there... keeping the world safe from the horror of free expression.
46432,Lisa,"stop saying that, dad."
46649,Lisa,how to loot brazil?
46185,Lisa,hi there.
45964,Lisa,but...

41875,Lisa,bart! i am not gonna learn ancient hebrew.
48156,Lisa,oh my god! spend a summer in rome!
44138,Lisa,adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
51438,Lisa,our school cafeteria is serving g.m.o.s -- genetically-modified organisms.
44721,Lisa,no!!
43712,Lisa,how else could he have gotten this?
52218,Lisa,"it's the centerpiece, bart!"
47112,Lisa,...it's christmas time in the city...
49247,Lisa,"oh, that's so sad!"
43248,Lisa,thanks.
48796,Lisa,oh my god! you don't suppose they're gonna start--
42687,Lisa,bye!
47588,Lisa,"dad, please. it's obvious you're pie man. we've been getting his mail for weeks."
52226,Lisa,i saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / my soul carved in slices by spikey-haired demons...
52147,Lisa,"once upon a midnight dreary,"
46895,Lisa,"ooh, the futuresphere. it's what people in nineteen sixty-five imagined what life would be like in nineteen eighty-seven."
50958,Lisa,"well, it's time we showed this dog some love!"
48595,Lisa,"i call it...""revenge of the geeks."""
49573,Lisa,hi.
44322,Lisa,"/ yahoo! / oh, man, am i glad to get outta there! / etc."

50002,Lisa,victory for the middle child!
45056,Lisa,"we're done for, bart!"

46910,Lisa,huh?
42638,Lisa,"excuse me, mr. mayor."
44706,Lisa,oh... i've got to find out more...
50937,Lisa,the dog's got the mumps.
49199,Lisa,there's bart!
52009,Lisa,this is gonna be the best birthday breakfast mom ever had.
42983,Lisa,"this is so cool, bart. we're just like woodward and bernstein!"
45858,Lisa,excuse me...
48311,Lisa,"no! wait! wait! bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!"
47251,Lisa,"well, i have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
51926,Lisa,what do you like best about me?
46791,Lisa,"hey, i read about this show in teen modern maturity. they film passengers with hidden cameras and catch them at their most uninhibited."
42305,Lisa,daaad!
47934,Lisa,"yay, mom!"
49120,Lisa,ceo!
46770,Lisa,that's it! i know exactly what we should do.
47756,Lisa,help... help... so much sulfur dioxide!
42093,Lisa,"well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
47303,Lisa,we found a secret tunnel out of the tower. it was used by sir walter raleigh!
49935,Lisa,"they must be bluella's children! hello, whale calves! your mother lives on through you!"
44415,Lisa,oh yeah?
45123,Lisa,i don't want your dirty denominators.
49221,Lisa,one more word!
47218,Lisa,don't go inside -- it's a trap!
47635,Lisa,"publish it myself? why not? i could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. i'd be a publisher, just like katherine graham!"
48393,Lisa,this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living. who cares what she thinks?
48263,Lisa,...when suddenly i heard...
49339,Lisa,"what is this, brooklyn in the fifties? don't just say stuff."
49233,Lisa,"okay, back to the real world."
43623,Lisa,"but it's marked down from $2,800!"
52328,Lisa,is too.
49984,Lisa,"mr. flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?"
44853,Lisa,"hi, larry."
52486,Lisa,i open this door and i go from being one kind of mother to another.
44272,Lisa,"hey! stop! you can take back the bassinet, but the baby is ours!"
52118,Lisa,fine. then you tell one scarier.
48155,Lisa,summer opportunities.
50909,Lisa,"c'mon, tell me!"
48677,Lisa,"ooo, there's my first saxophone recital!"
46308,Lisa,i've gotta get to school.
43741,Lisa,bart! look at this!
47942,Lisa,"wow, krishna krisps, amazonkers, lollapalollipops -- these sound like my kind of snacks..."
51708,Lisa,so many musical choices!
46299,Lisa,"oh my god, it's 11:15!"
44854,Lisa,"i'm sorry, it's just that on the school bus--"
52408,Lisa,pass the moo juice.
47957,Lisa,"hush, little baby, don't say a word / mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird / and if that mockingbird don't sing..."
51003,Lisa,"ew! on every level! ew! bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of milhice. what? it's the plural of milhouse. look it up."
44441,Lisa,"good one, dad."
52043,Lisa,"'bye, bart."
44633,Lisa,"point of order. if we want to learn anything, we must respect..."
47804,Lisa,"darts and meatpies, and lager in pint glasses"
51853,Lisa,then all the reindeer loved him / as they shouted out with glee / rudolph the red nosed reindeer / you'll go down in history...
43869,Lisa,"um, if it's okay with you, mom, i'd rather go find some kids."
50547,Lisa,everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie!
42624,Lisa,"no! self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."
43352,Lisa,two hundred and fifty dollars! but i need that album to honor the memory of bleeding gums murphy.
46485,Lisa,whaa?
42168,Lisa,this is a little more rustic than i expected.
50238,Lisa,can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army?
46912,Lisa,i don't think so.
50266,Lisa,bart?
49433,Lisa,"hm, i wonder if it's theses."
49113,Lisa,are you guys still mad at me?
45312,Lisa,why is it playing over again?
44128,Lisa,i'm getting used to never getting noticed.
46228,Lisa,i'd like to thank her parents for helping with the caging.
48334,Lisa,we haven't gotten our food yet!
44312,Lisa,i think i'm going to be sick...
51566,Lisa,"oh dad, you're back! just in time for my recital!"
42750,Lisa,that's the spirit.
42677,Lisa,this biography of bart came out awfully quickly. it's not even about him.
47302,Lisa,why did you let him be his own barrister?
50383,Lisa,"i guess it's up to me to save you, cregg demon magic freek."
48874,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
50485,Lisa,"ew, dad! wait a minute... can you pass gas at will? fart once for no, twice for yes."
49943,Lisa,it's the baby whales' dad!
45263,Lisa,dad!
51531,Lisa,"don't do it, dad. don't cheat."
49909,Lisa,oh my god...
51783,Lisa,that's even worse!
44873,Lisa,i didn't know springfield had a russian district.
50637,Lisa,it's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center?
44883,Lisa,no!
45814,Lisa,"ow! bart, that's hot!"
45871,Lisa,"oh, please stop!"
44429,Lisa,"well, i really liked that story. but it still doesn't fix this."
44069,Lisa,not me.
42878,Lisa,i won first chair?
46472,Lisa,"mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over..."
42789,Lisa,muffin.
45006,Lisa,it's true. i read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
42952,Lisa,cool! / neat-o!
51620,Lisa,"okay, enough theory."
44264,Lisa,ich esse; er isst; wir essen.
52295,Lisa,it's so hard to picture you two then. hand in hand at the crossroads of life. there are so many questions.
50053,Lisa,"ooh, a message from my small business person!"
51659,Lisa,that was unmotivated.
50338,Lisa,initiate phase two.
50449,Lisa,"and now without further ado, i give you... this!!!"
42382,Lisa,forget it. to get those tickets our parents would have to be part of springfield's cultural elite.
42344,Lisa,the beeramid contains so much aluminum it would take five men to lift it. twenty-two immigrant laborers died during its construction...
43916,Lisa,"i believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
51295,Lisa,begone!
47628,Lisa,"gee, i never noticed that before."
44073,Lisa,out back.
45396,Lisa,i think so.
42112,Lisa,"look dad, there's a spot."
41645,Lisa,"this is kind of relaxing. but it's so hard to turn off my brain. i have to stop thinking... starting now. hey, it worked. oh no, that's thinking!"
50525,Lisa,goorsha!
47719,Lisa,that was too easy.
45177,Lisa,drinking their coffee...
51996,Lisa,"remember, dad. the handle of the big dipper points to the north star."
48013,Lisa,it's the title of the movie.
50208,Lisa,"hey, there's a number on him. what is it?"
47192,Lisa,"well, it looks like maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
42121,Lisa,sideshow bob!
47270,Lisa,you tricked me into betraying my fellow students!
48638,Lisa,you asked to see me?
42785,Lisa,"just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that bart's absence has left in our hearts."
43253,Lisa,but you've been going on about these all week. i'm sure he just forgot.
50265,Lisa,"your four eyes saw a lot today, milhouse. what's the skinny?"
44694,Lisa,"and a spring for his curly tail! huh-huh. oink, oink, oink...huh-huh!"
43772,Lisa,okay... why don't you...
51838,Lisa,daddy! we're so glad to see you!
51244,Lisa,"i feel your pain, brother."
45303,Lisa,"the worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you!"
50145,Lisa,"dad, i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""baby must-have."""
43297,Lisa,"oh, yeah. i didn't think this was for me."
46948,Lisa,bye mom!
48238,Lisa,"alright, let's just try one more lesson. repeat after me: ""what flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
44589,Lisa,we can't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast.
45488,Lisa,497... 498 words. hmph.
49489,Lisa,maggie -- it's true! you are the gem child!
46863,Lisa,"mom, do something!"
49713,Lisa,"better change your mind quick, bart. a snow plow's coming to seal us in."
47207,Lisa,there you are.
49482,Lisa,it all adds up. i am the gem that will bring world peace! how brilliant of god to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
43576,Lisa,wow! / air show! / cool! /
50864,Lisa,why is this happening to us?
47226,Lisa,"well, they're transferring grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. i say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!"
44351,Lisa,this school has everything i ever wanted.
51252,Lisa,"if every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system."
48187,Lisa,how did you wind up here?
41829,Lisa,hey!!
52108,Lisa,you're gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later.
42103,Lisa,checkers.
47665,Lisa,nooo!
48051,Lisa,no. i mean ketchup.
47056,Lisa,"i got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive."
50426,Lisa,"all right, sister. what's your game?"
47043,Lisa,you said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. and now they're worse than ever.
42591,Lisa,"yeah, i've seen your curly too."
49208,Lisa,oh great. now you woke the baby.
50861,Lisa,"stop! this is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! if one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass!"
46921,Lisa,how'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? did mom help you?
42700,Lisa,"i'm warning you, mom -- i may get a little crazy."
41935,Lisa,"oh, nothing. i just scheduled a tetanus booster. maybe i'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
45193,Lisa,doughy's has terrible pizza.
42477,Lisa,"no, we're just curious."
50932,Lisa,"bart! i can't eat bugs anymore. please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild."
46163,Lisa,cut it out! you're a grown man!
48753,Lisa,i already read it.
47881,Lisa,"uh, let's talk about this outside."
48256,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. i brought something that'll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!"
45682,Lisa,do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
42429,Lisa,what have you done with my report?
48728,Lisa,larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt?
44074,Lisa,either that or batman has really let himself go.
42751,Lisa,we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board.
49559,Lisa,"i just wish i could go to a school like that -- even for one week. ""tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all."""
51820,Lisa,is it called the cooling tower because there's--
50735,Lisa,"hear, hear!"
51401,Lisa,it's almost like having dad here. only with less growling when i go near his food.
50330,Lisa,"i never thought i'd say this, but dad is the only one who can help us."
51700,Lisa,parking lot.
44253,Lisa,no one's pinching his legs.
50682,Lisa,ow!
51626,Lisa,mom? dad?
51474,Lisa,"""this includes feeding; bathing; cleaning of droppings and barfings; and, when the time comes, burying or flushing."""
43833,Lisa,what are you talking about?
47437,Lisa,nothing.
42019,Lisa,"i, lisa simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten malibu stacey accessories!"
51654,Lisa,bart! i found a portal back to earth.
46315,Lisa,"wow, look at all these flavors: blessed virgin berry... command-mint... biblegum..."
47396,Lisa,"if dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
51042,Lisa,i got one for just watching the game.
43534,Lisa,"well, where's my dad?"
51934,Lisa,"bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. i can't help but think if i had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. i know you can't eat it now, so i'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. ."
50900,Lisa,"okay, education paid for. with a gap year, to find myself. every nerve in my body is screaming ""cash out now,"" and yet... i've got a pair of aces!"
49940,Lisa,"dad, no!"
52466,Lisa,"and furthermore,"
44454,Lisa,"can we go, dad? / please dad? / please, please, please? / can we go, huh, huh please? /"
49190,Lisa,that was an odd thing for bart to say.
43908,Lisa,"did you hear that, bart?"
52447,Lisa,can i wear your jewelry?
42642,Lisa,"dad, what do you think?"
52132,Lisa,"that wasn't scary at all, bart."
41891,Lisa,i'll give you a candy necklace.
49259,Lisa,"you stopped being my daddy as soon as you bet against me! all i have now is a mom, which is why i'm taking her maiden name! from now on, i'm..."
49720,Lisa,...clark gable owes me a book. and he never paid me for the shoeshine. but his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. lunch butter we called it.
51472,Lisa,"i've never had a pet of my very own! my clock is ticking! i don't wanna be one of those girls who waits till she's sixteen to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late."
48831,Lisa,just dance.
47918,Lisa,"well, i don't care what you say, she still loves us more. don't you, snowball?"
42846,Lisa,"yuh huh. ""cast of characters: viceroy fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..."""
43668,Lisa,wow!
48777,Lisa,nothing.
46651,Lisa,"while you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there ronaldo is waiting to be found."
45601,Lisa,"dad, dad, you're driving on the sidewalk."
51321,Lisa,"listen, i'm really sorry about..."
41987,Lisa,so gambling makes a good thing even better.
44875,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
51800,Lisa,"uh, i'll make brownies later."
45765,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
48418,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
44217,Lisa,go to your bed!
47683,Lisa,thank you for applying to the ovenfresh bakeoff. every year many wonderful cooks fail to qualify.
47531,Lisa,"c'mon bart, here's our chance."
50516,Lisa,yay! / x-games! x-games! / alright!
44515,Lisa,hey! / what are you...? / wait a minute. / wait! wait! wait! / settle down! / no! no! no! / excuse me! / no! no!
43810,Lisa,bart's room.
41996,Lisa,"look at the fear in his eyes. listen to the quiver in his voice. he's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
43544,Lisa,i would if i could.
44571,Lisa,no burglar? / what? / what's he mean?
52296,Lisa,okay. uh... how did dad propose to you?
44108,Lisa,if you wish to be our sitter / please be sweet and never bitter / help us with math and book reports /
48470,Lisa,"okay, guys. no one knows you're here, so be quiet. and if you get hungry, there are rats living in the christmas decorations."
52136,Lisa,there's something not quite right about this.
46420,Lisa,i came home as quick as i could. what's going on?
50706,Lisa,wha--? mom is gonna love that!
48602,Lisa,i feel it would be best if we just stayed friends.
49297,Lisa,all the bees are dead!
42319,Lisa,we feel neither highs nor lows.
42837,Lisa,"dad, as you know, we've been swimming. and we've developed a taste for it. we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of..."
47403,Lisa,"""everybody poops, the video?"" ""yu-gi-oh price guides?"" there are hardly any books at all!"
42495,Lisa,"then, what should i do?"
49261,Lisa,"hey, bouvier was jackie kennedy's maiden name."
42418,Lisa,"mom, bart wrecked my project and the science fair's in three days!"
47936,Lisa,i'm sure everyone's happier with santa's little helper here to love them.
50592,Lisa,no bart! you can read other books too!
50148,Lisa,"wow, mom -- you got first place in the science fair!"
43889,Lisa,"aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
43537,Lisa,i must protest. you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
43087,Lisa,no! no! no! no!!!
50536,Lisa,"wow mom, that was awesome!"
42832,Lisa,pool mobile?!!
49402,Lisa,"aha! so dad's life would actually have been worse, because he wouldn't have gotten together with mom, his one true love!"
44726,Lisa,you have to listen to the notes she's not playing!
42106,Lisa,can't you see i'm reading a third-rate biography of copernicus i found at the bus station?
48179,Lisa,"well, some people in europe have the impression that america has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. so for the next week, i'm from canada."
50878,Lisa,because they can't let me have a secret. it drives them crazy.
48502,Lisa,"well, you'd better hurry. i don't think dad can last much longer where he's hiding."
49801,Lisa,"""dearest diary, today i am the happiest girl in springfield--"""
49671,Lisa,what happened to miss hoover?
50367,Lisa,"willie, if you will?"
50582,Lisa,see?
50149,Lisa,"mom, these grades are amazing! just as good as mine!"
43966,Lisa,what a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day!
46470,Lisa,i'm a buddhist!
48834,Lisa,it sounded like you were.
45545,Lisa,"no, i..."
50850,Lisa,a mini black hole!
52468,Lisa,shopping: it's the most fun you can have standing up.
49958,Lisa,again with the blonde! why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within?
42223,Lisa,are we done?
52510,Lisa,you parked the car. that helped.
52366,Lisa,"gee, is it always this good?"
43465,Lisa,"no, i can't! i can't eat any of them!"
44332,Lisa,"wait, look."
46726,Lisa,gotta finish. gotta finish. am i using too much glue?
45544,Lisa,"dad, it's a tobacco company. they make billions off the suffering and deaths of others."
52151,Lisa,"bart! stop it. he says ""nevermore"". that's all he'll ever say."
51569,Lisa,"see ya, homer! / bye, dad!"
41899,Lisa,"don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner."
51959,Lisa,"all right maggie, just go to bart."
48117,Lisa,"ooh, everyone's wearing such an interesting costume."
44098,Lisa,"i'll see what else is on. hey, where's the remote?"
43140,Lisa,"but, dad, don't you think..."
43031,Lisa,i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer.
44469,Lisa,yayyy!
49186,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's on the move!
50674,Lisa,somehow i missed that phase.
44358,Lisa,"that's how they want you to feel. but if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
45948,Lisa,"here we are. ""in a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers."""
44574,Lisa,i think they're running out of tomatoes.
45362,Lisa,"gee, bart, maybe you were right."
47536,Lisa,wow... mom and dad sure are having fun.
49761,Lisa,you ruined it on purpose. you want the old folks to be zombies -- because it makes your jobs easier!
49198,Lisa,"boy, aspen sure is ritzy. even the winos look better."
44842,Lisa,dad?
48161,Lisa,"arrivedérci, ignorance!"
41830,Lisa,you give that back. that belongs to me! that's mine!
47969,Lisa,i've been to paris / and london and tokyo town / but one crazy burg / has 'em all beat hands down...
42380,Lisa,"ralph, i think you're nice but, i'm just not ready for this kind of thing. do you understand?"
45834,Lisa,"wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
41932,Lisa,uh... take us to the video store.
48782,Lisa,"this film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. mixed signals, hmm."
48063,Lisa,can i sleep with you guys tonight?
44261,Lisa,"yeah, krabappel. they were naked in the closet together."
50868,Lisa,i thought i was the favorite.
46303,Lisa,my dad's not here? i need a ride to school.
51527,Lisa,"oh, dad, you don't want details. no one wants to see the sausage being made."
50964,Lisa,what's hopeless?
45501,Lisa,don't! uh... um... it's low-fat!
44188,Lisa,"thank you, dr. hibbert. your trust means so much to me."
42898,Lisa,it's great. it's really great.
51546,Lisa,is kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
47689,Lisa,i can't believe my mom would cheat.
42615,Lisa,"um... uh, well... uh..."
48742,Lisa,a sports bra?
50511,Lisa,"this game has all the best college marching bands! from the precision footwork of ohio state to the lame, dead-on-arrival humor of stanford!"
44761,Lisa,"i think you're a hero, dad."
42835,Lisa,dad...
43704,Lisa,"but i've caused so much trouble already, general washington. i can't go on."
43241,Lisa,how did you get that gash on your forehead?
49854,Lisa,"elementary, my dear simpson."
43601,Lisa,"oh no. inside, the evil bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
47734,Lisa,"you're successful too, mom. you made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise."
43541,Lisa,neat!
51323,Lisa,"listen, we're both eight years old. can't we just play monopoly or something?"
43884,Lisa,"well, it beats doing stuff."
43226,Lisa,guess what -- hugh and i are getting married.
51675,Lisa,i am judging you.
47799,Lisa,no.
51520,Lisa,he's my dad.
47062,Lisa,"dad, my life lacks direction!"
50901,Lisa,"full house! aces over threes! take that, rich-texan-oh-oh-one, and sideshow-bob-at-springfield- penitentiary. ha! i'm going all in!"
41828,Lisa,"i'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
47980,Lisa,is it possible to get a green spotlight?
44815,Lisa,"you know, bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news."
46962,Lisa,"hmm, this is an interesting old book."
52179,Lisa,"well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but i think you're referring to a pawn."
47774,Lisa,"eww, gross! i bet you can't twist it."
46704,Lisa,i'm more than okay!...
44233,Lisa,wait! dr. hibbert!
44805,Lisa,"it is, isn't it?"
51300,Lisa,oh.
42213,Lisa,to shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
51103,Lisa,--like someone faked being hit so they wouldn't be a suspect.
51589,Lisa,neither do you!
42667,Lisa,what? who? huh? what?
43472,Lisa,ah... miss hoover? i don't think i can dissect an animal. i think it's wrong.
42234,Lisa,"as little miss springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to america, the land of opportunity."
43700,Lisa,i was so sure...
51927,Lisa,well... hm...
42402,Lisa,uh... ralph?
52138,Lisa,stop!
45912,Lisa,"oh, that's it!"
50225,Lisa,i'll tell you later.
49842,Lisa,hi. now what are you up to?
48862,Lisa,"oh no, i ripped it."
51847,Lisa,what's his name?
42353,Lisa,i am the lizard queen!
48984,Lisa,i learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.
47131,Lisa,clara?! he's got a girlfriend! i feel like such an idiot.
47633,Lisa,but i didn't read my poem!
49224,Lisa,now gimme my license! give everyone their license!
49081,Lisa,"well, according to aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"
45946,Lisa,"stoats are weasels, bart. they don't come in cans."
46534,Lisa,maybe we should try to calm dad down.
43494,Lisa,"but why, apu?"
49765,Lisa,excuse me? i think this fell off your hat.
51914,Lisa,"i'm not greasing the wheels, dad. i like my teacher."
42646,Lisa,mommm!
42990,Lisa,"all right, bob! now it's personal!!"
51931,Lisa,don't bart! he's a friend of nelson muntz.
49627,Lisa,"listen, you're a persistent fellow, but i--"
49180,Lisa,mom and dad are spying on you. there's a tracking chip in your cell phone!
50168,Lisa,the seven of clubs.
51215,Lisa,"please, don't do this, dad! i don't know what horrors you saw in boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
51314,Lisa,"i'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, i'm not pigeonholing... is it a catholic thing?"
44354,Lisa,sorry. sorry. i know we'll be friends. talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
45918,Lisa,ow! son of a...
45664,Lisa,excellent.
49972,Lisa,and not all old people are bad drivers!
46115,Lisa,"you know what'd be good with these, is some ms. butterworth."
48077,Lisa,"okay, i'll watch tv."
45696,Lisa,"i hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win playing ""stars and stripes forever""? it's so beginner band, and we're advanced beginner band."
45187,Lisa,and guess who's been practicing medicine without a license...
47891,Lisa,that's a bread compartment.
44927,Lisa,you have a pen glued to your cowlick.
50550,Lisa,can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
46246,Lisa,"hey, you didn't see a warthog!"
50308,Lisa,and i locked the back door!
51701,Lisa,parking lot.
46280,Lisa,"hang on, linguo. you'll be up and conjugating in no time."
46401,Lisa,moe?
42978,Lisa,there's no councilman les wynan.
43439,Lisa,we give up.
41807,Lisa,honest abe. he'll show me the way.
49362,Lisa,a two-nicorn!
43022,Lisa,"bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
43254,Lisa,what about my family's tradition?
50564,Lisa,a dog wrote a bestseller?! aargh! all i've done is procrastinate! who am i kidding? there will never be a book with my name on it.
46545,Lisa,this is not a good time.
46871,Lisa,yeah! go ice-o-topes!
45626,Lisa,"no they won't. we'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? guys...?"
45760,Lisa,"hey, where's maggie?"
45600,Lisa,nobody! you're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy.
50775,Lisa,i'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.
47427,Lisa,"hi, janey... branford marsalis' car broke down outside your house? and he's just jamming 'til wynton shows up? oh..."
50100,Lisa,"wow, i'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
47138,Lisa,need-help-now-come-with-me-done-something-terrible!
41866,Lisa,i bet the rabbi misses krusty.
45498,Lisa,we can find him faster by splitting up. you take fried foods. you take salty snacks. i'll take desserts. break!
50362,Lisa,no!
42536,Lisa,"wow, look at all this be sharps merchandise! lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam..."
46608,Lisa,but i'm just a little girl.
46059,Lisa,"well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
46358,Lisa,/ wow.
47008,Lisa,what?!
49889,Lisa,"quick, we've got to get them back!"
51489,Lisa,i wish i could live in there.
42219,Lisa,she's beautiful.
43529,Lisa,"i don't know, bart. something tells me willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine."
50157,Lisa,"no offense dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams."
49253,Lisa,you got highlights in your hair!
45524,Lisa,they must be starting a new civilization on mars with our best and brightest.
45672,Lisa,you mean hawaii?
47365,Lisa,"bart, why are we fighting?"
43975,Lisa,"oh, no!"
41993,Lisa,can i watch football with you again next sunday?
45645,Lisa,no it's not!
47388,Lisa,don't you need training for that?
43566,Lisa,"mona simpson, mona stevens, martha stewart, penelope olsen, muddy mae suggins..."
47595,Lisa,"no, pie man! don't do it!"
51608,Lisa,fine.
51297,Lisa,"new kid? um, have you made any friends?"
50239,Lisa,don't dare bring that thing in here!
48153,Lisa,you don't have a tail anymore.
44781,Lisa,"i don't need a co-anchor. i'm a straight ""a"" student."
42652,Lisa,"but dad, if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of florida, i'll be the laughing stock of the whole school."
46979,Lisa,"it's three hundred, mom."
49086,Lisa,i'm making a documentary about a very special family.
46017,Lisa,"oh mom, those loggers chopped down the tree! why did i have to leave my post?"
49312,Lisa,you'll always have bart. always.
48892,Lisa,he wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
46310,Lisa,there's the school!
50086,Lisa,it's me!
49467,Lisa,"oh. well, i seek it so i can find my sister. how do you know about the gem?"
42307,Lisa,davah hassahoff.
50543,Lisa,wait! wait! come back! dad! follow that dinosaur!
46576,Lisa,"so bart, when does the killing start?"
48214,Lisa,"""my dearest mona. you've just left my arms to return to your husband, abe, and already i ache for you."""
48437,Lisa,"oh michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
46107,Lisa,"oh, dad."
46520,Lisa,francis of assisi .
50794,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i don't really want to be here."
42883,Lisa,"you're thinking of bears, mom."
49738,Lisa,fine. what's their number?
45472,Lisa,"who are ""they,"" exactly?"
51661,Lisa,"well, i guess you and i are in charge now, bart. but if we split the chores, i'm sure we can... what are you doing?!"
43736,Lisa,"yes, but..."
51590,Lisa,"mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend?!"
44812,Lisa,"no, you can't hurt bart. he's... well, he's... your son!"
46847,Lisa,i'm sorry. they don't publish that any more.
51958,Lisa,"no, maggie, don't go for the glitter. look for substance."
42378,Lisa,i get the idea.
47015,Lisa,but you don't play the piano.
46862,Lisa,be careful a-- uh-oh.
50270,Lisa,"sorry you broke up with your friends, mom."
45862,Lisa,"all right, i'll be the stupid curtain puller."
48575,Lisa,ta-da!
50371,Lisa,"oh, it's a lot less dangerous than you think. you can see me do it again in a talent show next week."
50776,Lisa,that's my brother! four years out of four.
48887,Lisa,"macbeth, act one, scene seven. look it up!"
42180,Lisa,he's really having trouble keeping his balance.
42925,Lisa,yeah. nice gag.
42096,Lisa,that's right. it was i.
51023,Lisa,they're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.
44532,Lisa,"don't feel sorry for me, mom. i feel sorry for you."
48672,Lisa,"dad, you're out of shape even for an american."
46493,Lisa,"i'm serious, make with the pony."
46002,Lisa,all right! a care bucket.
42102,Lisa,he is alive. he's wagging his tail.
50001,Lisa,oh my god! mom! thank you! i just need my...
45657,Lisa,you mean like when you hid inside the conga drum to scare ricky?
43580,Lisa,da-ad! why aren't you looking?
46134,Lisa,and you're not doing it out of spite?
44613,Lisa,well... if we did set fire to the house...
49817,Lisa,to the reference desk!
41838,Lisa,i think this is something bart would really have enjoyed. but it's the only way he'll learn.
50088,Lisa,"hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball! connie mack, sandy alomar, terry francona, pinky higgins--"
43235,Lisa,dad!
45669,Lisa,"mom, i lost dad and bart."
50341,Lisa,where am i? this neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... sesame street.
42156,Lisa,"finally, a copy of ""ethan frome"" to call my own."
49446,Lisa,can't get enough.
45495,Lisa,"dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?"
51797,Lisa,you've got a gift!
50233,Lisa,so you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
50320,Lisa,so i guess the lesson here is...
44374,Lisa,"i can't do this, bart. i'm not strong enough."
43021,Lisa,so here's where you're hiding.
49022,Lisa,"well, since you cared enough to apply peer pressure..."
42037,Lisa,"mom, bart's making faces at me."
42297,Lisa,"dad, was that your commercial?"
51019,Lisa,"okay, i also know of a puppet show..."
47232,Lisa,i could join past presidents. like otto... or krusty!
43265,Lisa,"wow. what else did you do, dad?"
44450,Lisa,never mind.
43255,Lisa,but you promised my dad you would.
49788,Lisa,"no, this can't be right."
46462,Lisa,i'm going out for a walk.
51672,Lisa,maxine lombard.
47972,Lisa,and skinner / and grampa / and ol' disco stu...
51597,Lisa,"but when i grow up, i'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever. and i'll always love you."
50404,Lisa,we haven't even gotten our salads yet.
44974,Lisa,no doubt! can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
42217,Lisa,but that ride meant everything to him!
44359,Lisa,"hey, what about me? i'm a lowly maggot!"
43763,Lisa,sure!
44505,Lisa,don't give up! i'm sure we'll find something!
51337,Lisa,you're just taking advantage of the situation.
42630,Lisa,"dad, look, i made fish sticks. they're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out."
51524,Lisa,"in the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. he made me a better person, because that's what heroes do."
43989,Lisa,you've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. why would she leave you now?
50714,Lisa,da-ad!
50648,Lisa,that's not you.
46217,Lisa,please? it's for science.
44203,Lisa,"come on, maggie... good maggie... the talcum powder's not to play with..."
44133,Lisa,wow! / alright! / cool!
44793,Lisa,they want cheap sentiment? i'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
50042,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
46461,Lisa,"no! look, i'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. i'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
48888,Lisa,"look, that's sideshow bob's mother -- dame judith underdunk! she's the greatest classical actress of her generation."
48206,Lisa,"that's quite a tale, grampa."
43169,Lisa,it says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.
44266,Lisa,halogen lamps? kilim rugs? you can't afford this how can you afford this?
49462,Lisa,big ring... big ring...
41741,Lisa,maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. lets see...
49252,Lisa,dad? did you come into some money we don't know about?
46011,Lisa,"ew, someone's been marking their territory."
49856,Lisa,anytime.
41934,Lisa,"dad, can you take me to dr. hibbert's office?"
48473,Lisa,"no, buttercup! no!"
43430,Lisa,"yeah. it seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy pat boone-ish quality to it."
46435,Lisa,we'll never find the body under all this water.
50510,Lisa,video game convention!
47791,Lisa,it doesn't seem fair to the regular visitors.
47567,Lisa,"no. we're gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they don't have one moment of fun."
49248,Lisa,"hey, there are no lenses in these glasses..."
48338,Lisa,i think we're heading for disaster / and most of you will not be saved...
51062,Lisa,principal skinner...
42489,Lisa,i learned how many drams in a pennyweight.
50944,Lisa,amen.
44178,Lisa,i'll do it! i'll babysit!
46297,Lisa,what do your friends call you?
50729,Lisa,"dad, they can only go three miles an hour!"
47283,Lisa,"okay, let me take figure skating."
44473,Lisa,what position have you got for me?
50166,Lisa,ice cold.
44985,Lisa,you don't understand. i don't belong there. the other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating. they make me feel like a little baby.
43805,Lisa,he's down there.
50492,Lisa,okay: a--
47356,Lisa,bart! on't-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.
50263,Lisa,happy new year!
46788,Lisa,"""dear dad, took money for the school book fair."""
51625,Lisa,oh no.
50312,Lisa,"all right, bart. what are you up to now?"
47688,Lisa,"hurry, mom!"
41676,Lisa,is it possible i've met a teacher who doesn't like me?!
46823,Lisa,"believe me, he doesn't. his act is getting old fast."
45447,Lisa,don't you serve anything that's even remotely japanese?
52238,Lisa,just look!
45653,Lisa,"stupid, inconsiderate bunch of jerks... i can't believe, after i..."
49378,Lisa,isn't that a little clichéd?
47271,Lisa,"i see. principal skinner, may i make an announcement to the school?"
48986,Lisa,"i based my costume on the books, not the movies."
42791,Lisa,"wow, i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
43060,Lisa,for the greater good.
50905,Lisa,this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me! i was ivy! strong ivy!
48002,Lisa,"dad, you sabotaged cameron for me!"
43676,Lisa,he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
51280,Lisa,"actually, i've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug."
47075,Lisa,hey.
50411,Lisa,"bart, i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser."
44635,Lisa,what about the rest of us?
46369,Lisa,this isn't my wand. it's a twizzler!
48356,Lisa,that's right. i'm toilet.
52023,Lisa,"""lullaby and good night / go to bed and sleep tight / close your eyes, start to yawn / pleasant dreams until the dawn."""
42065,Lisa,to the game.
44209,Lisa,excuse me?
44888,Lisa,dad! you're headed for the river again!
52272,Lisa,"anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken."
45235,Lisa,"how'd you know your plan would work, mom?"
44975,Lisa,"oh. so, i guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?"
45512,Lisa,i don't think so!
45563,Lisa,"dad, they have those everywhere."
42268,Lisa,"dad, you've got to let bart see that movie. i've never seen him like this. he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine."
49401,Lisa,"no, that's it."
51348,Lisa,"the democratic party pantheon. such lofty ideals! and here come the spirits... michael dukakis, walter mondale, john kerry?! these are all losers!"
48585,Lisa,wait! haven't you learned a lesson here? over-fishing and greed have brought this town nothing but rack and ruin.
51434,Lisa,ew.
43867,Lisa,"uh, mom, i'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."
47306,Lisa,"oh, my god! we've made a terrible mistake. this tunnel comes out in the worst possible place."
50989,Lisa,where are we going?
46930,Lisa,why did you do that?
52144,Lisa,"for your information, i'm about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe."
46549,Lisa,"hey, where's our parents?"
50249,Lisa,"o tannenbaum, o tannenbaum..."
50286,Lisa,no. it's oddly dehumanizing.
51146,Lisa,"all the greats are here -- jellyroll jones, boston cream basie, birthmark billy jackson, grabass walker, the fatneck sisters, and... bleeding gums murphy?!"
47677,Lisa,"to get maggie in time, we'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body's information super-highway!"
47790,Lisa,mom! dad built a device that would be deadly in the wrong hands! and he's holding it!
44880,Lisa,look out!
45206,Lisa,"so, is he alive or not?"
51302,Lisa,and don't you hate being the middle child?
48313,Lisa,"dad, that's mac tonight."
47808,Lisa,"well, if hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport."
49151,Lisa,"thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
49400,Lisa,"as a rational skeptic, i find that hard to believe. also, as a vegetarian, i hope there's not meat in that sauce."
49871,Lisa,mr. flanders invited us to israel. i think he wants to get dad into heaven.
43003,Lisa,"dad, look!"
49632,Lisa,you should've seen the look on krabappel's face!
49505,Lisa,"every june sixteenth, lovers of james joyce follow the route traveled by leopold bloom in the novel ""ulysses."""
44061,Lisa,"okay, start with diagonal colors."
51409,Lisa,and the worst one of all is--

47765,Lisa,get me number nine / and if you disconnect me / i'll chop off your be...
45967,Lisa,daaaad!
48150,Lisa,and i will be your campaign manager!
44091,Lisa,we'll help you.
50307,Lisa,dad! i know what you did!
48764,Lisa,"martin, anything?"
42900,Lisa,is it okay?!
50326,Lisa,this is so sad. can we help her?
49846,Lisa,you would mess up mom and dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
41597,Lisa,"look, my point is, show jenda you want to be successful and she might take you back. it's never too late for love."
46460,Lisa,no.
46279,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
49665,Lisa,"uh-huh, what's an esbat?"
46957,Lisa,"there are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. the bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. and with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
50132,Lisa,you're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.
46546,Lisa,"mom, did you sleep well at your sisters'?"
47709,Lisa,"hey, i don't look so bad."
42809,Lisa,hot dogs / armour hot dogs...
43402,Lisa,tito puente?
48685,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, mom. you're like christopher columbus -- you discovered something millions of people knew about before you."
44547,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. we'll help you study."
52121,Lisa,did too.
49554,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. these girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. i hope you understand."
49283,Lisa,sorry.
48079,Lisa,i can't keep sleeping in mom and dad's room.
51768,Lisa,i'm done.
52154,Lisa,"my brother's using worms but i who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing."
48515,Lisa,philistines.
51476,Lisa,this one whistled at me!
46689,Lisa,"congratulations, dad. the first step is admitting it."
48476,Lisa,i guess that's it. these animals are all gonna die.
48523,Lisa,"mr. szyslak -- there must be some person, possibly in this very room, who believed in you when no one else did."
43389,Lisa,could not!
44644,Lisa,wait! we're not savages! we live in a society of law. milhouse has the right to a fair trial!
49418,Lisa,"pride is to ""downfall"" as ""overconfidence"" is to..."
44225,Lisa,bart! you need first aid! let me in!
44900,Lisa,you broke it!
49779,Lisa,i saw you grooving to the beat! you gotta pay for that!
44474,Lisa,that's right. a girl wants to play football. how about that?
50030,Lisa,"maggie, your big sister is leaving for a more artistic life. i'll send for you when i'm famous. we'll take the town by storm like the brontë sisters."
43595,Lisa,"i will, mom."
43920,Lisa,"science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and chinese food. but i can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
43780,Lisa,"so how's the national grammar rodeo, bart?"
51966,Lisa,yeah.
47300,Lisa,"dad, no! you turned into a roundabout!"
44421,Lisa,mom!
49917,Lisa,"hurry, dad, hurry!"
44397,Lisa,"mom, are those rabbits dead?"
48951,Lisa,"hey, i was trying to help him. at worst, i'm an accomplice. i'm an accomplice!"
42979,Lisa,i don't think bob won that election legally. i can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
51388,Lisa,what? n.c. wyeth! these are book illustrations!
51942,Lisa,here.
43209,Lisa,no. it couldn't be...
47197,Lisa,a world without death...
44446,Lisa,"mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!"
51496,Lisa,"hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: ""johan oldenveldt."""
50671,Lisa,it's... nice.
42364,Lisa,excuse me.
50788,Lisa,that's mine!
41882,Lisa,peace on earth.
50228,Lisa,this is where we're ditching the dog?
46697,Lisa,i liked all the roles filled by minority actors.
43340,Lisa,it's only maggie.
44194,Lisa,certainly.
48881,Lisa,that commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here!
44506,Lisa,"c'mon, c'mon! a bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! she suddenly uncovers a white patch."
43216,Lisa,"yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings."
44086,Lisa,"oh, mom, no!"
42529,Lisa,we were asking you to appear on krusty's come back special.
49522,Lisa,what will springfield be like in fifty years? let's see what the computer says:
41967,Lisa,bart!
47712,Lisa,no thanks. i'm gonna stay in the library and do a little reading.
47611,Lisa,can i have a lollipop?
46040,Lisa,not my dad.
41662,Lisa,"okay, i can talk my way out of this."
51196,Lisa,something happened to dad on that trip. this is worse than when he went to new orleans and came back with the southern accent.
49887,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! i'll never get that image out of my head!
50847,Lisa,"hey! i specifically said no critics! this is outrageous! ooh, but they like me!"
47222,Lisa,ow!
49061,Lisa,he wants to know your name.
43261,Lisa,"wow. now that i know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?"
45528,Lisa,no it isn't. it's totally inaccurate--
50343,Lisa,help! i'm trapped in an alternate dimension! an existential netherspace!
51677,Lisa,what!?!?
48423,Lisa,"but, grampa, in nineteen forty-two, they only played women's baseball here."
48357,Lisa,"well, what can i do? they won't let me in the boys' school."
48976,Lisa,i thought i turned that tape off.
51099,Lisa,and so i've learned that the only true batmen are christian bale and adam west. why are you washing bumblebee man's pants?
51123,Lisa,it came with fries or salad.
51285,Lisa,dad! maggie's rolling away!
45109,Lisa,"well, actually, i do feel a little feverish."
44276,Lisa,"bart, that is a new low."
44009,Lisa,nelson! um... that note milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. it was from... me.
50876,Lisa,i guess.
49722,Lisa,"if you're not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me."
43933,Lisa,they're evolving so quickly! they've already reached the renaissance... wait! one of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral! i've created lutherans!
50269,Lisa,"hey, does dad know you and the cool moms broke up?"
42849,Lisa,but...
50787,Lisa,"so, when's the party?"
48739,Lisa,finally! i knew we could solve that maze using tremaux's algorithm.
41652,Lisa,"oh, no. now i'm dad."
50364,Lisa,"no, i shouldn't -- i won't."
41906,Lisa,"i'm sorry dad, i don't feel much like eating."
42371,Lisa,happy valentine's.
51446,Lisa,this is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
51232,Lisa,we thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide...
50705,Lisa,"dad, i wanted to give you a heads-up. mom's birthday is tomorrow. it's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting."
42970,Lisa,"dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is."
42149,Lisa,i see your point.
46898,Lisa,"so many categories... gym teacher of the year, substitute teacher of the year, most wheelchair-accessible school award?"
44949,Lisa,"so, there i am being nice to alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me."
49487,Lisa,um... this one?
49003,Lisa,how do you cope with it?
44543,Lisa,wait a second! you planted a phony skeleton for me to find! this was all a big hoax.
50243,Lisa,"see? every time we get a tree, mom disappears!"
48341,Lisa,"okay, the engine room is just through this flooded area. somebody has to take the rope, swim through to the other side, and tie it off so we can use it as an underwater guide line."
47096,Lisa,"oh, a jigsaw puzzle..."
50566,Lisa,i'm in.
51287,Lisa,"that's it, maggie! use the dino-wand!"
48168,Lisa,thank you. i've been studying. i even made flash cards!
44913,Lisa,"hey, public display."
49241,Lisa,i win!
47748,Lisa,"i've never disobeyed mom before. is this a step i'm really willing to take? i don't know. the more i think about it, the..."
48554,Lisa,it would be the day my childhood ended.
42595,Lisa,"no, dad."
48991,Lisa,no.
51145,Lisa,whatever bart's doing it's got to be pretty bad for him to get me tickets to this amazing jam session!
44592,Lisa,sure we do. ding ding ding ding ding.
42069,Lisa,"no mom, it counts as a hit. dad just won the game."
44520,Lisa,wow... so lifelike.
44850,Lisa,yes.
46386,Lisa,woo hoo!
50679,Lisa,"man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it."
47495,Lisa,you can do it. red!
47906,Lisa,"ah, rats."
48642,Lisa,and that's how a presidential veto gets overridden. any questions?
42122,Lisa,"what a beautiful story, sideshow bob. you're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
50408,Lisa,"bart, this isn't a photograph. i'm not just gonna paint you into--"
52252,Lisa,but captain murdock!
42118,Lisa,i'm sorry?
50105,Lisa,"bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. don't swing at anything!"
45423,Lisa,"da-ad! oh, dr. hawking. we had such a beautiful dream. what went wrong?"
47777,Lisa,why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
46732,Lisa,doogie howser went to college when he was my age.
46232,Lisa,"the pungent vinegar and tangy roquefort block the smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless."
48687,Lisa,"bart, it's not saturday."
43589,Lisa,helium. sideshow bob is in the duff blimp!
52314,Lisa,should i have my father arrested?
47770,Lisa,spitballs!
49369,Lisa,"i'd love to! oh, but i'm supposed to attend the model u.n. this weekend. i'm the delegate from azerbaijan, and i'm threatening a rice tariff!"
47471,Lisa,"it's called goth, eternally clueless one. my new name is ravencrow never-smiles."
51149,Lisa,"aw, c'mon."
41848,Lisa,looking at you with quiet awe.
47646,Lisa,burns owns everything! i've gotta speak out before it's too late!
45654,Lisa,lucy?
41731,Lisa,"hurry, mom! if we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
43881,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever."
51585,Lisa,what's the advice?
46035,Lisa,dad?? the panda was you?
49471,Lisa,because i cleverly deduced the answer to springfield's biggest ring. voila!
48517,Lisa,"moe, you're a published author!"
52348,Lisa,and they're not shy about expressing it.
43553,Lisa,"hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
44280,Lisa,and you have to cut these up first. otherwise animals get caught in them.
49643,Lisa,why would willie do that?
46565,Lisa,"well bart, you really understand women."
49264,Lisa,a couple hours? i can do the sunday puzzle in less than one hour!
42202,Lisa,"dad, can i ask you a question?"
51764,Lisa,"you know, dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient."
49327,Lisa,to that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive!
48175,Lisa,milhouse! just what is going on?
42232,Lisa,one! two! three! four!
47893,Lisa,yay!
49073,Lisa,i am a born filmmaker!
50374,Lisa,"the can is in two halves, and they slide apart."
43428,Lisa,you don't understand. mom and dad take good care of us.
51355,Lisa,"congratulations, isabel. i truly hope you enjoy the friday morning council meetings and the, the free snickerdoodle cookies."
52335,Lisa,"hello, mr. powell"
48625,Lisa,the people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land.
45041,Lisa,you had it on the way over!
46624,Lisa,"don't worry, beloved parents. god won't let anything happen to me."
45136,Lisa,i guess i don't have much choice.
51684,Lisa,this is the robot who claims to be from the future.
44157,Lisa,and vice versa.
47670,Lisa,you have a newspaper too?
49974,Lisa,"when there's cruelty involved, bart sure knows his history."
43555,Lisa,"hi, everybody."
43112,Lisa,"remember, dad. all glory is fleeting."
51012,Lisa,"oh great, another invasive skype from mil-- huh?"
42183,Lisa,crandall!
49493,Lisa,well that sucked! / there's a day we'll never get back! / i was so bored.
44688,Lisa,"for your information, none of your business!"
49258,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
42004,Lisa,"you know, dad, sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
48296,Lisa,mother-flippers? what's this show about?
42151,Lisa,eleven hundred and fifty bones.
47687,Lisa,you feed us on twelve dollars a week?
47745,Lisa,it's gonna be a let-down going to school tomorrow. we have to make a pilgrim out of felt.
43105,Lisa,warning. warning. doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores.
44759,Lisa,"be careful, dad."
43090,Lisa,"look on the bright side, dad. did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
43513,Lisa,"if your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them."
49787,Lisa,i can't wait to see what noble branches lie in the simpson family foliage!
48571,Lisa,"mom, i understand your psychological need, but i'm not sure what you can do."
42014,Lisa,my third husband bought me this.
46498,Lisa,these hotels are made of legos.
47481,Lisa,"that's right! this spells ""dog."""
48878,Lisa,we're going to a rest'rant grand op'niiiiiiiing... / but don't fill up on bread!
46170,Lisa,"it's okay, but it's missing a piece."
43282,Lisa,he's giving them a bath!
49265,Lisa,a couple of hours...
44611,Lisa,ugh! one of them's playing my saxophone!
49962,Lisa,the end.
42370,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
44405,Lisa,"...so in 1966, a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam, where he rose to become platoon sergeant. ralph?"
50893,Lisa,"all due respect, mr. flanders, could i have a little privacy?"
47210,Lisa,but it's not too late. you can still fly to stockholm.
50077,Lisa,there's a car in the parking lot with a yale sticker on it! it's gotta be you.
45507,Lisa,so you were going to kill us.
52347,Lisa,the cat is named scratchy.
44390,Lisa,"aw, i'd love to see new york. we could all go with the bus company's special supersitter fare!"
42351,Lisa,aaaahhhh!!!
46510,Lisa,"fine, i'll talk like this."
41591,Lisa,yeah. i miss christmas.
41734,Lisa,"perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
50314,Lisa,"thanks, sweetie."
49032,Lisa,where's all the money?
49619,Lisa,you're on.
48386,Lisa,"that's right, everyone. the best math student in the whole school is a girl!"
47060,Lisa,"well, i am young, gifted and yellow. my interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings..."
44550,Lisa,"""on the closing day!/ the escrow agents pay!/ taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to fannie mae!"""
44594,Lisa,"that's a good suggestion, mom."
43010,Lisa,okay.
46347,Lisa,got any more tall tales?
51058,Lisa,more than i want unicorns to be real!
46431,Lisa,"you know, if dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
50558,Lisa,"spot, stop, sop, top-tops, pot-pots, opt-opts, post!"
45744,Lisa,it's going into that building.
47978,Lisa,"i really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, dad."
51864,Lisa,here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
50615,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't do this. it's not fair how much influence you have!"
48399,Lisa,"well, now it's time for my summer activity. you promised we could go to a museum."
43548,Lisa,dad?
49798,Lisa,so dusty.
46556,Lisa,"principal skinner, you're just stealing."
48186,Lisa,sideshow bob!
47579,Lisa,these giant vegetables are amazing.
44414,Lisa,i said no!
46018,Lisa,"lightning?! well, at least it wasn't my fault."
43039,Lisa,"cut it out, bart!"
45008,Lisa,okay. umm... automatic...
52229,Lisa,"yeah, beg me, bart. beg me!"
45259,Lisa,you gave away my room!
45943,Lisa,"oh, no. you poor thing. here..."
49981,Lisa,he's got koi!
44246,Lisa,"hey, bart. how's your arm?"
43969,Lisa,"he's not a drifter, mom. that's mr. burns's son, larry."
47223,Lisa,doesn't this armoire belong to mr. flanders?
49056,Lisa,lisa's brother.
51662,Lisa,oh no! you're not leaving me to clean this up!
47276,Lisa,they've taken away our crepe paper.
47985,Lisa,but instead of singing carols / i was digging snowball's grave...
48647,Lisa,your minds are opening! take it home!
52055,Lisa,he brought us gifts. his first unselfish act.
48340,Lisa,this hatchway is jammed!
48657,Lisa,"check out this pinball machine! ""chevy chase in 'foul play'."""
41796,Lisa,have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability?
47100,Lisa,he's working on a jigsaw puzzle.
51463,Lisa,"uh... bob, you can't kill us without a little singing, right?"
41951,Lisa,did you hear that maggie? another baby in the house.
47499,Lisa,so maggie's not a genius?
47853,Lisa,"bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived."
48870,Lisa,"and dad, i hope you learned something from this."
46442,Lisa,"well, at least it's tasteful."
43074,Lisa,yay!
49649,Lisa,"yes, and-- oh, go ahead."
42808,Lisa,we didn't invite the other babies. maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
46560,Lisa,nooo!
42248,Lisa,you said he went bowling!
49678,Lisa,"um, it's the wiccan home page."
45537,Lisa,"all right. almost done, my little friend. soon you'll be a nice, cool... rat?!"
47612,Lisa,"dad, he's deaf."
49783,Lisa,there is no dress. it's just pins! help me!
47146,Lisa,"janey, more tea?"
50766,Lisa,"first of all, congratulations on getting the lead."
47654,Lisa,everyone chickened out. except ralph. he got poached by the chicago tribune.
51609,Lisa,"as the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods."
46578,Lisa,"gee buck, your old films are as violent as today's!"
49348,Lisa,"equalia. where everyone is equal, but we're in charge. i mean, somebody has to be, right?"
51738,Lisa,we've left earth's atmosphere!
49975,Lisa,"dad, i'm gonna need some help getting this off."
51407,Lisa,they've found us!
48203,Lisa,what are you doing in the chimney?
42643,Lisa,do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? i mean we haven't had a meal with mom all week. and she hasn't even started my costume for the geography pageant.
45932,Lisa,"yeah, right. / i'm sure. / pffft."
48801,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, dad!"
44470,Lisa,did anyone stop that robber?
43757,Lisa,i'm going after him!
50930,Lisa,"oh, thank god! just a dream!"
42553,Lisa,three little maids from school are we / pert as a schoolgirl well can be / filled to the brim with girlish glee / three little maids from school...
43988,Lisa,"oh, okay. can i stay up?"
50120,Lisa,bart!
45720,Lisa,why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?
50913,Lisa,lisa.
47444,Lisa,"oh bart, that's really sweet."
42314,Lisa,did too.
51166,Lisa,samurai shampoo blast!
50215,Lisa,"yes, i believe i have your pigeon, ""raymond bird,"" and i need to know how to return him to you."
49662,Lisa,why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts? why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts?
52350,Lisa,"bye, unky herb."
47152,Lisa,"actually, frank lloyd wright endured a lot of harsh criticism."
44931,Lisa,did she just tell me to shut up?
51286,Lisa,"if they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!"
50443,Lisa,"it's like five classrooms in one! a science room... student lounge... mathnasium... an experimental theater! all set for a production of samuel beckett's ""endgame""!"
51470,Lisa,"o-kay. well, can you please be nicer to our grampa? for me? i love grampa. you may not realize it, but he's a treasure."
46940,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. this first time we'll only take a few steps outside."
45024,Lisa,fake mustache.
51687,Lisa,"professor farnsworth, i'm dying to know how you got here. was it a time machine?"
45149,Lisa,can i fluff your pillow?
44291,Lisa,there's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
45391,Lisa,"hi, mr. flanders, i see you're reading the newspaper."
48281,Lisa,"aw dad, did my story make you cry?"
45549,Lisa,"dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
42210,Lisa,"i'd like to be alone, please."
47746,Lisa,oh! that'd be wonderful! oh i'd -- i'd have to ask my mom.
47085,Lisa,"mr. mayor, you can't flip-flop on this! we'll miss the meteor shower."
42573,Lisa,is it my imagination or is tv getting worse?
49019,Lisa,"i'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital."
44908,Lisa,yayyy!
43782,Lisa,"hmm... you could travel for free if you were a stewardess. well, how badly do you want to get home? all right, all right, how about a courier? they travel for free, too. no, that's a terrier. they're dogs."
47848,Lisa,glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
47924,Lisa,"no, you do. you're gay for moleman!"
45738,Lisa,"yeah, wish i could be entertained by two cents worth of rubber, shaped like some colorful animal, dancing and twirling, dancing and twirling..."
46238,Lisa,there's gotta be something to eat in this house.
46984,Lisa,...u-g-n. impugn.
48942,Lisa,may i join you?
46443,Lisa,what are they doing to the church?
42956,Lisa,who are all these characters?
45114,Lisa,oh my god! these are the answers to the test! i don't wanna cheat!
50298,Lisa,"scorpions!"""
51955,Lisa,is not.
43499,Lisa,"wow, paul mccartney! i read about you in history class. but where's your wife, linda?"
44111,Lisa,teach us songs and magic tricks.
51184,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom!"
41950,Lisa,"is mom gonna have another baby, dad?"
45172,Lisa,but it's not fair. adults always blame kids for everything!
52206,Lisa,oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby.
45880,Lisa,bart sleeps with raggedy andy.
48599,Lisa,"there are no small parts, just small actors."
50529,Lisa,"we should start our own food blog... ""the three mouthketeers!"""
52441,Lisa,mr. bergstrom!
46404,Lisa,"you did it, moe!"
44400,Lisa,kickin' it! a musical journey through the betty ford center.
50345,Lisa,no one sent me. i just knocked on the door and it opened!
44979,Lisa,"milhouse! i've been lookin' all over for you! listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance. pretty great, huh? see ya."
49941,Lisa,"they're right. if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, i can't let you do it."
50161,Lisa,"mom, could you keep it down a little? i'm trying to study."
48469,Lisa,i'll take him too.
43142,Lisa,"daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
48236,Lisa,"willie, in the next few weeks i'll be teaching you poise, pronunciation and posture. let's see you stand up as straight as you can."
42283,Lisa,"bart, are you taking a bath?"
52284,Lisa,shaft.
46653,Lisa,here we are!
43146,Lisa,"i'd get out, but i don't know where i am."
44596,Lisa,bring it in here.
41629,Lisa,but i am just a simple librarian. i have only read about dancing in books.
51332,Lisa,fine. i gotta go.
50825,Lisa,lisa simpson / lisa simpson...
42877,Lisa,and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
52435,Lisa,not mine.
43645,Lisa,it's okay. those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
46312,Lisa,look out!
44124,Lisa,been there. done it.
49301,Lisa,no bees means no honey...
45233,Lisa,no!
50196,Lisa,"people of springfield, to quote shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
46733,Lisa,but the atmosphere there was so stimulating. it was a bustling marketplace of ideas.
47895,Lisa,oh boy. let's get out of here before dad does a bad impression of mom.
48516,Lisa,"i don't care about my grade. i'm gonna send moe's poem to ""american poetry perspectives."""
47997,Lisa,so i took a stab at writing my own song. something that expresses what's really in my heart.
52075,Lisa,"bart, i'm starting to think you're right. krusty was framed. did he have any enemies?"
50287,Lisa,the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
52464,Lisa,"oh, that's an excellent use of a genius brain: to look after an idiot head."
49666,Lisa,you mean... witches?
42409,Lisa,i've got something for you.
49812,Lisa,i must know!
42692,Lisa,dad... that's over ten thousand miles away.
46533,Lisa,who?
45910,Lisa,swings!
51718,Lisa,"mom, where's dad?"
45372,Lisa,"ohh, poor mr. costner. he tries so hard."
47484,Lisa,"goodbye, maggie. i'm smart enough to know you're better off without me."
49070,Lisa,"well, i guess i could cut loose and do a little homework."
48719,Lisa,"bart, stop! no one's mad at you anymore! right?"
41994,Lisa,"point well taken. uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
50445,Lisa,nothing? and this ruler is unmarked and... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect...and this tooth has no dentin! everything is fake! what is going on?!
45238,Lisa,fine. how about--
41678,Lisa,"wow, i made mom cry. what unimaginable power! i can use this to get anything i want. but right now, all i want is for mom to stop crying."
42805,Lisa,chicks on the bench...
42436,Lisa,mmmm.
43044,Lisa,"that's very nice, dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. however, i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
46394,Lisa,"you keep digging like this, you're gonna go straight through to china."
43543,Lisa,i like school.
49991,Lisa,"now, let's scoot together."
52008,Lisa,"why don't you watch ""krusty the clown""?"
44152,Lisa,no. they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it.
43350,Lisa,what if i could find it?
45782,Lisa,"thanks a lot, bart. all right, how can we pay off our foreign debt?"
42578,Lisa,and...?
46102,Lisa,"ah, now for a little powder blue."
51913,Lisa,no there aren't.
43766,Lisa,woo hoo!
43448,Lisa,"bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. for five dollars, milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
43173,Lisa,"thank you, bart. i promise i won't make fun of you later for this."
43691,Lisa,"you don't have to help me with this, dad."
45249,Lisa,"yeah, but corporate sponsorship cheapens our nation's treasures."
50372,Lisa,there's no chance whatsoever. i'll show you.
50357,Lisa,you never even opened it.
42206,Lisa,oh my god. i'm ugly.
45844,Lisa,"she's not plain, she's beautiful!"
50415,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but i don't love you, milhouse, and i never will."
51863,Lisa,"i think bart's stupid again, mom."
43682,Lisa,miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up. she called me a p.c. thug.
42537,Lisa,i can't believe you're not still popular.
48646,Lisa,pre-tentious laughs at bunuel retrospectives...outsider art made by mental defectives!
49389,Lisa,"dad, you ran for class president?"
50565,Lisa,do i have to do any writing?
51570,Lisa,typical ralph nonsense.
45148,Lisa,"besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you."
42450,Lisa,arrrgh!
43071,Lisa,"the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. all they care about is entertainment. well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- public access television."
52105,Lisa,"he doesn't care, mom."
42448,Lisa,arrrgh!
46875,Lisa,"dad, we have to find a place soon. i really have to go to the bathroom and i'm out of tokens."
48221,Lisa,our instruments are rusting!
41643,Lisa,my first kiss! i always wondered what it would be like!
45988,Lisa,wow. um... i started an organic compost pile at home.
48045,Lisa,"dad, it's a scam!"
48974,Lisa,aren't they beautiful?
45399,Lisa,aren't those supposed to be confidential?
41856,Lisa,"dad, there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall, dinah shore, william shatner, and mel brooks."
42511,Lisa,yay!
43463,Lisa,i can't eat this. i can't eat a poor little lamb!
42050,Lisa,is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
42935,Lisa,"mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?"
50580,Lisa,gaiman!
52233,Lisa,yes.
45616,Lisa,/ push! /
42228,Lisa,oh bart.
51499,Lisa,this is so exciting! my first time establishing provenance!
50060,Lisa,he is. he's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
41705,Lisa,i didn't think you'd understand.
44999,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was work?"
51273,Lisa,no you're not!
41820,Lisa,the flanders are having a beef-a-thon! incredible ned-ibles! maude-acious vittles!.
51766,Lisa,"mom, dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!"
41719,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate.
41635,Lisa,that'll learn `im to bust my tomater.
49304,Lisa,how long is that?
43283,Lisa,maybe we were wrong about burns on this one.
45376,Lisa,"oh, i think this really sucks."
44934,Lisa,"well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. the new malibu stacy has an achievable chest."
50514,Lisa,she means the most authentic.
42635,Lisa,huh?
42493,Lisa,dad?
50075,Lisa,sorry.
49664,Lisa,my name's lisa and i was playing hide and seek when i met you ladies. please don't hurt me.
52227,Lisa,"""howl of the unappreciated"", by lisa simpson. ""i saw the best meal""..."
49403,Lisa,aha!
44382,Lisa,"a medal? thank you, sir!"
51845,Lisa,"a dog! all right, dad!"
50523,Lisa,"mom, they're here on purpose! they're foodies."
44909,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom and dad!"
42947,Lisa,"you know, itchy and scratchy land isn't just for kids. they have a place called parents island."
46117,Lisa,"eww, how long has this baking soda been in here?"
46240,Lisa,yayyy!
47000,Lisa,"uh, i was just k-i-d-d-i-n-g."
48183,Lisa,mozzarella! parmigiano! provolone! pecorino! gorgonzola! fontina! tallegio! bocconcini!
48670,Lisa,"sure, i guess. a couple of birds pooped on it over here."
41659,Lisa,i'm in a coffee house listening to poetry! there's a cat on a table and no one seems to care! this is the single greatest day of my life.
45986,Lisa,"oh, the earth is the best. that's why i'm a vegetarian."
45966,Lisa,dad! dad!
49774,Lisa,oh my gosh. it's the mascot from the 1924 games in chamonix!
50643,Lisa,i never said it was diabolical!
44464,Lisa,"no offense, mom, but that was pretty cool."
51360,Lisa,"huh. you hear that world?! they love my ideas, just not me! and that is half the battle! ha!"
45438,Lisa,never mind. looks like the flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
45256,Lisa,"yeah, well, i hope it doesn't hum too loud, 'cause i have a ton of homework to do, and if i don't finish it by..."
48560,Lisa,what i want can't be bought at any store.
46189,Lisa,"uh, francine? i think we got off to a bad start so... hey!"
42534,Lisa,oh my.
42787,Lisa,just take one of my geodes. the rocks on my desk.
44835,Lisa,where in the world did you find a sled on top of the--
48468,Lisa,i'll take him too!
44169,Lisa,no!
45499,Lisa,"dad, no!"
44803,Lisa,"hey, here's another letter for bart's people."
45595,Lisa,did you see that?
44587,Lisa,"many people in this town / sing like we do / there's mister burns, there's krusty, and even apu."
42995,Lisa,you were ronnie to his nancy!
42473,Lisa,"look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
45983,Lisa,jesse?
52204,Lisa,"mom, bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. steak will make him logy."
50274,Lisa,you could deliver newspapers.
45717,Lisa,"ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to springfield."
43523,Lisa,"it's no use, bart. we can't stay up forever."
45381,Lisa,you.
43100,Lisa,"dad, mom's getting worse. you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. look how tense she is."
51340,Lisa,"organic gardening is an essential part of twenty-first century education, teaching both hands-on--"
45028,Lisa,"bart? uhh, he went to play with a friend."
42824,Lisa,"here, dad. i brought you some nice..."
51980,Lisa,"no, sir."
52379,Lisa,to the pony rides.
50538,Lisa,"no fair! this isn't big, it's medium!"
42827,Lisa,"dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. there's a reason two people come together and stay together. there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. if you want to get mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can."
43702,Lisa,i-i-i...
50549,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
43789,Lisa,"it's in tennessee, right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
51761,Lisa,"well, i guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched."
44300,Lisa,"oh... if i did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. nothing evil."
50952,Lisa,no matter where you go... i will find you!
44675,Lisa,"i love you, mom!"
45419,Lisa,"welcome, everyone. today we embark on a new era of intelligent governance."
51002,Lisa,"...but, bart, i do know this: you will not do better than mary spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game!"
46305,Lisa,that sounds like fat tony.
44897,Lisa,"archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means."
45465,Lisa,bart! bart! krusty just fired his associate producer!
44161,Lisa,what were you thinking?
43987,Lisa,"hi, dad. you know, there's buns in the cabinet."
44180,Lisa,"please, please, please!"
42476,Lisa,maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids. let's put a grownup's name on it.
46229,Lisa,"i have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. i call it ""poindextrose""."
47637,Lisa,"""elegy for geezer rock:"" / ""postcard image, thing to see, / to think of springfield is to think of thee. / what thoughts be-pass a'hind thy mien? / why sky art blue, why trees art green? and what, pray tell, did thine eyes see? / perchance, old friend, they gazed at me. / brought low by nature's oafish hand, / thou crush-ed our reviewing stand / and twixt thy stones glimpsed i the truth: / all things must pass -- thy face, my youth."""
43128,Lisa,"so dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
51533,Lisa,you put it on the fridge!
51991,Lisa,yes!!!
48941,Lisa,"hey martin, what are you doing?"
49075,Lisa,"three it is! you're the teacher, and i accept your decision."
50613,Lisa,"you know, symbols can often rile people up. the swastika... the new york yankees logo..."
49217,Lisa,not anymore!
46178,Lisa,"dad, i'm so proud of you. if you need some inspiration, here's a book of mike farrell's core beliefs."
47319,Lisa,"you can strangle bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
46390,Lisa,what are you doing?
47003,Lisa,"well, i'm just happy you guys all came up here to calgary with me."
45291,Lisa,"wow, i've been a cat, a tree, and cokie roberts! it's happening again! i wonder where i'm going this time."
46171,Lisa,yaaayy!
47373,Lisa,"welcome to the family, snowball iii!"
42437,Lisa,uh huh.
46437,Lisa,and who sent it down that pipe?
42565,Lisa,it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- can't we do something?
48447,Lisa,pleased to meet you.
44430,Lisa,"well, don't worry about me, dad. it's not how it looks, it's how it sounds."
47803,Lisa,you ate fruit! you ate fruit!
50018,Lisa,"that's right! strike the set, pizza party..."
47843,Lisa,no it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! look at it!
51760,Lisa,right. conquering.
47757,Lisa,"be careful, mom! there's hot lava under the ground!"
47092,Lisa,"it worked -- i got my sky back! dad, look!"
52308,Lisa,no.
50727,Lisa,thank you!
47879,Lisa,how dare you make light of that brutal--
43454,Lisa,"i would like to say grace. lord, have mercy on my soul, and mom's soul, and dad's soul, and maggie's soul, and let every soul in christendom..."
46683,Lisa,can she have a pony? and the last line in the scene?
51629,Lisa,i guess you're right.
49898,Lisa,"you're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. now go and be free."
50659,Lisa,"even a kid who wears a ""finding nemo"" back brace has some pride. you went too far this time, bart."
51664,Lisa,"sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, cute! this one..."
51138,Lisa,well then you shouldn't feel bad because i can't imagine myself ever getting married.
51116,Lisa,"i'm sorry i was inconsiderate, milhouse. and furthermore, i respect you more for saying ""no."""
47865,Lisa,"stupid, selfish bart. like he's ever gonna do another nice thing for me..."
45921,Lisa,face it -- they're not great parents.
48444,Lisa,"hey bart, you wanna jam with me?"
45231,Lisa,"bart, they're not here to entertain us."
44043,Lisa,i think they're giving up.
50800,Lisa,"let me explain. i have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if i give up hope. now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, i would like to be alone."
41698,Lisa,but i need you too.
51352,Lisa,"hello, isabel? listen..."
49161,Lisa,really? so what else is in the news?
46106,Lisa,"""lisa: i'm taking the coward's way out. but before i do, i just want you to know: being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are."""
51370,Lisa,thank you.
42669,Lisa,"thank you. and thank you, dad. you got it back, just like you said you would."
50052,Lisa,"ooh, your first customer. be nice!"
42736,Lisa,really?
51846,Lisa,so love at first sight is possible.
44664,Lisa,"ah, shut up. savages."
46153,Lisa,they're recruiting people with subliminal messages!
44497,Lisa,"but they might be paving over rare specimens. pull over so we can complain, dad. come on, who wants to complain with me?"
51025,Lisa,"now remember, i can't sit backwards or i get sick."
48151,Lisa,"well, dad, you tried to make this town a better place. and no matter what, that makes you my hero."
43351,Lisa,"gee, your station has a lot of problems."
46713,Lisa,"um... of course. where do you think i go, baby school?"
49354,Lisa,"mom, i'm meeting juliet after school!"
46006,Lisa,now they're making popcorn...
47241,Lisa,"don't vote for me, kids of springfield / unless you want an effective leader / i'll talk to teachers / i'll handle skinner / a vote for lisa / makes you the winner..."
50222,Lisa,"mom, why am i so repulsed by pigeons? it doesn't make any sense."
48361,Lisa,uh... boy... man... boyman. jake boyman.
42389,Lisa,what if he wants a kiss?
44819,Lisa,"it's full, dad. that means you have to take out the trash."
43004,Lisa,dad!! your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
41626,Lisa,"dad, you just destroyed your first kiss."
52149,Lisa,"bart, he's establishing mood."
42804,Lisa,"well bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
46633,Lisa,uh-oh.
49611,Lisa,"just follow the ""dies,"" mom."
46094,Lisa,it's true!
46787,Lisa,but man's inquisitive nature is what separates us from the animals.
43901,Lisa,"okay, you found out i'm an over-achieving bookworm. so whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a polaroid. i'm going to sleep."
50730,Lisa,with great difficulty!
51999,Lisa,"yeah, i suppose so. night mom."
49971,Lisa,we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés. not all blondes are dumb! not all fat people are jolly.
44724,Lisa,"dear log: it won't be long now before my mind melts into a soft simpsony sludge. soon, the arts and literature i love will be replaced by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps. it's time to give my brain its last meal."
41757,Lisa,perhaps there is no moral to this story.
47530,Lisa,can we go? can we go? please! please! please! please! please!
41972,Lisa,what's going on?
42067,Lisa,"dar-ryl, dar-ryl."
46110,Lisa,"they are coming back for us, aren't they?"
42693,Lisa,that's over sixteen thousand kilometers.
42257,Lisa,what's wrong?
41920,Lisa,no.
46877,Lisa,bread tastes like clothes.
43211,Lisa,i read at a 78th grade level.
50973,Lisa,well i'm glad you're not upset. all my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
42394,Lisa,that story isn't suitable for children.
49506,Lisa,"pretty much, yeah."
50256,Lisa,"merry christmas, mom!"
44609,Lisa,they're squatting in our house?
43629,Lisa,i don't know what mom's thinking. this whole country club scene is so decadent...
50571,Lisa,my name is finally on a book!
48550,Lisa,no! we have to read it together.
43066,Lisa,"eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. he will make the next few hours a living hell."
44746,Lisa,i got it! woo hoo! i mean... splendid.
45900,Lisa,"shut up all of you, or i'll sue."
51183,Lisa,"orwell, obscure? the author of ""animal farm?"""
48448,Lisa,yes...
41865,Lisa,"oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on monday at school."
48548,Lisa,no.
43915,Lisa,so i have two brothers?
44391,Lisa,"dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
41801,Lisa,mom?
50996,Lisa,"princeton, b.a., oxford, m.a. -- i smell a rhodes."
44047,Lisa,"no. you don't understand, nelson. a kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
45532,Lisa,"could you build us a house, president carter? we can't go back to ours."
50229,Lisa,not really.
45781,Lisa,at camp david? sure. they couldn't keep pants on kissinger.
48299,Lisa,i already saw that exact same show on another network.
45169,Lisa,"wow, you look really hungover, dad. what did you do last night?"
46986,Lisa,free tibet!
41898,Lisa,"whayda ya know, she's right."
43249,Lisa,oh dad...
43409,Lisa,"they have simpson d.n.a. it could've come from any of us. except you, since you're a bouvier."
42215,Lisa,how could you? i won't do it!
50177,Lisa,"mom, please don't."
47155,Lisa,"see, now that's the kind of dog you should be."
48131,Lisa,"what do you think? huh? huh? pretty heartfelt, huh? huh?"
44251,Lisa,didn't you hear i almost killed my brother?
41728,Lisa,you grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
44204,Lisa,"okay, bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
42988,Lisa,even the pet cemetery voted for bob! look! mr. and mrs. bananas! humphrey boa-gart!
42627,Lisa,really? not even this?
48979,Lisa,get off me!
44398,Lisa,"look at all those beautiful shoes! i know they're made from animals, but wow!"
41675,Lisa,you'd better hope they say yes!
49862,Lisa,an f. an f! i hope harvard never finds out about this.
45872,Lisa,stop clapping!
49220,Lisa,"no, ""martinis""."
47527,Lisa,"""dear cosmic wars fan, i'm glad you loved my film?! here's a photo of your favorite new character, jim-jam bonks. may the power be on your side, randall curtis."" he ignored our criticisms!"
48995,Lisa,do you think mine...
43557,Lisa,"this is so weird. it's like something out of dickens or ""melrose place."""
52191,Lisa,bart! you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about.
47915,Lisa,this is worse than when we thought mom was having an affair. it turned out she was just going to the library to cry.
44340,Lisa,okay.
51622,Lisa,"if you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will."
50406,Lisa,"bart, you've done a truly kind thing."
50519,Lisa,"don't worry about it, mom. dad will take us on a great outing next weekend."
51154,Lisa,i was.
52363,Lisa,keep on truckin'? what does that mean?
50258,Lisa,...everywhere you go
51272,Lisa,"look, while i'd like to help, i'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances."
46283,Lisa,sentence fragment is also a sentence fragment.
44670,Lisa,it's just a joke.
44716,Lisa,but those candy bars are all squished and melted.
47344,Lisa,"i think that's ""drop."""
45804,Lisa,hmmm.
47842,Lisa,what happened to the glacier? it's nearly melted. this must be due to global warming!
43870,Lisa,i wonder where all the kids are.
52436,Lisa,"unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to."
47769,Lisa,ow!
47198,Lisa,"dad, you've become the new grim reaper!"
41794,Lisa,what did you do to it?
48058,Lisa,thanks for making me feel better.
42944,Lisa,yayyy!
48948,Lisa,but bart...
44756,Lisa,"good luck, dad. although i am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part."
42779,Lisa,ow! my hair!
50241,Lisa,"mmm-mm, that is some sweet pig meat. but as for christmas trees... i used to love them -- until last year, when i went tree shopping with mom..."
48505,Lisa,"my report on a ""fascinating springfielder"" is due monday, and everybody i've tried to interview is so boring."
49654,Lisa,"time has passed. children play in the streets. at night, there is music and laughter."
51114,Lisa,"ooh, a cupcake!"
49020,Lisa,is it bart?
51163,Lisa,it's for babies!
44795,Lisa,the old union pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
49225,Lisa,"bart, i've fallen in love with crosswords!"
46071,Lisa,it looks like a sturgeon.
48988,Lisa,"all is lost... angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six... magic, magic, magic... all is won!"
42673,Lisa,"hush, field trip boy."
51858,Lisa,"yeah, bart. you're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
46079,Lisa,"i know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. but, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. you see..."
47253,Lisa,"or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- ­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."
45350,Lisa,yep!
47700,Lisa,"check it out, girls. sixty-eight squares of ankle-busting fury!"
48297,Lisa,"dad? please come home, we miss you. is that a high-def tv?!"
44447,Lisa,"you just made a big mistake, fly boy."
42361,Lisa,uh - huh.
51651,Lisa,docetism?
45473,Lisa,"oh, bart, what's happened to you?"
45110,Lisa,"i need a miracle. come on, you owe me."
46715,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
42170,Lisa,you're serving us gruel?
43767,Lisa,"zagnut bar, mr. smithers? razzles? skittles? whatchamacallit? twizzlers?"
48065,Lisa,"dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
50540,Lisa,he gets four and i only get two?! no fair!
50125,Lisa,"stealing home. it's so impossible. it's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
44933,Lisa,is that perfume?
52458,Lisa,here he is!
46734,Lisa,well...
50866,Lisa,"mom, what's going on?"
45237,Lisa,"nbc has lots of great shows, and their news and sports coverage can't be beat!"
45327,Lisa,"uh, more or less. hey, is that manna?"
52064,Lisa,"i'm watching sideshow bob. you know, he's a lot less patronizing than krusty used to be."
51353,Lisa,and i also wanna say that if--
42390,Lisa,what if he...
46448,Lisa,that's it!
45430,Lisa,"wow, dad, you're surfing like a pro."
46828,Lisa,"bart, i am so mad at you!"
47559,Lisa,"quiet, grampa. hello... mom?!?!"
50197,Lisa,"you know, it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town."
52385,Lisa,do not feed animals. do not allow animals in the car. do not make eye contact with animals.
42295,Lisa,"ooh / meow / dad, stop you're embarrassing us / stop please."
43646,Lisa,their tap water tasted better than ours!
46322,Lisa,"bye, mr. flanders."
44600,Lisa,"oh boy! / all right, free money! / wow!"
45797,Lisa,"there you are. come on, we have to go. dad pushed a waitress. and mom lost twenty thousand dollars."
50503,Lisa,"my science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on july 15, 9789."
47230,Lisa,what?
48832,Lisa,"mom, i think there's something you're trying to avoid. or someone."
43473,Lisa,"ah, excuse me? isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
49519,Lisa,yes you do.
47839,Lisa,"well, that's the end of dad's wedding business."
48302,Lisa,but dad...
48827,Lisa,working? where?
45608,Lisa,yes. the madness ends here.
43462,Lisa,"oh, you are so cute! yes you are! you are! i just love you."
48586,Lisa,repent! repent! before it's too late! i always wanted to do that in a new england church.
44273,Lisa,where's santa's little helper?
52407,Lisa,lincoln lincoln i been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / is it water is it wine? / oh my god it's turpentine! / faster! faster!
42246,Lisa,it's a deal.
43851,Lisa,"mr. estes, the publications advisor. i edited the whole thing."
52469,Lisa,"oh, you poor thing -- this is a tough time of year for someone who's allergic to holly, mistletoe, the red part of candy canes..."
42098,Lisa,"bart, why'd you take the blame?"
45994,Lisa,"oh, i'll show you."
44078,Lisa,"it's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! oh, and you, dad. heh heh..."
48397,Lisa,this is horrible.
46641,Lisa,except antarctica.
50203,Lisa,"all right. mr. burns, i'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel."
50856,Lisa,"guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!"
43126,Lisa,i think it's romantic. throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
43895,Lisa,i just know we're gonna be friends forever.
50986,Lisa,twister!
45940,Lisa,go on! swim to freedom! go!
43276,Lisa,nooooooo!
43279,Lisa,"mom, don't give the puppies to him! he'll be mean to them!"
44581,Lisa,hey!
50676,Lisa,"wow, nick here in our house. i hope it doesn't make him think less of me."
45789,Lisa,i have a lot of meetings. i'm the president.
49978,Lisa,another springfield family moves to detroit to find a better life.
47546,Lisa,"grampa, how do you sleep at night?"
46802,Lisa,"no, sorry."
47514,Lisa,mom! dad! there's a ghost in the house!
46111,Lisa,"how's your back, dad?"
42600,Lisa,"but, no, we killed mr. burns."
46741,Lisa,"i know just how you feel -- isolated, alone, cut off from everyone--"
52025,Lisa,"oh, bart, don't you see? this is what psychologists call over-compensation. mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing."
51432,Lisa,"bart, that's your sixth taco. you know, whitman says, ""if anything is sacred, the human body is sacred""."
43334,Lisa,uh huh.
45889,Lisa,it's my favorite!
42723,Lisa,i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
41681,Lisa,that's assault! that is assault.
45892,Lisa,poor maggie. how many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life?
46127,Lisa,"dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. you remember the story of oedipus, don't you?"
43526,Lisa,"i'm not asleep, i'm just resting my eye-- uh oh."
47651,Lisa,i can't. my mom's not picking me up for an hour.
50198,Lisa,"we're called ""little people"" and i'm not one."
50231,Lisa,"marking a crime scene. to celebrate a ancient pagan ritual, this tree was cut down and tarted up like a dime-a-dance floozy."
51377,Lisa,all that's left is bart.
48795,Lisa,"of course. gosh, dad, your hands are shaking!"
44394,Lisa,"here's a better idea -- you give me your address, and i'll write to you."
51547,Lisa,i won't be using the correct term then.
50436,Lisa,"well, maybe a little. but i'd never break the rules."
50216,Lisa,"yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him."
44569,Lisa,turn into the skid!
52355,Lisa,"oh, no. i don't want to fall behind my class."
42725,Lisa,that's awful!
51548,Lisa,"um, why don't i just go sit alone and-- oh, you're doing it."
51536,Lisa,"i don't know, but she's my new hero."
45981,Lisa,i'd like to visit a prisoner.
45369,Lisa,why can't we see it now?
43050,Lisa,"bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
43337,Lisa,how come?
48463,Lisa,"ooh, but this one is precious!"
50304,Lisa,"dad, look! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!"
46561,Lisa,"bratwurst, sauerbraten, donderblitzen... mom, isn't there anything vegetarian?"
48512,Lisa,what you've got here is poetry!
48104,Lisa,i can read you like a book.
48394,Lisa,"i'm lisa, i'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- i'm your favorite."
45998,Lisa,i won't come down till you spare this tree!
51054,Lisa,"please keep them together! if not for me, for the mother!"
48855,Lisa,that's so poetic.
49062,Lisa,what's going on?
46777,Lisa,three cheers for a gun-free springfield. hip hip...
48682,Lisa,"okay, this is the place."
41883,Lisa,peace on earth.
46285,Lisa,"uh-oh, the bus!"
42251,Lisa,bart! you cast the wrong spell! zombies!
49939,Lisa,dad? where did you get that boat?
43023,Lisa,"yeah, well i eat fruit loops for breakfast."
43918,Lisa,"mom, hugo's eating his napkin!"
49578,Lisa,even the ralph of this school speaks french!
43873,Lisa,only kids are that incoherent!
44213,Lisa,"bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when mom and dad get home. now go to bed!"
51430,Lisa,"we do have them! they're my home screen! miss hoover! once again, the lesson plan i prepared would've covered this topic much better, but i can see..."
48047,Lisa,"dad, how much money did you bet?"
52364,Lisa,"ooh... phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? oh, do your own homework, bart!"
46199,Lisa,um-um.
46012,Lisa,"hey, everybody! i..."
50962,Lisa,but i wanna know about dad and his broken heart.
42130,Lisa,did the maniac kill her?
45276,Lisa,"ooh, my stomach hurts."
50539,Lisa,what?
45055,Lisa,to protect and sever?
45481,Lisa,and what per cent is that?
46909,Lisa,"i don't like mcnuggets, i'm a vegetarian!"
43295,Lisa,nooo!!
50914,Lisa,all day i have vitamin burps.
46402,Lisa,you don't like me? i like you.
45223,Lisa,"but mom, i read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents."
50602,Lisa,"you need an agent? we met a ten percenter today. she'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. you'll have a skein on the sked before you can say ""krusty's wardrobe furnished by ha-has of beverly hills""."
42188,Lisa,"hey look, it's last year's winner, deborah jo smallwood!"
42465,Lisa,that's as bad as the tasteless itchy and sambo cartoons of the late 30s. the writers should be ashamed of themselves.
43113,Lisa,beware the ides of march.
46987,Lisa,"this is just a kickball with ""mars"" written on it."
50424,Lisa,who'd follow milhouse around like that? sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko.
44343,Lisa,"chief wiggum, i can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
48135,Lisa,i'd rather not go than lie.
47104,Lisa,it's so weird not having dad here. i can't fall asleep if i haven't read him his bedtime story.
44371,Lisa,this wasn't in the brochure.
49857,Lisa,"dad, a meter is three inches longer than a yard, which is thirty-six inches, so fifty divided by thirty-nine times thirty-six, equals--"
46976,Lisa,"oh, tomorrow's the day the judge said we can visit bart."
46928,Lisa,"aw... life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, dad. i feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been."
51268,Lisa,"well bart, is that enough of a sign for ya?"
48522,Lisa,but we were a team!
49748,Lisa,"whether she's competing in equestrian events at the 1976 olympics or spending her summers at holyrood palace, princess anne is truly a world leader."
50739,Lisa,"i sold a couple of my rare jazz records. after a while they all start to sound the same. still love the genre, of course. not even close to getting sick of it."
51763,Lisa,i knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
48754,Lisa,"wait, milhouse -- hold your position. something doesn't add up."
43994,Lisa,why do you have to be such a pain all the time? don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
42682,Lisa,if anyone wants me i'll be in my room.
42747,Lisa,what's so special about this game anyway? it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville. they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
44057,Lisa,"dad, wake up!"
42160,Lisa,"oh miss hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. you gave me a b+ in conduct."
52169,Lisa,whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
48737,Lisa,"dad, why don't you throw me in the air, and i can see which way is out."
45829,Lisa,"you can't drive, dad. he's got your license."
43944,Lisa,"principal skinner, wait! i created the universe! give me the gift certificate!"
43764,Lisa,why do you need me?
45153,Lisa,he's waking up!
52278,Lisa,"please, dad."
48628,Lisa,"yes, you should've!"
44799,Lisa,they have two.
52145,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. you won't learn anything."
51391,Lisa,how could you burn the present i gave you?
51339,Lisa,by discussing the school's budget crisis?
51929,Lisa,"look, janey, cupcakes."
52063,Lisa,his face is so flesh-colored and sad.
51426,Lisa,i have about eight of them.
48295,Lisa,"listen, we can trade mr. teeny for bart. we just have to find a way to get him up there."
51743,Lisa,you mean like europeans were to the native americans? or the belgians were to the congo?
42339,Lisa,"goodbye, great aunt gladys. i wish i had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years."
52155,Lisa,"try not to spill anything, dad."
43949,Lisa,yayyy!
45302,Lisa,"i'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""the slaughterhouse."" it's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood."
50207,Lisa,"yes, technically it's you. but like i said, people change and--"
45161,Lisa,i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
46380,Lisa,"do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet mom and dad are being punished?"
43593,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
42904,Lisa,"bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
51523,Lisa,"...and when my dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew i was diving."
46361,Lisa,"dad, that's the water softener!"
45646,Lisa,good. maple soda?... a cell phone full of candy?... astronaut bread?
46923,Lisa,"you read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
47743,Lisa,"there's ""dan rather"" and ""tom brokaw"", hanging out with kent brockman!"
45661,Lisa,... horrible wailing...
50527,Lisa,goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha!
51299,Lisa,how do you know my name?
44122,Lisa,"more kippers, mum?"
51497,Lisa,"here he is! ""johan oldenveldt, painter, lived in amsterdam, paris... prolific early 20th century naturalist... i think this was painted by someone famous. maybe it's valuable."
50837,Lisa,fievel was a mouse in a movie.
44115,Lisa,any-one but him.
48136,Lisa,stupid dad. doesn't care about my feelings...
52285,Lisa,shut your mouth!
49399,Lisa,"dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better."
47840,Lisa,sure am!
50365,Lisa,you are? why?
43959,Lisa,"oh, little chipmunk friend. i'm allergic to everything!"
43068,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. what is she saying you did?"
48471,Lisa,"shut up! i just said ""shut up."" i'll punish myself by going upstairs."
52453,Lisa,does bart have to be there?
50116,Lisa,"well, you're not!"
41762,Lisa,"bart, i do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. i've made things for you. but you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
52211,Lisa,"dad, this isn't about glue. it's about territoriality. he only wants the glue because i'm using it."
48583,Lisa,"oooh, an institute!"
44455,Lisa,hey look. it's pelé!
45246,Lisa,"sorry, dad. my mind is made up."
44269,Lisa,"what've you got for me, boy? hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat."
47884,Lisa,"if we can just get to the delta airlines gold medallion lounge, they can't get in without spending frequent flyer miles."
43009,Lisa,mom! mom! you've gotta help! they're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!
46227,Lisa,"this is my test subject, francine."
45198,Lisa,it's so rigid and uncreative.
51726,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
47647,Lisa,"""dear readers: you hold in your hands the last paper not controlled by the burns media empire. we are not afraid to say montgomery burns is a monopolistic, self-aggrandizing hmmm... stinky pants."""
42468,Lisa,"according to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
44647,Lisa,could anyone else have taken it?
50724,Lisa,we'll take your word for it.
44401,Lisa,shhh! they're strapping down liza minelli.
50115,Lisa,he's not! he thought he was better than the laws of probability. anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
51131,Lisa,"aw, that's sweet."
43275,Lisa,"mom, why do i have to wear a flea collar?"
45961,Lisa,it is my birthday.
51481,Lisa,"i'm definitely getting this one. oh, but i forgot about this one! oh my god i never even saw this one!"
43324,Lisa,"wow, you've had some career. although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
45094,Lisa,i am just four power wands away from an anti-gravity lozenge. hope i don't run into that weird little troll!
48556,Lisa,why are you stopping? we're almost at the happy ending!
51061,Lisa,what if i home school?
43011,Lisa,one --
48332,Lisa,"i keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
44773,Lisa,mo-om...
51567,Lisa,wha--?!
43978,Lisa,yes i do! sure i do! look!
48896,Lisa,...so when bob collapsed in the courtroom...
48421,Lisa,"i just don't think religion should be taught in our schools, any more than you'd want scientists teaching at the church."
51365,Lisa,"krusty, are you broke?"
42008,Lisa,"moe, this is l.s. calling for h.s."
42968,Lisa,"dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning. can we listen to something else?"
52148,Lisa,"while i pondered, weak and weary,"
47909,Lisa,"for your information, springfielders can be intelligent and articulate. i happen to know because we're from springfield."
49572,Lisa,bart! your plan worked!
48930,Lisa,sounds like fun. can i play?
41832,Lisa,not any more. you punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. this is my brother... and he knows karate.
52310,Lisa,"dad, i think that's pretty spurious."
45492,Lisa,the food is exquisite...
43185,Lisa,this is horrible. people will start to avoid springfield.
46208,Lisa,"hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
44336,Lisa,"that came from baboon county, u.s.a.!"
45384,Lisa,"an open letter to the people of springfield: today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding."
50128,Lisa,"maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
44804,Lisa,oh-how-terrible-read-on.
46604,Lisa,no dad. it's an epic tale from ancient greece.
52375,Lisa,"sewing a new quilt. you know, it's one thing to be a link in a chain. it's another to start one of your own."
44160,Lisa,bob's trailer at the construction site?
51974,Lisa,but i don't feel like smiling.
48650,Lisa,"mr. spuckler, wait! is this really good for your kids?"
49781,Lisa,a dime? what do you think i am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
43077,Lisa,"there's you, dad!"
49329,Lisa,you're older. why don't you do these fun activities?
45723,Lisa,"okay, i finished the gardening sequence."
46103,Lisa,"oh, no. he wouldn't!"
43708,Lisa,that's because you stole it!
41897,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
50209,Lisa,thank god your son can't see the way you're behaving.
48903,Lisa,that means that springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! even earlier than new hampshire!
45704,Lisa,i can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
42820,Lisa,"i think it's great you're a teacher, dad. so, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?"
49050,Lisa,"all right, so i put that there to get you to stop eating meat. but your body is going to miss the protein. so you'll have to take these pills."
51712,Lisa,(impressed noise
50288,Lisa,"'angry dad: the movie.' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."""
50473,Lisa,"actually, i do have a speech prepared!"
47898,Lisa,how do you know that's their blimp?
49428,Lisa,this is so hard because i always thought mom was the strong one.
42895,Lisa,jeremy's iron.
49778,Lisa,just take 'em.
42605,Lisa,"have a blast, mom!"
46755,Lisa,thus ends the rule of law.
47382,Lisa,"look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. my cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball."
44232,Lisa,"hello, this is lisa simpson, and..."
46811,Lisa,"bart, i'm doing my geography homework."
50204,Lisa,not today.
42897,Lisa,you're finished already? but the competition isn't for weeks.
44005,Lisa,"i like you, too, milhouse, but not in that way. you're more like a big sister."
46081,Lisa,"as french canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment."
42341,Lisa,goodbye dad! don't eat any solids.
46920,Lisa,"dad, today was so great. the animal rights protest, a visit to the museum of sadness and oppression..."
42193,Lisa,it's mom!
43034,Lisa,that's not fair... why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out?
50911,Lisa,sure. i have the ending for my memoir!
49681,Lisa,"i'm gonna put a spell on you! yes i am, my tuna-breath familiar."
44806,Lisa,"oh, bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time..."
45552,Lisa,"dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside."
46099,Lisa,"dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. in fact, i made a graph."
47520,Lisa,"oh dad, i missed you so much."
52036,Lisa,ewwwww!
46112,Lisa,"so, how was it in the slammer?"
47861,Lisa,name three.
48736,Lisa,"dad, we're in the maze."
44826,Lisa,"you know dad, there's a lesson in all this. many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just..."
51047,Lisa,and it's got no pluto! how cutting edge!
46334,Lisa,what about us?
52373,Lisa,"dad, this is our pet. we can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?"
45623,Lisa,but they...
48935,Lisa,"i never dreamed an american car designed in germany, assembled in mexico from parts made in canada, could be so amazing."
52022,Lisa,mm! delicioso!
43606,Lisa,christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship jesus christ.
43639,Lisa,how much did it cost?
51703,Lisa,"excuse me, you ruined my report."
43896,Lisa,what's he doing here?
47184,Lisa,does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?
45021,Lisa,"hang in there, dad! just half a basket left!"
48129,Lisa,"hello. i'm looking for something in a pipe cleaner. extra bendy, with medium fuzz."
42081,Lisa,what's the point? they'll never notice.
44325,Lisa,i found a malibu stacy with no head!
41682,Lisa,"diphthongs, cognates, latin roots / lisa clobbers all you fruits!"
45328,Lisa,everyone's gone!
43078,Lisa,yay!
50412,Lisa,why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
46087,Lisa,"""lisa is an outstanding student, with a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism."" that's not even a word!"
52084,Lisa,"wow, a quarter past six. what's keeping dad?"
44780,Lisa,what?!
48559,Lisa,dad's ending is better.
47211,Lisa,he's right! it all checks out!
44639,Lisa,wait a minute... we had a cooler full of snacks on the bus.
44620,Lisa,he's wrong! you're wrong! the whole damn system is wrong!
48673,Lisa,"it's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. so i made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation."
44935,Lisa,"oh, jacks. jacks are big. they went out for a while, but then they came roaring back."
50067,Lisa,didn't anybody here stay in school?
41981,Lisa,"all right, dolphins!"
48989,Lisa,tv! tv! tv!
51591,Lisa,answer me!
51133,Lisa,i'm gonna put all my stuffed animals on it!
50003,Lisa,hello? hello?
46855,Lisa,this is a band-aid wrapped in tin foil.
47671,Lisa,i couldn't be prouder.
49985,Lisa,"so that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species?"
52463,Lisa,there must be some way out of this verdammten spell.
48488,Lisa,"dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!"
41873,Lisa,not quite. i got some dynamite stuff from rabbi simon ben eleazar.
51963,Lisa,that was beautiful. what's it called?
48102,Lisa,where are you staying?
51673,Lisa,assemblywoman lombard! you got my emails!
43291,Lisa,i've got an idea!
47560,Lisa,where are you?! are you okay?
42831,Lisa,"ah, face it, bart. our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck."
48994,Lisa,really? how?
51460,Lisa,"well, i thought it was because it was tote bag day."
49650,Lisa,"oh my god. if bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
41896,Lisa,"hey, here's a good job, dad. oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor."
51495,Lisa,pokey!
42134,Lisa,according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
43243,Lisa,"mom, i feel kinda funny wearing white - i mean, milhouse."
47761,Lisa,"praying to buddha, jesus, sponge bob. there's no time to be picky."
51594,Lisa,"mom, stop! stop! stop! i'm sorry!"
49078,Lisa,they sound great... i'd love to read them sometime.
50678,Lisa,nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths!
44311,Lisa,"oh, dear god!"
41777,Lisa,"where did you get the idea for this, mom?"
42174,Lisa,our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
46155,Lisa,you're being brainwashed.
50031,Lisa,"oh maggie, don't ever turn two."
51373,Lisa,"um, when a woman talks, she just wants to be heard."
46211,Lisa,"hey willie, i think i'm onto something! check this out!"
43911,Lisa,what's up there? / is it a monster? / we have to know! / what's the secret?
43545,Lisa,eww! mo-om!
47186,Lisa,"because i know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
46417,Lisa,he did it! he saved her!
47886,Lisa,out of the way! i learned cpr while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
51110,Lisa,maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.
49841,Lisa,now what are you up to?
48981,Lisa,"i almost flicked an innocent butterfly. bart, we're turning into monsters!"
49697,Lisa,"fine. get this on in two minutes, lose the attitude, and for god's sake, suck in that pooch."
48042,Lisa,who's professor pigskin?
51136,Lisa,"you know, in the middle ages people took refuge in church to escape the bubonic plague, but that made the plague spread even faster!"
49652,Lisa,"oh, did the chosen one hurt his chosen little noggin?"
43590,Lisa,don't you see? that would be taking the easy way out --
44681,Lisa,it's the kind john glenn eats when he's not in space.
45015,Lisa,"they're on hinges. that's really ingenious, dad."
48474,Lisa,i feel so terrible. i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer... but i never thought the two stories would intersect.
48114,Lisa,you're just possessed by the devil.
43549,Lisa,umm... mom just baked a cake.
51910,Lisa,it's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
43611,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
49303,Lisa,how do we catch her without hurting her?
49410,Lisa,how 'bout italian?
47339,Lisa,"dad, you have to say something. something meaningful!"
45982,Lisa,aren't you coming with me?
44384,Lisa,yay!
51161,Lisa,mom said we could watch it!
45582,Lisa,"this broom closet is not what it seems. it's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot."
45453,Lisa,"oh sorry, dad, we didn't know."
48071,Lisa,but i thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs.
44060,Lisa,we better pick up some supplies.
43407,Lisa,burns' suit! burns' suit!
51556,Lisa,dad? did you just call?
44208,Lisa,what? i didn't order any giant sub!
51436,Lisa,"whoa! mom, you made me over-swipe!"
41641,Lisa,"he's not like anybody i've ever met. he's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. he sure is ugly, though. so why can't i stop staring at him?"
47291,Lisa,how come?
41630,Lisa,"only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead!"
52140,Lisa,"if you don't believe me, look at this book i found."
52213,Lisa,"maggie, i'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!"
51395,Lisa,i sold the gift you gave me.
52292,Lisa,"dad, do something!"
42821,Lisa,i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
50368,Lisa,"i believe the expression is ""ta-da!"""
52119,Lisa,"oh, brother."
43508,Lisa,...too.
45808,Lisa,"now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture."
46950,Lisa,"dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a wnba game."
50378,Lisa,"oh, you think i'm pretty?"
50610,Lisa,"dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
44677,Lisa,"actually, we can't take a bath anyway. the water heater is broken."
41815,Lisa,"""the city of washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. it stank then, and it stinks now. only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air."""
43482,Lisa,stop it! stop it! don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
46785,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing?"
52069,Lisa,yeah man.
44630,Lisa,we are watching fox.
44289,Lisa,"i normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: ha! it couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
51727,Lisa,are we there yet?
43188,Lisa,ewww.
51552,Lisa,"beans, beans. we'll do beans."
44621,Lisa,grades?
46935,Lisa,those are the test animals! the detective must have sold them to the circus.
41702,Lisa,nothing.
46429,Lisa,we're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my dad's childhood.
43922,Lisa,ow!
46970,Lisa,"no dad, it means bart would be a legal adult and free to move out of the house."
52369,Lisa,"look, mom, i finished my patch. it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life."
44027,Lisa,mom...
47923,Lisa,"oh yeah? well, there's your girlfriend."
50995,Lisa,what's that stone around your neck?
42176,Lisa,bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that krusty the clown will come through.
45564,Lisa,answer to what?
47899,Lisa,"let's see, the rv dealership is across the freeway on the corner of... hey, this is a flintstones fun map."
42745,Lisa,"come on, dad, you can make it."
41779,Lisa,"hm. an essay contest. ""children under twelve""... ""three hundred words""... ""fiercely pro-american."" sounds interesting."
45800,Lisa,"mr. gumbel, you're upsetting me."
45196,Lisa,"wow, you've signed up quite a few people, dad: sea captain, bumblebee man, comic book guy, the squeaky voiced teen..."
48110,Lisa,having a robot brother troubles me. the ethical implications are really tensing me up.
43242,Lisa,"oh, you are so good to put up with all of this."
46613,Lisa,wait! i have been sent to lead the french army to victory.
47164,Lisa,look! there's duffman!
50151,Lisa,well... of course that would be great. but i see myself making an impact... outside the home.
50461,Lisa,you know anything about... bus twenty-three?
51977,Lisa,not me.
47617,Lisa,"""congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."""
48350,Lisa,"okay, boys' school -- i need a challenge!"
42056,Lisa,how's the dog supposed to get in?
45298,Lisa,"pretty cool. but now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?"
43734,Lisa,the judge says it's okay as long as you pay mr. lampwick royalties.
50518,Lisa,yes it is! that's all it is!
46014,Lisa,i'll just rest here for a minute.
47293,Lisa,prime minister tony blair!?
51218,Lisa,"but wait, wait, wait! what is this?"
44367,Lisa,"ech, i'm tired of being an issue, bart. maybe everyone would be better off if i just quit."
51994,Lisa,"look, maggie! birdies!"
47820,Lisa,"they stopped saying ""keepin' it real"" three years ago."
44347,Lisa,when do you expect the ringing will stop?!
43310,Lisa,there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now. at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar.
44511,Lisa,"well, obviously that's impossible--"
50988,Lisa,it was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.
43776,Lisa,okay. i like...
43234,Lisa,and if they are?
48938,Lisa,you wrote a report on it last week!
43863,Lisa,bye-bye lisa simpson.
49520,Lisa,"when you say it, it's not just in your head."
47462,Lisa,"no mom, it's just that i used to be ""the smart one"" -- now i don't know who i am."
46632,Lisa,what call to brazil?
47206,Lisa,it almost sounded like he plans to tear organs out of living people!
41869,Lisa,"bart, we've been going about this all wrong. what's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
42247,Lisa,no.
50526,Lisa,goorsha!
51732,Lisa,this is us.
50589,Lisa,"well, you're getting my help."
47421,Lisa,"look, we can go inside!"
47996,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen, i have a confession to make. i didn't have my usual songwriter tonight..."
51459,Lisa,but... but we sang gershwin together!
50267,Lisa,we've got to stop mom from going out with those women.
47680,Lisa,"what do you think, thomas pynchon?"
51132,Lisa,our poor couch...
45902,Lisa,none of us had ever sung before. but mr. geffen believed in us.
46646,Lisa,yes.
42482,Lisa,yay!
49461,Lisa,"hmm, what if i read every other word? ""one more time, you're hopeless. try again, numb skull."" that's not very nice -- i will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""turn around. seek springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
44293,Lisa,"what do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? you must have some magazines, or newspapers."
50894,Lisa,please? thank you.
43353,Lisa,where am i gonna get five hundred dollars?
44878,Lisa,dad!
41918,Lisa,"i just called to say i love you, dad."
43507,Lisa,"actually dad, this time i was wrong..."
48283,Lisa,that was awesome!
47460,Lisa,"yes, thank you."
46748,Lisa,that caterpillar is screaming.
46066,Lisa,"wow, mom got a laugh."
49727,Lisa,afro-cuban?
44656,Lisa,"aw, crud. / aw, come on, man."
45493,Lisa,"dad, that's so mean."
42438,Lisa,the mirror. the mirror!
50757,Lisa,"that's sexist, but thank you."
43013,Lisa,"remember bart, i mean, ""dances in underwear,"" we take the white man alive."
47287,Lisa,"bart, why don't you spend the money on something for mom? she does so much for us."
49380,Lisa,and so the queens--
44360,Lisa,"could someone help me? it's stuck on ""auto-fire""!"
46959,Lisa,"thank you, mr. cronkite."
45540,Lisa,something's growing.
46245,Lisa,when do we get to see the animals?
45330,Lisa,dad!
44248,Lisa,"hello, world's worst babysitter speaking."
48805,Lisa,"bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house."
50271,Lisa,"come on, pretend he meant something to you."
48435,Lisa,you could make a great chef someday.
49514,Lisa,fine. but how do you explain this?
51399,Lisa,you like this?
43633,Lisa,"mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons i like horses better than cars? one: a horse never--"
44533,Lisa,kent.
50255,Lisa,okay.
50782,Lisa,"y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that milhouse brought it to our attention."
46870,Lisa,but the game's not even over!
43085,Lisa,dad!
49460,Lisa,a cryptic message! maybe this will lead me to the gem!
50431,Lisa,maggie's locked in!
51771,Lisa,"i've been emotionally dealing with that all week. so, yes."
50947,Lisa,i didn't know that was an option.
49821,Lisa,they made it back to the house?! how?!
41839,Lisa,"bart, is your boss a crook?"
50137,Lisa,they're just dots in circles.
46996,Lisa,s-c-a-b-i-e-s.
41862,Lisa,let's move.
44105,Lisa,but he didn't do anything!
50375,Lisa,"from inside, you just push up. easy peasy. and there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done."
44901,Lisa,"it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!"
45907,Lisa,"right from the start, i had a bad feeling about that gig."
46934,Lisa,they must have come from over there.
43755,Lisa,"well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
48196,Lisa,sideshow bob!
46316,Lisa,there's nothing here.
41646,Lisa,"ohh, it's a ball of yarn. that's funny, i feel like batting it around."
52446,Lisa,"oh, mom, that's wonderful. can i find out his favorite dish and help you make it!"
42419,Lisa,"oh... i was just thinking of a joke i saw on ""herman's head."""
45586,Lisa,funzo? i said that name in class.
45887,Lisa,"we're jamming, mom. she's painting my music, and i'm playing to her painting."
45520,Lisa,"well, look at the wonders of the computer age now."
51948,Lisa,i'm too sad.
45604,Lisa,season's greetings.
43008,Lisa,"bart, does it strike you as odd that uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called uterbräten?"
51560,Lisa,i'm fine.
43660,Lisa,but we saw your plane crash...
52399,Lisa,mommy! i want my mommy!
44033,Lisa,about anything.
42519,Lisa,i can't believe it. our first glimpse of gabbo!
46482,Lisa,no!
47896,Lisa,"hey, i know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. what if we..."
44107,Lisa,"maestro, if you please."
43935,Lisa,ba-rt stop it!
42309,Lisa,bart!
45602,Lisa,joy to the world / the lord is come. / let earth receive her king...
51165,Lisa,it's ki-ya karate monsters.
44187,Lisa,thanks for the ride!
46990,Lisa,could you use it in a sentence?
43769,Lisa,thanksmombye!
49114,Lisa,"mom, you tricked us!"
52091,Lisa,"bart, you're just like chilly, the elf who cannot love."
42922,Lisa,"it was an unusually warm february 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
51164,Lisa,blob-jitsu kick!
50569,Lisa,"aww, i've always wanted an aiden..."
42650,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
52188,Lisa,i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
48607,Lisa,"bart, stop that. native americans are a proud people with a noble heritage... a noble heritage that anyone can claim!"
44026,Lisa,what?
47634,Lisa,my poem has become an elegy. an elegy no one will ever hear.
44881,Lisa,hurry! hurry! lower the bridge!
52313,Lisa,"maybe. i don't watch him every minute. but what i am sure of is, we're getting cable for free."
44626,Lisa,hoverbikes!!
48368,Lisa,what the hell are you talking about?!
44996,Lisa,kids?
43982,Lisa,"faster, mom, faster!"
49323,Lisa,give me the keys!
47066,Lisa,maybe geology...
41721,Lisa,"half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
45164,Lisa,"heh, you're not really giving my father power of attorney, are you?"
43711,Lisa,you did. until i realized that jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to.
44904,Lisa,"it's kind of humbling, isn't it? the music we just heard might never be heard again."
47767,Lisa,there was a piece of glass / miss lucy sat upon it / and it cut her big fat...
47563,Lisa,"hey, do i hear a back rub?"
44813,Lisa,"well, not literally. but in a way, isn't he everyone's son? for you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. no, bart's not to blame. you can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. i'm lisa simpson."
52130,Lisa,why are you trying to scare us? are you trying to keep us from getting close to you... maybe even loving you?
44567,Lisa,"bart, this is patches, and what was your name?"
47995,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
43726,Lisa,will do.
44352,Lisa,yes.
50848,Lisa,but we're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.
45151,Lisa,"doctor hibbert, i thought you'd located another kidney for grampa."
41744,Lisa,lee-mur. lee-mur.
51351,Lisa,i know what i've got to do.
43415,Lisa,"so, the d.n.a. was right. it must've been... oh, dad!"
46182,Lisa,"oh, it's tough being the new kid. someone should go talk to her."
43500,Lisa,"apu, i'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."
50245,Lisa,oh no! this is where they took mom from me!
44085,Lisa,"they're good pretzels, mom. but you've got to think big. find a major public event and set up shop there."
49320,Lisa,"i know it's not your fault, muk mu. you're a gentle, loving soul."
44399,Lisa,"okay, dad..."
46130,Lisa,"dad, i think you're overreacting."
51778,Lisa,his company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! he changed the way hollywood drives!
46406,Lisa,"how'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, moe?"
47383,Lisa,you're not hurt! you're a good-luck kitty!
48589,Lisa,"papa, may we have petit fours?"
50171,Lisa,do you have to wax this floor now?
46743,Lisa,"oh, i wish i had someplace to call my own. no one wants me around any more."
48005,Lisa,good.
47561,Lisa,at the dayton arms hotel?
51290,Lisa,two can be as bad as one / it's the loneliest number since the number one...
51621,Lisa,krusty's getting roasted tonight.
46519,Lisa,it was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
42880,Lisa,i won first chair?
47390,Lisa,why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
50903,Lisa,"four threes?! oh no! no-no-no-no-no, nooooo!"
41946,Lisa,i made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
48486,Lisa,"dad, here's a thought: if you just gave mom credit, maybe she could help you."
51571,Lisa,now that's what i call a modern family.
44758,Lisa,can i?
44560,Lisa,mom! make him stop!
43801,Lisa,ah! ah! ah! stop! stop!
47216,Lisa,what happens if i press this button?
41751,Lisa,"yes, dad."
42894,Lisa,oh really? i...
51663,Lisa,flaming tap water. i saw something about that in a documentary...
45774,Lisa,"not now, bart. i'm about to speak to a hundred million people. this speech could make or break my presidency."
51443,Lisa,"you. he's tried to kill you. me, i think he likes."
46784,Lisa,"...poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
47883,Lisa,"you look just like a buddha statue. now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity."
48869,Lisa,yes.
46511,Lisa,"dad's on the log. now mom, you get the car and pull them to safety."
52528,Lisa,"as i told you when we talked last month, i've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead."
44501,Lisa,"mr. hutz, we won."
44976,Lisa,really? all of you?
42577,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong?"
52159,Lisa,"yes, sir. a very inane one. mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"
51425,Lisa,"you know, bart, just because diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
52104,Lisa,"is there a reward? if she's convicted, we get t-shirts."
50155,Lisa,"dad, can i talk to you for a second?"
50773,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, i have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this story."
43301,Lisa,"luckily i've prepared for this, so i'm not too worried."
42886,Lisa,"i appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body."
46524,Lisa,why don't you file a class-action suit?
42518,Lisa,"i don't think they're giving you enough information, dad."
51803,Lisa,should we hug?
45636,Lisa,those boys of mine.
51544,Lisa,what does a competitive eater eat?
51041,Lisa,do not. that's ridiculous-- it's just-- it's that-- he's-- he's a rebel and only i can change him!
51393,Lisa,"no, about christmas. so i went out this morning and i got you this."
52225,Lisa,"mom, i poured my heart into that centerpiece! things like that always happen in this family!"
48166,Lisa,"okay, if that means teacher."
48353,Lisa,principal skinner?
50133,Lisa,it's something you've never seen: they're smitten.
46622,Lisa,i would like to call my only witness: almighty god.
42182,Lisa,wiggum!
42885,Lisa,"ah, that used to be my face in the mud..."
41748,Lisa,"you know his blood type, how romantic."
44654,Lisa,"stop! leave milhouse alone! help me out here, bart."
42710,Lisa,that's it! i'm calling the company!
45676,Lisa,no.
42089,Lisa,whattaya got?
49874,Lisa,"yes, it is fitting."
44629,Lisa,it's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
44467,Lisa,"yes i am! come on, spotty!"
41599,Lisa,what? i don't want to go to the same college as you.
47836,Lisa,why are we dressed as sunday best simpsons for dinner with aunt patty?
50008,Lisa,"sing what you just said, then play a little guitar riff."
42203,Lisa,why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
42996,Lisa,ringo to his rest of the beatles!
48603,Lisa,"the point, dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm."
45386,Lisa,"we are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. we have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""le sex..."" i write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! we can better ourselves!"
47837,Lisa,i thought you said aunt patty was just waiting for the right man.
48926,Lisa,in the first place... do whatever you want. i'm getting' a candy apple.
41665,Lisa,"they're looking at me! all right, lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs."
47901,Lisa,"dad, snowball's not fat. she's just got winter fur."
48082,Lisa,"if i can just spend the night here, i'll never be scared again. and boy, you're free to go home whenever you want."
50397,Lisa,interested in these?
46737,Lisa,two million.
44637,Lisa,knock it off. we gotta find a way to light a fire.
49744,Lisa,don't forget the unicorn!
44719,Lisa,"wesley, get mama's pryin' bar."
42909,Lisa,"after the way i've behaved, i don't deserve to win."
45192,Lisa,but it's nine digits now. what's the point of these other four numbers?
50881,Lisa,you put my college fund on a poker site?!
46906,Lisa,could it be some kind of book?
51842,Lisa,yay!
44439,Lisa,ow! someone just punched me in the face!
48038,Lisa,"no, plutarch. he chronicled the lives of the roman emperors."
45531,Lisa,that has people living in it. you can see them through the windows.
51122,Lisa,"hush, sweet boy. let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows."
47343,Lisa,this is offensive to christians and prunes.
42262,Lisa,"bart, come quick! there's an itchy and scratchy movie!!!"
41979,Lisa,wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
45450,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful, dad."
47194,Lisa,"mom, it's ""wind."""
51014,Lisa,"dad, why are you kowtowing to mr. van houten?"
41766,Lisa,"bart, in the split second before he died, i bet scratchy appreciated his birthday present. you see how this relates to us?"
46951,Lisa,"that's fung pang-li, the seven-foot sensation from szechwan!"
52131,Lisa,it chose to destroy itself rather than live with us. you can't help but feel a little rejected.
47411,Lisa,"well, at least they're not fighting."
49148,Lisa,"oh, well, it's one thing to fill in for a monkey. but a comedy legend? i wouldn't dream of it."
47148,Lisa,each year we lose seven species of gumdrops...
41593,Lisa,tell me about it. i broke up with milhouse.
46719,Lisa,mm. mom's not gonna like that.
43197,Lisa,i'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.
46143,Lisa,"well, dad, i think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life."
43829,Lisa,"no, i mean--"
49441,Lisa,for years... for years...
42187,Lisa,yuh huh.
49176,Lisa,"dad, do laundry."
52274,Lisa,"please, dad. this argument humiliates us both."
45521,Lisa,i think that was implied by what i said.
49809,Lisa,i never thought of that before.
44345,Lisa,where's miss hoover?
44872,Lisa,"uh-huh. um, listen, i'm kind of lost. do you think you could give me a lift downtown?"
42117,Lisa,she's wonderful. i could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
42722,Lisa,am i the first?
48605,Lisa,tomorrow's multicultural day at school.
47569,Lisa,busted!
50127,Lisa,"no. but you did do something. you made me love baseball. not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
43386,Lisa,everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns. even us.
45869,Lisa,yes?!
48426,Lisa,"isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? they're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now."
46359,Lisa,ew!
49104,Lisa,i can't believe what i've done -- maybe deep down i always knew how much this film would hurt them. maybe i'm the monster this movie exposed.
48247,Lisa,"mr. g. k. willington is not who he seems. in fact, he's someone you all know quite well!"
47475,Lisa,i'm a mess. i can't believe i'm jealous of a baby.
47059,Lisa,"hey, you can't blame principal skinner for wanting to feature his best student."
51709,Lisa,"a brass band... barbershop quintet?... the human kazoo... ooh, a drum circle!"
47061,Lisa,"hey, that's not gonna happen!"
45535,Lisa,i'll weed the floor.
47916,Lisa,"hey, that's the smell of her real family! the simpsons! and for your information, our walls have a bunch of dead raccoons in them. but we are saving up the money to find them!"
50388,Lisa,"we used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now it's time for our reward."
45031,Lisa,i see an eye!
43912,Lisa,hurry up! mom and dad'll be home soon!
46433,Lisa,"hey, there's mesmerino."
46259,Lisa,"hello, little fella."
50542,Lisa,hey -- i know you...
51745,Lisa,are there any side effects?
52224,Lisa,that's all right.
48596,Lisa,"milhouse, thanks to you, the nerds can breathe easy. except the ones with asthma. which is all of them. but still, it's great."
51313,Lisa,"i just can't believe someone like you would be a republican. i mean, isn't your last name gutiérrez?"
42901,Lisa,oh who am i kidding? there's no way i'm ever gonna beat allison!
47323,Lisa,it's gone!
48037,Lisa,"that's latin, dad. the language of plutarch."
43788,Lisa,"no, no! then he'll know i told! dad, you said i could trust you."
46908,Lisa,well... this could be fun. let's watch it.
52477,Lisa,how do i get down?
49717,Lisa,i wish i weren't.
50481,Lisa,what?! i'm telling mom!
49128,Lisa,"you know, spiritually speaking, grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... so, in a way... uh... i'm lying down now."
51539,Lisa,are you okay?
52162,Lisa,"mr. burns, i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish."
51362,Lisa,yes.
46720,Lisa,"uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us."
52451,Lisa,can we have wine?
44503,Lisa,this is so exciting! i can't wait to see what we find!
46964,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
41651,Lisa,...and a mouth-watering veal chop.
48085,Lisa,we don't go to you anymore. we have a better doctor.
51260,Lisa,he got a hundred on his test?! that's impossible!
51137,Lisa,"i'm sorry your dress is gone, mom."
42200,Lisa,know what i think would help?
45390,Lisa,"well, i'm sure someone had the time to read it."
48430,Lisa,there's a triple a battery in my macaroni and cheese!
45915,Lisa,so this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
43286,Lisa,ssh.
51839,Lisa,"can we go too, dad?"
45708,Lisa,"really -- hey, what are you doing?"
44849,Lisa,"ah, the old number 22. clean, reliable public transportation. the chariot of the people. the ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. sure, some folks prefer--"
45456,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, dad. buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the earth's supply... you're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?"
46571,Lisa,"dad, no. it says ""don't walk""!"
42639,Lisa,"this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my allowance. it isn't much, but i would like to help."
45470,Lisa,i'm so glad you're here. bart's really acting funny.
51331,Lisa,what are ya doing? s'imaginary.
49789,Lisa,they're all horrible!
49546,Lisa,is this seat taken?
43719,Lisa,mo-omm! i just said that!
52129,Lisa,it's an ancient indian burial ground.
42509,Lisa,o.j.
51245,Lisa,"help me, doctor!"
49216,Lisa,um... i think it's... we don't have one.
49278,Lisa,it's so sterile! mypods... myphones... a brainiac bar!
46710,Lisa,"oh, i'd love to!"
43154,Lisa,"if there has to be a bastardized version of krusty, i'm glad it's you."
49597,Lisa,...greedy!
51689,Lisa,but you just said that--
47225,Lisa,she was acquitted. then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
52389,Lisa,"grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table."
43986,Lisa,you're a grand old flag / you're a high flying flag / etc...
51961,Lisa,"no, that's okay, dad. i'll just work on my fingering. unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you."
50956,Lisa,what?! you cry all the time! you cried when they canceled that show you hated.
51212,Lisa,what other side?
48784,Lisa,"no! i mean chris ""ludacris"" bridges, right here in the dental plaza!"
42987,Lisa,"look! prudence goodwyfe, died 1641. she voted for bob, too! so did buddy holly, richie valens, and the big bopper!"
44132,Lisa,ok. / guess so. / sounds good to me./ let's go.
51512,Lisa,martin took my topic. what do i do?
50936,Lisa,"finally, a place where you can spread your wings and hop."
42946,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's dead!
50934,Lisa,he's there too?!
50285,Lisa,"well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering."
52103,Lisa,we caught her! we caught the babysitter bandit! she's tied up at our house right now!
42329,Lisa,don't you mean three million dollars?
43268,Lisa,"what's wrong, boy? getting tired?"
50824,Lisa,lisa simpson superstar!
44102,Lisa,"well, it's blue... six feet long..."
49661,Lisa,i'm here! come find me! olly-olly-oxen-free! olly-olly-oxen-free!
42079,Lisa,"dear log... this will be my last entry. for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now i have none."
43588,Lisa,"when bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. and what makes your voice high?"
49028,Lisa,you can just drop me off here.
50082,Lisa,but i'm only in second grade.
48901,Lisa,why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
45103,Lisa,"""the wind in the willows?"" oh yeah, ralph brought it over."
43160,Lisa,haven't you ever looked at your globe?
51186,Lisa,happy anniversary!
49002,Lisa,this is so hard!
47332,Lisa,he's at the peak of cuteness.
47115,Lisa,just hear those sleigh bells jingling / ring-ting-tingling too...
46372,Lisa,"bart, you saved me."
49926,Lisa,"goodbye, bluella! send me a post card from tierra del fuego!"
45294,Lisa,how can you embarrass me like this? you won't sit through anything that doesn't have car crashes!
49561,Lisa,look at this place. it's everything i've ever dreamed of: on-campus stables!
46599,Lisa,"look mom, it's your car. grampa and bart must be in that theater!"
46454,Lisa,no! i'm leaving this church forever!
43614,Lisa,this is the worst christmas ever.
49641,Lisa,"sorry bart, i couldn't do it! there's got to be another way."
48507,Lisa,"what a deep, tormented soul..."
42013,Lisa,so that's it. you just wanted me to help you gamble. you never wanted to be with me at all.
44386,Lisa,"dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!"
46467,Lisa,"mr. gere, i was hoping buddhism could bring me inner peace. or is that just a pipe dream?"
48422,Lisa,it's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.
43002,Lisa,"mom, is dad gonna kill us?"
44412,Lisa,"look, bart. i have to practice my saxophone and you can't stop me."
46301,Lisa,will i ever see you again?
44960,Lisa,"yes, you did! yesterday. right by my locker."
43058,Lisa,you want a piece of me?
50887,Lisa,get your hands off my future!
49568,Lisa,b plus?!
43005,Lisa,okilly dokilly.
47950,Lisa,um... maybe mom's the way to go.
45448,Lisa,but you promised me we'd do something japanese.
44244,Lisa,"oh, what's happening? where am i?"
50232,Lisa,you mean your gingerbread mcmansion.
50733,Lisa,"hello, lovebirds."
47368,Lisa,snowball!
41667,Lisa,question two: using what you learned in question one...
52393,Lisa,me too.
45825,Lisa,mom! bart's sitting next to me!
46264,Lisa,"hey! ah! stop it, you creep!"
45683,Lisa,they'll have tabouleh.
41786,Lisa,hmm...
43182,Lisa,it is off.
51883,Lisa,tough choice.
42302,Lisa,mommy.
46328,Lisa,"no, dad! i think there's a leak in the line."
50420,Lisa,shut up! i just want to know what she's up to with milhouse. a girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even kyle lobianco!
49204,Lisa,why can't you just admit we're lost?
50496,Lisa,"""perhaps someday there will be a cure. although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy, i'll pass."""
41953,Lisa,"it's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, dad. we watch an appalling amount of tv."
52027,Lisa,"yes, you are."
44733,Lisa,i'm supposed to talk to you about proposition 305...
42521,Lisa,"yeah, well krusty stole it from steve allen."
50910,Lisa,what? you did?
51669,Lisa,"stopping mr. burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""beezus and ramona."" but i know someone who can help..."
47165,Lisa,"but he won't, because he's too cowardly."
47922,Lisa,"bart, why were you in there so long?"
46374,Lisa,"hey, karie."
46814,Lisa,"what's this weird mark next to my ""a""?"
42982,Lisa,hey!
42374,Lisa,yeah. nice gag.
45975,Lisa,"no, you can't!"
49853,Lisa,you wanted to get caught.
42306,Lisa,mondale to hart: where's the beef?
51631,Lisa,"i know, but they're not gonna waste a whole saturday inside."
48027,Lisa,that's what we've been trying to tell you!
47663,Lisa,"dad, how could you say these things?"
51342,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
51989,Lisa,"you win, bart."
46866,Lisa,"actually, it says here we're gonna see hockey."
51721,Lisa,"mom, i'm just a kid. but i say if dad isn't here christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from."
41874,Lisa,"here you go, bart. it's a long shot, but, that's all i can do without learning ancient hebrew."
49512,Lisa,he ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!
46098,Lisa,"no, really. i think books have an amazing power to bring people together. look, even cletus is checking one out."
44778,Lisa,"and now, sports."
50435,Lisa,returning this lost key to principal skinner.
42744,Lisa,"what are you basing that on, mom?"
52196,Lisa,"but bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?"
42611,Lisa,"quit it, bart. quit it. quit it. quit it. mom, bart's making faces."
43730,Lisa,"mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. and dad's upstairs."
46052,Lisa,"dad, i'll set up your computer. why don't you and bart go play in the back yard?"
48694,Lisa,"you don't even know the rules! this could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!"
48829,Lisa,"to be fair, the millennium just started, so it's not that big a deal... but they're giving it to me!"
41931,Lisa,everything.
42245,Lisa,uh-huh.
48056,Lisa,saving!
50889,Lisa,get outta here!
47856,Lisa,yes. the clerk also gave me this bench warrant for dad's arrest.
43845,Lisa,no.
49299,Lisa,"dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying!"
47661,Lisa,you're not mad about principal skinrash?
47708,Lisa,i know! it's such an unrealistic standard for young... huh?
49515,Lisa,mom! mom! we know where dad is!
43412,Lisa,and we don't even know whose gun that was. maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad.
49838,Lisa,that's why my jazz is so smooth!
49526,Lisa,"oh ralph, how i envy your optimism. there is no springfield fifty years in the future! with global warming trapping the co2 inside our poisonous atmosphere, our super-heated oceans will rise, drowning our lowlands, leaving what's left of humanity baking in deserts that once fed the world!"
51630,Lisa,that's all i wanted: a tiny bit of control.
45427,Lisa,"this is ""wired."" it's about computers and technology."
42917,Lisa,happy valentine's.
47967,Lisa,there's no way i'm gonna beat her.
51100,Lisa,that's odd.
48004,Lisa,now you're getting creepy.
43742,Lisa,i don't know. but it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.
50798,Lisa,"please, take your time."
49629,Lisa,"bart, have you established your alibi?"
45585,Lisa,that's the doll that attacked me!
50236,Lisa,security!
50808,Lisa,"don't ""monster"" me."
52412,Lisa,i believe i know the answer.
51870,Lisa,look what i found.
49453,Lisa,the jewel will lead me to my baby sister? why are you telling me this?
42775,Lisa,dad! you're sinking!
50855,Lisa,"yes, it's the preferred term. and most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. but some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
50387,Lisa,"raymondo, i knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep. raymondo?"
51343,Lisa,excellent.
51686,Lisa,"wait, stop! why must you kill my dad? especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?"
52524,Lisa,"now, where is the google door?"
50295,Lisa,i believe it's from lamps plus.
46659,Lisa,i bet maggie would like one.
50152,Lisa,"maggie, something happened to mom and i'm gonna find out what and when."
52244,Lisa,i reached him.
49006,Lisa,nothing like fresh air.
45726,Lisa,"hey, isn't that the bass player from ""satanica""?"
50464,Lisa,that's where the ice bridge would be! go down!
45170,Lisa,kids?
46844,Lisa,yes.
45308,Lisa,"oh, milhouse is selling seeds! and he's coming this wa... oh, the birds got him."
52370,Lisa,"on the left is mr. largo, my music teacher at school. he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. and on the right is bleeding gums murphy. he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it."
48557,Lisa,is that really how it ends? what happened to the merlinical council?
43967,Lisa,"it's not foilage, mom. it's foliage. fo-li-age."
51175,Lisa,we're pretty broken.
43076,Lisa,see?
47107,Lisa,dad took us antiquing!
50026,Lisa,how do you cope?
48707,Lisa,"you were right to kick me out of that game. soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of europe and south america."
47129,Lisa,wanna play a little longer? it's only ten and the moon is awful big.
48504,Lisa,"colonel, i hope you've learned that an occupying foreign force can never defeat a determined local populace. among the many things we learned in vietnam is that a well-motivated..."
46449,Lisa,"they should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"
50032,Lisa,i came to share in the esteem that the world bestows on its artists.
48830,Lisa,...and the father-daughter dance.
48950,Lisa,oh my god!
47310,Lisa,daisies.
44844,Lisa,"ahm... i wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. she said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room."
43664,Lisa,yay!
52216,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
44049,Lisa,then why did you want to be with me?
52378,Lisa,"huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab."
50689,Lisa,"wait, how long is this love for again?"
47375,Lisa,"coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake?"
48010,Lisa,my good-girl points!
45554,Lisa,"ooh, i want to get the ""kr_nk""!"
51419,Lisa,"i don't need a new ralph, i like the old one. happy valentine's day!"
42274,Lisa,they discovered radium. then they both died of radiation poisoning.
47196,Lisa,i guess so.
50467,Lisa,"no, i mean they're mannequins!"
43476,Lisa,"i never realized before, but some itchy and scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
46662,Lisa,"whatcha doing, mom?"
45319,Lisa,"not now, moses. we gotta find a way outta here."
45847,Lisa,"but i want to learn a dance i can use in real life, like the tango de la muerte."
42672,Lisa,"and that's how i cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of tv's ""facts of life"", including long time hold-out, tootie."
49475,Lisa,from this angle they're words!
45706,Lisa,dear mr. president
48291,Lisa,maybe there's another way to solve this. bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot.
44089,Lisa,really? let me see!
47117,Lisa,"""on this battleground in 1881, fifty-six indians lost their lives and four brave americans lost their hats."""
46272,Lisa,"/ oh, he got overthrown!"
51706,Lisa,a world of anarchic free expression!
47483,Lisa,"maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly!"
48461,Lisa,"aww, they're all so cute."
43369,Lisa,"so, mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?"
44357,Lisa,apparently tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
48109,Lisa,"uh, mom? remember how you wished we would never grow up?"
46729,Lisa,"i just wanted to belong! for once, i felt i was with intellectual equals."
48708,Lisa,so from now on i'll play soccer for the same reason i study chemistry -- for fun!
48966,Lisa,"bart, i have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. put its fingerprints all over the railing..."
41634,Lisa,oh my god! my brother's my best friend.
50812,Lisa,to thank you!
45579,Lisa,"don't you think there's something weird going on here? we spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""phil from marketing""."
50938,Lisa,"willie, i love your chaps."
49042,Lisa,"keep it down, i'm reading ""harry potter!"""
47046,Lisa,we've gotta do something to help him.
49360,Lisa,see who?
46481,Lisa,awww...
48609,Lisa,"...hitachee tribe.,hitachee tribe,2
111238,390,17,lisa simpson: wait"
44434,Lisa,i know it's good.
48910,Lisa,and ralph is only eight years old! it says in the constitution you have to be thirty-five.
48083,Lisa,"hi, dr. nick."
43446,Lisa,what? how could you do that? your soul is the most valuable part of you!
43506,Lisa,"hi, dad. looking for me?"
45987,Lisa,"well, um, i was thinking of going vegan!"
41947,Lisa,"my jump rope broke, but i just tied it back together."
50494,Lisa,"""dearest marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."""
50313,Lisa,"it's okay, grampa -- you don't have to act grumpy. i know you're taking the drug, and i don't mind -- because you're happy."
42348,Lisa,i'm not sure that is water.
50407,Lisa,"oh, so that's why they don't give pigs truffles."
41957,Lisa,ariel.
48273,Lisa,let's see... it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv.
52270,Lisa,"well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the..."
44392,Lisa,i just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
46629,Lisa,and that's the greatest thing ever written.
49174,Lisa,"and i'm never gonna go to machu picchu. in this family, you get used to disappointments."
51333,Lisa,i'll see you later.
49408,Lisa,why does he think alfred's friends with batman?
49839,Lisa,"grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?"
44321,Lisa,"um, dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. it's..."
43622,Lisa,"hey, mom! there's something in here!"
47045,Lisa,that's jelly.
49938,Lisa,"those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. i guess it's just nature's way."
45434,Lisa,"um, according to the mexican council of food, this expired two years ago."
51194,Lisa,"dad, what's that on your lap?!"
46263,Lisa,oh no! it's the poachers!
52070,Lisa,"bart, look!"
50000,Lisa,"oh i get it. they go to oslo, we get some ice cream."
46046,Lisa,i'm so proud! my dad will be the grand finale of the thanksgiving day parade.
50050,Lisa,"so nelson, i see you started a small business."
45941,Lisa,killer dolphins?
42100,Lisa,give it to the poor.
43853,Lisa,wha?
50438,Lisa,band books?!
48818,Lisa,shout!
43447,Lisa,"well, whether or not the soul is physically real, bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us."
43236,Lisa,"oh hugh, thank you. you've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal."
48726,Lisa,i can't -- i won't!
48390,Lisa,"well, whatever the answer is, i'm glad i'm a girl and i'm glad i'm good at math. now enjoy your stupid flautist."
50006,Lisa,i can hear you.
49735,Lisa,"bart, i'm losing my grip!"
47422,Lisa,"ooh, we're like howard carter discovering the temple of tutankhamen."
50351,Lisa,would you... be interested in teaching me?
51849,Lisa,all of the other reindeer / used to laugh and call him names...
50509,Lisa,"wow! while i was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
48280,Lisa,"mr. burns got his plant back, and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul."
44008,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm so sorry..."
48460,Lisa,that might work.
45901,Lisa,"suddenly, i was invited to every birthday party. sometimes i'd have to read the cake just to know who i was singing to."
43036,Lisa,"mom, this is really scary. i'm gonna get my first 'f' ever."
43378,Lisa,he's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
48567,Lisa,"it's your foot doctor, gil! yes... yes... oh dear... i can't tell him that."
44964,Lisa,date?
47954,Lisa,i brought you some weak tea and dry toast.
43815,Lisa,"but i don't see any tigers around here, do you?"
51147,Lisa,no! that's impossible! he's dead! i lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.
43390,Lisa,could not!
48029,Lisa,the ones made from potatoes?
42890,Lisa,"give it to me! hey wait, there's nothing bad here."
50264,Lisa,why are you hung over? i didn't see you drink last night.
45085,Lisa,"mom, no, wait! we can make a deal!"
47729,Lisa,it's a media circus!
44021,Lisa,would you... play a song for me?
48497,Lisa,martians? you do know that radio broadcast was a hoax?
41843,Lisa,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? ewww.
42622,Lisa,"ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. you've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society."
52307,Lisa,"but everybody does it! i mean, we're stealing cable as we speak."
46013,Lisa,aww.
46848,Lisa,"dad, i'm telling you, truman wins."
48204,Lisa,"oh, bart, why'd you ask him a follow-up question?"
48162,Lisa,that's my italian tutor!
43149,Lisa,i can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that i've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
46543,Lisa,i thought you liked the new dad.
46126,Lisa,i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
51411,Lisa,they'll just reboot radioactive man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them.
42501,Lisa,"oh, good idea! let's see... bass, bass... ""tiny tim""... ""the chipmunks greatest hits""... ""a castrato christmas""..."
50419,Lisa,hmm...
44910,Lisa,wow! this is the best anniversary ever.
45036,Lisa,wow. did you know they had those web flaps for gliding?
45478,Lisa,"dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?"
42292,Lisa,uh-huh.
44926,Lisa,i like school.
49156,Lisa,i don't recognize any of them.
46766,Lisa,hm. does dad seem a little... dumber than usual?
46769,Lisa,"dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?"
51951,Lisa,"sorry, dad. i know you mean well."
41707,Lisa,"yes, you! baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
51356,Lisa,hey. i'm sorry i fired you.
47220,Lisa,"oh, definitely. if you ask me, she's far less dangerous than bart."
47714,Lisa,i can't hear you.
51598,Lisa,happy mother's day.
44275,Lisa,"hey, this park is great! how come we never take santa's little helper here?"
46333,Lisa,i can't remember the last time dad sang us a torch song.
44928,Lisa,no!
41631,Lisa,but how?
44573,Lisa,and after we spent all the townspeople's money.
50528,Lisa,what kind of american man doesn't want to explore global food culture?
42258,Lisa,what are we going to have?
46158,Lisa,lieutenant smash...
44528,Lisa,"ugh, those morons make me so angry."
45519,Lisa,it's got a computer chip in it. everything does.
51086,Lisa,i find that a little hard to believe.
43151,Lisa,when krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away.
46324,Lisa,you said we were doing this out of friendship.
42767,Lisa,"it's perfect, dad."
48057,Lisa,this stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!
42598,Lisa,it's so nice having everything back to normal.
48143,Lisa,"oh, yeah."
47535,Lisa,"""fox broadcasting, 10201 west pico, building 203..."""
44267,Lisa,"and so handsome! bart, i just love him!"
49936,Lisa,huh?
43000,Lisa,what about grampa?
42606,Lisa,sure dad.
44410,Lisa,"but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!"
46425,Lisa,"dad, what's wrong?"
47945,Lisa,"attention, duped masses!"
52266,Lisa,"hello, dr. hibbert."
43015,Lisa,"no, bart. i just think you and jessica are too different from each other to get along. she's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
42896,Lisa,what's this?
43701,Lisa,"oh, dad, i'm really sorry. i know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
43991,Lisa,she knows.
43270,Lisa,what's santa's little helper doing to that dog?
42123,Lisa,"come on, bart. if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
51338,Lisa,i'll make both.
47021,Lisa,"oh my god, you're right. i spelled it wrong. i tried my best -- and i failed!"
41870,Lisa,no bart. knowledge.
42139,Lisa,"hey bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
44751,Lisa,ralph? but the rocket was my idea.
49385,Lisa,cu-ckoo!
51027,Lisa,it's just enough to get home. i'm hungry now.
49137,Lisa,to make bart a krusketeer?
52186,Lisa,"and, finally, the most important book of all, the tao te ching by lao tzu."
52081,Lisa,"uh-oh, school bus."
47327,Lisa,"hey! wait a minute, if we're all out here, who's in there?"
52044,Lisa,"you know, in albania the unit of currency is called the lek."
51972,Lisa,i don't want your pity.
46960,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen. tonight, i'd like to harangue you about the plight of--"
47707,Lisa,this store makes me feel even worse about myself.
48618,Lisa,"well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked."
47473,Lisa,"do it for an hour, hour and a half."
47259,Lisa,okay.
46405,Lisa,"dad, you shot moe!"
46582,Lisa,plus he'll work for scale.
50629,Lisa,"hi, guys, what are you doing?"
49587,Lisa,"because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then i feel sorry for you. do you feel sorry for me? guess not."
46711,Lisa,campus?
49528,Lisa,what's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
43705,Lisa,no! not janey! she'll pack the supreme court with boys!
52011,Lisa,i hope she likes the presents we got her.
43749,Lisa,i've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
51716,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't be jealous of apu. remember, it's all about the music."
46885,Lisa,sideshow bob!
45143,Lisa,"mom, don't."
45480,Lisa,"wow, a bustling metropolitan newsroom, funnelling scoops from all over the globe."
50557,Lisa,"there, finished. now if i win just two more games of online boggle, i'll be ready to start writing."
52507,Lisa,"no, you were real."
52019,Lisa,then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
47244,Lisa,i may be the new girl / but you can't brainwash me / just osh-kosh-b'gosh me / and then leave me be /
42662,Lisa,"dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? i mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?"
44127,Lisa,nope.
52299,Lisa,"everything i know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
45997,Lisa,not so fast!
45648,Lisa,"hey mom, how's the leg?..."
42242,Lisa,"before i sing the national anthem, i'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
47704,Lisa,shut up! i do not!
43891,Lisa,"well, we could do something fun. um, how 'bout a beach party?"
52384,Lisa,discount lion safari!
44840,Lisa,what if i took a bus?
51107,Lisa,aw... but i do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
44678,Lisa,"you look a little nervous, dad."
50559,Lisa,"sitting in a coffee shop -- i couldn't feel more like a real writer! oh, better set up my wi-fi in case i need to do some research! but if i'm gonna use their free internet, i really should buy something."
45500,Lisa,it's gonna kill you!
45215,Lisa,"what's this wrapped in a banana leaf? mmm, smells like mint."
47721,Lisa,"yeah, a little. those mean girls just get to me."
43552,Lisa,shouldn't you be working?
49724,Lisa,i'm a freakin' buddhist! a buddhist!
46206,Lisa,"ooh, here's the tape i need."
52261,Lisa,itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
45269,Lisa,"dad, will you please tell bart to stop squeaking his chair. i'm trying to do my homework."
47603,Lisa,i can't believe you stood mom up.
44095,Lisa,what about our dad?!
50567,Lisa,"i was raised in a traveling circus. my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber. i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box. it was featured in the new yorker's ""best forty under four"" issue."
52301,Lisa,"dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?"
51492,Lisa,"oh my god, he's in the walls!"
52333,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?
48543,Lisa,"all right, no husband."
50665,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna look at the desserts!"
49625,Lisa,"interesting. with no obvious motive, no one would suspect us."
47618,Lisa,that's from the first amendment to the constitution. thank you.
52286,Lisa,i can dig it!
44214,Lisa,i thought i told you to go to bed!
48962,Lisa,act like you're shopping! we can't be seen together.
51036,Lisa,why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? that's how young people date these days.
42214,Lisa,what are you talking about?
43355,Lisa,oh thank you. but five hundred dollars! you'll never see that much money again!
45054,Lisa,how humiliating.
52473,Lisa,'s okay. but you know who took her side? marge boooouuuuvier simpson!
44810,Lisa,"nelson, cover for me."
41938,Lisa,the wax never lies.
49087,Lisa,"no, us!"
44221,Lisa,"bart, are you okay?!"
47786,Lisa,dad?...
42119,Lisa,these talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on tv.
51328,Lisa,what are you doing?!
49193,Lisa,huh.
49884,Lisa,"hey, they're not eating."
48755,Lisa,look what the bullies could have stolen...
50469,Lisa,otto? are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?
43528,Lisa,"you saved us, maggie!"
49488,Lisa,"it's really maggie, sherlock. you know, i have to point out that this anagram only works if i get the wrong answer first."
45836,Lisa,got that right. / durn tootin'. / boy howdy.
47928,Lisa,milhouse?! uh! i've been turning him down for the prom since kindergarten.
43495,Lisa,that's cute.
44549,Lisa,"when i had to learn about the magna carta, i made up a song. ""in 1215 at runnymede!/ doo dah, doo dah/ the nobles and the king agreed!/ oh, d-doo dah day..."""
45018,Lisa,"mom, they put every kid in america in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. it's all a big scam."
46621,Lisa,i want my mommy!
52324,Lisa,"no. and, since i'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, i'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair prince."
49759,Lisa,why is the tv back on? what happened to the videogame?
41733,Lisa,"hey, they do look alike!"
52165,Lisa,we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher!
44749,Lisa,i wanna read the giant book!
47847,Lisa,we have to do something about it!
43905,Lisa,bart!
50628,Lisa,"trust me, i've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. anyway, i ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. that's what kids do, right? hang out at the mall together. but when i went over..."

47593,Lisa,"as springfield's youngest buddhist, i am deeply honored to introduce the dalai lama."
45746,Lisa,"thank you. ""a gay president in 2084""?"
45897,Lisa,sheriff lowbrow...
50554,Lisa,i'll show you! i'll write a book myself! a personal story my readers will connect with!
42391,Lisa,"dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?"
41860,Lisa,that is so sad.
44121,Lisa,"yes, sing us a song!"
45154,Lisa,"i know you're a little peeved at grampa, dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
51632,Lisa,i've got an idea... but i'll need that broccoli.
49716,Lisa,"oh, gross, gross, gross, gross."
51932,Lisa,"does, too."
50753,Lisa,the penguin's life isn't all bad. those ones are having a blast!
45590,Lisa,the phone's not even plugged in!
46267,Lisa,the chimps are running a diamond mine?!
48140,Lisa,don't make me affix it to your file.
45121,Lisa,"uh, i am sick of everyone being so proud of me!"
50114,Lisa,"...so because of your on-base percentage, nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. questions?"
45557,Lisa,you already saw them.

50779,Lisa,you said they'd take it easy on me!
42541,Lisa,why haven't you hung up your gold record?
50658,Lisa,polo!
42204,Lisa,truly this was an act of god.
49328,Lisa,"oh, they've found a home."

45754,Lisa,what about my pledge to build the world's largest bookmobile? isn't there any money left for that?
47830,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. after all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"

46915,Lisa,so you know one thing about me. big deal.
51930,Lisa,hey! give those back!
42726,Lisa,"but you are malibu stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. i'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it."
43570,Lisa,"no, dad, it's a rhetorical question."
46446,Lisa,that could not be more blasphemous.
49107,Lisa,"ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
47209,Lisa,"no -- your son! on the biggest day of his life, when he accepts the nobel prize, you're not gonna be there."
46838,Lisa,thanks. where'd you get?...
45092,Lisa,"oh, great. so i'm dead now? fine, i'm sick of this stupid game anyway."

44254,Lisa,mo-om!
49162,Lisa,i'm trying to set you up for laughs.
45217,Lisa,that's not a fairy tale. it's just something that happened to you at moe's.

48555,Lisa,"come on, read, read!"
49298,Lisa,"willie, i didn't know you were an apiarist."
45514,Lisa,stretch dude! help!
49688,Lisa,"you heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. to ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. the moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it."
47993,Lisa,"dad, i don't want things to be awful between us. i made you some cookies."
46757,Lisa,are you gonna call the police?
46856,Lisa,"bart, this is all your fault."
47656,Lisa,"bart, you're staying!"
48388,Lisa,i always thought that boys had it easier. but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined.
50009,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
52288,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
50013,Lisa,"wednesday we did ""mame."""
46529,Lisa,you do this every year. we are used to it.

47301,Lisa,"dad, you rear-ended the queen of england!"
50005,Lisa,arts arts arts education...
45158,Lisa,"that ""change"" was a bribe."
49009,Lisa,i thought they were cancer sticks.
43370,Lisa,"mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad."
45365,Lisa,jack lalanne!
44893,Lisa,wowww. it's magnificent.
46834,Lisa,"oh bart, i think we're lost."
47195,Lisa,"dad, do you realize what you've done? you've created a world without death."
46846,Lisa,"listen, we're really sorry. we got lost on a field trip from springfield elementary!"
52174,Lisa,"mom, what's he doing wrong?"
42031,Lisa,i suspected as much.
44722,Lisa,i don't want to turn out that way!
47479,Lisa,aren't you smart. let's try another one... a little harder this time.
41663,Lisa,a fight? that would mean rejecting the last part of me that's still a girl.
41704,Lisa,he's gone. forever.
42513,Lisa,"you're still my hero, mom."
49900,Lisa,"dad, while i agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle."
49291,Lisa,"um, mr. mobbs... i sort of downloaded too many songs onto my mypod. and i don't have the money to pay for them. and... do you think you could consider a reduced payment plan?"
45444,Lisa,what the--?
46270,Lisa,these are just pictures of monkeys from famous movies.
51354,Lisa,but i--
42411,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
43710,Lisa,stop it! where's the silver tongue?!
51270,Lisa,"bart, you're not annoyed that milhouse asked me to go to the american football game instead of you?"
45122,Lisa,can't you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?
42445,Lisa,the christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
43453,Lisa,how're the southwestern pizza fingers?
51903,Lisa,we would if we had one.
42408,Lisa,"hi, ralph. you were great tonight."
45655,Lisa,what are you doing here?
43960,Lisa,"i'm allergic to everything here. my nose is so stuffed up, i can't even taste mom's delicious boiled celery."
46104,Lisa,"dad, how could you? we were connecting in such a meaningful way."
50289,Lisa,angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
42612,Lisa,what is it?
52114,Lisa,"... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, ""we have traced the call. it's coming from the floor below you. get out of the house!"" but it was too late. end of story."
51829,Lisa,cook all the tater tots! / there were too many tots! / and the teachers took them home in manila envelopes! / i hate you!
47121,Lisa,i'm lisa simpson and you're the first person i've met here who cares about our animal equals.
48355,Lisa,"mom, the girls' school is a joke and i'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
52300,Lisa,cable? / us? / wow! / we have cable!
46801,Lisa,"look, there's dad!"
43317,Lisa,yeah.
45750,Lisa,"excellent question. yes, i am proud to be america's first straight female president. helen?"
48792,Lisa,world.
44461,Lisa,no...
45007,Lisa,"you've started smoking, dad?"
43743,Lisa,i don't understand it. we're always the ones who solve these problems.
51200,Lisa,huh. it looks like he's praying...
42814,Lisa,"oh. that is so cool, that is so exciting, that is so... crappy."
49419,Lisa,they're all equally valid! but that can't be. in life everything only has one answer!
50771,Lisa,"oooh, look at these: ""extreme weddings"" triathlon, zero g... ""tie the knot at the top of mt. everest?!"""
44348,Lisa,look at how disciplined they are. they're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian.
42048,Lisa,she's beautiful!
46618,Lisa,"uh, god says we should just be friends."
43134,Lisa,mom! make dad tell the story right.
51187,Lisa,three awesome kids and a life of regret!
47409,Lisa,"oh, i can't stand it."
42583,Lisa,"dad, do you notice anything strange?"
41743,Lisa,"maggie, look. what's that?"
42356,Lisa,i did.
50041,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
41975,Lisa,daaaaad! you're not listening to me.
49726,Lisa,"larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like? fusion? neo-bop?"
49342,Lisa,i don't know -- it's been so long since i've had a playdate. not that i couldn't get one if i wanted...
46946,Lisa,and all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
49711,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna convince you to turn yourselves in."
42318,Lisa,operation? what are you talking about?
46842,Lisa,i'm sorry i got us lost out here.
44980,Lisa,so un-ask her.
47863,Lisa,he did try to cheer me up when my hamster died.
48773,Lisa,how do i stop it?!
44720,Lisa,easy does it now... easy... little more... yea... right... that's the spot... ooah!
49529,Lisa,"oh, go ahead -- numb me."
49046,Lisa,banana bread!
46551,Lisa,but west springfield's three times the size of texas. we'll never find him there.
41633,Lisa,hey...
42235,Lisa,i'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. unless it's made out of plastic.
42778,Lisa,dad!
45267,Lisa,squeaking that chair!
46867,Lisa,"this is a joke. you'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood."
41642,Lisa,"oh, no... i think i'm getting a crush on nelson muntz!"
45258,Lisa,what happened to my room?!
45949,Lisa,"no, dad! we don't want to kill him! let's call animal control."
42742,Lisa,"how doth the hero, strong and brave, a celestial path in the heavens pave!"
44986,Lisa,"forget it, mom. i'm not going."
49146,Lisa,long john seltzer!
42068,Lisa,"mom, they're professional athletes. they're used to this sort of thing. it rolls right off their backs."
48686,Lisa,it's seven a.m.
42398,Lisa,oh no. please don't show me with ralph.
45617,Lisa,see mom? you conquered your fears and now you're ready to sk--
46958,Lisa,i'unno. buddha?
42574,Lisa,wait! doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
52305,Lisa,"dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
49989,Lisa,"as an eight-year-old girl in twenty-first century america, i know how it is to feel insecure about your looks. but you've got so much going for you. i'd kill for your sense of smell... you have a nice firm handshake..."
42763,Lisa,"no, dad. he's grooming him."
44987,Lisa,"mom, you can't possibly believe that."
46746,Lisa,ew! bart!
48003,Lisa,"well, i think you're the sweetest dad in the whole world."
49095,Lisa,i can't believe i'm a director with a movie at sundance.
49168,Lisa,see ya!
51639,Lisa,"no, whenever anything bothers me i harmlessly vent it to maggie."
47272,Lisa,"i hereby resign as your president. and for my last act, i call a general student strike, effective immediately!"
42198,Lisa,give it a little more gas.
42694,Lisa,"dad, dad!"
49763,Lisa,"well, you still should have let them have their fun!"
43478,Lisa,"dad, can't you have some other kind of party? one where you don't serve meat?"
43191,Lisa,"mr. sherman, i understand you have two pulitzer prizes."
51869,Lisa,we've been robbed!
49594,Lisa,"excuse me, but snow white is a fairytale from hundreds of years ago. no one owns that."
44674,Lisa,me too...
43229,Lisa,oh.
48545,Lisa,haw haw!
43121,Lisa,or an inlet.
45954,Lisa,mom!
46905,Lisa,i wonder what this could be?
44846,Lisa,"hmm. i guess i could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea."
45894,Lisa,"oh, i really miss mom."
51871,Lisa,yeah!
41963,Lisa,is it sherri?
51976,Lisa,thanks.
49544,Lisa,"um, do you mind if i join you?"
50931,Lisa,i've been meat-walking!
51867,Lisa,"dad, eat something. it's got mustard on it."
45716,Lisa,use this plastic bag.
49944,Lisa,"thanks for not letting me give up, dad."
47410,Lisa,"mom, that sounds a lot like the movie ""amadeus,"" which was historically inaccurate. mozart worked hard on his music... salieri was a respected composer..."
42670,Lisa,why are you so happy?
43950,Lisa,it says here one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at disneyland.
42755,Lisa,me too.
52085,Lisa,"hey, mom."
45477,Lisa,why is the zero made out of glass?
49074,Lisa,"oh, that's a funny joke, mr. kinkaid. is this an art class or a comedy class? seriously, why is it three?"
51083,Lisa,"that's right! bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids. mostly these kids. there's only so many kids."
43864,Lisa,it must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
45332,Lisa,"dad, chew with your mouth closed. you're losing your mystique."
48309,Lisa,we're not dead... and neither are you.
48860,Lisa,i got dolphin.
44614,Lisa,"oh, i can't watch."
45388,Lisa,"dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?"
49622,Lisa,stupid miss hoover.
50182,Lisa,count me in!
49582,Lisa,could you?
47123,Lisa,"mom, why are you talking like that?"
49751,Lisa,maybe i should go out and get you guys a converter.
43048,Lisa,ma. i think i'm all hugged out. oh... one more.
46865,Lisa,that's how i felt all along.
47823,Lisa,why did you burn up your shirt?
43745,Lisa,"hi. i remember you from such film strips as ""locker room towel fight: the blinding of larry driscoll."""
47752,Lisa,wha--?!
50720,Lisa,"everything has rules, bart."
49979,Lisa,what's that delicious smell?
51104,Lisa,what's that?
46269,Lisa,how could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
46591,Lisa,give grampa a chance. statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes.
50908,Lisa,"well, back to square one is a major victory in this house, but why did you help me?"
47440,Lisa,what? really?
52322,Lisa,go for it dad!
51964,Lisa,"thanks, mr. murphy."
47811,Lisa,looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
52250,Lisa,"thank you for arranging this, dr. hibbert."
43831,Lisa,"bart, no!"
51384,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
50576,Lisa,so i pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
46536,Lisa,really?
47582,Lisa,did i do anything right?
46797,Lisa,...while you're spending the week at...
47844,Lisa,"ah, pre-modern man. if these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
49518,Lisa,"dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into maggie?"
50273,Lisa,fine. just get in here.
42017,Lisa,"look around you, malibu stacey. all this was bought with dirty money. your penthouse, your alfa romeo, your collagen injection clinic."
49279,Lisa,"i can't afford any of your products, but can i buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think i have a mypod?"
47958,Lisa,and if that diamond ring turns brass / mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
48514,Lisa,"how 'bout this for a title: ""howling at a concrete moon."""
47434,Lisa,oh. i see how it is.
45454,Lisa,"well, maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, i'll just go."
45460,Lisa,"stop doing that, mom."
43399,Lisa,"hey! i said that. my name is lisa simpson, and i made a chart of all the suspects in the burns case. look."
49644,Lisa,"all right, bart... i guess i have no choice. i have to kill... you!"
51174,Lisa,there... carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside reykjavik.
41929,Lisa,"giddyup, dad."
49143,Lisa,krusty klovnen baby visker?
42463,Lisa,lois sanborn.
49379,Lisa,"yes! i mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! green ones, chinese ones, chubby bald ones..."
44255,Lisa,"mo-om!! prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"
43339,Lisa,grampa!
51879,Lisa,aha!
46118,Lisa,"i'll call poison control. fran, it's me. just a heads-up."
42571,Lisa,bobo. it's mr. burns' bear all right.
47792,Lisa,mr. burns acting nice? that's odd. he must be up to something.
52209,Lisa,"bart, cut it out!"
51248,Lisa,i have a solution!
42271,Lisa,"mom, they expect you to lie a little."
41997,Lisa,i'd bet my entire college fund on it.
44865,Lisa,"aha! it's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north."
42714,Lisa,it's awful being a kid. no one listens to you.
46530,Lisa,"ooh, a salute to brunch! wave to brunch, maggie!"
51618,Lisa,"which meant that at long last, my brother could get a good night's sleep."
47264,Lisa,they've taken everything!
49053,Lisa,it's a no-brainer.
49152,Lisa,i'm gonna keep this forever!
46783,Lisa,please don't hurt our family.
46509,Lisa,"look, we can't fall into old patterns. we've gotta think of a plan."
51080,Lisa,"nice going, bart. you've ruined halloween, thanksgiving, christmas and easter. the legendary grand slam."
41709,Lisa,no!
51016,Lisa,"mom, i think maggie misses tv."
42030,Lisa,"bart, who's winning?"
44353,Lisa,all i want is a chance to prove myself.
49382,Lisa,"looks like. juliet, i don't want to go to equalia anymore."
43964,Lisa,what are you talking about?
46693,Lisa,"bart, stick to the script. don't be a jerk."
42683,Lisa,"dad, you should blow the whistle on the kwik-e-mart."
51636,Lisa,she's under a lot of stress. her husband's at sea.
49824,Lisa,our family has heroes!
46061,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
44456,Lisa,somebody's gotta stop them!
44065,Lisa,"dad, no! this may just be the eye of the hurricane."
51274,Lisa,"wow! that was great! can i have my regular clothes back, please?"
51317,Lisa,what is so funny? they're destroying the world!
48778,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
48429,Lisa,i understand. i'm not like my dad either.
44791,Lisa,"you didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony."
49082,Lisa,"okay, but can i just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
51782,Lisa,"no ideas? oh, that's sad."
51094,Lisa,"your honor, i think we've seen enough. i have demolished the prosecution's claims and made the prosecutor sweat through two shirts."
51530,Lisa,how'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
45383,Lisa,"people, stop! stop! we're not animals!"
51246,Lisa,i won the science fair! i get to go to chicago!
52217,Lisa,"i couldn't tell you how many hours. it was a labor of love. it's my homage to some american heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless..."
50967,Lisa,what does that mean?
46837,Lisa,what do you care?
44100,Lisa,"uh, mom?"
51037,Lisa,i know. it's weird to me too.
42194,Lisa,i think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness.
48614,Lisa,the hitachees invented women's lacrosse... soft luggage...
43101,Lisa,"dad, i like picking beans with grandma."
42299,Lisa,"well, don't push her. remember, ""tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
51121,Lisa,"milhouse, seeing you there... saying nothing... it's the cutest you've ever been."
52006,Lisa,it's so awful.
42708,Lisa,they cannot keep making dolls like this! something has to be done!
52371,Lisa,and look!
44084,Lisa,"wow, mom, look at all those customers!"
43237,Lisa,are you okay?
44372,Lisa,"meet me at the eliminator"" after lights out. p.s. the cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
42064,Lisa,"no, i want to get him a beer."
41742,Lisa,"ah ha, now you look pathetic."
48921,Lisa,"we're in the middle of our own story, thank you."
51596,Lisa,"i'm fine. fine! it's funny, but... hurting your feelings made me feel better."
47227,Lisa,"grandma, you'll always be an inspiration to me."
48472,Lisa,bart! what are you doing here?
49865,Lisa,"""dear fellow organic gardening enthusiasts: i'm afraid i am too sad to post my list of garden-friendly snails. yet again i have seen the bitter truth of how difficult it is to be smart and accepted."" ""with mulch love, lisa simpson."" mulch love, that's cute."
51880,Lisa,we were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
46291,Lisa,what's happening? where am i?
47948,Lisa,"bart, how can you laugh at that? you just had a heart attack!"
42216,Lisa,nope.
50246,Lisa,it's a sign. mom's okay! thank you.
51072,Lisa,that just made it worse.
45377,Lisa,"thank you. mm. for low-fat, this pudding's pretty good."
48024,Lisa,"it's albanian. but the producers added subtitles to make it ""commercial."""
47304,Lisa,push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
46023,Lisa,... pour cocktail onions down your pants.
47692,Lisa,yes.
45996,Lisa,"wow, what a view."
42011,Lisa,"you know, dad, we've been watching a lot of tv lately. maybe, the sunday after the super bowl, we could hike up to the top of mount springfield. the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
51505,Lisa,what you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
52433,Lisa,"yes! yes, mr. bergstrom?"
47250,Lisa,"oh, don't be silly."
44000,Lisa,"thanks, but i prefer the honest way."
43137,Lisa,"sounds like you had a good day today, dad."
50103,Lisa,everyone shift towards right!
48617,Lisa,"show's over, let's go!"
44830,Lisa,"so we transplant the town. we're just gonna trash the new springfield, too."
43414,Lisa,"that's it! oh, mr. pigeon, i'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
45855,Lisa,it's me!
46009,Lisa,"oh, i can't take it! would it be so bad if i just went home for an hour?"
43921,Lisa,ow! what's that supposed to prove?
42757,Lisa,we won't.
51933,Lisa,"hey, everybody. here comes my brother, bart the bully­ killer!"
50512,Lisa,"uh-oh, i'm losing the crowd!"
51205,Lisa,"but, but--"
52099,Lisa,"quiet, bart. let's make the best of this."
49704,Lisa,more... more...
45903,Lisa,wow...
43047,Lisa,"hey milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! jimbo! jimbo! go for the face! look! ralph wiggum lost his shin guard! hack the bone! hack the bone!"
42140,Lisa,why didn't you go to dad?
51021,Lisa,milhouse?
43910,Lisa,me.
49893,Lisa,you're not going anywhere near annie.
50774,Lisa,"bart, aren't you gonna tell mom and dad about the problem you have?"
52003,Lisa,valhalla is where vikings go when they die.
41727,Lisa,"it's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
42124,Lisa,i could've been the flower girl. and i wouldn't keep falling down either.
52071,Lisa,"come on, bart. the tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito."
43598,Lisa,"...and you'll be bartron, the evil robot from mars, gone berserk."
50039,Lisa,"goodbye, guys. i'll try again when i'm older..."
51649,Lisa,"hm, looks like ancient aramaic. fortunately, i have an app for that."
52076,Lisa,sideshow bob!
51442,Lisa,"well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people."
42829,Lisa,"good luck, dad."
52240,Lisa,"yes, but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling, perhaps forever."
44492,Lisa,it's the tradition in india.
47009,Lisa,"who, alex? the boy that everybody loves?"
46161,Lisa,but you have recruiting ads on tv. why do you need subliminal messages?
44585,Lisa,"that was pretty bad, bart / but it could've been worse / you could have been carrying a sequined purse!"
49167,Lisa,"hey, what are those boxes in the back?"
50809,Lisa,are you crying... glitter?
47446,Lisa,what's going on?
50732,Lisa,"""stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. it was huge! well, the first season and the last season."
48031,Lisa,cooper! thy staves are not flush!
42788,Lisa,"no, that's a trilobite... that's petrified wood... bart, that's a bran"
51404,Lisa,"wait, i know one place in springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
41917,Lisa,"this next song is also about a girl and her pony. it's called ""wildfire."""
50984,Lisa,i don't like this game! nobody likes this game! even the kids on the box look bored!
43655,Lisa,well i can't. you'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
47423,Lisa,"pictographs! bart, this is a native american burial mound."
42022,Lisa,"well, i would like to see what all the fuss is about."
46961,Lisa,"mom, why did you wake me up? i dreamt i was at the kennedy center honors."
46537,Lisa,"we were playing four square, and i called no double taps, and ralph double taps. and i said ""you're out"". and he says ""i can do a sum-ber-salt"" which has nothing to do with anything."
47779,Lisa,great! will you play malibu stacy with me?
45345,Lisa,the future is a...
45232,Lisa,"but dad, lemurs are nocturnal."
51983,Lisa,i feel like smiling.
45596,Lisa,they must have programmed it to eliminate the competition.
42175,Lisa,"our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a dickensian workhouse."
51170,Lisa,ki-ya!
43857,Lisa,grown-up nerds like gore vidal. and even he's kissed more boys than i ever will.
51891,Lisa,good. commence shovelling.
42931,Lisa,aw.
48267,Lisa,mad beast!
41921,Lisa,you're gonna make me give up princess?
47697,Lisa,"i don't want mickey mantle, i want my mom."
50220,Lisa,no! no! no! get off! get off! get off!
47888,Lisa,"mom, why are you so worried about money?"
43608,Lisa,i think i'm having chest pains.
47543,Lisa,why would bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
43141,Lisa,"no, dad, i don't think..."
42664,Lisa,world domination?
43687,Lisa,that's jebediah's secret confession. it proves he was a fraud.
41954,Lisa,"dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her ariel?"
45104,Lisa,test?
47150,Lisa,oh! someone is spying on us!
41811,Lisa,"sorry, sir. it's just that..."
47784,Lisa,a robot?! last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. i don't have a chance now.
44703,Lisa,this is crazy! just because you and dad and bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it?
44479,Lisa,"dad, that was really mean."
50310,Lisa,but it's not real happiness. it's just because of an untested drug!
43069,Lisa,"sorry, dad. we do believe in you. we really do."
41937,Lisa,that looks like an olympic torch to me. your husband could be an olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
50508,Lisa,"it wasn't a pie, it was science! and it's not fair -- my project was way better than bart's, and i didn't have help from a nerd! i'm my own nerd!"
51733,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
50188,Lisa,mom?
51102,Lisa,"splatter, as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand--"
43440,Lisa,"uh, actually, the... we were never baptized."
50363,Lisa,raymondo's greatest secret!
51645,Lisa,"um, i'm not sure this is the best use of my skills."
48450,Lisa,yes!
42911,Lisa,"i'm really sorry about what i did, allison. it's no shame being second to you."
51755,Lisa,knot with a k.
46090,Lisa,"wait, i'm confused. why was a wolf shooting a web?"
44453,Lisa,"dad, that's our house."
48055,Lisa,we've gotta tell dad! where is he?
48532,Lisa,i'd like that. i'd like it a lot.
43444,Lisa,nooooo! it's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
52028,Lisa,"yes, you are."
47519,Lisa,"look maggie, it's a pop up! ""daddy's made a shiv. can you help him ice johnny shakes, the jailhouse stoolie?"""
49831,Lisa,no! you lie! eliza simpson can't be a coward! she's the only decent ancestor i have.
45112,Lisa,"we've got a test, and i didn't read the book. i'll get a zero for sure, bart! what do i do?"
46224,Lisa,but why do the brawny prey on the brainy? is it jealousy?
44112,Lisa,the nanny we want is kindly and sage.
47348,Lisa,dad? are you okay?
43894,Lisa,"for me? wow, my first real friend... ...ship bracelet. i don't have anything for you... ...except this necklace i made."
46453,Lisa,"those are all wonderful things. but they've cost the church its soul. and i, for one, will not be a part of it!"
51471,Lisa,please.
51679,Lisa,probably just another piece of america's space junk falling out of orbit.
51179,Lisa,are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
46508,Lisa,"gabriel, are you okay?"
52391,Lisa,i'll name her princess and i'll ride her every day.
44153,Lisa,"but if there're no deer out there, then what are they hunting?"
50502,Lisa,no.
51112,Lisa,i think our lunches got mixed up.
42128,Lisa,we don't have seatbelts.
49469,Lisa,does your mother know you're using her minivan?
41759,Lisa,"no, no. he's fine."
49336,Lisa,kinda. let's do some groban.
44032,Lisa,"isn't it nice up here? what are you thinking, nelson?"
50584,Lisa,does anybody want my opinion?
46382,Lisa,when are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
45787,Lisa,no!
49375,Lisa,yeah.
42051,Lisa,mmm! could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
44176,Lisa,why hasn't anyone called?
43793,Lisa,waaa! uhh! there's gum in my hair!
46284,Lisa,just come on.
46752,Lisa,"mom, dad, thank god you're okay."
46761,Lisa,wow. look at dad. people really respect him.
42379,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
48360,Lisa,i'm... jake.
47002,Lisa,very well. l-i-t-t-l-e -m-i-s-s...
51421,Lisa,that's someone who eats plants.
45069,Lisa,"step on it, mom. dad's signaling that he wants to go higher."
48787,Lisa,and you're constantly flouting the law.
41802,Lisa,i'm too excited to sleep. anyone up for the winifred beecher howe memorial?
52220,Lisa,mom!
47083,Lisa,"the best part is, next week we'll get to see the deadly meteor shower."
51784,Lisa,"he's taking your homer-isms and turning them into his own great ideas! this is the most inspirational moment of my life, but, unfortunately, this is my stop."
41795,Lisa,mommm!
41735,Lisa,he's no wittier than the next superhero.
50458,Lisa,"jeez, they're dropping like flies."
49914,Lisa,whales are mammals like us! they're sensitive and deeply intelligent!
50535,Lisa,i can't believe dad is missing this!
47946,Lisa,"these new vending machine snacks are crammed with processed sugar, industrial byproducts and trans-fatty acids!"
45348,Lisa,g-52.
42584,Lisa,"eww, dad, this is blood."
43213,Lisa,why?
47753,Lisa,we're trapped!
46414,Lisa,i don't know.
51943,Lisa,just take mine. a simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.
44195,Lisa,certainly.
44798,Lisa,they also have memorial day.
43103,Lisa,fine.
42440,Lisa,so we'll march day and night / by the big cooling tower / they have the plant / but we have the power.
46904,Lisa,"a laser pointer! thanks, bart."
45353,Lisa,shhh. don't wake them.
49063,Lisa,"bart, i'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. in the meantime, just say yes, so lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
48308,Lisa,it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
50653,Lisa,i'm trying to set a mood here.
49138,Lisa,wha... but...
42120,Lisa,ewww.
51466,Lisa,how veiled?
47619,Lisa,"it's not a jail, it's a ""reeducation center."""
52237,Lisa,"bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings."
43168,Lisa,"it's 6:45 a.m. next wednesday. you may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
44796,Lisa,"hmm, thank you, bart, for yet another touching ""bart's people."" now, turning to--"
51887,Lisa,me!
42241,Lisa,from now i will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
47833,Lisa,"why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? we can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
49576,Lisa,i didn't think i'd get a fresh start like this till junior high!
44483,Lisa,"mom, please, we're eating!"
48230,Lisa,don't you ever hope for anything better?
44310,Lisa,what's going on?
51029,Lisa,"free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch. just remember, milhouse, do not buy the condo."
42989,Lisa,"oh, my poor dead kitty! please, not you too!"
44680,Lisa,i bought my lunch at the gas station.
51667,Lisa,it's a terrific sport that--
44480,Lisa,i don't want to make the team.
49035,Lisa,"panic not, fellow springfielders!"
48837,Lisa,"as this month's rotating president of the springfield future scientists club, may i say: i'm sorry. and is there anything we can do to help?"
42718,Lisa,i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of malibu stacy.
42485,Lisa,"i guess nobody likes the truth, huh grampa."
49072,Lisa,there's drama and inspiration everywhere i look.
43661,Lisa,or kill us.
44915,Lisa,it's a bottle cap.
44607,Lisa,"i was wrong about the cooders, dad. they're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home."
50089,Lisa,"really?... they sound like... i mean... well, the thing..."
44929,Lisa,"come on, bart. the bus is here."
42375,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
41592,Lisa,is that robot break-dancing?
49435,Lisa,"right, 'cause i wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king, susan sontag, sappho of lesbos, and, i suspect, peppermint patty..."
44422,Lisa,i am three and three eighths!
52251,Lisa,"mr. murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping springfield gorge on a skateboard."
49333,Lisa,"yes, i would. class, everyone please stop and admire juliet's painting..."
47255,Lisa,"""photo op helping kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""move the brushfire hazard needle..."" um, shouldn't i stay here and work on school policy?"
44787,Lisa,"we'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. and now, bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch."
46345,Lisa,"paul bunyan never fought rodan. and his size seems to be really inconsistent. i mean, one minute he's ten feet tall, the next his feet are as big as a lake..."
51410,Lisa,"well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
52026,Lisa,"bart, i read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. they go through eight separate stages. right now, i'm in stage three, fear. you're in stage two, denial."
45392,Lisa,"chief wiggum! oh, you sure got a lotta copies of the paper."
43176,Lisa,how could you forget? they had signs posted all over the library.
42813,Lisa,doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
48245,Lisa,you're a smash g. k.!
42912,Lisa,only if we're the best.
44162,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd swear bob was building a dam."
45230,Lisa,"hey, why don't you come to the wild animal park with us?"
41706,Lisa,"i'm glad i'm not crying because i would hate for you to think that what i'm about to say is based on emotion. but you, sir, are a baboon!"
47650,Lisa,"they're so beautiful. and their breath smells like peppermint! no! no! i won't take your blood ponies! go on, sweetie. go on. shoo!"
49200,Lisa,"mom, you said all hitchhikers were drug-crazed thrill seekers."
51015,Lisa,dad?!
42078,Lisa,"my god, they are stubby."
50552,Lisa,and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! it's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
43946,Lisa,shouldn't you people be groveling? and bring me some shoes. nice ones!
44052,Lisa,don't worry. nelson and i don't like each other anymore.
49675,Lisa,what else ya got?
47741,Lisa,"oh, that moe. but good for you, mom! why didn't you follow chloe into journalism?"
48813,Lisa,"dad, i think someone's trying to kill you!"
47212,Lisa,it must be tough to win the nobel prize and lose your father on the same day.
49237,Lisa,citywide crossword tournament!
49799,Lisa,the diary of eliza simpson?
52283,Lisa,shaft.
45039,Lisa,but then we're stuck with gorillas!
47025,Lisa,"you have made me feel so wonderful. thank you, springfield!"
44982,Lisa,lucky parameciums.
45491,Lisa,"and there's the cane from ""citizen kane."" wait a minute. there was no cane in ""citizen kane."""
47354,Lisa,not any more.
47544,Lisa,and thanks for showing my brother that girls can be cool.
47596,Lisa,"dad, i think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to."
48940,Lisa,now you two play nice!
42277,Lisa,"bart, that's not funny."
49986,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, would you like to buy some band candy?"
47913,Lisa,i'll bet she's sneaking food from someplace else! let's follow her!
48915,Lisa,maybe you wouldn't be such a bad president.
51198,Lisa,intelligence?
42712,Lisa,i have one.
45004,Lisa,"it was thomas edison, dad."
46858,Lisa,"actually, i saw them earlier and i was working on it in the hall."
44658,Lisa,we should be safe in here.
43813,Lisa,it doesn't work.
45658,Lisa,"ohh, i don't like the looks of this."
45243,Lisa,"oh, this is perfect!"
45159,Lisa,no he doesn't. trains are regulated by the federal department of transportation. and recent studies have shown that...
45796,Lisa,"legalize what? oh, oh. consider it done."
50191,Lisa,"because, it's too elitist. everyone's parents are in ""the business."""
44685,Lisa,maybe i can't concentrate because of all your cooties.
46968,Lisa,you're baby stink-breath! you're baby stink-breath! en francais! vous etes l'enfant stink-breath!
46277,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
52416,Lisa,three: you seem to be of the jewish faith.
47814,Lisa,"dig in, everybody!"
49005,Lisa,wowww... no! all i need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
48251,Lisa,"willie, there are no more lessons. you're a proper gentleman, my work is done."
46635,Lisa,"ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. that's why i called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared."
51804,Lisa,that works.
42752,Lisa,yeah. maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
50532,Lisa,"it's called ""el chemistri"" and they use science to make the food!"
52259,Lisa,there she is!
49171,Lisa,this is evidence.
43442,Lisa,"let's see. dirt... dirt... well, there wasn't really much dirt."
51562,Lisa,"dad, i believe we were on a date."
44370,Lisa,will you stop looking at your feet?!
43731,Lisa,it's one of those campy 70's throwbacks that appeals to generation x'ers.
44653,Lisa,the law has spoken.
47496,Lisa,i'm sorry i ran off. being second to maggie's not so bad. but why didn't maggie press the right button 'til i told her to?
51172,Lisa,"he said he went home, and his passport is gone. what country is he from?"
51220,Lisa,no one can use it but no one gets hurt!
50672,Lisa,"mom, i'm sorry i'm late! no excuse, i just forgot all about you. huh? i'm not sure that patch really represents who i am right now."
43420,Lisa,"cheer up, bart. milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low."
42333,Lisa,but the ride only takes a minute.
51538,Lisa,at least we hope it's bottom.
50476,Lisa,please! i went through my t.r. phase in first grade. now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin.
42939,Lisa,"soon, corey, soon."
48622,Lisa,we were south... west of... north dakota-lahoma.
51715,Lisa,"yeah, you really get that it's all about the music."
41655,Lisa,"i'm sorry, honey."
49473,Lisa,mr. burns! what are you doing here?
45827,Lisa,look at the size of that gator!
46360,Lisa,we have to disable its central processor! c'mon!
45619,Lisa,"wow, what a perfect scene. this was so worth it..."
48553,Lisa,"c'mon dad, read the last chapter! everyone says there's a big surprise -- i bet angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
49244,Lisa,"in my young life i've seen that every time i'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" and another little piece says ""i agree."""
45612,Lisa,let's just agree that the commercialization of christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
46221,Lisa,"third row, near the aisle."
47827,Lisa,this proves bart lied about being kidnapped!
48498,Lisa,"yeah. it was an orson welles radio play of ""war of the worlds."""
45515,Lisa,"bart, just let me drop and save yourself!"
45615,Lisa,she cleaned out the attic!
46362,Lisa,"there must be someone who can use a man around the house, even if he's slightly homicidal."
50396,Lisa,"bart, you can find them by smell! that's amazing! restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
51160,Lisa,ki-ya karate monsters!
44770,Lisa,...and i'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. plus i get to be on tv!
48624,Lisa,i'll be good.
48185,Lisa,"hey, she says the mayor speaks english."
47477,Lisa,people who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality.
47733,Lisa,technically he was born in shelbyville.
52080,Lisa,"awww, dad."
47349,Lisa,"it's saturday, december sixth."
45764,Lisa,"bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy."
51936,Lisa,why don't you go see grampa?
44564,Lisa,"hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks? that'll make us feel better."
51532,Lisa,i'm sorry you weren't my first choice. in fact... i had my doubts about using you at all.
52141,Lisa,wait a minute!
48477,Lisa,do you have an idea?
43051,Lisa,"bart, just get out of here."
50737,Lisa,"well bart, i guess that's our cue to skedaddle..."
45361,Lisa,"bart, are you crazy? you've got to get the old folks home to the old folks home."
47379,Lisa,"dad, what are all those cuts?"
47639,Lisa,"all right, nelson. what kind of journalism skills do you have?"
43450,Lisa,i think we should do a test.
51278,Lisa,"and some of the angles are loooooow. but don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions."
49486,Lisa,"no, no, no -- the solution was ""regally the rock gem is lisa""."
47508,Lisa,bart and i will explore the attic until we find their source.
45727,Lisa,"mom, dad's on pbs!"
46936,Lisa,"dad, are you in here?"
42066,Lisa,you stink strawberry. we want home-run homer!
52263,Lisa,and janey and i went bird watching. we saw a grackle.
42771,Lisa,mom! dad! bart and stampy are gone!
48146,Lisa,"ah, mortadella!"
45783,Lisa,we don't own the shores of tripoli.
42994,Lisa,"you don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
43824,Lisa,"no, not what he said -- what he is. grandfather. as in ""grandfather clause"". apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
51997,Lisa,"should maggie be going with them, mom?"
51139,Lisa,"hey, i have a weakness for pomp!"
43847,Lisa,the reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: retrospecticus.
48806,Lisa,look at the crowd around that table.
49178,Lisa,bart! there's something i need to tell you! mom and dad have been--
47518,Lisa,"he tried once, but he got confused and thought the book was real. he's still looking for that chocolate factory. it consumes him."
43674,Lisa,what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? look.
51868,Lisa,i don't know what else to do.
49805,Lisa,that's all there is -- the rest of the diary has turned to dust!
44641,Lisa,"no one, but if we're gonna survive, we need rules and order. let's not forget what we learned in the u.n. club."
49924,Lisa,"""the world below the brine / forests at the bottom of the sea / the branches and leaves... / sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."
44039,Lisa,he's not like you anymore! he's changed! and he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums!
46616,Lisa,i would gladly kneel -- were you the real king!
43603,Lisa,thanks.
47580,Lisa,"my theme is ""if music be the food of love."" the setting features tuning forks, champagne flutes and of course, chopsticks. and for dessert, ella fitz jell-o."
42237,Lisa,i'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes?
48458,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna lose it! bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""blowin'"" and ""the sugar sheet""."
51811,Lisa,"well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it."
51822,Lisa,"wow, dad! thank you!"
48868,Lisa,"dad, are you okay? i see food on your plate instead of blurring motions."
49712,Lisa,"never, huh? what are you gonna eat?"
47239,Lisa,i rest my case.
42960,Lisa,"don't do it, bart."
41840,Lisa,"dad, i think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and larry king."
43333,Lisa,"thank you. oh dad, why did he have to die?"
44828,Lisa,that's awful! i almost wish it were drugs.
44936,Lisa,"oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
42556,Lisa,no.
51447,Lisa,i say engineered po-tay-to / you say engineered po-tah-to... potato!
47681,Lisa,"if you win, ovenfresh industries will make you the new face of auntie ovenfresh."
44137,Lisa,"um, excuse me, sir. the thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. but after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
41637,Lisa,"well, well, well. look who's come crawlin' back."
49267,Lisa,and a new record time! wait a second...
42406,Lisa,"oh, george..."
50160,Lisa,"are you a distraction, or a higher calling? all right, let's see. how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives? there's, um..."
50038,Lisa,mom! take me home!
49802,Lisa,"""...because tomorrow, i shall get my very first slave."""
47048,Lisa,"okay, paperclip, do your stuff."
43525,Lisa,"bart, you're in trouble! wake up!"
42464,Lisa,this is a rather lifeless outing.
43836,Lisa,"generation x may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
46712,Lisa,you guys are college students!
51886,Lisa,"no, me!"
45245,Lisa,it encapsulates america and makes history come alive!
50870,Lisa,achem!
42138,Lisa,you've gained thirteen pounds.
45509,Lisa,bart!
46672,Lisa,a lot of people think our dad's behavior has screwed us up. and it has!
49800,Lisa,"this entry's dated april 14th, 1860."
42072,Lisa,homemaker?!
49413,Lisa,i waaarned you.
46772,Lisa,"""i dream of a world without guns."" don't we all, william."
50941,Lisa,"dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!"
45629,Lisa,don't tell me mom dresses you.
45561,Lisa,what a neat idea!
48601,Lisa,i see. while it would be an honor to be your queen...
50276,Lisa,i've been doing the family's books for years. i take what i need.
50790,Lisa,"what is the point? i think this is the end of me. all i had was my integrity. and now that's gone. i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. i try not to cry till you're asleep."
49093,Lisa,"dad, no!"
43771,Lisa,"who do you love most: me, bart, or maggie?"
48300,Lisa,this is an abc sweatshirt.
51731,Lisa,are we there yet?
48711,Lisa,all this fuss for a baseball game? why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
49685,Lisa,don't dip those wiccans!
52013,Lisa,happy birthday!
45780,Lisa,why you little...
41855,Lisa,"no, dad, that's hebrew. krusty must be jewish."
45826,Lisa,"oh, no! we came during spring break!"
49040,Lisa,southern-fried succubus?
44442,Lisa,"there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
42640,Lisa,"mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and i don't know which state to go as."
45029,Lisa,"no, no. i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse."
52494,Lisa,the old milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack.
42981,Lisa,"okay, aaron a. aaronson voted for... bob. aaron l. aaronson voted for... bob. arthur b. ablabab voted for... bob."
46736,Lisa,can i come with you?
49497,Lisa,"sorry we missed your special day, grampa. we'll definitely go next year."
52312,Lisa,i see.
51078,Lisa,she hates me because i'm pretty!
42892,Lisa,i prefer my phrasing.
48316,Lisa,"i was always cheering for you, grampa. till now."
47449,Lisa,they just painted the tower brown.
49575,Lisa,did you just wink at me?
43045,Lisa,"lay off, guys. he's with me."
48246,Lisa,"that's where you're wrong, principal skinner. i did enter a project... and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!"
49820,Lisa,please don't make those recipes.
52005,Lisa,it's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
49416,Lisa,"several?! that's more than ""a few"" and almost ""a bunch!"""
47412,Lisa,"oh bart, i'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend."
51802,Lisa,we did it! we wrote an awesome song!
49549,Lisa,"dad, i don't want to hurt people's feelings."
50594,Lisa,hurry! we're heading for the falls!
45849,Lisa,sorry. the floor's kind of at an angle here. i'm gonna move over there.
48216,Lisa,"grampa, stop."
48841,Lisa,they were in yesterday's new york times!
46758,Lisa,"dad, that's bart."
41768,Lisa,"bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before i join them i have one question: today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and i'm afraid to ask."
49772,Lisa,yay!
41736,Lisa,i stand corrected.
52440,Lisa,"i believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your semitic good looks."
49011,Lisa,my feminist heroes!
50479,Lisa,"that's a lot of anger, grampa."
44932,Lisa,you'll want a locker in this hallway -- it's library-adjacent.
47049,Lisa,now we just need a distraction.
46241,Lisa,africa looks like a beautiful jewel.
51208,Lisa,how much did you hear?
42863,Lisa,i never made miss hoover yow-wee.
49396,Lisa,homer simpson.
43471,Lisa,why does it talk like a lamb?
47203,Lisa,well where is he now? maybe i can help you two patch up your differences.
46044,Lisa,"well, there's lots of needy kids out there..."
42594,Lisa,"the only way to get bart back is to kill the head vampire, mr. burns."
50858,Lisa,"dad, that's creepy."
48367,Lisa,did you know lisa simpson? i heard she was pretty cool.
44106,Lisa,we have our own suggestions for the new nanny. would you like to hear them?
44143,Lisa,we should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.
46074,Lisa,is that a long island iced tea?
43914,Lisa,momdadwesawsomethingintheatticand --
49481,Lisa,does kissing milhouse count?
46037,Lisa,"so, this is your mysterious new job for mr. burns?"
49861,Lisa,this isn't a dream. i really did fail.
47711,Lisa,what?! i'm not fat enough already? how could you say that to me?
48225,Lisa,we've only brought in five dollars. and that came from mr. flanders buying back his own stuff.
42087,Lisa,"okay, but if you really want to honk skinner off, i suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in."
41609,Lisa,"simone de beauvoir, margaret mead, queen elizabeth the first, lauren bacall..."
42109,Lisa,have you found a picture yet?
44553,Lisa,that's not true. you're thinking of airbags.
49324,Lisa,"wow, this must be important, dad! i've never seen you walk up an incline before."
50381,Lisa,you're just gonna stand there?
48381,Lisa,uh... uh...
45935,Lisa,"father, i knew you'd rescue us!"
51586,Lisa,"oh god, i'm gonna be sick!"
41765,Lisa,"meditations on turning eight, by lisa simpson. i had a cat named snowball -- she died, she died! mom said she was sleeping -- she lied, she lied! why oh why is my cat dead? couldn't that chrysler hit me, instead? i had a hamster named snuffy -- he died, --"
43756,Lisa,"houston, we have a problem. homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
48015,Lisa,"dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. yet. a hundred years, global warming... we're goners. but for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
50683,Lisa,"if we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset."
49758,Lisa,you use the wand like a tennis racket to hit an invisible ball.
46607,Lisa,...and please bless mama and papa and bartrand and coco chanel...
48651,Lisa,"dad, those kids aren't dumb. this show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!"
47600,Lisa,"mom, why are you so mad?"
47159,Lisa,"yeah, don't listen to him mr. duff the seventh. we took this dog in and loved him, and that makes him ours."
46535,Lisa,you wanna know what happened?
43707,Lisa,the missing piece of the puzzle... i've got it!
45707,Lisa,"i'm writing a letter to president clinton about that travesty of a band contest. as a fellow sax player, i'm sure he'll be outraged."
43888,Lisa,"don't be afraid, little friend. you'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
45530,Lisa,where are we gonna live?
51872,Lisa,"all right, dad!"
48528,Lisa,moe marginalized my contributions...
43533,Lisa,no.
48680,Lisa,it's eleven at night and i can't get to sleep!
51975,Lisa,i feel more popular already.
45236,Lisa,"well, this could be quite enlighten--"
47472,Lisa,"okay. but first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess ironica, uh... who lives in this rock."
43456,Lisa,not in any of the ones you know about.
42190,Lisa,wow! my mother the actress. i feel like lucie arnaz-luckinbill.
50945,Lisa,whoa.
46600,Lisa,"mom, you're hurting me."
52445,Lisa,he ruined the one chance i had of getting to know mr. bergstrom outside of school.
45577,Lisa,"uh, just a few venn diagrams."
42099,Lisa,"oh, bart."
46409,Lisa,i love chinatown... although i wish they'd stop picking on tibet town.
45011,Lisa,"dad, women won't like being shot in the face."
50828,Lisa,a peloton?
50624,Lisa,"well, it all started a couple of months ago..."
47252,Lisa,we need to get teachers more involved! have them meet with struggling kids in the morning before school.
48443,Lisa,you guys need a break. why don't i take bart with me to the children's be-bop brunch at jazzy goodtime's?
52177,Lisa,"and i'm studying for the math fair. if i win, i'll bring home a brand new protractor."
51390,Lisa,fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury?
44034,Lisa,what do you feel? what's inside you right now?
51851,Lisa,they never let poor rudolph / join in any reindeer games...
51453,Lisa,i like the impressionists.
46767,Lisa,yay!
43316,Lisa,ew. how'd you get a name like that?
45078,Lisa,uh-oh. i don't like the sound of that.
50068,Lisa,"there, you see?"
46313,Lisa,"...as the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery."
49260,Lisa,lisa bouvier!
51048,Lisa,please-be-her! please-be-her!
50199,Lisa,"people of springfield, as a nerd, i understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
42199,Lisa,"no, no, that's too much."
44168,Lisa,"it's hopeless. utterly, utterly hopeless."
42162,Lisa,"so, bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty?"
42774,Lisa,"dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
42131,Lisa,how?
48846,Lisa,i fed your fish.
48121,Lisa,you mean this?
49048,Lisa,"bart, are you all right?"
50839,Lisa,"well, at least i'll be able to say i went to a broadway show."
44575,Lisa,"um, miss hoover! miss hoover!"
49346,Lisa,juliet's father is the world's foremost john grisham scholar.
45807,Lisa,that picture's a cliché .
47852,Lisa,whatever!
45452,Lisa,i think we all had that idea.
43981,Lisa,"oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. and i think i know what it is..."
50980,Lisa,"you're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!"
48081,Lisa,i've changed my mind! can you please open the gate?
51897,Lisa,you're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?
47857,Lisa,"hey, this really works."
48172,Lisa,"but luigi, surely you speak italian."
48961,Lisa,what?!
47381,Lisa,"wait, you don't want me to have this cat!"
50600,Lisa,"well, you're not exactly my hero. i see you more as a cautionary tale."
49330,Lisa,do we have any more paints? my orange isn't the orange of that orange.
50722,Lisa,we never do my thing!
41813,Lisa,the truth must be told.
50040,Lisa,"thanks, guys!"
45711,Lisa,"ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
49293,Lisa,would i ever!
46160,Lisa,how could you soil the good name of star blitzzz promotions?
42977,Lisa,i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.

51387,Lisa,nothing is easy to wrap. i have trouble with scissors!
43604,Lisa,"then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to w and s. waylon smithers."
42007,Lisa,"dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. and with your blessing, i'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago."
47245,Lisa,to fight for kid-power / i must be heard not seen / i have to lead wisely / not just primp and preen!
48093,Lisa,i think i'll be okay by myself.
42000,Lisa,"hey, the new sign is really working."
44671,Lisa,he said there's no shame in their forbidden love.
52051,Lisa,your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. may i be excused?
46780,Lisa,if only poor william bonney were here to see his dream come true.
51938,Lisa,"yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?"
50140,Lisa,i know just how you feel!
48689,Lisa,"i fell in love with the game when i saw ""bend it like beckham."""
49642,Lisa,"what if i gave you homework help? i won't give you the answers, but i'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
45014,Lisa,homer! / dad! / look out!
47749,Lisa,bart! thanks for helping me make up my mind.
46434,Lisa,we're investigating a possible murder case.
49412,Lisa,"dad, bart's throwing away his future!"
49746,Lisa,i am her / she is me / i'm just like / penelope...
45745,Lisa,excuse me. we just came to get our balloon.
50960,Lisa,what just happened? who's bongo?
49963,Lisa,that's a rather unambitious book.
46574,Lisa,"i said ""let's go""."
51702,Lisa,hello? hello? is everything okay?
43840,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
42585,Lisa,whoops. bart and i have to go wash up.
48503,Lisa,"mom, we've got to stop them from pacifying our town!"
42919,Lisa,it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine's day...
43939,Lisa,you think i'm god?
42802,Lisa,i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
51737,Lisa,"dad, i don't know about this. it's not on the park map."
45556,Lisa,"i became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited."
42301,Lisa,i wish we lived in the kitty house.
48544,Lisa,"so, how was nelson's party?"
44148,Lisa,hi-c! and fluffernutters!
49560,Lisa,"mom, that's brilliant! we could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! and where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers."
48304,Lisa,fox flew me out here to bring you back. they flew me on frito lay's air force yum!
42696,Lisa,"i'm sorry, apu. but remember, who needs a kwik-e-mart--"
48232,Lisa,adequate... adequate...
48819,Lisa,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
50635,Lisa,i'd have more friends if i knew what people liked. but i won't know what people like unless i'm their friend. it's a conundrum.
48619,Lisa,"yes, we're among the lostest."
41824,Lisa,"hey, quit it, bart. quit it! hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! m-o-o-o-m!"
44407,Lisa,"and he survived to make it back to springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
52153,Lisa,"not yet, sir."
48947,Lisa,bart! you can't just run away from this!
49891,Lisa,"well, i will never forgive you, bart."
43214,Lisa,pertaining to a process involving a randomly determined sequence of observations.
50497,Lisa,"""you are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. for further communication i will require more beans. i love you, baby."""
41968,Lisa,"bart simpson! the thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. when they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
50176,Lisa,"mom, dad! please, can i go here? i'll study so hard i'll make the old me look like bart."
45282,Lisa,"they're not all crazy, dad."
46900,Lisa,i love happy endings.
43811,Lisa,"that's specious reasoning, dad."
48427,Lisa,"otto, help me!"
44281,Lisa,i could still use more paper.
49223,Lisa,"i've got it! ""isaac bashevis!"""
46579,Lisa,why are you driving a car?
44448,Lisa,hey! it worked!
47675,Lisa,science officer!
45722,Lisa,bite me.
49016,Lisa,i need firsthand smoke!
42582,Lisa,"ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
43919,Lisa,this tooth will be perfect for my science project.
48372,Lisa,"you just want somebody to say ""i love you"". i love you."
41660,Lisa,"oh my god, my social studies project is due tomorrow morning!"
48722,Lisa,i think maybe we cou-ould.
49604,Lisa,looks like maggie wants a story too.
52343,Lisa,pony ride!
51644,Lisa,"no, no. you want to make american kids work?"
49745,Lisa,princess penelope! sign mine! sign mine!
44562,Lisa,dad...
49525,Lisa,it just gets worse and worse.
44140,Lisa,"no, it's not your fault, dad. you did fine. it's just that poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. you can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
52493,Lisa,too much sodium.
41716,Lisa,that music always sends a chill down my spine.
45252,Lisa,how can they put a prop from a tv show next to the bill of rights?
47221,Lisa,i object!
49569,Lisa,"but i always get a's. at my old school, i got so many a's, the teachers didn't even check my work."
51197,Lisa,"chief, is there really a terrorist threat to springfield?"
50344,Lisa,"i've been-- hey, how ya doin'?"
46204,Lisa,it's hard to miss the cameras.
47470,Lisa,"okay, okay, don't get discouraged. every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like."
48178,Lisa,idioto! idioto! idioto!
43666,Lisa,"hi, i'm lisa simpson. i'm here to research a report on jebediah."
41819,Lisa,bart!
47524,Lisa,that character is just a tired stereotype.
47180,Lisa,i don't think dad is accurately portraying native american life.
47428,Lisa,"um... some other time, maybe. today i'm just hanging out at home."
52094,Lisa,"one eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal..."
50912,Lisa,it's not the vegetarianism!
50606,Lisa,i need my books!
47649,Lisa,"she's very pretty, but the answer is still no."
50888,Lisa,"new low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... i'm just gonna log right out."
45150,Lisa,i can't imagine dad running away like this. leaving his father to die.
46972,Lisa,do you even know what a loft is?
46463,Lisa,lenny and carl?
42748,Lisa,"dad and ned flanders friends? what's next... ""a's"" on bart's report card?"
45266,Lisa,"bart, stop it."
50971,Lisa,what happened with the e.m.p.?
44534,Lisa,"i just think it's a fantasy. if you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
42563,Lisa,plug it in! plug it in!
51939,Lisa,eww! knock it off!
43195,Lisa,how did you know my name?
51180,Lisa,"aww, dad, i just got a little twinge in my heart."
44488,Lisa,what's the deal with that dot?
43568,Lisa,"all right, then we'll call your husband: grampa."
46239,Lisa,"""find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to africa."""
43906,Lisa,"oh. thanks, bart."

45734,Lisa,trophies! trophies! attendance!
45962,Lisa,"well, the book festival starts today..."
52021,Lisa,"don't be scared, dad. it's not so hard taking care of us."
45914,Lisa,"hey, what's goin' on?"
43232,Lisa,"hey, i remember you. mayor quimby, right?"
43125,Lisa,"good aim, dad."
51010,Lisa,"well, the obvious question is... why did i turn out so... academically superior... while bart--"
48620,Lisa,centered. centered. you know where the four states come together?
47445,Lisa,i think i'm gonna use this card right now.

46876,Lisa,what's so good about it?
45508,Lisa,i don't think the real radioactive man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
46440,Lisa,that's just a dog in a space suit.
46708,Lisa,"you're reading ""gravity's rainbow?"""
43690,Lisa,"i'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
44207,Lisa,i'll answer it. you go to bed!
50294,Lisa,"the creative team from mixar! pardon me. i've seen all of your movies except ""cars,"" and i can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital rembrandts of my generation!"
43699,Lisa,"don't forget to look in his shoes. when i lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes."
49589,Lisa,mom! dad! i have to leave waverly hills and never come back!
42044,Lisa,bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. find anything good?
49637,Lisa,you're a monster!
50084,Lisa,"c'mon, maggie. i need to get good at fencing so i can put it on my resume and get into yale. don't be scared. i won't hurt my widdle sister."
43723,Lisa,are you sure he's dead? maybe you just really really hurt him.
52135,Lisa,fried shrimp.
44316,Lisa,"oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! i was a fool to help that horrible old man!"

43246,Lisa,hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
42875,Lisa,"well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? make a few calls on my behalf? maybe you could've been ""nicer"" to principal skinner, if you know what i mean."
45875,Lisa,you mean i danced all by myself?
43887,Lisa,"that's a hermit crab. when she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
48478,Lisa,"oh, bart, thank you so, so much!"
47685,Lisa,come on mom! you still have twenty minutes left -- you can fix it!
49270,Lisa,new york times crossword editor will shortz!
44022,Lisa,i wish i could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.
48982,Lisa,"no, not cool! we have to do the right thing, and come clean! listen, world! we killed martin prince!"
43174,Lisa,i'm impressed that you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
50201,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns is here for you again."
51075,Lisa,i've got to know before you leave! why don't you like me?
48094,Lisa,"bye, guys. you really helped me a lot."
43662,Lisa,"yeah, krusty doesn't want to be a clown. he's happy just being another blue-collar bozo."
49785,Lisa,"it's not that easy, bart. i... traded away my pearls! without them, i'm just a big maggie!"
43928,Lisa,my god. i've created life!
47011,Lisa,free college?
51374,Lisa,"mr. flanders, where's your store?"
49983,Lisa,"oh, bart. i am so glad everything's okay."
43432,Lisa,"i thought i could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
46975,Lisa,"aw, that's so sweet."
49966,Lisa,"dressing in uniforms is a good thing -- if everyone looks the same, it levels the playing field."
48963,Lisa,exactly.
44661,Lisa,"uh, that's right. the u.n. doesn't look too kindly on..."
48641,Lisa,my name's lisa. what are your names?
43538,Lisa,have you told mom about this?
46132,Lisa,goodbye.
45846,Lisa,"well, i think world war ii helped a little, mom."
41729,Lisa,how's your marriage?
51785,Lisa,bye!
45809,Lisa,is that rainier wolfcastle?
46911,Lisa,"dad! that information is all wrong! maggie's a baby, not my best friend! you don't know anything about me!"
45963,Lisa,"ms. tan, i loved ""the joy luck club"". it really showed me how the mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity."
44807,Lisa,they gave you a chopper?!
43161,Lisa,"see, the southern hemisphere is made up of everything below the equa... this line."
48611,Lisa,"...and so my proud people were nearly destroyed by the warfare, disease, and greed of the invading europeans."
50792,Lisa,it's not a frown. it is a straight line of resignation. looks just the same upside down.
48822,Lisa,"click that one, mom. / no, go up! / keep going, up, up, up! / the blue ones are ads! / that's the toolbar! / now you've opened ""word!"" close it. / close it, don't save it! / stop clicking! / don't go there! / why are you buying a freezer?!"
44191,Lisa,it'll be dark.
48724,Lisa,maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
43948,Lisa,yeah. did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking each other down? i've never been to a place like that before.
52207,Lisa,"bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, i'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. but here goes. i believe in you."
46137,Lisa,how would you know? your backhand looks like a rusty gate.
46314,Lisa,it's lucky for me that legs was an experienced mob doctor.
49201,Lisa,they're worse than wal-king!
41673,Lisa,but then... you wound up like you.
50301,Lisa,"these flowers saved me from a terrible fate -- not getting an ""a"" on my next science project!"
45637,Lisa,"okay, guys, dinner's ready..."
45083,Lisa,much better.
50895,Lisa,yeah! fifty dollars up! time to play with house money!
51843,Lisa,"what, aunt patty?"
47818,Lisa,just what we need. another lame suburban kid who loves rap.
45985,Lisa,my name's lisa simpson. i think your protest was incredibly brave.
51917,Lisa,"here, otto, i made an extra one for you."
47785,Lisa,"well, we're supposed to do this without parental help."
49830,Lisa,what are you talking about?
50337,Lisa,"ooh, authentic american folk music, just like they play on n.p.r.!"
41916,Lisa,"oh look. you haven't touched your salt lick. num num, good salt lick."
48772,Lisa,"dad, that's a bomb!"
49598,Lisa,...lenny!
42497,Lisa,yeah.
44737,Lisa,"so, please, i beg you, don't take your brain for granted. it's the best friend you'll ever have..."
44067,Lisa,the hurricane's over.
45939,Lisa,"oh, you want to be with your friends."
42783,Lisa,"hey mom, bart's throwing peas."
48652,Lisa,"krusty, the spuckler kids missed their reading class today."
45801,Lisa,"did gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
41905,Lisa,i'm done.
45735,Lisa,"oooh, there's ulysses s. grant, babe ruth ben franklin..."
42535,Lisa,"bart, look! it's dad!"
50585,Lisa,proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as i cuddle up with madame bunny.
51789,Lisa,"mr. musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?"
48212,Lisa,"well, what choice do you have?"
49775,Lisa,i must have him!
52513,Lisa,she told me to relax and bake cookies!
49191,Lisa,my family's here!
52485,Lisa,argh.
43578,Lisa,can i fly it?
48414,Lisa,"i'm so glad you could all come. i'll be reading to you from ""the origin of species"" by charles darwin."
43251,Lisa,"hey, dad. did you forget to give those cufflinks to hugh?"
41835,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
45877,Lisa,you think so?
50439,Lisa,could this key open...
48020,Lisa,"dad, we've been so worried about you!"
42097,Lisa,i know. i know.
44416,Lisa,"dad, you don't understand. this saxophone is like my oldest friend. i've had it for as long as i can remember."
46033,Lisa,"thank you, dad."
49548,Lisa,"hmm, well, they are good ones."
51207,Lisa,"i haven't heard anything about you, except from you."
41608,Lisa,losers? you mean losers like...
44816,Lisa,i can't believe they cancelled us for this stupid...
48103,Lisa,"bart, i think you're behind this whole thing."
46365,Lisa,hocus-croakus!
52353,Lisa,"if bart stays home, i'm going to school."
48279,Lisa,i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me!
50402,Lisa,as big as a baby's head.
49004,Lisa,"cigarettes?! they could kill you. they did a whole episode about it on ""the suite life of zach and cody""! zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. but she went for cody instead! zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
48697,Lisa,"um, uh..."
50923,Lisa,you did that to help me out!
50871,Lisa,me neither.
44510,Lisa,it looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
47144,Lisa,"listen, luke. it's my fault clara got lost. i didn't know she was your sister, and i wanted you all to myself."
47074,Lisa,"okay, jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
51665,Lisa,maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.
43586,Lisa,"huh? hurry up, mom and dad are probably worried sick."
50046,Lisa,got it!
50710,Lisa,"but at the kwik-e-mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register."
45346,Lisa,got me? what are you talking about? i've been volunteering here for a year.
50765,Lisa,dad?
49282,Lisa,i'm a mapple person!
50709,Lisa,these'll go great with betel nut butter!
44572,Lisa,why you little...
44071,Lisa,"i saw it, bart."
42851,Lisa,"shut up, brain! i got friends now. i don't need you anymore. duh, yeah, i'd love to go to your house."
44166,Lisa,you cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! that's what happened.
44230,Lisa,bart?
43205,Lisa,"hey, watch it! / watch it!"
51862,Lisa,"hey, lookin' good, bart."
46114,Lisa,it's so passionate. it almost leaps off the wall.
42340,Lisa,"aunt selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
42772,Lisa,"i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, dad."
44320,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad."
44959,Lisa,"oh, then, at the risk of being unpopular, i think i'm gonna have to say..."
50666,Lisa,"yep, you're the crack head. what dessert are you gonna get?"
43572,Lisa,"you know, gramma, i used to think maybe i was adopted. i couldn't understand how i fit into this family. now that i met you, i suddenly make a lot of sense."
47987,Lisa,i don't like sausage.
42866,Lisa,"no. i just like to smell my lunch... gee, i never met anyone who skipped a grade before."
43130,Lisa,i hope it's a girl.
47907,Lisa,oh! the famous shelbyville theater district! can we see a play?
43162,Lisa,"uh-huh. in fact, in rand-mcnally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people."
48113,Lisa,dad! dad! wake up! you're not a robot!
45343,Lisa,you papier mache'd my cat?!
50662,Lisa,"yeah, yeah, okay, second closest."
45899,Lisa,it was amazing how fast dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.
50158,Lisa,no! that's not gonna happen to me! i'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!
42954,Lisa,"mom, that's veal."
45142,Lisa,"and the tumbleweeds tumble at 2, 4 and 6! plus a midnight tumbling on weekends."
42660,Lisa,"what, this jug?"
43321,Lisa,it must be awful to be all alone in the world.
42315,Lisa,"huh, okay."
50061,Lisa,isn't that a christmas tie?
43042,Lisa,"please, dad, i'll be fine."
44730,Lisa,"uh, i am! i'm strongly opposed to... proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
45265,Lisa,"ugh, this is not gonna work."
46570,Lisa,"maggie, what do you think?"
46880,Lisa,i guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
45355,Lisa,"the elderly aren't like you or me, bart. they thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
45194,Lisa,"um, dad..."
50820,Lisa,"i love npr, and jazz guitar..."
48955,Lisa,that's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
49030,Lisa,"the money helps us serve the community! we plant trees, pick up litter, cut up milk bones for old dogs..."
49184,Lisa,"ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. you've been flying south, because you're migrating to... machu picchu, peru!"
47731,Lisa,"abc, cbs... uh-oh, the christian science monitor has a flat tire!"
43714,Lisa,"people of springfield, i, uh, i don't know quite how to say this..."
42520,Lisa,that's the same time as krusty the klown!
52158,Lisa,"hmmm. well as long as i'm asking something, can i ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?"
50414,Lisa,"okay. first of all, it's never wise to use the word ""spew"" in a love song."
42446,Lisa,now who's laughing? now who's laughing?
44769,Lisa,me?
48416,Lisa,there are so many worse crimes. why are you persecuting me?
47285,Lisa,okay.
47286,Lisa,"no, it doesn't."
52100,Lisa,"maggie, maggie."
43099,Lisa,"uh, neat... anyway, mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
49366,Lisa,i can't see juliet anymore?! i thought you wanted me to have a best friend.
46473,Lisa,i'm a buddhist.
46140,Lisa,me neither. i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
52336,Lisa,"no, sir. i can assure you i am not."
50379,Lisa,raymondo! you forgive me!
51543,Lisa,"actually, i think it--"
45071,Lisa,i washed the dog today.
45482,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry the editor didn't like your review."
47006,Lisa,"some of us still enjoy scripted comedy, sir."
47452,Lisa,ice?
45118,Lisa,"actually, there are four plusses."
45067,Lisa,"dad, you really should be watching the road."
51231,Lisa,"a gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. it doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. so if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
52504,Lisa,"thanks, but milhouse and i are in a pretty good place."
50644,Lisa,hit refresh.
46116,Lisa,let's have a breakfast meeting.
48084,Lisa,"bye, dr. nick."
51740,Lisa,are we there yet?
41586,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, you want to buy some band candy?"
50817,Lisa,a mockingbird without a song...
44887,Lisa,i guess...
48549,Lisa,"oh dad, i'm tired. we'll read more tomorrow."
47097,Lisa,concert in golden gate park.
47933,Lisa,he was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week. that's not gonna happen!
43145,Lisa,we have a bomb shelter?
42431,Lisa,"please, mother. it's purely in the interest of science."
50468,Lisa,skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
41760,Lisa,"bart, my birthday is in two days. i'm gonna be eight years old. it's a big number -- almost double digits."
49739,Lisa,what about bart?
42080,Lisa,what's so good about it....
45393,Lisa,doesn't anybody in this town read?
50797,Lisa,this is where i live.
46527,Lisa,is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
48218,Lisa,so... what setting is that fan on?
41780,Lisa,"what would ben franklin say if he were alive today? he'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
45751,Lisa,"yes. yes you were. now, in conclusion, my administration will focus on the three r's: reading, 'riting and refilling the ocean. thank you very much."
45005,Lisa,"that, too. he also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car."
48916,Lisa,i like the sound of that.
52406,Lisa,mom...
48710,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't wanna play?"
45690,Lisa,but housesitting is a sacred...
49827,Lisa,"computers, right? our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named eliza simpson."
44992,Lisa,"oh, i don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
51420,Lisa,"no bart, no. do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog."
46521,Lisa,only on mars.
46954,Lisa,"dad, are you hurt?"
45562,Lisa,"""allen ginsburgers, un-american cheese sandwich, polio dogs..."""
48877,Lisa,we're going to a rest'rant grand op'ning / we're going to a rest'rant grand op'ning...
42950,Lisa,"okay, bye-bye / bye / bye, grampa."
46771,Lisa,"""william h. bonney."" ""gunned down july 14, 1881. aged twenty-one."" so young."
49322,Lisa,i'm going home. give me the keys to my bike lock.
43459,Lisa,awwww.
47875,Lisa,"what about your pet iguana, jub-jub?"
51692,Lisa,"let me take care of that. if there's one thing i know how to do, it's manipulate barts."
44954,Lisa,but i don't think i'm ready for pierced ears.
51326,Lisa,ew. how long has it been since you washed your stomach?
49869,Lisa,and now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
46702,Lisa,"well, i can't argue with the man who wrote ""profiles in courage."""
50691,Lisa,"thanks. but i couldn't have done it, mom. i mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life."
47824,Lisa,"so you see principal skinner, that's why i had to come to you."
49209,Lisa,"my god, bart, what happened to us?"
45089,Lisa,"all right, i guess you're supposed to go through this stupid door..."
42159,Lisa,how could this have happened? i feel so dirty. uh.. uh...uh. the dirt's not coming off. okay. calm down. this must just be a little typo.
42397,Lisa,aw.
51793,Lisa,"i still believe in this town... a town that deserves its own original song! and as an aspiring musician with off-broadway dreams, i'm the one to write it!"
46295,Lisa,you know about i.m. pei? i.m. impressed.
47825,Lisa,"it doesn't matter. the point is, only with your help can i expose bart's lies."
44196,Lisa,"uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
51854,Lisa,"yeah, mom, hurry up."
45063,Lisa,and now he's dead.
51674,Lisa,how could you sell fracking for mr. burns?
51772,Lisa,"look, dad had to get cured some time. there's nothing we can do about it."
42239,Lisa,stop this float!
44783,Lisa,"zork? what is ""zork""?"
47939,Lisa,dad!
43313,Lisa,"i'm glad you're okay, bart."
48092,Lisa,my dad says they're too expensive.
50297,Lisa,"""while beautiful, the desert also harbors hidden dangers: cacti, poisonous snakes, and most deadly of all--"
43634,Lisa,you know how a horse goes like this? mom? like this? mom?
41703,Lisa,mr. bergstrom left today.
44524,Lisa,excuse me. i took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. soon we will have all the facts.
46731,Lisa,sixteen.
49255,Lisa,what's goin' on?
44041,Lisa,that's so unfair!
47851,Lisa,help! i'm sinking in the lake!
43985,Lisa,"mom, calm down. the party's not for another three hours."
47478,Lisa,"fine, i'll help you with your stupid flash cards."
50465,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
49277,Lisa,"mom, dad! our mall got a mapple store!"
48387,Lisa,that's a lie!
47106,Lisa,"""nancy drew let out a low whistle. 'this isn't an old windmill at all. it's a new windmill!'"" no dad, i'm sure she won't be killed."
49302,Lisa,bees.
52431,Lisa,fine.
44387,Lisa,"""dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan..."""
46438,Lisa,yes.
42724,Lisa,change what she says. it's your company.
43347,Lisa,you didn't know him! nobody knew him! but he was a great man! and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy!
48326,Lisa,what about this swordfish?
43547,Lisa,"well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. the longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
48664,Lisa,what's the password?
44768,Lisa,i know. i already jumped to that conclusion.
43641,Lisa,"so with tax, how much was it?"
48771,Lisa,but you and willie will drown!
50339,Lisa,affirmative.
48201,Lisa,"this is no act, they're actually trying to kill us!"
50446,Lisa,"principal skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
50501,Lisa,"bart, you wanna see something cool?"
47897,Lisa,"wow, i was gonna say ""call reverend lovejoy,"" but i guess this could work."
46063,Lisa,"yes, the island."
43706,Lisa,"oh, let me help you, george washington, i still want to help you."
44638,Lisa,she's really hungry.
44606,Lisa,ewww!
42413,Lisa,just screwing with your mind.
42227,Lisa,but those other girls are prettier than me.
42617,Lisa,"we know, dad."
47094,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
49203,Lisa,"we won, he's asleep!"
50616,Lisa,you're endorsing ted nugent for president?! he's a right-wing rock star who likes everything i hate!
47547,Lisa,i think skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
44602,Lisa,this isn't very scary.
43092,Lisa,"c'mon, bart. they're gonna pamper us. not literally, of course."
50810,Lisa,"dad, thank you. like always, the fact that i could tune you out without fearing i'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful i have been. which means i've got a train to catch."
45317,Lisa,"keep that plague coming, moses."
51902,Lisa,there go my young-girl dreams of vassar.
42838,Lisa,canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwe... etc.
50632,Lisa,what the--
50899,Lisa,"and money is college, which should lead to more money some day, but who knows anymore?"
45699,Lisa,take your arm off me.
50472,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. luckily, as equipment manager, i... was not... invited! woo-hoo!"
43786,Lisa,"langdon alger? oh, i don't like him anymore... okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially bart."
42023,Lisa,put me down.
44736,Lisa,"beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. you can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower..."
48452,Lisa,'cause i've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! how would bart like it if i just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?
51623,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
47279,Lisa,but... but i...
49747,Lisa,it's still on / in my head / it will be there till i'm dead...
49285,Lisa,it was my brother bart!
48629,Lisa,"bart, that's a blowhole!"
49953,Lisa,blondie?
49829,Lisa,"...and though hiram, mabel, and eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on. thank you."
50322,Lisa,these are comedy albums?
47108,Lisa,"mom, i know dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt. why don't you just say you're sorry?"
43898,Lisa,"i know exactly who i am. i am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak."
44236,Lisa,"hold on, bart. everything's going to be just fine. i'm going to get you to a doctor. he will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family. happy, happy, happy family."
43808,Lisa,"uh, grampa, maybe i should moisten your washcloth..."
46879,Lisa,"why is the guy from ""laverne and shirley"" living in our house?"
45313,Lisa,"mom, i need to get some sleep! i have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. i mean, english."
47702,Lisa,"ladies, grab your pebbles!"
46490,Lisa,"no, i'm still buddhist, but i can worship with my family too."
49847,Lisa,"fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. for example: one half plus one third equals..."
47781,Lisa,wheeee!
45588,Lisa,good. saddle up the bikes.
43395,Lisa,"actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is. the rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
48902,Lisa,but won't that just shift the burden to your children?
43329,Lisa,"hey, bleeding gums! i was great! and i owe it all to..."
43556,Lisa,mom! dad! bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
46022,Lisa,"dear moe, if anything should ever happen to me, i want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... dad, i can't--"
51599,Lisa,"great! but from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other."
45980,Lisa,shut up!
47157,Lisa,"it also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the duff corporate jet."
52031,Lisa,"sorry, bart. i'd love to help you but i'm mired in stage five, self-pity."
48701,Lisa,"but, but..."
44762,Lisa,dad!
50573,Lisa,i'm sorry.
41928,Lisa,"i mean you, you dummy."
48285,Lisa,they take in animals from the movies and tv that aren't cute anymore.
45096,Lisa,the wind in the willows.
43157,Lisa,"it never spins the other way. in the northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. it's called the coriolis effect."
45550,Lisa,not lenny!
51640,Lisa,kids love 'em. we trade them at school.
49090,Lisa,and... let's roll.
44591,Lisa,you turn it on. i turned it on yesterday.
50227,Lisa,you're gonna put him down?
52167,Lisa,i can't leave springfield. i was born here and i thought i would die here.
51130,Lisa,okay!
46567,Lisa,"oh, bart, it's human nature. you only want her because someone else has her."
52050,Lisa,"well, okay."
42706,Lisa,don't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says?
42225,Lisa,it's hopeless.
49892,Lisa,that only angers me more.
48973,Lisa,what was that?
47087,Lisa,"forget it bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the fox satellite."
51765,Lisa,i just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken.
46638,Lisa,awww.
42729,Lisa,"i've got the solution -- you and i are gonna make our own talking doll. she'll have the wisdom of gertrude stein and the wit of cathy guisewite, the tenacity of nina totenberg and the common sense of elizabeth cady stanton. and to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of eleanor roosevelt!"
49055,Lisa,"yeah, it's my code name. this is compost. and this is solarpanel."
42668,Lisa,"wow! how'd you track him down, grampa?"
48975,Lisa,it's a tape. martin must've set it to go off when the chrysalises hatched.
44491,Lisa,"which bombay to springfield flight is she on? the 10 o'clock, the 10:15, or the 10:30?"
46080,Lisa,the cirque de purée. we've had tickets since septembre.
46194,Lisa,knock-knock...
47128,Lisa,"but when he's twenty-three, i'll be eighteen."
48111,Lisa,"goodbye, implications..."
47822,Lisa,dad!? why did you do that?
52361,Lisa,ow!
44556,Lisa,um-hmmm.
41615,Lisa,i'll get those no good indians. just as sure as my favorite book is...
44252,Lisa,that's funny. i don't feel stupid.
44797,Lisa,"that's what veterans day is for, bart."
44239,Lisa,"um, excuse me, mr. smithers, bart may be seriously hurt. could we possibly go ahead of you?"
51329,Lisa,well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
42636,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you."
51746,Lisa,"so, you use a lot of solar energy?"
52120,Lisa,ow! mom! bart threw a book at me.
43980,Lisa,you mean there's nothing left to clean?
50793,Lisa,"dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help."
42690,Lisa,they made dad sicky-mart.
48508,Lisa,moe!
47900,Lisa,"look, dad wrote something: ""dino -- short for dinosaur? remember to ask jeeves."""
46252,Lisa,i don't care. i hate them.
48923,Lisa,what did i miss? how did it end?
41845,Lisa,a role model in my very own home. how convenient.
42984,Lisa,no edgar neubauer.
51812,Lisa,"take it, bart!"
49677,Lisa,"well, it is an honor to be asked. but i never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
51305,Lisa,oh my god. someone wants to be my partner. can't screw this up.
46202,Lisa,someone will. i'm gonna crack the bully code.
49750,Lisa,why is everyone staring at static?
49172,Lisa,because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
50959,Lisa,you never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. and i suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
47389,Lisa,not if i pump your heart full of morphine first!
43677,Lisa,he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. he even tried to kill george washington!
47930,Lisa,you've wrecked my life! / you're gonna wreck my life!
43517,Lisa,guarantee void in tennessee.
50522,Lisa,"exotic... vegetarian... i can mention it in a college essay... mom, this is amazing!"
50101,Lisa,huh?
50477,Lisa,"yeah, so he could shoot it himself. franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war two!"
50080,Lisa,"um, i'm treasurer of the jazz club, and started the school's recycling society."
43685,Lisa,no baseball bat.
48564,Lisa,"oh, you poor man. fired on christmas eve!"
51619,Lisa,"three feet, nine inches. that should do it."
45255,Lisa,"ugh, that antenna is an eyesore."
52128,Lisa,mom! dad! look!
48371,Lisa,"and because you're poor, so you don't feel like you're good enough."
50661,Lisa,your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable.
43972,Lisa,we've got to go down there and help dad!
43322,Lisa,when was the last time you worked?
50325,Lisa,"easter grass, cable ace awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten jiffy pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys..."
46356,Lisa,"no, pierce brosnan. a voice like his would give our house a much-needed touch of class."
51007,Lisa,"no, you're watching baby poindexter, the most educational dvd available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!"
51759,Lisa,really? but i thought...
42161,Lisa,perhaps i'm not making myself clear. i think you should reconsider.
46335,Lisa,they're always laughing. laughing at nothing.
49912,Lisa,"she's such a beautiful shade of blue... i'm going to call you bluella the whale."""
50430,Lisa,"dad, our lives!"
46292,Lisa,west springfield?
51173,Lisa,iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.
46531,Lisa,why is this movie pg-13?
45713,Lisa,"mom, i think you might be developing a gambling problem."
52115,Lisa,is too.
45344,Lisa,"good work, dad."
48363,Lisa,my name isn't toilet -- it's jake!
48895,Lisa,his father is a doctor...
49214,Lisa,"what are we, a piano bar?"
50493,Lisa,"""d, e, a..."""
43119,Lisa,"dad, that doesn't help people."
45222,Lisa,"there's an opening, mom!"
49535,Lisa,"wow, the truth in boardwalking law has really done a number on this place."
51848,Lisa,rudolph the red nosed reindeer / had a very shiny nose / and if you ever saw it / you would even say it glowed
46385,Lisa,"judge snyder? motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be boys."""
47465,Lisa,"right, right."
45759,Lisa,"sorry i'm late. i've been racking my brain, trying to think of something to cut from the budget."
42740,Lisa,"you know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it."
51656,Lisa,"dad, the tv's screwed up. it only plays ""married... with children."""
48213,Lisa,"boy, you sure showed them."
48914,Lisa,maybe you whaaa--?
42688,Lisa,and he taught me how to play the shenai.
50478,Lisa,face on a dime!
47502,Lisa,it's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on tv.
51076,Lisa,that is so unsatisfying.
43179,Lisa,"hey dad, whatcha doing?"
42360,Lisa,midnight?
48194,Lisa,more like jailed at sing sing!
42053,Lisa,is it terri?
49315,Lisa,"mr. burns, you can't do this!"
43648,Lisa,mom?
50282,Lisa,huh. let's see what cousin jessica's up to.
51690,Lisa,what a surprise -- it's bart.
51469,Lisa,your grampa's alive?
49850,Lisa,"thanks, dad. but you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
45166,Lisa,even you?
45719,Lisa,the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it!
44119,Lisa,"oh shary bobbins, this is ever so much fun!"
45226,Lisa,"mom, bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
50677,Lisa,"mom can't appreciate the kind of boy nick is, because although i love dad, he's a completely different creature."
47998,Lisa,"bernie, if you please."
48588,Lisa,"chill thunder! ""chill thunder""!"
46389,Lisa,it's not a school project. i'd've heard of it. i'd better go check it out.
43637,Lisa,you mean it's a new dress? where did you get it?
42773,Lisa,a deer!
44925,Lisa,krusty's speak and say?
45978,Lisa,"dad, change it back!"
52205,Lisa,oatmeal.
47539,Lisa,and why is krusty on the couch?
49398,Lisa,both. homer simpson... vance connor... fonzie... homer simpson... and the winner is homer simpson!
45670,Lisa,i tricked them into thinking they had leprosy.
51143,Lisa,"you never know, mom. i'm only eight. i might get married someday... even if it's only a green card marriage to keep a chinese dissident from being deported."
48925,Lisa,"bart, no, it's valentine's day."
44134,Lisa,why is that mirror sneezing?
44818,Lisa,"uh, what a terrible waste!"
44007,Lisa,please?
50680,Lisa,"grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?"
42973,Lisa,bart! your mortal enemy is on the radio!
47051,Lisa,who's naïve?
50141,Lisa,"bite me now, edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
48035,Lisa,"bart, a school-sponsored medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. you deserve to be expelled."
50291,Lisa,"you know, your movie's not all bad. if you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film."
49397,Lisa,please stop doing that.
46684,Lisa,what up?
49310,Lisa,"go, live your lives, get off my face!"
42372,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
52045,Lisa,and the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
44004,Lisa,"but i bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. i guess you could say i want to bring out the milhouse in nelson."
44742,Lisa,so all the simpson women turn out okay?
44182,Lisa,"oh, they're going to get eaten alive in middle school."
51550,Lisa,can i join you for lunch?
52124,Lisa,quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
45933,Lisa,oh yeah? what's his name?
44045,Lisa,you lied to me.
51437,Lisa,mom... can i visit bob?
47267,Lisa,what have i done?
45120,Lisa,"mom, where did you get that?"
48762,Lisa,"sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
48615,Lisa,and that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? they had seven names for that.
42029,Lisa,"if i still love you, dallas. if i don't, buffalo."
47521,Lisa,"i have to admit, i'll miss having him around."
42432,Lisa,but this project has no scientific merit.
45374,Lisa,"yeah, if you want to change your image, you've got to get your face out there..."
43934,Lisa,"wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
43193,Lisa,that is what i'd truly like to be/ 'cause if i were an oscar meyer weiner...
48026,Lisa,"dad, i don't think you realize what you've done. you've totally humiliated the best friend the simpsons ever had."
48412,Lisa,"last week, the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools."
44457,Lisa,dad! it's three a.m.! can't you mutter in your room?
43041,Lisa,he said it was just a name.
42323,Lisa,"mom, this is fascinating. did you know that they'll stop dad's heart for six whole minutes?"
49698,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
45927,Lisa,"wait, let me check the book."
44126,Lisa,we've crushed her gentle spirit.
51238,Lisa,"well, now i always have someone to eat lunch with."
45366,Lisa,what the heck's going on?
45924,Lisa,"hmm... bowls of porridge... oh, this seems somehow familiar... let's see..."
52512,Lisa,you could go back to michigan -- it's still under sharia law.
43546,Lisa,this whole thing is really creepy. are you sure you won't talk to dad?
46603,Lisa,why don't you read to us now?
49733,Lisa,um... what if someone were to lose larry?
50655,Lisa,"i know it's awful and insular, and caused thirty-five deaths, but i had friends! four digits of friends! i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell!"
46691,Lisa,whaaa?!
52046,Lisa,and the main export is furious political thought.
43027,Lisa,"oh, what the heck, it was jessica lovejoy."
45511,Lisa,"bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes!"
47391,Lisa,we're not paramedics!
46421,Lisa,you pulled me out of school for this?!
42679,Lisa,like what?
48453,Lisa,mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
41842,Lisa,hey there ten-year old. i couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
43669,Lisa,"the secret confessions of jebediah springfield? ""know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""
46919,Lisa,and look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
43306,Lisa,"so if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
41791,Lisa,iiiiiii waaaaaannt... that one.
49584,Lisa,"look, can you please, please, help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in? it's what half your songs are about."
44696,Lisa,darn it!!
43754,Lisa,maybe we can make your job more fun... what are those?
48709,Lisa,do you want to play a little?
47806,Lisa,and they seem awfully chummy.
42510,Lisa,o.j.
45201,Lisa,vincent price's egg magic!
47080,Lisa,"hi, i'm trying to reduce light pollution."
42592,Lisa,"mom, dad! mr. burns is a vampire, and he has bart!"
47026,Lisa,that's amazing. thank you.
49718,Lisa,i wanna do that!
43795,Lisa,"no, it's somebody's gross gum! get it out! ow! ow! it's pulling out my hairs!"
50690,Lisa,"hm, that's a pretty long time."
52325,Lisa,"dad, bart ate a green bean during the blessing."
48980,Lisa,his foot is caught in my button hole.
49026,Lisa,and i'm happy to be smoke-free -- thanks to these children's nicotine patches.
43388,Lisa,"yeah, i was just getting to me. because of mr. burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend tito puente got fired. but i could never shoot someone."
52139,Lisa,don't you see what's happening here? they're fattening us up so they can eat us.
49689,Lisa,that river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
45323,Lisa,"hey, cut that out! i have an idea."
46403,Lisa,dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
47592,Lisa,"well, i know one thing you could do..."
48269,Lisa,maybe mr. smithers will help us.
45610,Lisa,are you saying the end justifies the means?
42720,Lisa,"no, it couldn't be..."
45729,Lisa,microatia? that's twelve thousand miles away.
43725,Lisa,did he die?
50772,Lisa,they have itchy and scratchy weddings?
49254,Lisa,and your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled.
47073,Lisa,"thanks a lot, surviving beach boys."
48608,Lisa,"""my great-great, great-great great grandmother was a native american. she was a member of the..."""
46399,Lisa,"it's not fair, dad. why should an animal die just because you and moe are fighting?"
47541,Lisa,but i'm eight years old!
50094,Lisa,i'm gonna do a little research.
46271,Lisa,buzz off.
47173,Lisa,"good for you, dad. could you get me some syrup?"
47655,Lisa,i guess we're down to just me.
50750,Lisa,"from egg to baby to grownup, we can see them living their entire penguin lives from up here!"
50200,Lisa,what did you do with him?
49961,Lisa,everyone was mean to sally. she was too well-rounded. she felt cornered. they wouldn't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social.
45191,Lisa,"i did, until we came here last year."
48108,Lisa,"bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did."
50598,Lisa,i liked the knowledgeable docents.
48663,Lisa,"fort. that's build a ""fort."""
51134,Lisa,"all right, get comfy."
48513,Lisa,"you know, artfully arranged, these fragments could be an epic poem -- like t.s. eliot's ""the wasteland."""
42570,Lisa,i knew it.
41893,Lisa,morning.
48048,Lisa,those reindeer look really uncomfortable.
44428,Lisa,that one!
44326,Lisa,what the heck is that?
49995,Lisa,isn't this exciting?
47644,Lisa,don't call me chief.
42586,Lisa,you're probably right. let's just go back...
42442,Lisa,and that's the tooth!
49992,Lisa,"mr. cowell, would you like some band candy?"
44114,Lisa,grim--
45290,Lisa,"wow, my mind just created that out of nothing. this tank is releasing the full potential of my brain."
44576,Lisa,"but we don't have $15,000."
52137,Lisa,"hey, how come we never see you guys eat?"
51815,Lisa,rubik's cube!
43515,Lisa,but people can't help looking at them. they're wrecking the town.
47050,Lisa,what about you and mom?
42602,Lisa,mom?!
43075,Lisa,"dad, this clears you completely!"
46985,Lisa,wow. i'd better make the most of this.
43156,Lisa,yay! i won your stupid bathroom products race!
42480,Lisa,... then we put your name on the script and sent it in.
51126,Lisa,no. nobody did.
52520,Lisa,this is it. i'm going into the ultranet to save my daughter.
45970,Lisa,"there you go, little fish."
44618,Lisa,dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.
45758,Lisa,co-president? are you crazy?
48637,Lisa,no you haven't!
42085,Lisa,a doy.
43880,Lisa,i think i know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
44739,Lisa,i'm adopted?
46695,Lisa,mine tastes like dog fur.
44443,Lisa,bart! is that you?!
46773,Lisa,"he's not my dead boyfriend, he is a dead boy who happens to be my friend. mr. bonney, i am going to make your dream come true!"
42197,Lisa,"""our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy..."""
44858,Lisa,crackton? that doesn't sound right.
46999,Lisa,thank you! i've never felt more accepted. perhaps one day people who spell correctly will replace athletes at the top of our national pantheon.
48312,Lisa,how many bulls / must my grandfather kill...
49595,Lisa,yes. but they're my own original creation.
45908,Lisa,what kind of song should we play?
48163,Lisa,"oh, hey milhouse. i think bart's upstairs."
49096,Lisa,these badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at sundance.
51084,Lisa,"good news, bad news. we're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you..."
51482,Lisa,"maybe i should get that sick one. if i don't, no one else will. bart, list your top five, best to worst. no, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
42018,Lisa,"you're going back into the shoe-box. it may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest."
42581,Lisa,a vampire!
41725,Lisa,yes. ten please.
42794,Lisa,otto!
47366,Lisa,there's the enemy. give 'em all you got.
44735,Lisa,"and please don't deprive yourself of wonderful books like ""to kill a mockingbird"", ""harriet the spy"", and ""yertle the turtle"", possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle-stacking..."
47747,Lisa,hmmm. so... is it okay if i go to the women's conference with chloe?
48579,Lisa,maybe you just overfished them.
48574,Lisa,ta-da!
45771,Lisa,"see, that has the same problem. we need to soften the blow."
49091,Lisa,what are you boys doing on the foley stage?
46628,Lisa,"oh great, now hamlet's acting crazy. well, nobody out-crazies ophelia! hey, nonny, nonny, with a hoo and a haw and a nonny, nonny, hey..."
42930,Lisa,"no, thanks."
45049,Lisa,hey!
52052,Lisa,"hi, sideshow bob."
43638,Lisa,"wow, two finds in one store! what are the odds?"
43398,Lisa,mr. burns is the richest man in town. maybe it was about money.
42270,Lisa,up-up-up. when i'm done.
41648,Lisa,"oh my gosh, i've entered the body of our cat!"
41927,Lisa,hmmm hmmm. there's a big dumb animal i love even more than that horse.
41644,Lisa,"oh, i know. i heard it too. here's some music."
43006,Lisa,okay.
51752,Lisa,here you go.
51916,Lisa,"oh, brother."
50761,Lisa,krusty! this once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! because he's been eating nothing but your food!
46257,Lisa,"oh, no! we're headed for victoria falls!"
42471,Lisa,finished. now all we have to do is put our names on it.
51304,Lisa,i'd better go.
47204,Lisa,did a shark do that?
42593,Lisa,no! no!
47920,Lisa,what is it that they have that keeps snowball coming back to their house?
47627,Lisa,"i miss america, too. the united states has its grandeur and its follies, but mostly it's the place where all our stuff is."
47919,Lisa,you toyed with my heart like it was a toy heart.
49996,Lisa,"why aren't i going to oslo? the nobel prizes are my freakin' thing! but no -- bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy. and maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby. meanwhile, i'll just stand and wave to people going to better places."
43503,Lisa,"you don't eat cheese, apu?"
45260,Lisa,"i can't believe you did this, dad. why didn't you put that thing in your room?"
47722,Lisa,"thank you, nelson."
48817,Lisa,shout!
43941,Lisa,"oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. bart's just my brother."
51473,Lisa,"""i, lisa simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other."
48266,Lisa,and of course you'd never attack a fellow herbivore!
51905,Lisa,arrrgh!
49998,Lisa,"i'm just gonna chill out with a little ""this american life."""
47065,Lisa,"hmm, maybe i could be an expert on dinosaurs."
43256,Lisa,"i know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them."
43550,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing down there?"
42933,Lisa,noooo!!
46890,Lisa,precisely.
47122,Lisa,i'm sure she'd be happier without someone sitting on her back all day.
51364,Lisa,what are you doing?
43968,Lisa,he tried to kill our puppies.
44218,Lisa,i'll make you!
42416,Lisa,"oh bart, i forgot my math book. would you hold this for me, please?"
46029,Lisa,not yet.
43491,Lisa,the whole world wants me to eat meat. i can't fight it anymore.
50562,Lisa,writing is the hardest thing ever!
51090,Lisa,and do you think this boy took those eggs?
45951,Lisa,"it's a movie, dad."
51397,Lisa,"thanks, bart. this'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
51281,Lisa,"how? by size, brand, value? and don't even suggest race, 'cause i don't see that. i just see little people i own. what do you say, ladies?"
47658,Lisa,what the...?
42486,Lisa,"january 8, 1815. two weeks after the war ended."
45628,Lisa,"dad, where are your clothes?"
44757,Lisa,an earring? how rebellious in a conformist sort of way.
46816,Lisa,you did better than me?!
50647,Lisa,"wait a minute, grownups are on this?"
45289,Lisa,how am i supposed to hallucinate with all these swirling colors distracting me?
49319,Lisa,nay.
41939,Lisa,you're telling who?
51535,Lisa,"no penalty! he dove, dad!"
48112,Lisa,i hate going to the zoo. i feel so sorry for the animals.
42281,Lisa,"oh, i get it. bart, the baby-sitter's here. let me tuck you in."
42871,Lisa,"wow, with so much in common, i'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
44568,Lisa,here comes santa claus / here comes santa claus / right down santa claus lane... vixen and blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...
48636,Lisa,you haven't heard the last of this!
49131,Lisa,what? bart got a swiss army knife.
45725,Lisa,i'm taking my name off this thing.
46167,Lisa,"okay, we have our choice of rectangle land, cube country or squaresville."
47772,Lisa,no!
48254,Lisa,with one little difference.
42859,Lisa,"mom, i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've got to practice!"
46995,Lisa,yeah. i've got some work to do.
47273,Lisa,"principal skinner, i will not call off this strike until you bring back music and art."
45675,Lisa,you went to springfield u. you hate a & m.
44189,Lisa,"there's a lot more to it than that, bart. i don't just babysit; i sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour -- two dollars after nine o'clock."
51022,Lisa,"well, milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. but it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway."
50117,Lisa,"look, dad! ""players and coaches' entrance!"""
51909,Lisa,arrrgh!
46487,Lisa,"oh, i'll send you an email greeting card."
51794,Lisa,"let's see... what rhymes with ""jebediah""?"
49077,Lisa,"principal skinner, i didn't know you knew so much about film."
51118,Lisa,chocolate or regular?
41639,Lisa,scanning for sarcasm... it's clean. go!
41712,Lisa,you're so silly.
48200,Lisa,"dad, the phantom isn't in this."
51064,Lisa,better switch to social studies.
46489,Lisa,"yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys."
43474,Lisa,well i believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
44679,Lisa,"dad, we're the visitors."
50410,Lisa,you're gonna regret the day you were born!
41664,Lisa,"okay, i'll do it. but whom should i beat up?"
49256,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
45404,Lisa,"my family never talks about library standards. and every time i try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd."
42503,Lisa,in here!
50875,Lisa,a gentleman doesn't ask and a lady doesn't tell.
49565,Lisa,i'm lisa. one word.
50731,Lisa,"wow, the tv's hooked up to the internet! you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows."
50044,Lisa,so i want to honor grampa by giving my inheritance to charity. but which one?
44481,Lisa,i got it.
50642,Lisa,"nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!"
45358,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
52173,Lisa,there he is!
41977,Lisa,"no.... well, we used to have burping contests, but i outgrew it."
47140,Lisa,how can we get across?!
47862,Lisa,"yes, but he thought that was a bad thing."
51219,Lisa,i've told you that a million times!
49448,Lisa,"mother superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?"
42603,Lisa,"happy halloween, everybody!"
47202,Lisa,is there a problem with your father?
49465,Lisa,the biggest ring in springfield...comes from the bell in the springfield bell tower!
43298,Lisa,"i've never seen them fight like that, bart. i'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
45684,Lisa,"uh, dad has the worst luck when he's drinking."
44898,Lisa,"oh! we can't touch it, dad. it's behind a velvet rope! a velvet rope."
45882,Lisa,they're pigs?
52367,Lisa,bad dog! don't worry snowball. you're safe with me.
46165,Lisa,meh.
51475,Lisa,"oh, my god -- i'm getting a guinea pig! thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!"
42327,Lisa,"all right, dad!"
47587,Lisa,dad?
46070,Lisa,ya-huh!
50058,Lisa,but don't you know that people who don't go to college make three percent less than people who do?
52317,Lisa,"sorry, i'd rather go to heaven."
47572,Lisa,"yeah, i can't sleep. maybe we should give mom and dad a break. you know, go spend the day in an amusement park so we're out of their hair."
51681,Lisa,a little lazy if you ask me.
48405,Lisa,"evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact. it's even accepted by prominent conservatives, like george will and the late pope john paul!"
44292,Lisa,"thanks, dad!"
47821,Lisa,a shirt from that rap concert... bart must've gone to the show. but that means...
49531,Lisa,i'm going to dizzyland!
41688,Lisa,that life is worth living.
50758,Lisa,"well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
47005,Lisa,"i guess i'll have to. then i'll be queen of the world! of spelling. that's right, queen of the world! of spelling."
41769,Lisa,"i thought so. oh, bart, you..."
51040,Lisa,why do you think bad guys are so cool?
42550,Lisa,we know you're the one behind this. so knock it off or we're going to the cops.
48064,Lisa,"well, i heard they finished the stamp museum. that could be fun."
44718,Lisa,"hey, angel pie. can you drive me down the libarry? i wanna rent us up some movies."
44376,Lisa,bees. bees.
42641,Lisa,no. nevada makes my butt look big.
45335,Lisa,who?
49377,Lisa,a battle to determine the fate of equalia. but you wouldn't be interested.
44170,Lisa,"um, do you know what you're doing?"
50751,Lisa,this stupid prank is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
42769,Lisa,mr. blackheart?
44848,Lisa,yes!
46135,Lisa,"dad, i don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt mom."
45117,Lisa,"well, i guess i was just on a roll."
43425,Lisa,ow! mah tug!
46989,Lisa,"well, i'm not done yet. principal skinner said if i win the state finals, i can go to the spell-lympics!"
47868,Lisa,i'm relinquishing the poke-pole.
48847,Lisa,i warned ya. and yet my punishment is no less severe. that's odd.
47904,Lisa,look!
45652,Lisa,will you guys turn that thing down?
51799,Lisa,"bart, i need your help to write a new anthem for springfield. will you team up with me?"
49140,Lisa,i'll never last here.
48439,Lisa,where did you get that?
51924,Lisa,"i'm not a little egg sucker, am i?"
46368,Lisa,alakazai dragon fly!
46966,Lisa,"if i ever needed proof of the existence of god, here it is."
43965,Lisa,no.
47528,Lisa,"dad, that's our address."
48908,Lisa,"c'mon lis, hop on the wiggum wagon. ralph said he'd let me be secretary of indian burns. here's my first official act:"
45876,Lisa,"forget it, dad. i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby."
44222,Lisa,"ew, your arm! it's got extra corners!"
49700,Lisa,"belt is by twizzler, vest courtesy of nelson, tights are by hello kitty..."
44388,Lisa,"""...if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the east river at your expense."""
51877,Lisa,"go, dad!"
51593,Lisa,i'm gonna tell every psychiatrist i ever go to what you did.
48383,Lisa,sure!
43460,Lisa,awwww.
49438,Lisa,"okay, people, we've hit penumbra. brace yourself for umbra."
46775,Lisa,"sure. the point is, let's stop the madness and ban guns now!"
49153,Lisa,"yeah, sure, mel. let me just wave one more goodbye to my fans."
46764,Lisa,we could come with you.
45072,Lisa,of course not.
48721,Lisa,are you sure?
50778,Lisa,um... thank you for noticing me?
49999,Lisa,"mom, this isn't the way home."
50136,Lisa,how'd you do that?
46036,Lisa,"oh, dad."
46055,Lisa,mom wants you to come to bed.
42949,Lisa,yayyyy!
41636,Lisa,"they're only using you for your pool, you know."
47294,Lisa,maybe you could give us a personal tour of your country.
43683,Lisa,"that won't help, dad. no one's ever going to believe me."
46136,Lisa,what's so funny? i'm better than you.
42233,Lisa,left a good job in the city -- workin' for the man every night and day...
52339,Lisa,watch me dive! watch me dive! watch me dive!
48017,Lisa,"dad, if you'll recall, i never believed in you, not for one second."
51906,Lisa,so did mine.
51193,Lisa,point taken.
48425,Lisa,i concur!
41808,Lisa,"mr. lincoln, i..."
49421,Lisa,"well, that's it."
43658,Lisa,"""rory b. bellows, slip eight!"" let's go!"
52170,Lisa,"i can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something."
45546,Lisa,you're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. you've gotta destroy this plant.
44136,Lisa,me! / i would! /
43277,Lisa,"is that what we do in this family? when someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!"
48956,Lisa,"bart, keep it together. people are looking!"
52001,Lisa,"what about my cat, snowball?"
42499,Lisa,"dad please, for the last time, i beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob."
42560,Lisa,"oh, those baby ducks were so cute. i can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
43837,Lisa,it smells like otto's jacket.
43110,Lisa,"you're a member of the stonecutters, grampa?"
45576,Lisa,"oh, a name with ""fun""? um... fungus, funzo, attila the fun..."
51162,Lisa,ki-ya!
47510,Lisa,okay. i'll just stay calm and approach this scientifically.
49417,Lisa,"no, but wait. i aced the math part, right? because..."
44425,Lisa,and my gifts are still going to waste.
46069,Lisa,ya-huh!
47558,Lisa,i'm an orphan!
41879,Lisa,"oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
50575,Lisa,you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
46563,Lisa,"bart, this girl is in love with you. think about it."
51688,Lisa,that's it! all we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
43612,Lisa,"mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy!"
42312,Lisa,i don't see your name on it.
43354,Lisa,bart! i can't believe it... but why?
46800,Lisa,"dad, you knew this day was coming."
47534,Lisa,"your early movies are timeless classics. please, mr. curtis. go back to what made your first films so great."
45016,Lisa,"me, too!"
47036,Lisa,"there's the 10:50 from newark... the 10:52 from phoenix, connecting from dallas... the 10:55 from portland is running late. again. there it is."
45455,Lisa,yes! got 'em!
51563,Lisa,lucas! you're not competitive eating anymore?
50029,Lisa,"if you need me, i'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
49915,Lisa,i'm gonna get real help. just try to keep her wet.
52290,Lisa,why are we using the good china?
47353,Lisa,people would be a lot happier without presents.
43487,Lisa,"bart, tell dad i'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
49836,Lisa,what are you talking about? is there something you know about virgil that you haven't told us?
42825,Lisa,"dad, that's just a plant."
42026,Lisa,however...
50418,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna find out why, because this..."
51464,Lisa,"to quote whitman: ""this is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and animals, despise riches, stand up for the stupid and crazy..."""
46289,Lisa,"thanks, mr. teeny!"
46942,Lisa,i'm a magazine rack.
52359,Lisa,"oh, but i don't know how to sew."
45973,Lisa,don't you call me a--
49790,Lisa,"there must have been some good ancestors -- grampa, don't you know any?"
43272,Lisa,"look, it's twins!"
43336,Lisa,"oh, dad!"
47798,Lisa,what countries are those?
46341,Lisa,we just spliced in some home movies. whaddaya think?
42290,Lisa,look! there we are!
51129,Lisa,i don't know... it's four days old... i just ate...
48768,Lisa,a mole?!
45791,Lisa,"you're too much, bart. that's why i'm appointing you ""secretary of keeping it real."""
45890,Lisa,"c'mon, becky. tell us your big news."
52411,Lisa,"my god, she's been dumped again."
49485,Lisa,maggie?
43613,Lisa,bart got a present early? then i should get a present early! i want a present!
43393,Lisa,we don't have an outhouse.
51713,Lisa,it's so cool to have another musician in the family!
47284,Lisa,"well, what can i be?"
44432,Lisa,that's not gonna protect us from anything.
42702,Lisa,"thanks for buying us these toys, grampa."
48992,Lisa,oh. oh.
51057,Lisa,ms. cantwell?
50590,Lisa,don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
42365,Lisa,"oh, c'mon! hurry!"
48030,Lisa,cooper! more pink lemon-ale!
51714,Lisa,"uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--"
42545,Lisa,"that's good, dad."
52334,Lisa,heehaw!
47835,Lisa,i mean a man and a woman.
43159,Lisa,"bart, water will only go the other way in the southern hemisphere."
42566,Lisa,"no you didn't. you only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
50156,Lisa,"well, um, i was looking through mom's old schoolwork, and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
42619,Lisa,this is madness. he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
47141,Lisa,run across!
44072,Lisa,what hat?
47127,Lisa,"well, i like it here, too. luke has shown me the gentle side of the old west. he's really sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old."
49084,Lisa,this is so generous. how can i ever repay you?
41607,Lisa,time for a smoke.
51230,Lisa,...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!
50453,Lisa,that's us. do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
48107,Lisa,stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. mom and dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.
47550,Lisa,"good for you, mrs. k!"
48804,Lisa,"i just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
42334,Lisa,yayyy!
42279,Lisa,"dad, make bart wash his hand."
41817,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i couldn't think of a nice way to say america stinks."
45883,Lisa,"dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!"
51032,Lisa,"hmm, you're right. it is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted tv shows."
49182,Lisa,something about this just doesn't seem right.
49858,Lisa,"an f?! okay, this is the time when i always wake up."
52282,Lisa,make it two.
42055,Lisa,"sure it is. hey bart, let's do some homework."
49806,Lisa,yes!
42369,Lisa,poor ralph.
48451,Lisa,"oh, i can't believe..."
44288,Lisa,but we didn't do that badly. we collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
50927,Lisa,um... i just assumed?
52398,Lisa,whoooooaaaa!
48141,Lisa,i guess.
42027,Lisa,"however, i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose. in which case, i'd bet the farm on buffalo."
46175,Lisa,bart's got a girlfriend!
49454,Lisa,you mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? that's so cool.
43118,Lisa,well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
46881,Lisa,when you put your t-shirt on backwards?
48376,Lisa,"ow, that hurt."
51372,Lisa,but i'm going to give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.
42811,Lisa,skinny kids...
52484,Lisa,bingo.
45048,Lisa,of course... the transplant! somehow snake's hair must be controlling--
49815,Lisa,run!
51610,Lisa,"while bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our pop's brainpan."
42680,Lisa,"forget it, dad. if i ever become famous, i want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
47170,Lisa,"dad, you ate the last can of tuna."
51445,Lisa,shut up!
42141,Lisa,"well, according to ""eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. so i guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse."
46336,Lisa,i guess dad just takes us for granted.
47205,Lisa,"sir, your son has brought you into the twenty-first century. it's a lot like the twentieth, except everybody's afraid and the stock market is much lower."
44165,Lisa,then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
43732,Lisa,so it's true. some cartoons do encourage violence.
49911,Lisa,"bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?"
42142,Lisa,we leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
46056,Lisa,"you have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
50187,Lisa,mom?
51069,Lisa,can i ask you guys something? why does someone become a bully?
46504,Lisa,take it back! take it back!
45066,Lisa,"actually, keeping promises would make you a good father."
50942,Lisa,"dad, the baby giraffe is taking its first steps!"
52526,Lisa,i'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.
41837,Lisa,i'm gonna eat eight pieces of chocolate.
43278,Lisa,they don't like being broken up.
49117,Lisa,doctor.
42195,Lisa,mom!
48347,Lisa,yes.
44660,Lisa,stop! you are in violation of the model u.n. charter!
49814,Lisa,"listen: ""april 20th, 1860. a week ago, i had no idea what the future would bring, which, i guess, is always true of everyone all the time. anyway, last saturday night, i went to colonel burns's ball..."""
43014,Lisa,"don't be so hard on yourself, bart. it's not your fault jessica doesn't like you."
49325,Lisa,my bees?
50633,Lisa,i have no friends.

51380,Lisa,professor digglesby's wand! now i have every wizarding stick from the spells and potions department of wagglepoofs academy!
41789,Lisa,okay.
41658,Lisa,"wow, i'm actually passing as a college student! and they don't have a blue's clue. whoops, gotta age it up."
46032,Lisa,"dad, what happened to the back seat?"
43843,Lisa,no.
47793,Lisa,how many men do you know?
48509,Lisa,you have a worldview both bleak and beautiful! i wanna write a report about you!
49094,Lisa,my movie got in! i'm going to the sundance film festival!
51641,Lisa,"wow, mom! you're gonna open a sandwich store?!"
46864,Lisa,"well, you saved krusty's reputation."
45731,Lisa,i just want to tell you how proud i am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
42024,Lisa,"look dad, i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to. but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
52457,Lisa,"i'm lisa -- peppy, blonde, and stunning! / sophomore prom queen five years running! goooooo lisa!"
42455,Lisa,"i wish i'd gotten to know you better, dad. but there were times when we really connected."
45736,Lisa,ewwww.
44700,Lisa,"wow, dad was a good speller?"
44258,Lisa,"bart, how come you're not sick?"
52428,Lisa,"i don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect."
48265,Lisa,"i've read about you. you're shy, and you rarely approach humans!"
47640,Lisa,"perfect. you're our tv critic. ralph, what about you?"
50919,Lisa,"mm, that is good grub."
50096,Lisa,we're brother and sister.
50717,Lisa,what is going on?
48157,Lisa,uh... check.
48089,Lisa,but i'm too smart to get scared.
52444,Lisa,oh lord.
50206,Lisa,"actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. but you're a better person than he ever was."
45050,Lisa,"ohh, bart, that's plutonium. it's highly unstable."
44087,Lisa,what's going on outside?
41693,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom! hey, mr. bergstrom!"
45124,Lisa,"no! i never cheated before, and i never will again! oh, i almost wish i hadn't gotten away with it."
45929,Lisa,"oh, this is horrible!"
51888,Lisa,this is where you belong.
43594,Lisa,here we go again!
45543,Lisa,"""tomacco?"" that's pretty clever, dad. i mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
50482,Lisa,"hello, mom? you won't believe what bart's doing."
50205,Lisa,"i thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
46138,Lisa,all we can do is play our very best.
46026,Lisa,"sir, have you no shame?"
48489,Lisa,"dad, no! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!"
50377,Lisa,haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face?
52374,Lisa,yea!
42651,Lisa,"dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight."
41625,Lisa,might as well. you're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.
49352,Lisa,"we're still cool though, right?"
46244,Lisa,"no, mom."
51403,Lisa,dad! dad! you're back! you're back!
49731,Lisa,he's in here. safe and sound. let me just staple that bag for you.
51379,Lisa,an angelica button wizard robe... with wand pocket!
52042,Lisa,what do you know about france?
41753,Lisa,"that's okay, bart. nobody really believed it. we were just trying to scare you."
41806,Lisa,how could i read my essay now? i don't believe my own words.
43596,Lisa,bedbugs?
50570,Lisa,"no, guys... it was me."
49826,Lisa,"no, no, no, not now! quit! quit! no, don't quit the program, just the update, ya stupid--"
43900,Lisa,being myself didn't work... being someone else didn't work... maybe i just wasn't meant to have friends.
45632,Lisa,will you at least do the dishes?
46028,Lisa,"well, i'll write you letters. on rice paper, with a soy pencil!"
45578,Lisa,"the word is ""irony."""
50983,Lisa,very good.
47191,Lisa,this party's boring. everything here is for babies.
48655,Lisa,"cletus, i had to stop you exploiting the children, so i sent her an e-mail."
51605,Lisa,"bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, bart chose ""b."""
41985,Lisa,what could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
42941,Lisa,dad! remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive?
50835,Lisa,at least i'm with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.
44834,Lisa,"family to dad. family to dad. come in, dad!"
48922,Lisa,it seemed like twenty.
44921,Lisa,this should be in a museum.
43426,Lisa,"printhipal thkinner, i need thum shoes."
51336,Lisa,you got it.
45188,Lisa,"... that's right, homer simpson."
44185,Lisa,"okay, chief. enjoy bob saget!"
44014,Lisa,snowball! i - don't - understand. she loves to climb in h--
48011,Lisa,dad?!
45712,Lisa,"thank you, mr. president!"
42899,Lisa,"look, bart. it almost killed me, but i hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from oliver twist. and now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm."
43663,Lisa,what about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?
44090,Lisa,"hi, mr. smithers!"
44593,Lisa,ding ding ding ding ding...
42136,Lisa,dad! dad! do you know what today is?
45527,Lisa,do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
46068,Lisa,that's a party magic college.
49921,Lisa,i'll catch up with you guys in a little bit.
41724,Lisa,it's no use kidding myself. i'm having an ethical crisis.
42453,Lisa,is a coma painful?
49437,Lisa,this is the lowest we've sunk.
43931,Lisa,that waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
45178,Lisa,meh.
44811,Lisa,"willie, stop!"
50572,Lisa,and they're letting me write the sequel! a hard deadline is just the kick in the pants i need to focus and get some serious writing done!
47371,Lisa,"all right, i'll look."
46585,Lisa,texas.
43057,Lisa,"don't worry, i'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
52346,Lisa,the mouse is named itchy.
46931,Lisa,how could you?
42043,Lisa,"you think you know fear? well, i've seen them naked."
43936,Lisa,"oh, my poor little guys. that bart is so rude."
49730,Lisa,larry? larry? larry? larryyyy?!
48861,Lisa,asterix! tintin! i heard these only existed in high school french classes.
48669,Lisa,we did it! now we can enjoy boxingham palace in peace!
46805,Lisa,"bart, i have to study for the elementary school achievement test. and so do you."
44690,Lisa,ugh! now i can't remember my combination!
49942,Lisa,dad! the sharks must think you're a baby whale!
46833,Lisa,"oh, forget it. hey, how do we get back?"
43844,Lisa,no.
47161,Lisa,i'm not a coward.
45443,Lisa,who's up for some exploring?
48856,Lisa,"bart, bart, bart. you're worried you're losing milhouse. and love is a selfish thing."
44313,Lisa,"ach! you haven't changed at all! you're still evil! and when you're trying to be good, you're even more evil!"
47507,Lisa,both of us heard mysterious noises coming from this very spot.
48483,Lisa,this is a valuable skill. people might even pay you to build things for them.
44330,Lisa,"look, we got a package from the mr. sparkle company in japan!"
44029,Lisa,i wonder if i could change nelson...
43433,Lisa,and they read newsweek instead of nothing.
48049,Lisa,"mom, i got a rash where the reindeer licked me."
46323,Lisa,don't throw this away. it's rod's first tooth.
45214,Lisa,we should really put that in the corner.
43086,Lisa,"no, dad. i want to get down. this tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."
51141,Lisa,"using something this town has never ever seen: good, honest police work."
42580,Lisa,"no, no, they're wrong! the creature they seek is the walking undead. nosferatu! das wampyre!"
45228,Lisa,bart! that's tomorrow night's dinner.
41754,Lisa,"wait, dad, he's smiling."
41758,Lisa,"bart... bart... hey, bart."
43512,Lisa,hmmmmm.
47533,Lisa,better technology doesn't mean better storytelling.
42311,Lisa,homer.
42929,Lisa,tickets to the krusty anniversary show!
47557,Lisa,that's where mom and dad are!
50098,Lisa,fine. i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
46154,Lisa,"otto, what are you doing?"
47878,Lisa,i don't know about that -- i'm considered pretty smart.
48852,Lisa,that's not the milhouse i know.
50399,Lisa,brown gold... tuscan tea...
45382,Lisa,"okay, i'm leaving."
47548,Lisa,he's probably in costume -- he could be any of these people!
43688,Lisa,but it explains why there's no record of jebediah before 1795! he was hans sprüngfeld until then!
45766,Lisa,"i am proud to honor the players of the negro leagues of rollerball. and as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by..."
46645,Lisa,"no dad, it's just the weather."
44216,Lisa,b-e-d -- bed!
46388,Lisa,where's bart? his mountain dew's getting flat.
52518,Lisa,"oh, poor bart. my daughter thinks i'm a lousy mother."
44408,Lisa,i admit sgt. skinner seems okay... but mr. tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
50403,Lisa,that baby's head.
45152,Lisa,dad!
45742,Lisa,i'm trying! can't i get on your shoulders?
45446,Lisa,"dad, we didn't come halfway around the world to eat at americatown."
46436,Lisa,"hey, what's that over there?"
43729,Lisa,"hey, the comic book store's still open!"
51881,Lisa,"no, you do!"
50065,Lisa,you did?
48965,Lisa,don't make me say indian again!
44130,Lisa,do you think we'll ever see her again?
48122,Lisa,i'm worried about mom. she's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours.
51603,Lisa,and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.
51451,Lisa,dad!
45157,Lisa,"oh, my god. someone has to go back in for maggie!"
41785,Lisa,"wow, a bald eagle."
52061,Lisa,"if cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time."
49634,Lisa,"i never said ""kill!"""
47887,Lisa,compress his chest!
46725,Lisa,in heaven!
42540,Lisa,but there are still a few things i don't get. like how come we never heard about this until today?
51153,Lisa,have you no shame?
49245,Lisa,"with my luck, i bet it will. it's practically a sure thing."
42770,Lisa,are you an ivory dealer?
45856,Lisa,the cat dances better than i do.
47608,Lisa,this whole morning has been wonderful. too wonderful.
43108,Lisa,"what do they do there, dad?"
45026,Lisa,but mom said not to!
48193,Lisa,"yeah, but he's a wanted killer in our community!"
48428,Lisa,i'm not afraid of you.
51900,Lisa,i guess i'd have needed a partial scholarship.
46781,Lisa,william bonney?!
50650,Lisa,"friend, friend, awaiting reply, friend..."
50898,Lisa,"i've read every expert on poker, and watched jennifer tilly's dvd."
46634,Lisa,please don't be mad. i've been sponsoring an orphan boy in brazil.
45993,Lisa,"oh, i didn't think it would be so high... maybe i could just circulate a petition..."
42451,Lisa,arrrgh!
48144,Lisa,how did you do that?
49607,Lisa,although there were a few holes in the story.
42689,Lisa,i think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
41805,Lisa,"""i will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws."" amen, sister."
46048,Lisa,pranksgiving? uh-oh...
46738,Lisa,i live in a house.
45288,Lisa,i'll take two hours.
42320,Lisa,eh.
47591,Lisa,"i want you to stop this, dad. before you get killed."
48215,Lisa,"well, this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple dna test."
47031,Lisa,"miss sloane, how are you handling the change from la-la land to blah-blah land?"
44339,Lisa,"oh, those poor monkeys."
42322,Lisa,my dad is very sick. what's gonna happen if he dies?
45425,Lisa,"wow, mom. that's very profound."
45416,Lisa,"oh, well, we really mean it."
44907,Lisa,playin' hot wheels.
43852,Lisa,"hey, will you guys sign my yearbook?"
50119,Lisa,what am i gonna do? i need a pinch-runner with speed!
52176,Lisa,"read the bosom part again, dad."
45715,Lisa,"now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. everything we pack in, we pack out."
51291,Lisa,"no is the saddest experience you'll ever know / yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know..."
52192,Lisa,"well, it's very frustrating."
51806,Lisa,we've got a big sinkhole...
50290,Lisa,"no dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises."
50879,Lisa,cursive writing. i'm learning cursive. all these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them.
43825,Lisa,"da-ad! you're not pointing anywhere near springfield. it's over here, apu."
51940,Lisa,"but, mr. largo, that's what my country's all about."
52236,Lisa,just tell me you're sorry.
44417,Lisa,nuh-uh.
49197,Lisa,"mom, ""bart"" has something to tell you."
43672,Lisa,just when i was getting over my chester a. arthritis.
51077,Lisa,you think i'm pretty?
43424,Lisa,no i don't!
43774,Lisa,da-ad!
51233,Lisa,"but when we got home, he was waiting inside!"
48621,Lisa,not there. not even close.
47871,Lisa,i've realized how much i missed you -- and i can see from this magnificent lisa statue that you felt the same way.
52351,Lisa,his life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a simpson.
43187,Lisa,whatcha doin' ma?
43373,Lisa,it's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
45045,Lisa,who'd do such a thing?
47451,Lisa,"okay, for malibu stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need?"
47771,Lisa,oh!
45469,Lisa,"all right, i'll go! you don't have to be a jerk about it."
49355,Lisa,"we're at the end of chapter four. but we need a grabber, a whammy, a snap-a-roo, some eye mustard... i've got it! how 'bout this? what if queen helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn!"
42998,Lisa,"the spoon, bart."
52454,Lisa,can we do it this week?
47812,Lisa,"he's just being true to the bible, which is pretty violent."
45721,Lisa,"that's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned."
51747,Lisa,why are you sharing all of this with us?
45397,Lisa,i know that. it's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere.
42057,Lisa,"dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
44824,Lisa,"wow, dad, you're really working hard."
49656,Lisa,sorry -- i have a tea party at janey's.
48640,Lisa,the hillbilly tykes will become my tutees!
48415,Lisa,chapter one: when we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals...
51376,Lisa,"if i have to give presents, i'll give presents with a purpose. one for maggie... check."
45146,Lisa,because they discovered gold right over there--
43266,Lisa,who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
46852,Lisa,"there's clinton, bush senior, and the nice guy who finished last, jimmy himself."
43667,Lisa,"i was right about jebediah, and now i can prove it."
48699,Lisa,you can't give me a yellow card?! you're my father!
42184,Lisa,"bart, you said you were gonna name it ""camp freedom."""
49404,Lisa,so dad's life would have been the same! he would have married mom and worked for mr. burns. it would have been a push!
42259,Lisa,what if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
46665,Lisa,"i want my old dad back. the one who was yelling all the time and... you know, i'm not really sure what i want."
48445,Lisa,"not bad for a newbie, bart! you just may be the second-best player up here. in case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
51601,Lisa,"my brother is about to meet fear, and as usual, he won't pass."
50681,Lisa,mulberry island. we'll kiss there at sunset.
43163,Lisa,"bart, you can't actually call these places! don't you know how expensive international calls are?"
51652,Lisa,making fun of someone's clothes. how original.
49964,Lisa,you're blond too.
44350,Lisa,and so am i!
48945,Lisa,oh my god!
46339,Lisa,"well, i've been cutting the felt kinda crooked."
43318,Lisa,my brother just had his appendix out.
46287,Lisa,"oh no! somebody took my bike?! mom, i need a ride to school."
52142,Lisa,"well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?"
48990,Lisa,i didn't know you cared about ballet.
42685,Lisa,i can see through time.
46918,Lisa,they're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...
51542,Lisa,"oh, well, you're very wel--"
49085,Lisa,"um, okay."
47605,Lisa,"uh, i think we'll go to bed now."
49762,Lisa,"well, i agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world, but..."
45635,Lisa,"you stay away from lenny. and where's your sweater, bart?"
44545,Lisa,"i don't understand, professor. why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
44167,Lisa,but everyone will know you did this!
45418,Lisa,excellent. now next week is our state of the city address. has everyone finalized their proposals?
45428,Lisa,"hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in springfield! will you take me, dad? please? i'll show you how to order pizza over the internet..."
45603,Lisa,let ev-ry...
44521,Lisa,it's a bone scraping from that skeleton i found.
52243,Lisa,"i'll be playing my first solo. if you miss it on saturday, i'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on sunday."
51221,Lisa,i can complete my dad's mission just like george w. bush.
47455,Lisa,rice? why not caviar?
42656,Lisa,you had a stamp collection?
45886,Lisa,"well, mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans."
46451,Lisa,"no it's not, it's apt! apt!"
42590,Lisa,"please, bart, i've seen your stupid shemp."
44619,Lisa,we toil in the fields and he rides around in a rolls royce?
47788,Lisa,yes...
48732,Lisa,"but mom, the lifeguards have to know."
50946,Lisa,"look at these obscure card games! hey, do you have ""uno?"""
51965,Lisa,ew! how'd you get a name like that?
41613,Lisa,i sure am hungry for my favorite food...
46955,Lisa,"dad, i think this might be the work of satan."
43413,Lisa,the scene of the crime! there must be something here that can clear dad.
50316,Lisa,"oh, i ain't mad, and i never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful, wonderful..."
46109,Lisa,da-ad!
51810,Lisa,do you really think that we can write a song that does that?
50953,Lisa,the back yard?! but what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to flanders's fridge?
46319,Lisa,i thought you didn't like her.
42515,Lisa,it seems like i've been wearing the same red dress forever.
52479,Lisa,i know where mine is...
51413,Lisa,they're giant polluters but the c.e.o. is a woman. it's very vexing.
44634,Lisa,"hey, martin seconded the motion. it's entirely his fault."
46393,Lisa,o-kay then.
43713,Lisa,exactly.
51441,Lisa,i say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
42575,Lisa,"dad, i wouldn't go outside if i were you."
45352,Lisa,"we tried giving them eggnog at christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
45338,Lisa,"no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic."
47956,Lisa,"stop it! you'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. now, close your eyes..."
44663,Lisa,"look, he's licking the slime off that rock! that's what he's been eating -- slime! and there's enough slime for all of us! we're saved!"
45583,Lisa,"listen, when you see what's inside this..."
46057,Lisa,you can't post that on the internet. you don't even know if it's true.
49164,Lisa,stop it! both of you! you have a common land! a literature! and the sweetest songs on earth! toora loora loora -- toora loora lie / hush my little baby / hush now don't you cry
52517,Lisa,well... someone calls someone.
48748,Lisa,ew! he is slimy!
47568,Lisa,i'm going into the gold medallion club... with silver-level membership!
50827,Lisa,"and the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay."
43854,Lisa,"i don't get it. straight a's, perfect attendance, bathroom timer... i should be the most popular girl in school."
47610,Lisa,"this is ridiculous. only babies and ex-junkies are afraid of needles. stick me, chuckles!"
47468,Lisa,"all right, so what else is goin' on? let's see... hey! why do they call them field trips? we never go to a field!"
44462,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
47377,Lisa,"coltrane, you were with us only briefly, but we'll always have the ride home from the shelter. and uh... i guess that's it. amen."
46195,Lisa,would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard work?
48939,Lisa,it's disgusting!
48794,Lisa,i guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
47551,Lisa,at least i was planned.
49931,Lisa,maybe i should just be alone a little bit.
44436,Lisa,all the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
46088,Lisa,it sounded like a silo tipping over!
45779,Lisa,"goodnight, america."
44172,Lisa,bart!
44899,Lisa,dad!
51428,Lisa,well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. want a hug?
44876,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i give up."
44776,Lisa,"come on, this isn't a joke. all over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news."
50568,Lisa,what happened to me? in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most -- a literary fraud.
45101,Lisa,"oh, i really need one more day, mom. i think the germs are regrouping. now for breakfast i'll have hash browns, coffee and a short stack. and would it kill you to heat up the syrup?"
43647,Lisa,i'm going to contribute my money to the corporation for public broadcasting.
52062,Lisa,oh no!
41971,Lisa,"hey, stop that!"
51111,Lisa,ah! tenting! tenting! back to the tenting!
44016,Lisa,"please don't ruin this for me, bart. i think he's starting to like me!"
50253,Lisa,"ms. stewart, i made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles!"
48034,Lisa,i dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system: the serfs.
51921,Lisa,"you'll never get one now, mr. name-caller."
46889,Lisa,huh?
49965,Lisa,dye! dye! dye!
48810,Lisa,and you contributed to our culture!
42666,Lisa,"oh, grampa. they pelted you too?"
43308,Lisa,pointless.
49045,Lisa,mom! we need a callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!
45098,Lisa,"we'll see about that, mate."
42508,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
45580,Lisa,that's not funny... huh?
46873,Lisa,but where will we live?
47606,Lisa,great!
49024,Lisa,i want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of americans. for years we've known how dangerous it is. it stunts your growth. and it's marketed to children. i'm talking about ballet.
47701,Lisa,"that's right, a double-dogleg, hamstring-knotting hop-way to hell. what insane kangaroo dreamed this fevered nightmare? behold!"
46480,Lisa,"well, santa can take it back because i'm not ruled by material desi-- is that a pony?"
48072,Lisa,i know. i'm sorry.
47574,Lisa,i know. my new thing is to ignore you.
45681,Lisa,i think godzilla's bigger than superman.
47376,Lisa,coltrane?
49177,Lisa,tracking software? you're spying on bart!
47386,Lisa,"mom, can we go into this bookstore? please, please, please, please, please, please, please?"
45937,Lisa,"it's okay, they're gone now. you can..."
52489,Lisa,but surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback. love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.
48261,Lisa,"sure. once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--"
42958,Lisa,i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
46024,Lisa,nooo!
51602,Lisa,the last day of school. field day. when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
51105,Lisa,this kilt says you framed my brother! why?
52066,Lisa,"oh, bart."
48590,Lisa,uh... deux... troi....
52316,Lisa,"hi, dad. i think stealing cable is wrong. so i'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. it's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. thank you for your time."
44821,Lisa,"yeah dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize."
44740,Lisa,doctor?
51787,Lisa,foolish boy. you'll never guess elon musk's master password.
49266,Lisa,"""last clue: ""loses on purpose"". hmmm... ""diets!"" oh, will shortz, you clever rascal."
48298,Lisa,"wow, there's a rainbow outside."
44304,Lisa,"oh, i'm not doing this for the money. i'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
47254,Lisa,"look, in the swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance--"
44402,Lisa,what a perfect way to end our day in new york.
41772,Lisa,"huh... wha-- bart, it's six a.m."
46661,Lisa,"mom, my potato is eating a carrot!"
48257,Lisa,it's so impressive.
50846,Lisa,"hey, don't ever stop, because tonight we made it in new york!"
49876,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
50845,Lisa,"oh, for the love of god."
50257,Lisa,it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast...
51878,Lisa,yeah!
45687,Lisa,"wow, he's got every nancy drew! even the controversial ""clue in the clock."" so many swears."
42169,Lisa,are you sure that's safe?
47690,Lisa,"oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
46807,Lisa,"bart, the test is in two hours. and you haven't slept in a fortnight."
43019,Lisa,well read and just a little wild. if only someone could tame him.
43616,Lisa,"now you are the one who is ""it."""
49504,Lisa,"ooh, it must be bloomsday!"
46430,Lisa,murder most foul?
43238,Lisa,"uh, mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?"
50583,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story."
48223,Lisa,my malibu stacy heads!
52178,Lisa,"hi, bart. what're you doing?"
46034,Lisa,something's wrong. terribly wrong.
51945,Lisa,"every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. and we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable..."
52107,Lisa,"everyone knows you're faking it, bart."
50169,Lisa,"what's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home, if i have to do my learning here?"
49463,Lisa,so many rings! but which one is the key to finding the gem?
46542,Lisa,she could get hurt!
48032,Lisa,"guards, take him to the tower!"
52434,Lisa,no. homework's not my father's specialty.
44329,Lisa,wow.
45536,Lisa,"oh, you poor little sheep! no one's sheared you for years!"
49784,Lisa,"what is this, tough love?"
44083,Lisa,"mom, this is no time to be conservative. let's roll the dice here."
49859,Lisa,"come on, alarm clock -- get me out of this!"
50500,Lisa,"halloween is over, which means america, it's time to start your christmas shopping. infuse our stagnant economy with dollars you don't really have."
47407,Lisa,"mom, i can't find anything on sacagawea. just a couple books on ron santo."
51899,Lisa,hey!
49021,Lisa,i can't -- i promised i wouldn't.
42189,Lisa,sorry.
49405,Lisa,can you keep her quiet?
48767,Lisa,"i am. you're on a bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man."
48219,Lisa,i would have guessed low.
46157,Lisa,is that a navy tattoo?
41589,Lisa,stop telling me that.
44529,Lisa,but they are morons. what grown person could believe in angels?
45202,Lisa,"okay, now we just have to stick the feet on."
43842,Lisa,that song is so lame.
47081,Lisa,"look up at the stars, springfield! for eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
50102,Lisa,"thanks, guys."
49714,Lisa,"and, bart, maybe charlie can't be your little brother, but you'll always be a big brother to me."
48290,Lisa,"dad, you can't keep this up for long."
51841,Lisa,"oh, no!"
44802,Lisa,"""bart's show."" if everybody knew what a phony bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... i've got it!"
49212,Lisa,it's true! he's not bluffing!
46422,Lisa,"mom, i believe you."
48260,Lisa,"i'll stay with you, dad."
45811,Lisa,"okay, on three. one... two..."
43516,Lisa,"hey, springfield! are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? then take a tip from mr. paul anka..."
46506,Lisa,just ten more years! / just ten more years! / just ten more years!
50386,Lisa,"wait, i know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. but he doesn't deserve to die."
42073,Lisa,a homemaker! i might as well be dead!
49521,Lisa,"math, done. pine cone, collected. permission slip, signed. now time for a break -- a little social studies."
44297,Lisa,no.
47678,Lisa,"oh, my god! this is the worst halloween horror we've ever faced."
43925,Lisa,hmmm. looks about the same.
45281,Lisa,"yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --"
42205,Lisa,no.
49292,Lisa,can't you open your mapple menu and click on the compassion bar? oh please?
41775,Lisa,i don't think real checks have exclamation points.
42716,Lisa,action! i've got to talk to that woman who invented malibu stacy and see if i can get her to --
47029,Lisa,what a sight! it happens every year like the swallows returning to capistrano.
47320,Lisa,"dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. that's the whole point of moby dick."
48319,Lisa,"aw dad, we'll miss you so much."
42964,Lisa,"yeah, best ever."
45379,Lisa,a pie.
50437,Lisa,banned books?!
50121,Lisa,now get out there a kick a field goal! kidding!
45087,Lisa,but i'm hardly learning at all.
51824,Lisa,you're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
42071,Lisa,"janey, school is never a waste of time."
47723,Lisa,i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
44648,Lisa,milhouse! i am defending you!
50843,Lisa,i was thinking amateurs only.
43400,Lisa,"mr. burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner moe szyslak. his bar was closed because of burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur barney gumble. when moe's closed, barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the love tester machine."
45145,Lisa,"oh, come on."
44260,Lisa,"i was in the library at the time, but janey told me that principal skinner and bart's teacher, mrs.... what's her name?"
42869,Lisa,the sax.
42853,Lisa,"bart, i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately. i got carried away with being popular. but now that i'm unpopular again, i want you to know i'm here for you."
51637,Lisa,"dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating."
42972,Lisa,"when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her."
45084,Lisa,i'm afraid i can't allow that.
50333,Lisa,really? can i see it?
46381,Lisa,"well, why don't you do something about it?"
47151,Lisa,"i'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track."
48462,Lisa,"well, i kind of like this guy..."
43518,Lisa,it worked! they're all dead!
48872,Lisa,"the tivo is installed! now we can watch shows, and skip the commercials!"
45828,Lisa,rock and roll.
48592,Lisa,papa meaux! papa meaux!
51885,Lisa,me first!
52465,Lisa,that's the answer! maggie's a real witch now! she can reverse the spell!
50634,Lisa,okay.
43133,Lisa,i'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
45490,Lisa,"wow, my first published article. although someone else's name is on it."
44605,Lisa,"why did you shudder just now, mom?"
42927,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
48894,Lisa,his mother was a shakespearean actress!
43419,Lisa,"yeah, that's how fast grampa is shrinking."
48188,Lisa,"and literature is filled with tales of redemption, from jean valjean to the voice of buzz lightyear, tim allen."
51440,Lisa,oh my god! it's worse than i thought. everybody wait here while i do some actual research. nobody form any opinions while i'm gone.
42490,Lisa,whacking day is coming.
47999,Lisa,"i'm in the final two / i should be happy / but all i want to do / is spend more time with my pappy... now that you're gone, dad, i miss you so much / and your threats against teamsters and techies and such / your management style is like attila the hun / you were vicious, malicious, but you got the job done..."
46587,Lisa,i'm really gonna miss him.
51730,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
49567,Lisa,"i should warn you: by using the term ""lame,"" you're violating the americans with disabilities act."
48715,Lisa,"bart, meet joe laboot."
50427,Lisa,i am so sorry.
44884,Lisa,"are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did close on your head."
43458,Lisa,"we're going to storytown village, grampa. it's an amusement park for babies."
47963,Lisa,"and if i win, i'll be on itchy and scratchy..."
42238,Lisa,i don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company!
48927,Lisa,a story suitable for children!
43752,Lisa,"no, thanks. do you have any fruit?"
45548,Lisa,now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
45216,Lisa,eww.
49896,Lisa,"it's the natural order of things. i'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
49792,Lisa,"well, are you gonna help me or what?"
44364,Lisa,"bart, i got a cassette from mom and dad! i thought we could listen to it together."
41770,Lisa,"dear bart, i am using the stationery mom and dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. perhaps if a professional so advises, i will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
44689,Lisa,"if you're suggesting i stayed up all night trying to solve that childish puzzle, you're right."
51529,Lisa,"i switched with her, dad."
43535,Lisa,sorry.
48173,Lisa,i had a wonderful time today. grázie. grázie míll-eh.
51642,Lisa,what's wrong?
51724,Lisa,oops. so did mine.
48320,Lisa,hello?
48202,Lisa,it's santa!
47973,Lisa,did i forget to mention yoooouuu?
50925,Lisa,"get along, little buggies!"
47219,Lisa,"dad, the word's ""desert."" and those farmers are suffering!"
51462,Lisa,"more for mom, but yes."
45342,Lisa,"well, actually, i just wrote it for a school assignment. everyone else wrote to the back street boys."
44765,Lisa,"no, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
44496,Lisa,"hey, they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow. that's where they discovered all those fossils!"
43727,Lisa,"bye, mom. bye, dad."
46532,Lisa,these are so easy. it's obviously tom hanks.
42441,Lisa,so we'll march day and night /
43584,Lisa,bart! bart! what are you doing?! we've got to get out of here!
45913,Lisa,"to prolong the run of the series, i was secretly given anti-growth hormones."
43379,Lisa,"let's go now, mr. puente."
50756,Lisa,"nelson, don't you want my lunch money?"
51392,Lisa,"bart, you were right."
44210,Lisa,"well, there's been a mistake."
48700,Lisa,this is what i think of your yellow card!
43449,Lisa,hmmm... pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
45680,Lisa,"that's nice, but maybe your homecoming float should have something to do with college."
52338,Lisa,marco!
42799,Lisa,"you're a witness? bart, you have to tell the police."
50071,Lisa,"hi, nelson."
44673,Lisa,"one's residential, the other is business."
52508,Lisa,you finally reached emotional maturity. unlike bart.
44306,Lisa,"mr. burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. you have to show them they're appreciated."
51013,Lisa,he's right here.
48127,Lisa,i'm afraid the best thing i could find is this.
47486,Lisa,"well, i'm sure a lot of great people have started with less."
49803,Lisa,i can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
48336,Lisa,...and you've got the elderly jewish couple making their first trip to israel.
42045,Lisa,"ah, bart! that's a black-head gun!"
45280,Lisa,i'm really not the chuckling type.
46947,Lisa,"'bye, mom!"
48454,Lisa,it's jazz! jazz! you don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me!
52509,Lisa,how did my daughter turn into my brother?
47607,Lisa,make mine calico!
49563,Lisa,"ooh, a doctorate!"
45051,Lisa,what's wrong with the tv?
42046,Lisa,dad!
42923,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
42867,Lisa,"well, i'm sure i could have, but i'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends."
49776,Lisa,"um... can i have it on account? on account of i want it? you've heard that one, huh?"
45274,Lisa,da-ad!
46205,Lisa,why does the school need to watch us all the time?
46786,Lisa,i guess guns really are the answer.
51607,Lisa,mom! i'm narrating!
43189,Lisa,"i like him. he's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
50194,Lisa,now they're dancing on his grave!
51818,Lisa,"ooh, mom. someone wants you to give them a ride."
46302,Lisa,hmmm... it's noon -- that's about when dad gets the brew-shakes.
50921,Lisa,"so if i'm growing grasshoppers to eat, am i a farmer or a rancher? there are gonna be a lot of heated blogs on this topic."
43362,Lisa,"when the jazzman's testi-fyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman, take my blues away ..."
49834,Lisa,there's no noble simpson.
44249,Lisa,aren't you afraid i might take drugs and injure your children?
42951,Lisa,haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
46926,Lisa,lady penelope ariel-ponyweather.
43434,Lisa,yeah. the sun is still out.
51555,Lisa,hello?
47162,Lisa,"look, to get our dog back, we need a plan."
51573,Lisa,i'm okay with no friends. it's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form i choose. right now i'm thinking long novella. goodnight!
48626,Lisa,"eating mock buffalo steaks made from peaceful turnip roots, uh, they... environment... umm, dignity... corn god... i'm sorry, i can't do this!"
50521,Lisa,"relax, mom -- be adventurous."
47620,Lisa,"well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. check out all the left-wing celebrities."
45526,Lisa,mom.
45905,Lisa,"we were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash."
42355,Lisa,"dad, hide your shame!"
50534,Lisa,"yeah-huh: athos, porthos, aramis and d'artagnan."
44270,Lisa,"no. they went for a walk with the flanders. bart, what's going on? why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
51241,Lisa,"are you really, really sure?"
49101,Lisa,proudly edited by lisa simpson!
46795,Lisa,"have you always resented us, dad?"
42743,Lisa,"go, dad, go."
52092,Lisa,"oh, no, bart, we'll have nightmares."
43062,Lisa,"ew. bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. they go in the trash."
44610,Lisa,"bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig."
43644,Lisa,i won't say anything controversial.
43053,Lisa,get out! get out!
48712,Lisa,hide the sports section!
48835,Lisa,ice cream! ice cream! / dad's the best!
44911,Lisa,someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. we can get a new one.
42561,Lisa,we stopped five minutes ago.
47401,Lisa,"fine, i'll tell you how it ends. the brutish captain mordecai has cornered his rival, cyrus..."
49373,Lisa,"juliet, i'm scared."
49947,Lisa,"that's not true! first of all, milhouse fell because you tripped him. secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
49443,Lisa,"wait, i have an idea! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
45772,Lisa,i love it!
51052,Lisa,fur?!
41692,Lisa,"i see he touched you, too."
42135,Lisa,"they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. as you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
43488,Lisa,"why don't you just eat him, dad."
45950,Lisa,how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
44867,Lisa,how could i confuse bus 22 with bus 22a?
51251,Lisa,the students would do it.
47133,Lisa,"yeah, it sure is..."
42325,Lisa,oh dad.
46477,Lisa,om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung.
49135,Lisa,"hey krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. why don't you hire them both? it won't cost you anything -- you could call bart an intern."
49436,Lisa,"there's a lesson here: life is fickle. you should appreciate every... stop kicking, bart!"
46148,Lisa,what does it mean?
44997,Lisa,"it's because they are kids. and so are we. c'mon, alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open, and go days without bathing. we'll never have that freedom again."
45614,Lisa,"what's in the box, mom?"
50210,Lisa,you said it was boston.
41901,Lisa,"no. dad, i broke my last saxophone reed, and i need you to get me a new one."
41976,Lisa,why isn't dad ever interested in anything i do?
46826,Lisa,to fraternal love.
45496,Lisa,not anymore. i don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
50725,Lisa,power's out.
51758,Lisa,"um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
44588,Lisa,"because he was singing, we overheard his plan / and could save those dogs from that mean old man."
43208,Lisa,"hello. i need ecosystem of the marsh, by thompson."
48402,Lisa,creationism? but that's not science.
45139,Lisa,"... and the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and i don't deserve your applause. i cheated on that test."
43957,Lisa,excuse me.
43483,Lisa,"wait dad! good news, everyone! you don't have to eat meat. i made enough gazpacho for all!"
42328,Lisa,"oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
47336,Lisa,"krusty, you can still have your bar mitzvah as an adult."
46759,Lisa,maybe we should look for clues.
50968,Lisa,"every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities."
49513,Lisa,sideshow bob! drop that knife and give back our dad!
46464,Lisa,you guys are buddhists?
49511,Lisa,sideshow bob!
41846,Lisa,maybe you ate a clove.
46573,Lisa,let's go where it's quiet.
42620,Lisa,is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
44493,Lisa,you did. his name was stampy. you loved him.
51000,Lisa,"mary, could i steal bart for a minute?"
45163,Lisa,"i've never heard of these bands, mom. what kind of music do they play?"
43983,Lisa,how was what? what?
44215,Lisa,"i said go to ""bed."""
48358,Lisa,"mom, i don't think this will fool anybody."
50014,Lisa,thursday we got attacked by bees.
51311,Lisa,"oh, dear god."
46424,Lisa,i suggest dinner and a show.
49916,Lisa,"hey, mom... dad... there's a whale on the beach... you've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!"
42841,Lisa,coming!
49207,Lisa,"oh, bart. don't say things you can't take back."
51051,Lisa,meat?!
46290,Lisa,huh? this isn't miss hoover's class.
47179,Lisa,"ideally no, but..."
48016,Lisa,"dad, please don't go through with this. all through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."
42663,Lisa,and i still don't have my saxophone.
44874,Lisa,excuse me. can you tell me how to get to the museum?
50699,Lisa,"dad, where are we going? do we have a plan?"
44676,Lisa,"ow! bart, that has nuts in it!"
44599,Lisa,the carnival!
50072,Lisa,"this is really fun. but we're still just friends, right?"
46427,Lisa,"no dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
49768,Lisa,but he does look lonely all by himself...
48479,Lisa,this place is looking a little run down.
44948,Lisa,they left without me.
44013,Lisa,c'mon!
51952,Lisa,no. not really.
45479,Lisa,"dad, that's an ambulance."
48696,Lisa,"dad, i'm impressed! you've become a much better referee."
50085,Lisa,anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
42492,Lisa,excuse me.
47763,Lisa,miss lucy went to heaven and the steamboat went to...
51322,Lisa,what?! my mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
43302,Lisa,oh yeah.
42861,Lisa,"sorry, ralph. that would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation."
49553,Lisa,confirm.
45440,Lisa,"look mom, the safety instructions are written in haiku. ""fasten seatbelts tight / your seat cushions float gently / headsets five dollars."""
44498,Lisa,fine. i'll come back later. who wants to come back with me? fine.
42975,Lisa,uncle mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have!
49127,Lisa,"it's not really avenging her, dad. just the fulfillment of her last wish."
50638,Lisa,"no, that is not true! i--"
41911,Lisa,"dad, no!"
51578,Lisa,tumi? but you're from the other second grade. we only come together for tornado drills.
46172,Lisa,"thank you, dad."
45133,Lisa,chalmers.
45420,Lisa,i don't remember discussing that.
44682,Lisa,professor provolone's picto-puzzle.
50994,Lisa,things that you're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed.
43804,Lisa,i love it! i finally look like a real person! thanks!
46610,Lisa,god spoke to me -- i must obey.
43904,Lisa,this is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
44580,Lisa,but we would have had each other anyway.
44363,Lisa,"uh-huh. so, anything else you want to talk about?"
42547,Lisa,"bart, i figured it out. who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years?"
48931,Lisa,how is that fun? fun is only fun if everyone's having fun.
49574,Lisa,really?
45306,Lisa,"mom, is this the one you want?"
49219,Lisa,": fdr's middle name... ""delano."" ""oxidized surface""... well that's ""rusty."" ""bartenders serve them 'dirty'""..."
51429,Lisa,"pass the peas, please."
50747,Lisa,"like monks during the dark ages, it's up to the kidzone: elite to make a record of human culture."
44889,Lisa,"dad, are you all right?"
43215,Lisa,he can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
47974,Lisa,i'm talkin' springfield... where nobody sucks! except for flanders?
51284,Lisa,"dad! we're missing ""the giant capybaras of uruguay!"""
45812,Lisa,hey! no fair! we'll never get a good picture.
44601,Lisa,i want some fried sugar!
51516,Lisa,no!
42443,Lisa,"like halloween and christmas, april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
45037,Lisa,but isn't that a bit short-sighted? what happens when we're overrun by lizards?
52029,Lisa,i stand corrected.
51206,Lisa,i think someone i love is a terrorist. does that make me crazy?
49945,Lisa,do you think they'll be okay?
49925,Lisa,"girl, you're going home! you're going home!"
50346,Lisa,"uh, how'd i get from inside there to over here?"
45234,Lisa,throw your peanuts!
47815,Lisa,really? didn't you just sign a ninety million dollar contract?
49018,Lisa,that's easy for you to say. you've never had to be thin and focused.
42891,Lisa,"i've got to stop being so petty. i should be allison's friend, not her competitor. i mean, she is a wonderful person."
51653,Lisa,it's true! it would be a cold day in hell when i was popular.
46220,Lisa,"i know, and the crowd is so distinguished. the inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
51201,Lisa,to the east! the middle east! mecca!
49844,Lisa,how did you--

49593,Lisa,"thank you, but i know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty. it's called ""snow white and the seven..."""
42393,Lisa,"hmm, i think you should give that a rest, ralph. chief wiggum, how did you ever get these tickets?"
51344,Lisa,"what am i doing? untent! untent! oh bart, i want to win, but not like this. i'm sorry. you're fired!"

47281,Lisa,"oh, this place is paradise."
45251,Lisa,america's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
46953,Lisa,"dad, this ticket is for tomorrow's wnfl game!"
46010,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll be right back."
43260,Lisa,maybe. but i still love them. and i don't think you understand that.
45605,Lisa,si-lent night...
46354,Lisa,"ohh, let's try matthew perry!"
48464,Lisa,"okay, this little guy's coming home with me! who's gonna get neutered tomorrow? you are! oh, yes you are."
42354,Lisa,can't talk. comin' down.
49160,Lisa,"um, there's someone i forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. krusty, will you come up on stage, please?"
45229,Lisa,mom! bart took what i said and turned it into an insult!
45165,Lisa,"why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?"
44857,Lisa,never mind.
51415,Lisa,not to.
52004,Lisa,i think she likes my present better.
43404,Lisa,chief wig-gum... don't eat... the clues.
46981,Lisa,woo hoo!
43484,Lisa,it's bad enough they're all eating meat. they don't have to rub it in my face.
50024,Lisa,arts camp was lovely.
42347,Lisa,this is a disgrace.
45686,Lisa,you won a grammy.
46091,Lisa,"excuse me, but isn't that voice very similar to the cowardly lion?"
42434,Lisa,this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
48809,Lisa,it is! tenor andrea bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
43046,Lisa,"don't worry, bart, they won't bother you anymore."
50179,Lisa,i'm so exci--
46982,Lisa,"i guess i won't be popular this year, either."
46095,Lisa,i'd love to go to the library with you.

47662,Lisa,what's that?
45090,Lisa,hmm... i wonder what's in this glowing barrel.
42275,Lisa,i don't think we should be down here.
41666,Lisa,why did i have to lie about my heritage? by speaking with forked tongue i am in heap big trouble. and now i'm thinking in stereotypes? that's even worse!
51840,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
45972,Lisa,you're ruining the earth.
49034,Lisa,i would strongly support that measure.
44918,Lisa,"wow! an alternate ending to ""casablanca!"" bart, this could be priceless!"
45773,Lisa,fiscal solvency.
44988,Lisa,i'll go.
51033,Lisa,it looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
42971,Lisa,"sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick. but in 1990, he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail."
50425,Lisa,i am never gonna get my homework done tonight.

51276,Lisa,"lisa. guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team?"
45485,Lisa,the food is delicious.

52344,Lisa,pony ride! boat ride! pony ride! boat ride!
46054,Lisa,well... a web page is supposed to be a personal thing. you've just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else. they could sue you for that.
46234,Lisa,"no, dad! didn't you listen to anything i said?"
42282,Lisa,homer.
48007,Lisa,"yeah, the templates had a great run. but we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
42703,Lisa,a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
51350,Lisa,"so, do you know how i can win?"
48170,Lisa,present.
44257,Lisa,but 7 goes into 28 4 times.
43175,Lisa,"well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into an ecosystem that can't handle them."

43381,Lisa,"oh, no. that's awful, mr. puente. what? oh. he owns the nuclear power plant. yeah, i'd like to settle his hash, too."
45200,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
43097,Lisa,"mom, you've been cooking all night?"
48873,Lisa,oh no we won't!
41970,Lisa,"maybe not, but i bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""property of bart simpson"" label on that radio."
44640,Lisa,"we may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more till tomorrow."
46015,Lisa,"ooh, it's morning. i gotta get back!"
43228,Lisa,"mom, it's a picture phone."

42671,Lisa,"you're right, bart. school is for losers."
49657,Lisa,"well, there's only one game we can play in the car over and over and over again. ""bonk it."""
43136,Lisa,"so, you loved her right from the start."
43406,Lisa,better... look... burns... suit.
47118,Lisa,this whole ranch is appalling. it's built on a legacy of cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.
48581,Lisa,maybe you should be ashamed of yourself!
46159,Lisa,"a wig! but, but your pant legs..."
48159,Lisa,vóglio affittáre úna bárca píccola.

51101,Lisa,this skirt has a small splatter...
52318,Lisa,i just want to call attention to the fact that i'm not watching this fight. it's my form of non-violent protest.
46053,Lisa,"okay, you're ready to go. i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them."
46835,Lisa,you die now!
46151,Lisa,yvan eht nioj? they keep saying that.
50142,Lisa,"sir, i'm not trying to take your son away from you. i plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes."
43349,Lisa,"hi, i have a request. i would like you to do a tribute to bleeding gums murphy, please."

51638,Lisa,"hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? meat, no meat, it's all good."
48744,Lisa,um... i don't think he's ever thought about anything.
50891,Lisa,"well, maybe i can just win the sixty-two dollars back."
49580,Lisa,"well, if it's sold out, even alaska nebraska's best friend couldn't do anything about that. can't build more seats!"

44423,Lisa,two apples!
45224,Lisa,"eww, why is courtney love on the wheaties box?"
48396,Lisa,the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom's brain.
43855,Lisa,"heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal..."
52523,Lisa,not a good time.
41670,Lisa,maybe i should just move on to question two.

42173,Lisa,"dear mom and dad, i no longer fear hell, because i've been to kamp krusty."
44636,Lisa,all we found were these oozing berries. and they look pretty poisonous.
48171,Lisa,one gelato for... the pretty girl.
45784,Lisa,"whoa, whoa, whoa! why don't we just invite our creditor nations here, and gently remind them of america's past generosity?"
49903,Lisa,"dad, you are leading the way in clean energy."
43475,Lisa,do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?
46475,Lisa,"i'm planting my own bodhi tree. if i meditate under it, perhaps i can find inner peace."

42386,Lisa,"tickets to the krusty anniversary show! oh, he must want me to go with him."
49106,Lisa,that doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
41956,Lisa,ariel.
43505,Lisa,"wow, that'd be great!"
42858,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
42220,Lisa,i thought those were illegal.
49365,Lisa,it's better if you don't.
48848,Lisa,"oh, that's great."
47265,Lisa,i would have gone with you.
50836,Lisa,"yeah, for about a week. but as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de barto. and that's why you're alone tonight."
44760,Lisa,i told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
44247,Lisa,"eh, well, that's okay. i can always sell seeds. do you want some seeds?"
44983,Lisa,you don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.

45023,Lisa,so what prize did you end up getting?
42400,Lisa,"now you listen to me -- i don't like you. i never liked you, and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is `cause nobody else would!"
45638,Lisa,"oop, the cheese isn't quite melted. let me just pop it back in the..."
43244,Lisa,"okay, i've got something old - that's my pearl necklace. something new is the wedding dress. something borrowed is this antique brooch from hugh's mother. now i just need something blue."
45710,Lisa,is that duncan?
41991,Lisa,"okay, dad."
46203,Lisa,"willie, i need to see the school security tapes."
50874,Lisa,what do you do tuesdays and thursdays after school?
41895,Lisa,can we sleep with you?
45560,Lisa,ew! these records used to be real accomplishments. now they're just gross.
46329,Lisa,eight.
52500,Lisa,i have to decide whether to make milhouse human again. i even prefer the way he smells now. some meat went bad in our freezer and my heart skipped a beat.
50804,Lisa,"you! it's about hello, hello, springfield. it's me, gaga! why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
45227,Lisa,hey!
47699,Lisa,hey look! the new ovenfresh flour bag!
45012,Lisa,you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
49391,Lisa,vance connor...
46247,Lisa,mom! bart implied i was a warthog!
50670,Lisa,ew. how 'bout i'll just look at you.
51298,Lisa,that's a reference to the brontë sisters!
49268,Lisa,"""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" wow, it's almost as if dad planted that message. no, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?"
50617,Lisa,"dad, you cannot endorse ted nugent. i mean, sure, we all love his music..."
49895,Lisa,"bart, she's only carrying thirty times her weight. our girl is slowing down."
48335,Lisa,i'm starting to think the sea captain isn't coming back.
48315,Lisa,"but you just got a new lease on life. why would you want to use it to hurt poor, helpless animals?"
45462,Lisa,"principal skinner, what would you say is the most important firefighting tool? would you say it's prevention?"
42484,Lisa,they said their insurance won't cover you.
48551,Lisa,"hey bart, do you want some ice cream? i just hit a major marshmallow vein - ooo, i think it goes all the way to the bottom!"
52498,Lisa,but doctor... he's so much more interesting this way.
43860,Lisa,be myself? i've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. look at all these dorky clothes... a bathing cap... nose plugs...
50261,Lisa,"come on, bart. afraid of a little apple juice?"
42452,Lisa,"hey, we know you're tough, dad. remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
46894,Lisa,universal studios?
51210,Lisa,"dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused."
49439,Lisa,"but mom, you'll miss the eclipse."
42784,Lisa,ow! that was a big one.
49038,Lisa,double ew!
47503,Lisa,because mr. flanders volunteered to take the senior citizens out for ice cream.
50853,Lisa,it's a black hole!
46474,Lisa,a buddhist wouldn't want any.
51707,Lisa,i'm home!
47706,Lisa,maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
50021,Lisa,"no! i fell in love with theater, dance, and song!"
49141,Lisa,"here you go, krusty."
51561,Lisa,is that mom?
49234,Lisa,isn't it beautiful?
51171,Lisa,the geyser's one of the most famous natural wonders in... iceland. i guess that's where carl's from.
47669,Lisa,the barney bugle?
45380,Lisa,"oh, this is so embarrassing."
48001,Lisa,"dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. i don't care if i win, just as long as you're in my corner again."
45334,Lisa,"well, if it'll help - um, mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy."
50621,Lisa,"dad, no!"
43452,Lisa,"that's creepy, bart. i think you really did lose your soul."
44906,Lisa,do do do do-do / do do do do-do / do do do do do do do do.
48123,Lisa,mid-june?
44444,Lisa,i can't hear you. wait! fly into my saxophone!
51967,Lisa,"i have problems, too."
48099,Lisa,"i bet that bra was planted by sterling, to break them up."
52268,Lisa,i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is.
50611,Lisa,"dad, i'm glad your show is successful, but i have to ask you: what's with the crying?"
52449,Lisa,can i dye my shoes pink?
44193,Lisa,"you should wash up for dinner. to make it fun, you can use the mr. bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
48977,Lisa,"""congratulations on purchasing the sanyo dl30, the finest non-reversing tape player..."""
43684,Lisa,we could?
50361,Lisa,ew.
44299,Lisa,you again.
42272,Lisa,"well, you voted for him... twice!"
48240,Lisa,say it again!
47673,Lisa,"well, you can't fight fate, but if you must shoot our father, please remember our family motto: ""not in the face."""
47338,Lisa,i have a jewish imaginary friend. her name is rachel cohen and she just got into brandeis.
46242,Lisa,"hey, how ya doin' there? / hi! / hello. / yo, kitenge! what's going on?"
41674,Lisa,those girls are snotty and shallow. tell them off!
50746,Lisa,sweet? sweet?! the passengers on this ship could be the last people on earth!
49543,Lisa,old comedy writers who now have to work at our kitchen.
51508,Lisa,"but, you still, i mean... i suppose you're right."
43828,Lisa,"no, i mean american indians."
49703,Lisa,"""off with their heads!"" said the red queen. now, pull the tab."
50183,Lisa,"well, i am so happy to be in your class."
47372,Lisa,"too fluffy, too siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. me-ow!"
42261,Lisa,bart!
46630,Lisa,"i need to call janey, but i can't get a dial tone."
50349,Lisa,"i do, i do!"
42985,Lisa,this is hopeless. they're gonna demolish our house for sure. we're gonna have to move into a motel 6.
41799,Lisa,"hello, sir."
45803,Lisa,"well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old photo."
43376,Lisa,"no, mom! bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville."
41816,Lisa,"""and who did i see taking a bribe, but the ""honorable"" bob arnold. but don't worry, congressman, i'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. and this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none."""
49206,Lisa,"excuse me, boys! my brother is lost, and kind of a jerk. if he'd brought a map of the grounds as i suggested, then we would--"
51754,Lisa,it's called a knot.
47292,Lisa,"grampa, that's so romantic! we gotta go to england!"
43274,Lisa,wow! twenty-five puppies!
45620,Lisa,"don't worry, little friends. i won't hurt you."
49508,Lisa,i think it's romantic. you can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together.
47609,Lisa,"oh, please let it be volvo."
52077,Lisa,"come on, bart. go with the flow."
41756,Lisa,"no, maggie. not az-tec. ol-mec. ol-mec."
46514,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that you're breaking up our family?
47810,Lisa,"i used to love springfield park, but it's gotten so run down."
52271,Lisa,"friday night, pork chops. from cradle to grave... etched in stone in god's library somewhere..."
42711,Lisa,mom! we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person!
41691,Lisa,"the train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
43269,Lisa,my bongo drums!
46294,Lisa,sorry. i was rushing because i'm in the wrong school. can you believe that?
51030,Lisa,"well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
46687,Lisa,two million.
45942,Lisa,plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
44714,Lisa,all right! sounds good!
48536,Lisa,mom! mom!
46678,Lisa,"well, i think we should try the springfield speaker's bureau."
43102,Lisa,"okay, i will."
44237,Lisa,mag-gie!
51394,Lisa,"it's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like ""worms with friends."""
50688,Lisa,shut up and kiss me.
47691,Lisa,and lose her soul.
47018,Lisa,"intransigence. ""i..."""
45134,Lisa,you can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! because i cheated!
52482,Lisa,"hands off, hands off. eh, screw it! sometimes a mother's job is to butt in."
44282,Lisa,dad! you're not supposed to have fun recycling. this is serious.
41603,Lisa,well... okay. i guess this is my destiny.
50805,Lisa,"well, i denounce thee!"
48639,Lisa,me... a tutor?
50442,Lisa,"i've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
45952,Lisa,if you ask me...
50260,Lisa,"aw, poor baby."
43703,Lisa,general washington?!
44829,Lisa,"but dad, you can't cram garbage under springfield forever."
50409,Lisa,you just ruined six months' work!
50448,Lisa,you're just pressing a mento.
41919,Lisa,what's wrong with dad?
46307,Lisa,can you take me to school? please?
50877,Lisa,i know why they're here!
50079,Lisa,"well, that depends."
47429,Lisa,you did not.
44318,Lisa,congratulations...
46652,Lisa,"mom, these are slums. the government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended."
48952,Lisa,"uh... let's think about this. martin's gone, but it was an accident. ruining our lives won't bring him back."
42383,Lisa,"oh no, it's ralph! just make some excuse."
49068,Lisa,anything?
44650,Lisa,did any one of you actually see milhouse eat the food?
44177,Lisa,but... but i'm very mature for my age. people often mistake me for nine.
47938,Lisa,"and here's the clincher... ray magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""
49393,Lisa,vance connor...
49294,Lisa,think differently... think differently... think differently... think differently...
50332,Lisa,you're out of tonic.
51156,Lisa,that's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. we start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
44452,Lisa,"stop! doesn't the bible say ""judge not lest ye be judged""?"
48704,Lisa,"gimme, gimme, gimme!"
42626,Lisa,"tsk, tsk. the remorse of the sugar junkie."
51890,Lisa,"happy, dad?"
44036,Lisa,"see, you do have a tender side. you just needed someone to bring it out."
44535,Lisa,"look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
44598,Lisa,okay. we get our room and board free anyway.
43263,Lisa,"hi, dad."
47340,Lisa,"well, dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
48970,Lisa,...whatever the heck you're doing.
51059,Lisa,i remind you of you?
50484,Lisa,"da-ad! anyway, continuing: ""for the present i will only say that this 'landowner' -- for so..."""
43259,Lisa,that's a horrible thing to say.
48844,Lisa,what do we do now?
45010,Lisa,lazy father...
45340,Lisa,"to make the world a more magical place, i guess. although they did blow over and kill some people."
45057,Lisa,look!
48587,Lisa,this is not what i wanted at all!
46700,Lisa,forget it. i'm going home.
48871,Lisa,"it's ""hoist with his own petard."""
50851,Lisa,"oh no, i've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it!"
49729,Lisa,gotcha!
51762,Lisa,i thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
42961,Lisa,"dad, i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend."
51068,Lisa,we don't have the metric system.
43201,Lisa,the death card.
52357,Lisa,"yuck. quit it, dad."
48735,Lisa,springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!
42776,Lisa,dad!
50373,Lisa,you don't open the top -- the locks are real.
52527,Lisa,"okay honey, i made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty."
52426,Lisa,"no, no. you don't understand. when mr. bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --"
51874,Lisa,wow!
43872,Lisa,i don't see any kids at all. it's like they ditched me in advance.
51648,Lisa,really bart?
44728,Lisa,"ah, they just came for the buffalo wings. but you really got through to me."
46907,Lisa,huh?
44727,Lisa,great set!
49280,Lisa,"oh, i'll never get a mapple anything."
42906,Lisa,enough with the hose!
45867,Lisa,"little vicki, i figured out how to dance. i can be in the show now!"
43250,Lisa,"dad, you're babbling."
52279,Lisa,"please, dad."
43785,Lisa,"there's something troubling me, dad...but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret."
49647,Lisa,cows eating cows?! that's an abomination!
45627,Lisa,"oh, mom. i've seen what you do around the house, and i can handle it. maybe i can even make things more efficient."
48364,Lisa,what are you drawing?
44939,Lisa,"she's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
50144,Lisa,"uh, dad? they turned you into a vampire."
49708,Lisa,"bart, you have to take him back!"
48533,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
44101,Lisa,"um, there's a hair in my soup. but i'll just eat around it."
42746,Lisa,"yeah, dad. how many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
49796,Lisa,bicentennial issue of reader's digest...
48482,Lisa,"wow mom, you made all this?"
49036,Lisa,"i've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes."
47522,Lisa,where's your costume?
43289,Lisa,that's cats.
42632,Lisa,are you hiding something from me?
46588,Lisa,grampa!
43886,Lisa,"that's my dorky little brother, bart --tholomew."
50991,Lisa,this is a pretty important decision.
49262,Lisa,well what did you think her name was before it was kennedy?
41872,Lisa,this looks good bart. take it to him.
41604,Lisa,"oh, that's so noble. but what about jenda?"
45183,Lisa,wait! we don't need supernatural powers! we already know their secrets.
45945,Lisa,"well, according to whatbadgerseat.com, ""badgers subsist primarily on a diet of stoats, voles and marmots."""
51038,Lisa,"""gorilla joe,"" ""gorilla sam,"" ""gorilla pete,"" ""ook and eek, the gorilla twins""... where did mr. burns dig up all these old wrestlers?"
49993,Lisa,"we're watching the nobel prize announcements, live from stockholm!"
47084,Lisa,"named after its discoverer, professor artemis deadly, who was ironically killed in the shower of 1853."
52038,Lisa,i wonder when dad's coming home?
44990,Lisa,it slipped.
41596,Lisa,armpit noises are not a language.
42609,Lisa,"don't worry, mr. hutz is still here to take care of us."
42474,Lisa,paper.
51140,Lisa,"mom, i found your wedding dress!"
49067,Lisa,"for you, dad -- i consider that a victory."
43451,Lisa,well?
44159,Lisa,"i know it's hard to accept, bart, but face it: sideshow bob has changed."
43422,Lisa,"mom, you fuss over us way too much."
51908,Lisa,arrrgh!
47425,Lisa,"bart, there's spiders in your hair."
43940,Lisa,the devil? what devil?
49491,Lisa,"mom, wait! maggie is the gem child! she's brought peace to our town! and reports of less road rage in shelbyville! she has to stay here!"
45070,Lisa,where'd you get that muffin?
44229,Lisa,"bart? did you stop because i said to? if so, thank you."
49956,Lisa,excuse me! is this what the framers of the constitution would want?
49155,Lisa,"well, i do owe you everything... make it quick."
47064,Lisa,i can find a good career at this museum. or at lease see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon i complained about.
46092,Lisa,"well maybe if mom didn't make such dry waffles. there, i said it!"
51225,Lisa,"'twas halloween night, with the kids door-to-dooring, and all over town blood sugar was soaring."
51559,Lisa,"so, mr. burns never realized it was maggie who saved the plant?"
42222,Lisa,"i meant because they both win all the time, mom."
48391,Lisa,"dad, all you had to do was paint one number. now no one's gonna be able to find our house."
50770,Lisa,he's in every scene.
47070,Lisa,"dad, that's a moth."
42266,Lisa,"it was the greatest movie i've ever seen in my life. and you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. dustin hoffman, michael jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
49532,Lisa,"hello, smiley face. hello, smiley face."
42143,Lisa,this award is the biggest farce i ever saw.
43227,Lisa,"mom, remember when i was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep dad from ruining it?"
41974,Lisa,"look, dad. i made a modest studio apartment for my malibu stacey doll. this is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
42876,Lisa,it hurts my teeth.
46447,Lisa,i am not gonna be taken in by all of this.
43410,Lisa,"okay, mom. anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. like those fingerprints. they could've gotten on the gun some other way."
50303,Lisa,this calls for some springfield silvertongue!
46083,Lisa,"look, the sea captain's all hunkered down."
50741,Lisa,"well, well, mr. never-wrong was right again -- family vacations always suck. i called it. called. it."
47457,Lisa,just because maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
51001,Lisa,"bart simpson, i don't know what the future holds for you..."
49232,Lisa,"grampa, everyone knows that the only real test of skill is the new york times puzzle, edited by will shortz!"
48379,Lisa,"fine, i'll beat up ralph."
46886,Lisa,bob!
48130,Lisa,"the unicorns are you and me, dad. i drew it myself."
47859,Lisa,"oops, need more soda."
51396,Lisa,get the twist?
49980,Lisa,"mom, it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture. he drives a hybrid!"
52088,Lisa,"oh, boy, ""the happy little elves meet the curious bear cub""!"
50859,Lisa,the black hole is looking a lot bigger. does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
50385,Lisa,but why?
51694,Lisa,attention goblins: madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars. and people are laying fingers all over them.
49855,Lisa,"leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning. but don't worry. your secret's safe with me. as far as mom and dad know, you're just a soulless little psycho."
46379,Lisa,"oh, poor mom and dad."
49492,Lisa,you told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
42092,Lisa,i don't know. you?
45959,Lisa,"oh, yeah? you didn't blow up maggie's room."
47119,Lisa,you're not listening!
41610,Lisa,bart's making faces!
47330,Lisa,"wait, santa's little helper had puppies before."
43427,Lisa,i don't know. they should be here.
48891,Lisa,bob planned this from the beginning --
45575,Lisa,bart broke all my books.
48289,Lisa,"no, no, it's still ""kid-napped."" the prefix applies to the victim."
49110,Lisa,"thank you, mr. jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than i do."
45813,Lisa,"boy, you can see everything from mount springfield. the squidport, the old monorail..."
48580,Lisa,maybe you killed them all.
43018,Lisa,"bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. except maybe that boy who works in the library."
45656,Lisa,will this do?
46364,Lisa,five-minutes-more-ious!
46983,Lisa,i-m-p...
44451,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
48382,Lisa,forgive me for this.
49049,Lisa,what you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
45776,Lisa,"my fellow americans, and voting illegal aliens: i will not mince words. your country needs you. that's why today i am proposing a temporary refund adjustment."
50352,Lisa,what if you just taught me one trick?
47163,Lisa,"mom, we need him for our plan."
45212,Lisa,"the first episode was just a pilot, dad. producers fiddle with shows all the time. they change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
44109,Lisa,bart!
45001,Lisa,surprise!
41661,Lisa,"oh my god, i was wrong! and by being corrected, i learned! and no one cared about my feelings!"
50978,Lisa,"so, how's the studying going?"
51722,Lisa,i'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.
43150,Lisa,"yeah, dad was right."
44333,Lisa,"hey, it was all a coincidence!"
47037,Lisa,why don't we go to our congressman?
51576,Lisa,are you guys okay?
51375,Lisa,no thanks.
51263,Lisa,"oh my god, you found a loophole! why don't you just put this much inventiveness into your work?"
49426,Lisa,"fine, but i wish you'd picked an easier theme than ""super-jet dinosaur fun-monkeys."" what does that even mean?"
49422,Lisa,the test is almost over and i haven't done a thing. i've blown my whole future.
45277,Lisa,"mom, i don't feel so good."
42070,Lisa,all right! a test!
42488,Lisa,it's all so barbaric.
50033,Lisa,sure is cold in here.
46350,Lisa,that's not a tall tale. it's a book by mark twain.
47105,Lisa,hello... hold on.
50795,Lisa,"please, i've had enough attention for one day!"
52199,Lisa,dad!
42358,Lisa,"all right, mom. i promise you will never be billed for another call. bobby sherman..."
45091,Lisa,what? nunchuks? those aren't even australian.
47493,Lisa,"maggie, i'm sorry i was jealous of your special gift. from now on i'm gonna nurture and cherish--"
51018,Lisa,i get it. middle child. never do what i want.
45749,Lisa,"ah, something troubles me about indian gaming. on the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes..."
42756,Lisa,they're having a great time and i'm stuck in here.
44361,Lisa,"i am just calling home, i am not asking to come home."
49552,Lisa,"i've never been called ""fierce"" before. ""strident..."" ""hectoring"" has been tossed around..."
46190,Lisa,"you like malibu stacey, too?"
42915,Lisa,ren and stimpy do it all the time.
48303,Lisa,forget it.
49605,Lisa,"mom, isn't that book the bible of right-wing losers?"
41871,Lisa,we're gonna hit him where it hurts. right in the judaica.
50104,Lisa,"okay, everyone study two-out situations, count management, and i'll be back with some gluten-free crackers."
45042,Lisa,"whoaaa, daaad!"
42404,Lisa,"well, can it?"
41958,Lisa,that is so sad.
43001,Lisa,"hello. ""we're here."" ""hi."" etc."
45911,Lisa,"folks, we're just having a little family tiff. if you'll just bear with us..."
51801,Lisa,i think we might just make a good team. like maggie and grampa.
45857,Lisa,why?
45211,Lisa,"that's not really you, dad. he's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name."
42157,Lisa,"no, dad. you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty. and with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
49660,Lisa,this is the best hiding place. they'll never find me.
46685,Lisa,"well, it delivers what it promises."
42267,Lisa,sorry bart.
43951,Lisa,oooh! aaah! ohhh!
42868,Lisa,"uh! hey, sara! well, i gotta go. i have to practice for band auditions."
46891,Lisa,i can't believe you went to the movies with the teacher. what happened to the bart simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?
50154,Lisa,what could've happened?
52511,Lisa,maybe my mom would have some ideas...
47643,Lisa,"nice work, bart! but give him a runny nose. i want the readers to gag on their morning cup of joe."
42125,Lisa,"yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
51971,Lisa,"but mom, can't i... stay a little longer?"
43345,Lisa,no! it was bleeding gums murphy.
44305,Lisa,you guys shouldn't laugh at him. mr. burns has changed. he's different now.
47542,Lisa,you're a great mom. you were always there for bart with love and support. his acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
44489,Lisa,fully. we have to go now.
47438,Lisa,"look, just because milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend."
48288,Lisa,she looks like she's crying.
45522,Lisa,"mom, make him stop."
42955,Lisa,"awww, look at that cute little baby axe."
50172,Lisa,should i get the nurse?
50012,Lisa,it can't be saturday already! monday was orientation. tuesday we did mime.
47387,Lisa,i'm gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.
50106,Lisa,hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
47034,Lisa,"dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?"
49037,Lisa,"hey dad, that's the singer you used to manage!"
43739,Lisa,"yes, well, technically everything worked out all right. but..."
43405,Lisa,this suit burns better. look.
52096,Lisa,finally!
47845,Lisa,"listen, people!"
42294,Lisa,i think you should do a new ad. one that's fresh and original.
47713,Lisa,"sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six..."
46589,Lisa,"look grampa, you're already getting a new neighbor."
46396,Lisa,can we go to bed now?
46180,Lisa,that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
51624,Lisa,"dad, you're eating too much! i'm worried about your health! i don't wanna lose you!"
45421,Lisa,what are you doing here?
45974,Lisa,"no, i think they're protesters."
50126,Lisa,"it's the most exciting play in baseball! go, bart!"
52143,Lisa,there were monsters on that ship. and truly we were them.
50181,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i don't really play."
44902,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. and just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
46754,Lisa,"dad, it's a blackout."
51312,Lisa,that isn't a word.
45442,Lisa,"look, there's the imperial gardens... the meiji shrine... the hello kitty factory..."
50815,Lisa,i'll do anything but sing!
45753,Lisa,the country is broke? how can that be?
50740,Lisa,"and dad donated something, too."
43032,Lisa,grades are all i have. what could i be failing? i'm smart and a teacher's pet.
45916,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
50170,Lisa,willie!
43089,Lisa,that's what i assumed.
47578,Lisa,"well, it looks like everything worked out just fine for everybody."
47469,Lisa,"uh, well i..."
49899,Lisa,/ what's going on?
50487,Lisa,"well, it means that you can communicate!"
48691,Lisa,you already promised you would.
48105,Lisa,"if you don't tell mom what you did, i will."
46188,Lisa,"they're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. but it might work."
50660,Lisa,yes i did. now i'm going to bed.
49603,Lisa,"well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine."
49124,Lisa,i hear noises coming from the kitchen!
45674,Lisa,"dad, you only took one course."
47682,Lisa,"mom, a letter from ovenfresh industries!"
51728,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
47594,Lisa,"and now please welcome the elvis of enlightenment... the lean, serene, chanting machine: the dalai lama!"
48359,Lisa,what're you playing?
42623,Lisa,"well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. may i suggest ""good-natured doormat?"""
50838,Lisa,can't dad take bart while we seek out culture?
43560,Lisa,more like pre-school.
45651,Lisa,"i really thought i could handle this, but..."
50193,Lisa,mr. burns? where's he going?
52163,Lisa,"i can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. there's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy."
42887,Lisa,i don't need a card. you live in the room next to me.
51857,Lisa,"not i.d., dad. id. it's a word."
51060,Lisa,this class doesn't give demerits.
44025,Lisa,"i feel so stupid, mom. nelson's not right for me at all. and i don't think he ever will be."
48192,Lisa,"see? s'fine. go on, go on with the thing."
45331,Lisa,"dad, i really need to rest my back."
43673,Lisa,"uh, no."
44495,Lisa,why would a motorboat have a mast?
50109,Lisa,you disobeyed your manager!
48098,Lisa,"if you two don't mind, i'd like to watch that cool fox show about teenagers in orange county."
42381,Lisa,good.
45017,Lisa,"dad, those should be your millions."
49459,Lisa,i fell in love with you / heart and soul...
41638,Lisa,"uh-oh. should i laugh? was that dry british wit? or subtle self-pity? ooh, they're staring at me, better respond."
44509,Lisa,"oh, my goodness."
45451,Lisa,yipee! time for the company loyalty song!
41763,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
48649,Lisa,"well it's nice to see you again, krusty, but these kids have field trip journals to write!"
46214,Lisa,i believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
51277,Lisa,they sell your posters...workout dvds...and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.
52189,Lisa,embrace nothingness.
51098,Lisa,"mr. burns, i came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. and the man i'm looking for would help me find the truth."
49309,Lisa,"oh mom, it's perfect!"
49331,Lisa,"lower your expectations, lisa. public program, public program..."
44393,Lisa,we're here!
43841,Lisa,"shh, mom. dad needs our support."
44691,Lisa,the project! i forgot all about it!
42330,Lisa,hardly. i'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
52014,Lisa,here's your birthday breakfast!
51135,Lisa,those are bedbugs!
49816,Lisa,i'll never know if eliza got virgil safely to freedom!
42576,Lisa,"nope. it says right there, school bus."
49154,Lisa,"oh no, the northern irish are also having a parade!"
47069,Lisa,"oh dad, look at this one!"
48025,Lisa,i feel so much empathy for those villagers. they had to drink their own tears...
44418,Lisa,"look, mama!"
49097,Lisa,this is it! my premiere!
48060,Lisa,stop scaring me!
52210,Lisa,"it's not yours, bart! this is family glue!"
43564,Lisa,"all right, we don't need the dryer."
49904,Lisa,"dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
50698,Lisa,why would you want to banish us from springfield?
45503,Lisa,"uh, dad?"
45463,Lisa,you've really done it this time.
45321,Lisa,"eh, slave labor. you get what you pay for."
49288,Lisa,it's a gift from mapple!
41930,Lisa,yes.
45790,Lisa,"you know something, bart? you're right. my lack of coolness is really holding america back."
47566,Lisa,those horn-dogs -- they ditched us again! you know what this means?
51422,Lisa,what? a rule's a rule.
47629,Lisa,he's got a tree in his eye!
43748,Lisa,i still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom work.
49822,Lisa,wait. all that was in the recipe?
42833,Lisa,time's up?!
44652,Lisa,object-objection! he's not asking any questions!
48073,Lisa,is it the chair?
51254,Lisa,"i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it. milhouse?"
48853,Lisa,"oh, milhouse! you're very brave."
42094,Lisa,stupid hoover... thinks she's so smart.
50513,Lisa,this is the funnest game ever!
46832,Lisa,because you've already done it once.
45618,Lisa,"so hard, but so rewarding... downhill skiers missing fun... oh, who am i kidding?"
45647,Lisa,"dad, i gave you a list!"
48106,Lisa,enough with the tricks!
49387,Lisa,"""...unfortunately, it is not what we're looking for at this time. thank you for thinking of us."""
46097,Lisa,i always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
43569,Lisa,how did you survive?
51306,Lisa,franklin roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the new deal...
50537,Lisa,gift shop!
51911,Lisa,keep your greasy mitts outta there.
50630,Lisa,can i join you?
45555,Lisa,"mom, no! everyone at school picks on the ""pöpli"" kids. even i do. i just hate them so much."
51968,Lisa,okay.
43497,Lisa,"oh, apu! it's beautiful!"
49231,Lisa,"probably, but a cruciverbalist is a fan of crossword puzzles -- which i am!"
47511,Lisa,"oh god, oh god. oh nooo. if i don't make it out alive, i love you, mom and dad. maggie, you can have my books. and bart, i'll see you in hell, you booger-eating wuss. that's right, we all know!"
41955,Lisa,ariel.
41978,Lisa,i think so.
44713,Lisa,"yeah... huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!"
47964,Lisa,"nicely done, wind-dancer. but seriously, cruelty to animals is no laughing matter. you can make a difference!"
50906,Lisa,what are you talking about?
47986,Lisa,"but dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people."
47028,Lisa,"well, i'm all set. i'm gonna be following the latest designs from modern sandcastle magazine."
51087,Lisa,grampa's story was true?
46298,Lisa,just like me!
42039,Lisa,bart's making faces.
41812,Lisa,"uh, maybe i should be going. i caught you at a bad time."
46187,Lisa,"well, lots of people like jazz fusion..."
50395,Lisa,a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. it's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
51316,Lisa,my new best friend isn't what i thought. she's a... republican.
48276,Lisa,"well, my best recollection of burns' paraphrasing of what he read in moe's letter is that krabappel told moe..."
48044,Lisa,"i get it. every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right! that's when they ask for your money."
43689,Lisa,i'm not going to give up. i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
49269,Lisa,"dad, i know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the new york times crossword puzzle?"
46883,Lisa,no.
50073,Lisa,can i hold your hand... for balance?
49819,Lisa,"martha, you are the best."
42250,Lisa,it's not working.
44490,Lisa,why is that woman still living here?
52368,Lisa,"mom, what will we do if santa's little helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school?"
51988,Lisa,"we're playing ""what's that odor?""."
49023,Lisa,"all right, that's enough!"
51668,Lisa,this whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation.
44794,Lisa,"they call her the cat lady. people say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. but can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
45389,Lisa,"dad, stop kidding around. look, they printed my letter."
50924,Lisa,not sure what your motivation for that is.
46230,Lisa,"the bully has caught my scent, and she's at maximum rage. professor frink?"
49195,Lisa,the real bart would've thrown me out the window.
49516,Lisa,we know it was you selma bouvier.
46541,Lisa,"dad, you've gotta do something."
43365,Lisa,"mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
44961,Lisa,"okay, girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats..."
44262,Lisa,no.
45741,Lisa,i hope they're hover-bikes.
47269,Lisa,they made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
48884,Lisa,you never ask what we've been up to. we went to the strawberry patch and i picked the most strawberries!
46749,Lisa,"""screamapillar care tips."" wow, look at all this stuff. ""without constant reassurance, it will die. it's sexually attracted to fire..."""
52002,Lisa,the answers to deep theological questions..
45044,Lisa,gee!
49957,Lisa,how many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
42633,Lisa,"judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named mindy... or a man named andy."
44536,Lisa,"ugh, i wish i'd never found those stupid bones! it's time to put an end to this. bart, i'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
46937,Lisa,"oh dad, you do remember something about me. perhaps you also remember this laser bart gave me earlier!"
51357,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
49149,Lisa,"okay, i'll do the monologue."
49008,Lisa,i've gotten better since this morning. how could that have happened?
51901,Lisa,"no, dad! please don't pawn the tv!"
43591,Lisa,he's getting away!
48274,Lisa,treasure?!
50768,Lisa,"dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the christian faith. and although i personally follow the enlightened teachings of lord buddha, messing with jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a florida state jersey to a florida game."
42913,Lisa,"hey, ralph. want to come with me and allison to play anagrams?"
46373,Lisa,"bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry. even if you never become a great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother."
44179,Lisa,"but i'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
44482,Lisa,"well, i know you don't want to disappoint dad, but how do you feel about lying to him?"
49715,Lisa,oh no! you took too long to make an obvious decision!
52182,Lisa,"hi, mrs. norton."
44711,Lisa,dear log: my worst fears have been confirmed. i've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. what will my life be like after i descend into mediocrity?
43064,Lisa,"no,me!takeme!me!me!me!"
49033,Lisa,"sir, i didn't get this ""skepticism"" merit badge falling for promises like that."
49263,Lisa,i'm through with crosswords! my innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes.
49381,Lisa,danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop.
47889,Lisa,it's so embarrassing mom is making us wear clothes from goodwill.
47488,Lisa,air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and i'll never run into my family here! it's the perfect place to start a new life.
48492,Lisa,speak.
47201,Lisa,just for that?
43368,Lisa,as long as it's constitutional.
47552,Lisa,baaaaaart!
44577,Lisa,"run, mom!"
45642,Lisa,"bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!"
48678,Lisa,duffman's on a date with booberella!
47966,Lisa,i can't believe i used to date him.
46829,Lisa,the bus!
43029,Lisa,that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. what if the weatherman is wrong?
42331,Lisa,really?
46193,Lisa,"milhouse? she got you, too?"
50715,Lisa,looks like dad's not coming.
51227,Lisa,then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...
42116,Lisa,i guess that executive stress ball we got him for christmas isn't working.
42165,Lisa,"don't patronize me, doctor."
45793,Lisa,"please, calm down. we can work something out."
49635,Lisa,"well, i didn't kill mrs. krabappel!"
41809,Lisa,"mr. lincoln, my name is lisa simpson, and i have a problem."
48306,Lisa,i know who donald trump is.
43144,Lisa,it's a pony.
43332,Lisa,but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do.
51866,Lisa,"yeah, dad. you can do it!"
47312,Lisa,this is even worse than you think -- look!
52341,Lisa,"i want to go on a pony ride, unky herb."
44337,Lisa,play dead!
49213,Lisa,ow.
51108,Lisa,today you were truly a hero. thank you.
52490,Lisa,"actually, terrence, this is a synthetic substance. devised for zombie vegans, or ""zegans."""
47537,Lisa,uh-oh.
52208,Lisa,why do i get the feeling that someday i'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
41740,Lisa,"how's it going, bart?"
49447,Lisa,where's maggie?
45182,Lisa,nelson.
49870,Lisa,schnell! schnell!
51243,Lisa,"'cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins!"
44693,Lisa,it's a pig!
45584,Lisa,i don't understand. i could swear it was right here.
43792,Lisa,"mom, dad threw his beer can at the miracle gro guy on tv. can i recycle it?"
46455,Lisa,"lord, i'm not turning my back on you. i just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
47032,Lisa,they must have moved the flight paths over our house.
52425,Lisa,"when i fall asleep, mr. bergstrom is the last thing i think of, and he's my first thought when i wake up."
50883,Lisa,more importantly it's a college fund...
52400,Lisa,"forgive us, dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."
42614,Lisa,i'm going to have my wedding here.
46375,Lisa,creative sentencing is common these days. that's why bill clinton is our new mailman.
48009,Lisa,"bart, you look worse than aunt patty in the morning. and there ain't nothin' looks worse than aunt patty in the morning."
44701,Lisa,grampa!
48407,Lisa,"they're making us learn creation theory in school. today we had a test, and every answer was ""god did it."""
46992,Lisa,"really? it won't be the same without you, dad."
52349,Lisa,hello there. do you miss the antarctic?
44307,Lisa,"wow, even i didn't know he was so committed to recycling! see? i told you mr. burns has changed. see?"
46778,Lisa,hip hip...
42407,Lisa,"please don't leave me, george."
43408,Lisa,"hey, chief wiggum, what are you doing? what's going on?"
52053,Lisa,goodbye adil. have a nice trip.
46268,Lisa,dr. bushwell!
45247,Lisa,deal.
43486,Lisa,"i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to my room."
51267,Lisa,i know the answer. i'm gonna force you to turn yourself in.
42058,Lisa,"i knew it. all right, bart, who's your girlfriend?"
51091,Lisa,but could bart have gotten those eggs?
50004,Lisa,huh?
47759,Lisa,"mom, that was incredible!"
43346,Lisa,saxophone! he was a jazz musician.
45756,Lisa,"let him up, please."
45086,Lisa,"no, but i enjoy the smell."
47126,Lisa,"oh, it looks like a happy sheep."
51303,Lisa,"it's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!"
50830,Lisa,we're not having a baby!
48395,Lisa,"well, talk to me in a week."
42113,Lisa,"uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
46003,Lisa,"hot thai soup! ohhh, bart... ""dear lisa. you rock! mom is calling rescue agencies. dad is building a giant ladder, but it is of poor quality. we miss you, bart."" awww."
52492,Lisa,garden brains.
47442,Lisa,bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd. no one calls me a nerd.
43807,Lisa,no! old people deserve our respect! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn. you wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
50701,Lisa,"it's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, wikileaks is right over there."
45714,Lisa,you read my letter?
42286,Lisa,"good luck in your trumped-up law suit, dad."
45131,Lisa,"well, if you're gonna cover this up, i'll just have to go over your head to super--"
47789,Lisa,"dad, that could explode!"
43342,Lisa,"that's maggie again, grampa."
49873,Lisa,"krusty, i've been meaning to ask, what are you doing on this tour?"
46686,Lisa,how's your company gonna make money? do you have a business model?
45240,Lisa,dad! don't you remember? it's our special saturday.
46596,Lisa,"oh, that was lucky."
45329,Lisa,it's the rapture. and i never knew true love.
43299,Lisa,oh no. strike?
41859,Lisa,"krusty, please continue."
48229,Lisa,"willie? i hope i'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
51525,Lisa,that's what heroes do.
43210,Lisa,that's the book i need. you'll probably take forever with it too.
52456,Lisa,as am i.
46884,Lisa,it still beats disney's california adventure.
46494,Lisa,"here, clip-clop. here pony, pony."
44250,Lisa,"oh, um, i'm sorry. can you hold on, please... hello?"
49863,Lisa,"uh-oh, looks like i'm in more trouble. born to be bad."
46410,Lisa,how is the feast of twelve delights with triple happiness sauce?
49923,Lisa,"no, no, you'll like it. it's about the ocean."
42655,Lisa,"wake up, dad! wake up! there was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
49414,Lisa,how did i do?
42731,Lisa,how about me?
45253,Lisa,"it guarantees all of the basic freedoms -- speech, religion, the right to a speedy trial..."
51779,Lisa,"that's so sad. maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to..."
47111,Lisa,"silver bells, silver bells..."
47266,Lisa,"well, i don't feel like it now."
48087,Lisa,where am i?
52126,Lisa,"sorry... sorry bart. sorry, mom... sorry maggie... sorry lisa."
46156,Lisa,"l.t., thank god you're here! the government's putting subliminal messages in your videos!"
42171,Lisa,"i feel like i'm gonna die, bart."
51809,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
42848,Lisa,"look, it's the telescope i won at the optics festival."
45622,Lisa,but they were trying to eat me!
44542,Lisa,"well, there you go. i hope you all learned a val--"
43715,Lisa,i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and...

47262,Lisa,"and then, as school president, i don't have to take the hearing test."
41867,Lisa,"excuse us, rabbi krustofsky?"
50311,Lisa,it was wrong of me to play goddess!
47125,Lisa,"thanks for making me feel better about this place, luke."

49757,Lisa,"please, at least try the tennis game."
51456,Lisa,"well... there is something i should have told you. you see, it occurred to me that if i can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't i modify... me!"
45175,Lisa,"ooh, ""the game of lent."""
45284,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to go to a new age store just for me. i know you think this stuff is stupid."
41783,Lisa,"yes, mom."
43416,Lisa,stop! don't shoot my dad! he's innocent. he wouldn't hurt a fly!
42527,Lisa,"hey bart, if we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with krusty, it might get his career going again."
42054,Lisa,is it that exchange student mx!pa?
46554,Lisa,their periodic table has two hundred and fifty elements!
43733,Lisa,and soon.
41726,Lisa,isn't it obvious? we've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
42291,Lisa,old man winter!

52525,Lisa,"oh right, it's dr. seuss's birthday."
42962,Lisa,"dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
44129,Lisa,good-bye shary bobbins!
51050,Lisa,"well, while you're grading so generously... here's mine."
42980,Lisa,i thought this was a secret ballot.
43455,Lisa,with the change in my piggy bank.
44118,Lisa,you know her?
43716,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was... jebediah was... great. i, um, just wanted to say that i've done some research and, uh, he was great."
51919,Lisa,forget it.
44704,Lisa,dear log: can it be true? do all simpsons go through a process of dumbening?
42021,Lisa,"yeah, i did."
45351,Lisa,their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.
43605,Lisa,"hey, i thought krusty was jewish..."
43627,Lisa,do i have to go? that country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
45307,Lisa,"come on, mom, let's take it for a test drive."
51816,Lisa,charles m. schulz.
48993,Lisa,so what happened?
51719,Lisa,"well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-saharan african music, but the rest will have to wait. bart, bart, i hear mom sobbing and i don't know where dad is!"
45936,Lisa,"oh, snorky..."
52095,Lisa,"come on, come on."
51484,Lisa,"dad, give me your phone. i need to look at the pictures again!"
46735,Lisa,what are you guys doing?
50212,Lisa,huh. it's a pigeon.
47951,Lisa,i know how we can raise money!
49753,Lisa,"all right, it's all hooked up."
43155,Lisa,"come on, shampoo! you can do it!"
49825,Lisa,"my black history month presentation is called ""the simpsons: the first family of freedom."""
41587,Lisa,"if you have to guess, guess ""b."""
51423,Lisa,i saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
47740,Lisa,miasmas!

48563,Lisa,"thank you, thank you, thank you!"
43522,Lisa,"bart, don't you realize what this means? the next time we fall asleep we could die!"
42531,Lisa,you mean those diet milkshakes?
46377,Lisa,"granted. but you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for bart. he might even make the honor roll, if dad can control his night terrors."
51912,Lisa,it's mrs. hoover's birthday!
46300,Lisa,"we've been spinning for hours! i've got to get to my school and hand in linguo. oh, but i don't want to leave you."

45830,Lisa,"dad, what do we do?!"
41669,Lisa,focus!
47795,Lisa,"this must be the ""nasty surprise"" he mentioned in the invitation."
42308,Lisa,bart.
50886,Lisa,are you playing poker with my college fund?
43437,Lisa,they're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. i wish i could tell them how much i miss them.
49376,Lisa,"so the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised."
51861,Lisa,he's the bullfighter.
41989,Lisa,"boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
42844,Lisa,sorry. i just came to see how you were feeling.
43129,Lisa,daaad!
45471,Lisa,you'll see...
47395,Lisa,maybe you should let dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
51920,Lisa,tell me more.
46525,Lisa,"that's okay, mom. today's law schools are churning out two point one lawyers for every person in america. look."
49902,Lisa,dad! i found what you're looking for!
45533,Lisa,"where are we going, dad?"
45116,Lisa,keep the change.
41969,Lisa,the police will catch you sooner or later.
46249,Lisa,"i know, but..."
47463,Lisa,i already have one of those.
50433,Lisa,so how come we have all these other keys?
50213,Lisa,the poor guy hurt his wing.
46974,Lisa,ow! indian burn!
48054,Lisa,i see mom!
44856,Lisa,may i have that seat?
46222,Lisa,"my study is entitled ""airborne pheromones and aggression in bullies""."
44584,Lisa,"you like musicals, don't you dad?"
49483,Lisa,look who's here!
50400,Lisa,"bart, i am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest."
50736,Lisa,i don't think shauna should choose any of you. shauna should choose shauna.
42196,Lisa,everybody was cheering for you.
43890,Lisa,"no. no, i heard it on ""baywatch."""
46478,Lisa,"well, they do smell good..."
50063,Lisa,"mr. zuckerberg, i'm lisa, and this is nelson."
44969,Lisa,"i don't want a date! and i don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! am i the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""the mclaughlin group?"""
50049,Lisa,"i will. i'll take a chance on you, nelson muntz."
42986,Lisa,"no, bart, don't you see? dead people can't vote!"
44981,Lisa,"ah. what am i doing? this isn't me. i'm sorry, milhouse."
42807,Lisa,"maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
44125,Lisa,shh. tv.
44295,Lisa,ha! i'd never help you. you're the worst man in the world.
50684,Lisa,but grampa...
44967,Lisa,"what's ""d.m.y.""?"
50777,Lisa,"what?! ""least popular?"" i gotta go."
46692,Lisa,"come on, guys. we're gonna be late."
44952,Lisa,"hm, don't give it a second thought. i didn't."
46441,Lisa,you know it is.
45244,Lisa,no! the smithsonian traveling exhibit.
45375,Lisa,oh! ... on the radio.
46128,Lisa,oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
47001,Lisa,i'm a little tired.
49210,Lisa,it's not a pedal boat. it's a pedal car that bart drove into the river. because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
46492,Lisa,"thanks, mom. hey, where's my pony?"
46798,Lisa,"and you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the olive garden."
51176,Lisa,what is it? what is it? what is it?
46398,Lisa,"hunting? dad, no!"
43514,Lisa,like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
45176,Lisa,"fine. we'll play ""hippo in the house."""
49083,Lisa,"my family. ...language, rhythm and spectacle."
46296,Lisa,as in monk?
48932,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
46792,Lisa,i had no idea disco stu was so complex.
52330,Lisa,da-ad!...
51074,Lisa,ms. cantwell! wait!
46750,Lisa,top suspects?
48510,Lisa,because i suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.
47807,Lisa,i'm not inferring anything. you infer. i imply.
51723,Lisa,bart! you know you can't open a present till mom and dad wake up!
45955,Lisa,i'm so conflicted.
48978,Lisa,where is this music coming from?
42937,Lisa,that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
42276,Lisa,bart! the winfields didn't have a son.
42229,Lisa,"my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place!"
49667,Lisa,"well i'm glad you're not ""witches."" wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me."
49498,Lisa,dunkilderry is so quaint! it looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.
49425,Lisa,hooray! i'm a brainy outcast again!
47989,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. you were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business."
48826,Lisa,dad? where are you?
51821,Lisa,"dad, do you have anything i can eat?"
50355,Lisa,and george washington took a trip down the...ear-y canal!
48738,Lisa,"corn... more corn... another kid getting' thrown in the air... witch's coven... seattle space needle... amateur production of ""you can't take it with you""... i'm getting dizzy... and corn again."
41988,Lisa,"...three, two, one..."
46647,Lisa,"look, it's the giant statue of christ on corcovado."
44331,Lisa,it's a videotape!
42349,Lisa,"bart, quit it, bart. quit it, quit it, quit it!"
47282,Lisa,but this is my dream.
52420,Lisa,"yes, but i didn't do it."
43812,Lisa,"by your logic, i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
42423,Lisa,"i propose to determine the answer to the question: ""is my brother dumber than a hamster?"""
48255,Lisa,i understand.
48705,Lisa,no.
46956,Lisa,and there are so many places to cloister myself!
48839,Lisa,can i weld that?
43166,Lisa,"uh-oh. bart, you better talk to mom and dad about this."
41986,Lisa,uh-huh.
46892,Lisa,and you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
47846,Lisa,"how can you stand there eating snacks and being children, when the world's glaciers are vanishing?"
49427,Lisa,did you remember to disconnect it first?
47873,Lisa,"aww, bart, i missed your lies... and i was kind of a pill. i guess."
43217,Lisa,i'd love to. can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
52475,Lisa,"my daughter thinks i'm a ruthless tyrant, like hitler or prince harry."
48552,Lisa,what's wrong?
43429,Lisa,that was a baby tooth... it was loose...
42777,Lisa,"dad, feline means cat."
46617,Lisa,"you are the true dauphin. you had this impostor try to fool me, to see if i was truly sent by god."
46671,Lisa,"but seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years."
50087,Lisa,"what, you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team?"
49617,Lisa,two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
44945,Lisa,"careful, now. nobody likes a showoff."
52000,Lisa,"ready for inspection, mom."
49612,Lisa,"someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. this goes against every feminist bone in my body, but dad, can't you control your woman?"
45785,Lisa,"ooh, but bart could screw everything up..."
50124,Lisa,no! the computer says it's statistically impossible!
51017,Lisa,"you know mom, i was thinking we could take maggie downtown. ""the jazz hole"" is featuring a dizzy gillespie tribute band. their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks..."
42150,Lisa,"and while on ventnor avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa. a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
46357,Lisa,soyghetti-o's!
42337,Lisa,five... six... seven... eight...
47236,Lisa,i can't believe nelson is more popular than me.
51995,Lisa,you are?
50992,Lisa,someone's smitten.
49530,Lisa,"well, off to school where they'll prepare our little minds for a future we'll never see."
52460,Lisa,i want candy!
45631,Lisa,"you know, the reason for the hat..."
50045,Lisa,"ooh, what's this?"
47941,Lisa,oh my god! look at these ingredients!
49227,Lisa,"cocoa! ""ice rink drink!"""
43563,Lisa,there. now no one should be able to hear us.
48525,Lisa,but... i deserve... acknowledgement...
50748,Lisa,this group is adapting children's classics for the stage to entertain generations of survivors.
51402,Lisa,i don't know. it wasn't like dad was stealing for himself. he created this wonderful experience for the whole town. i just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
42384,Lisa,now ralph is in this play with me. i just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
45510,Lisa,"hold the funeral, poindexter."
44922,Lisa,hey!
47750,Lisa,i didn't cushion your...
47728,Lisa,that was you.
41606,Lisa,lisa... lisa simpson...
47805,Lisa,what a classy way to get drunk off your asses
45076,Lisa,you might as well. you already made up a phony film credit.
52303,Lisa,"well, don't you remember the eighth commandment?"
44050,Lisa,"well, i guess this is it..."
48797,Lisa,"hi, dad."
50619,Lisa,but he's out of his mind -- he can't run for president!
50738,Lisa,"face it, we're just kids. we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. all we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
46265,Lisa,greenpeace?
41778,Lisa,"wait, dad!"
44342,Lisa,can i go downstairs and see what dad's doing?
44514,Lisa,it could be anything. it could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
45824,Lisa,"some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
50146,Lisa,didn't there used to be more texxon stations?
45893,Lisa,shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
48292,Lisa,"hey, i know how we can save bart."
47224,Lisa,"dad, i'm just as sad as you are. what happened to grandma is an outrage."
47278,Lisa,"if we stand together, we are strong!"
48780,Lisa,"oh bart, you fall for that every six months."
42367,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
44302,Lisa,there's a can.
44019,Lisa,touché.
44459,Lisa,that would have made a lot more sense.
49157,Lisa,melvin van horne... sideshow mel?! it's you! how could this happen to you... to all these wonderful performers?
50069,Lisa,i used grampa's money to try to help someone in need. but it didn't go the way i expected.
43230,Lisa,"mom, picture phone."
46065,Lisa,"mom, you're missing a great show."
52089,Lisa,but i want to see what happens.
42940,Lisa,"ah, your first kiss."
50818,Lisa,i was small inside and lacking pride...
49754,Lisa,i've never seen mr. burns this happy.
46075,Lisa,what did he look like?
48529,Lisa,"oh, moe."
50829,Lisa,meaningless friend thing.
43396,Lisa,"well, i don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
41732,Lisa,"i think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and i hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
42424,Lisa,remarkable.
52221,Lisa,baaart! you're wrecking it! let go! i worked forever on this!
49615,Lisa,"dad, i keep telling you, that won't work."
47489,Lisa,lousy maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows...
42548,Lisa,"no, someone who didn't deserve it."
41964,Lisa,"how do you mean, dad?"
44566,Lisa,"sorry, daddy."
44463,Lisa,"can you help me get my ball down from the roof, dad?"
48406,Lisa,all i'm saying is--
49885,Lisa,bart! that pop tart wasn't locally farmed or sourced!
49849,Lisa,congratulations. you're officially a sociopath.
42269,Lisa,uh... i think it needs a little padding.
48277,Lisa,"my pearl necklace! i must have lost it, and you were just bringing it back to me."
44349,Lisa,they're discussing poetry! oh! we never do that at my school!
46913,Lisa,"dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. it's too late."
49411,Lisa,"woo-hoo! test day at last! now i can show off at a federal level. hey bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about ""manifest destiny?"""
48632,Lisa,what kind of lunch is this? a drawing of a sandwich?
47137,Lisa,sister?! you mean she's not your girlfriend?
44081,Lisa,wait!
46994,Lisa,well how often is that gonna come up?
41632,Lisa,poor predictable bart. always takes rock.
45108,Lisa,"brown, brown, brown..."
51327,Lisa,cakey or gooey?
46845,Lisa,bart!
49682,Lisa,"zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! i curse you, hell's kitten!"
52030,Lisa,"frightened, bart? welcome to stage three: fear."
47672,Lisa,"mr. flanders, why are you moving?"
52455,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom, we request the pleasure of your company... no... mr. bergstrom, if you're not doing anything this friday... no... mr. bergstrom, do you like pork chops... oh no, of course you wouldn't..."
50240,Lisa,don't worry about that. i love meat and i always will.
52267,Lisa,"dad, may i please make an observation?"
44449,Lisa,"if they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?"
48310,Lisa,suicide?!
49551,Lisa,one of you said something bad about the other.
49741,Lisa,me! me! me! me! me!
45928,Lisa,you're probably right.
41605,Lisa,"so nelson, who did you end up bringing tonight? sherri or terri?"
45689,Lisa,mom! bart's making faces at me. i think.
44284,Lisa,hmm. you've never heard of recycling? it means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
44583,Lisa,he's dreamy.
44256,Lisa,now you're making your own alcohol? that's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
46723,Lisa,i'll see you tomorrow!
51534,Lisa,"all right, you're hurt. i understand. but when i made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. you became the hero i thought you could be, dad."
44380,Lisa,yes! you thought i couldn't but i could i did! and i could do it again let's do it again!
42921,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
47178,Lisa,"dad, maybe you could lead bart's tribe."
45030,Lisa,"that never happened, dad."
50113,Lisa,i don't know... yes.
52249,Lisa,"please, before you do anything, there's someone i'd like you to talk to."
45969,Lisa,what a waste...
41803,Lisa,an early crusader for women's rights. she led the floormop rebellion of 1910. later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece.
42721,Lisa,excuse me. miss lovell? i'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy.
47193,Lisa,and yet i'm still not satisfied.
46722,Lisa,non-dairy?
49636,Lisa,"yeah, ding-dong-ditch!"
44723,Lisa,like you!!
51256,Lisa,now the class nerd. milhouse?
45995,Lisa,"well, this looks like a good place to set up camp."
44912,Lisa,what a weird looking vacuum cleaner.
51255,Lisa,"now, the smartest kid. milhouse?"
45398,Lisa,"you want me to join mensa? oh, that's wonderful. but don't i have to take some sort of i.q. test?"
50135,Lisa,i love your pallor.
43377,Lisa,i'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. we've got a really great instructor lined up...
43653,Lisa,oh my god! krusty's shoes!
52054,Lisa,"look, mom. there he is."
49571,Lisa,"hi, caitlin."
50546,Lisa,of course you're real! everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. how could that be made up?!
44131,Lisa,"sure, we love it! but how can we watch tv when it's so beautiful out?"
43781,Lisa,"i knew it! i knew it because why would they have our national grammar rodeo in another nation?! oh, bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
51493,Lisa,i hear chewing!
50456,Lisa,how did this bookshelf get here so fast? i bet it's shoddy.
46658,Lisa,"okay, on this map i marked all the places that ronaldo liked to go. if we split up, we should be able to search them all."
48000,Lisa,"i'm sorry i hurt you, but please don't be sad / you're no longer my coach, but you're always my dad..."
44582,Lisa,"did you get ""emma?"" did you get ""emma?"" did ya? did ya? did ya? huh?"
43394,Lisa,look at burns' suit. yeesh.
46730,Lisa,i guess we won't be biking through italy.
48578,Lisa,yum-yum fish?
50970,Lisa,"dad, there are lights following us!"
46332,Lisa,i've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
43054,Lisa,"okay. then i'm going to start kicking air like this. and if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault."
46311,Lisa,"first place, here i come. look out!"
43779,Lisa,"thanks, dad. oh, this has been the best spring break ever!"
43070,Lisa,no.
49646,Lisa,"it was an accident, i swear!"
42599,Lisa,grampa's a vampire?!
46186,Lisa,my name's lisa. what's yours?
51191,Lisa,"i'm glad you're back, dad. it's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek."
43938,Lisa,your world is incredible! and you speak english!
43819,Lisa,"but immigration is what america's all about. even the simpson family immigrated to america. right, grampa?"
43435,Lisa,"you know, maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us. i think she's beginning to forget mom and dad."
47185,Lisa,"c'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower."
46458,Lisa,"i still believe in god. i just think there's another path to him, or her."
45848,Lisa,nope.
44031,Lisa,"i know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
51990,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
51478,Lisa,"i'm sorry, mom."
50780,Lisa,"um, can i be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?"
47417,Lisa,we can't jump this ditch.
48546,Lisa,"dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?"
42992,Lisa,"you know, sideshow bob, i believe you when you say you're innocent..."
51266,Lisa,"but after some thought, all my worries went away."
42090,Lisa,"uh, i'll smoke it in class."
47136,Lisa,"i'm sure she's just running late. or, she's not coming because she doesn't understand how special you are."
49910,Lisa,a beached whale.
51923,Lisa,"i'm not a sniveling toad, am i?"
48886,Lisa,"actually, you made one. what shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
47214,Lisa,"oh come on, don't you get it? bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch."
49669,Lisa,dad! over here!
49363,Lisa,"mom, please don't do that."
51448,Lisa,tomato!
52078,Lisa,with all our hearts!
52503,Lisa,"wait, mom. does that mean you're gonna take dad back?"
43602,Lisa,"we'll be safe here till mom and dad, the evil overlords gets home."
51720,Lisa,bart! this is the year i've got to nail christmas. i don't want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you!
44231,Lisa,911
42224,Lisa,isn't this dangerous?
51053,Lisa,"but i am playing! i'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph, climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme."
46518,Lisa,but i have to save them! the books no one buys get chopped up and fed to pigs.
41941,Lisa,"mom, instead of milk for dinner, can i have a ""virgin moe?"""
42507,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
50713,Lisa,"just throw in a couple of ""fur is murders."""
45325,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. hurry, everyone! we don't have much time!"
42287,Lisa,"hey, wait... that's not a dummy!"
49609,Lisa,no one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.
52248,Lisa,"springfield gorge? bart, you'll be killed!"
44597,Lisa,hard work made us quit.
47953,Lisa,"well, i think this family should try more vegetarian meals. we'd feel better and live longer."
46718,Lisa,"well, bart's kinda-- no!"
47364,Lisa,you don't even know what the idea is.
51005,Lisa,"don't you see, you're taking women for granted. and aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
44226,Lisa,"bart, if you come out, i'll let you eat raw cookie dough. i'll let you... ride the lawn mower through the house. come on, open the door!"
44970,Lisa,hel-lo?
43656,Lisa,"no. we're looking for this man, krusty the clown."
47145,Lisa,"oh, i had my first crush, and all it did was make me do terrible things and then break my heart."
50429,Lisa,yes... no... i don't know! it means that... that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up. and you're cute in the moonlight.
52275,Lisa,"nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time."
44579,Lisa,what?
48248,Lisa,i give you... groundskeeper willie!
43083,Lisa,"hey, hey, hey! stop it! stop it! why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? haven't you heard of occam's razor? ""the simplest explanation is probably the correct one."""
48933,Lisa,do you do it with relish?
50019,Lisa,"saturday morning, and then... noooo!"
43671,Lisa,"oh, it's just the excitement of studying jebediah."
44433,Lisa,i won't.
47182,Lisa,i'm so proud of what you guys are doing. i even tipped off the local paper.
50553,Lisa,you're group-writing a book?! but the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
49119,Lisa,chef!
45278,Lisa,my tummy really hurts.
42815,Lisa,it looks like part of scratchy's arm.
50743,Lisa,it's so diverse! i've died and gone to a pbs kids show!
50948,Lisa,i can finally compost!
48097,Lisa,"hi, bart. i baked you some cookies."
52073,Lisa,wait a minute. krusty can't read.
45286,Lisa,da-ad.
41622,Lisa,let's eat maggie.
43111,Lisa,i still don't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters.
50281,Lisa,help! my macaroni marconi!
49696,Lisa,what do you want?
43262,Lisa,i thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
44030,Lisa,very sharp!
46553,Lisa,this school has everything.
42948,Lisa,"yeah. ""dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
42999,Lisa,oh no! we left grampa back at the gas station.
42557,Lisa,no.
42002,Lisa,"yeah, me!"
51500,Lisa,that's a terrible thing for a father to do.
49770,Lisa,all dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
46716,Lisa,life sucks.
51817,Lisa,"well you're the only ""gangsta"" i know with a nine o'clock bedtime!"
47432,Lisa,milhouse? i thought your mom took you away forever.
48046,Lisa,"look, all i'm saying is, you really should think twice before..."
46105,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
47686,Lisa,emanations!
44403,Lisa,"what a magical city! can we come back next year, dad?"
43717,Lisa,"because the myth of jebediah has value, too. it's brought out the best in everyone in this town. regardless of who said it, ""a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."""
48783,Lisa,"dad, that's ludicrous!"
44003,Lisa,...on nelson muntz.
52156,Lisa,"oooo, a political discussion at our table. i feel like a kennedy."
42038,Lisa,"mom, he's doing it again. bart, quit it! quit it! hey quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! mommmmm!!"
41713,Lisa,i don't have any banana.
45566,Lisa,"dad, i'm tired of bathing in the yard. plus, i think rod and todd are watching."
46789,Lisa,"do you remember how you got home last night, dad?"
46606,Lisa,"no, mom. joan of arc."
43218,Lisa,that is good because eating animals is wrong.
48500,Lisa,"standardized tests, standardized tests, standardized tests..."
46680,Lisa,"he created a cartoon called ""danger dog."" it's popular with kids and adults."
51477,Lisa,"oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin! but this fella is so fuzzy!"
42252,Lisa,"dad, we did something very bad."
52376,Lisa,this patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt.
43625,Lisa,"c'mon, mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
49592,Lisa,please don't say a man.
44984,Lisa,"thanks, mom. but i told you, i'm not going."
43493,Lisa,tofu?
48139,Lisa,"oh, it had to be a boy, did it? you think a girl can't flip out? well, you're wrong!"
41653,Lisa,"and i'm at a stupid, boring ballet."
42145,Lisa,"dad, you know you won."
45061,Lisa,me too.
49159,Lisa,"everyone, wait!"
41818,Lisa,i can't believe it! the system works.
47724,Lisa,i'd like that.
47599,Lisa,granted.
45422,Lisa,help!
46580,Lisa,i'm annie oakley!
48494,Lisa,he sure is neurotic for a monster.
48012,Lisa,come on -- we'll hide in the theater!
42377,Lisa,what do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
50920,Lisa,but i promised paul mccartney i wouldn't eat meat.
47426,Lisa,"""the mound builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."""
45204,Lisa,now what do we do?
51158,Lisa,something smells fishy.
44891,Lisa,"dad, i'm kind of scared."
45292,Lisa,"dad, wake up!"
48385,Lisa,thank you. or should i say thank you!
49742,Lisa,"i agree it's cliché, but she does have a certain-- unicorn!"
49709,Lisa,"hello, bart."
50011,Lisa,i finally found the place i belong.
50882,Lisa,well... at least i have a college fund!
52212,Lisa,here.
48455,Lisa,i always wanted a jazz nickname!
50490,Lisa,"okay, first letter ""d."" next letter: a-b-c-d-e-"
51979,Lisa,okay.
43917,Lisa,i'll start with radio shack.
42062,Lisa,"""and any time i hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... edna!"""
46486,Lisa,i can really celebrate christmas?
42326,Lisa,hey! the incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. below!
50854,Lisa,"are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"""
47885,Lisa,"well, i think -- in these days of petro-terrorists and ozone depletion -- a sunday drive reeks of bio-hubris."
51006,Lisa,compliment her!
43247,Lisa,"hi, dad."
50447,Lisa,it's real. i can show you!
45486,Lisa,hm. what's the english equivalent for ? i'd say... transcendent.
43224,Lisa,"yes, i will."
47058,Lisa,and what's that?
49109,Lisa,it's just a cat.
42240,Lisa,i'm tired of being a corporate shill.
49919,Lisa,a little.
43079,Lisa,"mom! dad! look, this biography of peter uebberoth is only ninety-nine cents! and i found the new al gore book!"
50957,Lisa,how did santa's little helper get in there?
48802,Lisa,and at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
52074,Lisa,"no! don't you get it, bart? how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?"
47512,Lisa,bones!
47855,Lisa,"you'll see. oh, you will see."
41612,Lisa,"howdy pardners, my name is sheriff..."
49272,Lisa,"well i must admit, i'm kind of touched. ""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" nice."
42538,Lisa,what about bob hope? he's been consistently popular for over 50 years.
49868,Lisa,"flotus1 is ""first lady of the united states... one!"""
50504,Lisa,"fine. good luck with your project, which i'm sure you haven't started yet."
46676,Lisa,the speakers are poor because we're letting just anybody do it.
44555,Lisa,"ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. big deal."
44715,Lisa,"if she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
43979,Lisa,i'm gonna rescue a baby seal! and then i'm gonna save an otter!
49150,Lisa,"so the centipede says: ""i'm goin'! i'm goin'! ...i'm just puttin' on my shoes!"""
49653,Lisa,"dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
47314,Lisa,"wow, look at all this stuff."
51226,Lisa,but the simpson abode was deep down in the dumps. 'cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps.
49883,Lisa,such an intricate formicarium! i'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
46861,Lisa,"dad, look!"
48791,Lisa,"mr. brockman, you're a huge hit!"
43678,Lisa,"the next time hans sprüngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to jebediah springfield."
50966,Lisa,"when grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about."
44420,Lisa,"mom, can you tell me the story of how i got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about bart!"
41923,Lisa,"she likes a little carrot after her oats. and she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. and if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. please take good care of my princess."
45160,Lisa,dad! what a nice surprise.
44578,Lisa,i guess we better get used to being pariahs.
50515,Lisa,fun dad rocks!
43469,Lisa,"oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism."
43803,Lisa,"cut it off, but be careful."
49466,Lisa,ha! principal skinner? comic book guy? what are you doing here?
42362,Lisa,just like oscar the grouch.
50990,Lisa,with nametags on them?
43457,Lisa,"happy to do it. but you know, bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night."
48137,Lisa,"sure, that's all you men do is, take and take and take, without regard to feelings or unicorns...here, take my lunch, too!"
42823,Lisa,"i'll tell you a secret, bart. every time i'm worried about mom and dad, i go to the attic and add to my ball of string."
45433,Lisa,"eww, we're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-cent store?"
43573,Lisa,"gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to springfield?"
42504,Lisa,now wait a minute. how can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you?
44957,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
42675,Lisa,why? i'm so much happier here.
49192,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
46765,Lisa,"well, duh."
49601,Lisa,so snow white slept and waited for her prince to come... but he never did.
49693,Lisa,global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
48022,Lisa,her films are so lyrical! the phone lines are gonna be jammed.
44113,Lisa,"hurry nanny, things are"
48960,Lisa,nothing!
43468,Lisa,dad... those all come from the same animal.
48695,Lisa,"sadly, no. i'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but i'm not surprised."
45568,Lisa,"dad, there's a note on the back of your head."
49307,Lisa,please let me keep them for just a little longer.
43341,Lisa,that's only the cat.
42298,Lisa,"be-bop? ""be-bop""?"
51749,Lisa,"i win, i think."
51577,Lisa,what's for dinner?
43093,Lisa,"see, dad. i told you mom would have problems."
50159,Lisa,"okay, i've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... oh my god!"
52015,Lisa,no!
51247,Lisa,"eh, bart, bart, bart."
49860,Lisa,"no it's not, dream-hoover! and as long as i'm asleep, i'm gonna have some fun. i can fly! wheeee!"
51283,Lisa,"okay guys, i got your ice creams."
48929,Lisa,mo-om!
48731,Lisa,that's just someone barbecuing.
48176,Lisa,"sono cosí matto a lei! ho pensato abbiamo avuto qualcosa andando, e poi la prendo con questa sgualdrina! lei me fa malato!"
51282,Lisa,"ooh, good... nice... ""beat dallas."" can never argue with that."
42754,Lisa,"and i'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet. wanna come with me, daddy-o?"
46243,Lisa,isn't that cute? a bush-baby.
49550,Lisa,i'm a big girl! i'm a big girl!
49694,Lisa,"really? really? uh-huh, all right."
43954,Lisa,"hello, mr. chipmunk! you're a northern reticulated chipmunk! yes, you are! you are so reticulated!"
45494,Lisa,but what if someone bad tells me to...
46997,Lisa,ac/dc!
46248,Lisa,"wait, rhinos don't come from eggs."
49313,Lisa,always.
46121,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm impressed."
43445,Lisa,where'd you get five bucks? i want five bucks.
47476,Lisa,you're making fun of him for something you made him do.
50306,Lisa,"dad, is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee?"
45843,Lisa,"that's my name with bella on the end of it. ask her, oh god, please ask her to dance."
47040,Lisa,"krusty, i don't usually give advice to republicans, but it would be nice to be on the winning side for once. you have to start making an honest connection with the voters. talk about how you could help regular families -- like ours."
48756,Lisa,big chief rotten cheeks chewing tobacco...a take-a-penny tray with a quarter in it!
47586,Lisa,"no, i think the expression is ""peg."""
50074,Lisa,sorry.
48349,Lisa,"but... isn't it? i mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
46664,Lisa,"dad, it's one a.m. and i'm out of saliva."
48410,Lisa,"dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?"
47443,Lisa,bart will give back the malibu stacy head you thought was lost.
52423,Lisa,"no, really, i can't."
45650,Lisa,so mom... you think you'll be getting out of there soon?
51511,Lisa,no-no-no.
52403,Lisa,and what was ringo's response?
47638,Lisa,tomorrow's? i hadn't thought about publishing more.
48593,Lisa,"dad, wait, i've got a story about why revenge is wrong."
44557,Lisa,"well, i'm proud of you, mom. you refused to compromise your integrity."
46400,Lisa,do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
43791,Lisa,"no! don't use your real name, or bart will know!"
47870,Lisa,"no, i'm giving it up!"
47057,Lisa,"dad, this just isn't working."
44389,Lisa,"dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
50922,Lisa,"you know, shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers. they're both arthropods..."
45003,Lisa,there you are in outer space. that's pretty impressive.
50268,Lisa,could we hurry this up? i am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
52421,Lisa,"no, but i'm starting to wish i had."
43892,Lisa,"don't have a cow, man!"
52422,Lisa,i can't.
41750,Lisa,ring.
46747,Lisa,what was that?
50444,Lisa,"ooh, a pull-down map of..."
48633,Lisa,excuse me.
43219,Lisa,when will the world learn?
45195,Lisa,it is to me.
44966,Lisa,stop saying hello!
51369,Lisa,principal skinner? i object to this arbitrary use of power and request i be taken off the list.
49668,Lisa,"sure they do. if magic was real, i'd use it to get out of my pipe cleaner art project that's due tomorrow."
47022,Lisa,"my one chance for everyone to like me, and i blew it."
48198,Lisa,"hey, krusty's in an opera, here in rome! he can save our lives! come on, let's go!"
43326,Lisa,i stopped brushing my teeth so i can play just like you!
48972,Lisa,you calm down!
45435,Lisa,this also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
50807,Lisa,i denounce thee! i denounce thee! i denounce thee!
49092,Lisa,"okay, one more take."
42405,Lisa,but couldn't we just give in to the british?
46609,Lisa,victory.
45461,Lisa,but my dad can...
44662,Lisa,"hey... if a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food."
42882,Lisa,but she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
49415,Lisa,what did i get wrong?
43325,Lisa,i sure am. look!
42589,Lisa,oh my god!
44924,Lisa,"look, dad, they've got every kind of paper! looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!"
48321,Lisa,"calm down, dad. what happened?"
47055,Lisa,"dad, have you looked at this earnings report?"
51734,Lisa,"whoa, this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars."
44406,Lisa,sgt. skinner was a hero. he risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
42836,Lisa,dad...
49725,Lisa,"larry, please don't judge our whole family by bart. he's the black sheep. not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. i do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. ooh, look! jazz!"
51043,Lisa,why are you so mean to me?
44734,Lisa,"...but i have something more important to say. for reasons beyond my control, i will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. so before that happens, i want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me..."
46123,Lisa,"tough break, toots. i need a man who answers to no one. a full manager."
44519,Lisa,just let me take it to the museum for one day. they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
47215,Lisa,why can't i tinker with the fabric of existence?
50692,Lisa,"i know it's futile, but i must again point out there is no dragon."
41764,Lisa,"well, all right -- if you listen to the poem i just wrote."
51617,Lisa,"so milhouse got the redemption he deserved... and so, in a way, did bart."
51825,Lisa,you never let me tell!
61607,Marge,i'm gonna sleep on the couch.
55050,Marge,"well, you may not look like ted bessell, but you're just as nice."
67654,Marge,when we're intimate?
63551,Marge,hello. hello?
66643,Marge,"i understand, honey. did you get someone to cover?"
66192,Marge,i feel kind of... melancholy...
64018,Marge,let's go get my little girl.
57235,Marge,what are you talking about?
61750,Marge,i don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones.
62213,Marge,"okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
55863,Marge,mr. hutz --
63979,Marge,"well, i want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
60841,Marge,"it's nice and cool in here, don't you think?"
55395,Marge,"homer, my audition is in half..."
67184,Marge,"what, homer?"
56862,Marge,that's it! there's too much corruption on this force. i quit!
59502,Marge,did you really have to handcuff the children?
56366,Marge,"mmmm, homie..."
61919,Marge,chloe has such an amazing life. i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism.
55203,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
59100,Marge,is mel gibson here?
58955,Marge,"really? well, what do you call that thing on the branch?"
63028,Marge,i help more than you might think.
59190,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie. a lady remington."
61839,Marge,i don't deserve to win. i sabotaged all the other entries!
66774,Marge,there's only one fair solution: we have to put it to a vote.
64569,Marge,"well, we will take you up on your offer."
61662,Marge,right here in dayton.
54811,Marge,"homer, you encouraged him. you should be strangling yourself."
64057,Marge,"i know i shouldn't get too attached to a building, but... that's where lisa took her first step... the kids' height...homer's weight..."
55901,Marge,"oh, what a cute convertible. you guys at the bureau thought of everything."
66696,Marge,can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
57468,Marge,"oh, homie. i know you love me. we don't need to get married again."
64294,Marge,god didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
66015,Marge,thank you!
59796,Marge,wow. the artist really captured jimi's passion and intensity.
65415,Marge,there's champagne in those!
63984,Marge,"lisa, i don't like this at all."
65234,Marge,i'm going to bed.
55429,Marge,"keep yelling, you big ape."
60555,Marge,"look, i'm really starting to worry. there's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"
65956,Marge,it's not what you think!
62398,Marge,"oh sure you can, sweetie. just don't make a habit of it."
58168,Marge,"actually, we're done."
58732,Marge,"mm-hm. hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits aunt patty always gives us?"
67205,Marge,sure.
57838,Marge,or save the endangered alaskan salmon?
57254,Marge,of course i'll accept! bart! i've missed you so mu-- you want to speak to lisa?
59496,Marge,"i trust you, honey."
54822,Marge,"bart, i asked you to watch your sister!"
66742,Marge,hello?
55409,Marge,"well, i guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her."
66486,Marge,"homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself."
61519,Marge,"homie, that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together. i think he looks a little like you."
66450,Marge,"eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on..."
66619,Marge,would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
60589,Marge,sure.
56161,Marge,there! isn't that a lot better? now you can do whatever you want. but don't mess up the house.
61272,Marge,"no, it's too risky! we'll just wait till the traffic thins out. turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
63338,Marge,"now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life."
63253,Marge,can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
54780,Marge,so maybe a part-time job is the answer.
55460,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, i had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
65653,Marge,homie? aren't you going to come in?
65684,Marge,"when you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!"
65934,Marge,"everyone, please! calm down! reverend lovejoy is here!"
64679,Marge,"lisa, too humble."
64147,Marge,i can't believe homer left me at the altar.
57080,Marge,"oh, homie. look at that watch. i've always wanted a watch like that."
54975,Marge,"question one: ""name one of your child's friends..."""
64909,Marge,"huh? oh, myself, i guess."
65606,Marge,homer? how many samples did you sell?
63982,Marge,uh-huh...
55627,Marge,did you girls watch the last episode of mash?
65660,Marge,"and these fake movie reviews are so mean, it's hilarious."
58665,Marge,"oh, thank heaven."
63556,Marge,"okay... they're so buggy, i can't!"
62165,Marge,"if you don't want to say it, just think it."
59277,Marge,you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
63997,Marge,"say ""yes"" say ""yes""!"""
63839,Marge,"thank you so much, mister..."
62938,Marge,"i never heard anything about it on the gossip shows, or the blogosphere or in my supermarket check-out magazine."
61568,Marge,oh no! i'm gonna be incarce... incarce... incarce... i'm going to jail.
65301,Marge,you'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
57810,Marge,they started it!
57388,Marge,what are you doing in the basement? it's like you're hiding out down here.
57005,Marge,i'm so proud. that's my husband wedged in that hatch.
62989,Marge,"homie, look -- he's enjoying it."
62620,Marge,tire spikes?
57696,Marge,"maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. that's why they hire teenagers."
65385,Marge,what's going on?
66209,Marge,first few weeks of what?
56670,Marge,"this has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, montreal morn."
57809,Marge,thank heavens!
60945,Marge,"come on, everyone's helping."
54657,Marge,...make him feel good about himself.
63842,Marge,"here we are at school, kids."
55543,Marge,oooh! they're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
57619,Marge,"i'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
62971,Marge,"no problem, i'll just drive up to your house and get it."
56807,Marge,death sports.
63595,Marge,homer! the wedding's in twenty minutes! just pick a tie!
66020,Marge,is it your impression of mr. burns eating soup? because i'm not in the mood.
64667,Marge,the paper's here.
64326,Marge,that's. my. son.
63925,Marge,"homer, that was rude and shortsighted. patty and selma have the map."
66343,Marge,dr. carlock is like my wednesday reset button.
60875,Marge,"two, three, two..."
55261,Marge,not one that i want the public to see.
56683,Marge,"no, homer."
62712,Marge,i didn't say that.
61141,Marge,i don't know what happened. i saw you and i went for the brake but i hit the accelerator!
66317,Marge,jesus says to love your enemies.
57201,Marge,"checking accounts aren't really for children, bart."
63171,Marge,i was so happy on that island...
66777,Marge,what?!
67664,Marge,"ahem. ""the blackened clouds are forming ..."""
66378,Marge,"another seminar tomorrow. i just wish i could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
61078,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, mrs. lovejoy, principal skinner, duffman."
65911,Marge,he's taken a step. he's really close. all he has to do is not eat a piece before i do.
58460,Marge,but think of the scandal.
55859,Marge,"grampa, you know you can't have liquids after three p.m."
54832,Marge,crazy house!
60313,Marge,"aw, hop in."
56379,Marge,"homer, no. you're going to get lost."
61736,Marge,"now, that wasn't so bad, was it bart? you know, sometimes the fear of some..."
55786,Marge,but you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look.
58345,Marge,you already have a monkey.
54699,Marge,maybe not this time...
64608,Marge,"hey, that's pretty nifty. let me try."
54761,Marge,yes.
60979,Marge,it's so exciting! it's like living in a dictionary.
67900,Marge,hmmm huh.
67807,Marge,"mm hm. two o'clock is fine. thank you, dr. hibbert."
63225,Marge,"bart, you're too young to get married! you still make me check the closet for the boogeyman!"
61775,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
58633,Marge,ohh.
66069,Marge,he's writing me again! better put a stop to this.
61637,Marge,"dayton, ohio!"
55549,Marge,we're here for the retirement party.
59623,Marge,"fortunately, i had a network connection. the man who cut my hair was also president of fox."
63110,Marge,not that one.
64257,Marge,macbeth!
63612,Marge,"bye, bart! enjoy your funny books!"
57189,Marge,"no, no, no! not tonight! no vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. just be good."
63741,Marge,boring!
57129,Marge,"are you interested in that motorized tie rack, principal skinner?"
64587,Marge,"really? okay, eat your lunch."
54659,Marge,well i do.
56217,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
63423,Marge,my quads! every stride is a nightmare!
60662,Marge,huh?
56954,Marge,this is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house!
56121,Marge,hm. i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
55371,Marge,"well, it's pretty ingrained."
64395,Marge,dinner's ready! dinner's ready!
62054,Marge,don't you push them! they've gotta work that out for themselves.
61243,Marge,deal! hit me! hit me! hit me! busted!
63793,Marge,roger that.
66889,Marge,"homie, homie, i can finally tell you how we really got the money..."
66082,Marge,he says shows set during world war one are too sad. particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
65935,Marge,so charming. it's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.
64248,Marge,macbeth!
65048,Marge,"c'mon, people. peaches!"
54812,Marge,"honey, what's done is done. no matter what happens, we'll pull through. we always do."
56310,Marge,all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
65868,Marge,my what?
67604,Marge,bart! bart!
66820,Marge,"homer, it's a standing ovation, get up!"
59294,Marge,"no, no, i mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs."
63415,Marge,watering can!
64408,Marge,what a smart way to spend a snowy day.
63821,Marge,"homie, what's going on?"
63684,Marge,"speaking of disasters, have you seen this? springfield dodge bought too much inventory, and they've only got one weekend to get rid of all the '07s!"
66590,Marge,yikes!
64145,Marge,we are now eleven seconds behind schedule!
60706,Marge,get in.
58465,Marge,"hang on, homie. i'm gonna try to set her down."
61908,Marge,"gee, with all that travel, you probably haven't had much time to find that special someone."
55952,Marge,"homer, we gotta do something! today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!"
57423,Marge,"no, i had to go rent the bulldozer."
57495,Marge,"ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
61647,Marge,"oh, homie."
60205,Marge,"well, is anything coming back to you?"
62510,Marge,no.
60002,Marge,"it's a healthy cereal from europe: ""meus-lix."""
63128,Marge,"you can't go home tonight! it's cold, it's late..."
67211,Marge,"you are not a blimp, homer. you're my big cuddly teddy bear."
60357,Marge,"please, homie? no more craziness -- for me?"
62783,Marge,"well, i had my doubts, but grampa sure looks manly in those leggings!"
61136,Marge,what's all that rustling?
65423,Marge,barney?
57019,Marge,which was?
65471,Marge,just take me home.
61667,Marge,here's to life without children!
60455,Marge,have we gotten all the liquor?
66418,Marge,"oh, it looks great!"
65369,Marge,what are you doing here?
58907,Marge,you still haven't told us why lenny bit you.
61335,Marge,it makes her happy.
56856,Marge,go back to bed! don't make me come up there!
63687,Marge,no!!! that's my memory box!
55059,Marge,oh dear...
56384,Marge,homer! we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
57293,Marge,"bart, you can invite milhouse. lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
61953,Marge,"homer, use your inside voice."
58737,Marge,"oh, honey. that is egg-ceptional."
65176,Marge,"ooo, let's see what else they do wrong!"
58355,Marge,"it's the same basic bear, homey."
62403,Marge,noooo!
54964,Marge,"homer, can you get the door? it's my sisters."
67762,Marge,saturday night? i'm not even sure my sisters will be available.
66099,Marge,that'll take hours! on our anniversary!
62901,Marge,oh of course i do! that's why we're such a great team!
66280,Marge,that one creeps me out from the beginning.
57046,Marge,"all right, climb in."
60821,Marge,"oooh, that place is famous. it's where j. lo hit p-diddy upside the head with gary coleman."
66264,Marge,where is the end?
59326,Marge,stop it!
59334,Marge,i can't be in the hospital! tomorrow is laundry day. and i've gotta de-meat lisa's baloney.
64619,Marge,lisa is very sensitive. if something she loves dies in front of her--
66547,Marge,"so as her teacher, i was wondering if you could tell me why lisa has such trouble making friends."
67092,Marge,"oh homer, you promised me..."
57463,Marge,"edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- ah!... homer! what are you doing?!"
65520,Marge,"i wish i was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me."
65139,Marge,he's not a bad boy.
64884,Marge,he's starting to wake up.
63802,Marge,"ooo, ""candyland."" a great family game is now a great family movie!"
67111,Marge,where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?
67261,Marge,"well, i guess for the next few months, yes, i'll be your mother."
55743,Marge,"you know, i rented another tape... in case you felt better."
62255,Marge,it's graffiti you can eatie!
63505,Marge,i'm what?!
57219,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
62939,Marge,"homer, can i see you in the kitchen?"
67372,Marge,"well, he certainly must have been motivated. prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this."
59985,Marge,wonder where this river goes.
61531,Marge,my husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! do you know why no one likes you?
56759,Marge,"dogs! chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor!"
62390,Marge,and i always will.
56626,Marge,turn it off.
67593,Marge,what in the world?
60135,Marge,"just, just let me get--"
58273,Marge,"oh, knock it off, homer. you're the fattest one in the car..."
61769,Marge,"homer, i am so mad at you! i'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
65396,Marge,"homie, this might be a clue! what's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies!"
59525,Marge,you should get your eyes checked. i'm taking bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
67430,Marge,"did the team ask you to dress like that, homer?"
57208,Marge,toast.
66974,Marge,"oh, homer, how could you think of killing yourself? we love you."
55683,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
66186,Marge,"i asked him here to cheer you up, but i didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, spaniard."
59392,Marge,"ooh, the drain bugger!"
54588,Marge,you leave me sitting here all alone...
61921,Marge,"that's a sweet thought, homie."
56168,Marge,stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
59906,Marge,"okay, everybody. say ""funny."""
61622,Marge,"oh, that's so lovely. but it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
58451,Marge,it's okay when you're in love. and married. to the sweetest guy in the world.
67735,Marge,why so glum?
63522,Marge,homie! you're all right!
61682,Marge,"shut up and kiss me, you doomed hunk!"
61733,Marge,who's ready for a kitten?
56326,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
62107,Marge,always nice to see him.
65532,Marge,la-dies-and-gen-tle-men-i-have-an-an-nounce-ment. that's not iambic pentameter!
61263,Marge,tony... i mean mr. prime minister... what should we see first?
62009,Marge,really? is it one that will change the sleeping arrangements?
65276,Marge,lisa...
60779,Marge,"oh, homie."
61289,Marge,"you're not going, and that's final."
57050,Marge,"did you eat the cookies, maggie."
56403,Marge,i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.
62970,Marge,"okay, just one more kid to pick up."
61396,Marge,"homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
55165,Marge,uh-huh.
61581,Marge,pour me another.
60168,Marge,it wasn't meant to be.
55840,Marge,in a minute!
67097,Marge,homer! were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?
67048,Marge,i'm upset about lisa.
60602,Marge,at the golden banana?
54937,Marge,"homer, if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her."
61686,Marge,let's see how your sister's doing in the place-setting competition.
55677,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't know. this might upset them."
67798,Marge,now this is spoiling them.
57801,Marge,"no, he's disappeared. oh, i'm in way over my head. i mean, where do the helpers turn when they need help?"
56166,Marge,i really think this is a bad idea.
57929,Marge,but balzac is the name--
62402,Marge,"tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... homer, stop that!"
65918,Marge,why would you think i'd like this?
59414,Marge,you're on fire!
60270,Marge,"sir, we know you're not an angel. my husband sees too many movies."
63876,Marge,that's a hard hat zone!
57346,Marge,"okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... annnd maggie's enjoying her swingamajig..."
62922,Marge,"lisa, i think i have a way to help you at the trial today."
58965,Marge,"oh, thank you. are you okay?"
56962,Marge,"bart, sensible bites! all right lisa. if you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things i can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs..."
61687,Marge,"where were you, homie? you missed all the excitement."
63829,Marge,i thought she gave you her rebellious spirit.
62328,Marge,"all right! i admit it -- they're both at the catholic church! reverend, what should i do?"
65627,Marge,"so, this was after homer's mother left?"
57099,Marge,"oh, bart, not again... give it to me."
66134,Marge,who cares what happened? daddy's back!
61693,Marge,"that was so exciting, yet familiar. like coke with lemon."
57666,Marge,"homer, listen carefully: john is a ho-mo--"
67631,Marge,um-hmm.
66615,Marge,i'm not sure this is going to work out.
66843,Marge,homie! are you dressed? you have soccer setup in twenty minutes! homie?!
56094,Marge,"bart, i've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune."
56446,Marge,that's what he wore to church.
55652,Marge,"well, bart, what do you think of little lisa?"
66071,Marge,he's in the market! we might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
66161,Marge,you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city!
56708,Marge,second.
59291,Marge,where are we going?
55550,Marge,maybe i should apply for that job.
59533,Marge,i remember little vicki valentine! her perky smile and dancing brought america right out of the depression.
59017,Marge,nothing.
54732,Marge,children! go!
63326,Marge,"good morning, sweetie."
61145,Marge,"gee, everything always works out for you."
60342,Marge,when who should ring the doorbell but ned flanders.
64273,Marge,he would not let maggie's creativity flower:
57708,Marge,just stand still and i'll get someone!
56320,Marge,jacques.
59029,Marge,now there's the place you want to buy your buttons.
58943,Marge,"who cares?! no one could ever get sick of this song. ""suddenly appear..."""
63148,Marge,"well, just let 'em finish this one song..."
65368,Marge,"don't even bother shooting us. we've found a new place that we love. a place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more..."
57118,Marge,i can't believe otto picked up a 7-10 split. he's phenomenal!
58660,Marge,"it's so sweet of you to take us out like this, homie. come on, kids, three cheers for your father! hip hip--"
65839,Marge,i think your dad might be gay.
64013,Marge,"lisa ran away, and it's all my fault! if i'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything would've been fine."
61034,Marge,"oh, homie. don't let it get you down. so mr. burns doesn't take you seriously? big whoop! who gives a doodle? whoopie ding dong doo!"
62845,Marge,"et tu, zud?"
66884,Marge,actually... my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church.
59132,Marge,back in the lunches you go.
64128,Marge,no rockets! you can pick the frosting.
67225,Marge,what are we laughing at?
66150,Marge,what ring?
63887,Marge,"bart! where are you, bart?"
58788,Marge,"all right, i'll get you the materials. but you're building it."
67399,Marge,"for a superior race, they really rub it in."
58502,Marge,"turn it off, homer."
56467,Marge,"moe, i think you should leave."
55051,Marge,marge.
56636,Marge,i'm not saying it won't work. i'm just saying it's dishonest.
61488,Marge,my baby has no future!
56009,Marge,"ruth, that's a lot of hooey. it's not over until it's over."
58052,Marge,"you know, homer, i'm starting to realize life is short."
55259,Marge,the dog will get out!
66895,Marge,i'm going to do what i should've done in the first place.
66434,Marge,an atm receipt?
64820,Marge,are you sure? he's having a growth spurt.
60760,Marge,"they do make my neck look thinner... oh, all right, let's do it."
60580,Marge,"oh, it must be something big. hm. something you did?... no, something you saw."
60722,Marge,why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert? i made a pie.
62803,Marge,we're not engaged.
54727,Marge,homer! you promised!
62710,Marge,"everything's covered in foam. and it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
67243,Marge,"oh, homer. how many times do i have to fluff your pillow?"
62603,Marge,vendetta means... vendetta!
59347,Marge,lost them? what do you mean?
60908,Marge,"hurry up kids, you'll miss the bus!"
58322,Marge,"homie, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. what if you get called into combat?"
57398,Marge,"honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals. you can stay right here and give the dog a bath. or trim the cat's nails."
63576,Marge,how was your night?
66415,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's beautiful! i've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
55469,Marge,"yes, the lesson is..."
66114,Marge,and love conquered all / with a train from the mall
56941,Marge,he's going to baptize our children?
62646,Marge,a dollar.
59181,Marge,who could be calling at this hour?
64244,Marge,and she lived happily ever after?
61917,Marge,that's better.
59053,Marge,it looks so elegant. and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. you've got to show me exactly what you did.
67782,Marge,"telephone, homer."
61738,Marge,i think you should stay home from school tomorrow.
67350,Marge,remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
65207,Marge,1501 w-- east oak street.
56215,Marge,"yeah. anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""periodicals,"" that's it."
67187,Marge,"goodbye, lisa. my darling little lisa."
63030,Marge,"homie... i think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. i mean, look at your t-shirt!"
58281,Marge,"kids, from now on, i don't want you touching anything in our house. dart!"
57086,Marge,i know you are...
56274,Marge,"this was a lovely idea, homie. come here and kiss me."
64785,Marge,i can't live with the guilt.
65926,Marge,d.
62207,Marge,knockers on route 98.
58636,Marge,"oh my, you're burning up. i'm going to tell the school you're staying home."
65531,Marge,"no, lisa! if you click that turnstile, it'll blow our budget!"
61990,Marge,"howdy, partner! why don't you sit next to us?"
58237,Marge,and who do you love now?
65160,Marge,you kids have had a big day. head up to the tub while i deflate your toys.
61348,Marge,"ms. naegle, i'm sorry to surprise you like this, but i thought if we met face-to-face, we could settle our differences."
57330,Marge,"oh, finish your fish heads. then we'll talk."
56968,Marge,"tell him yourself. you're ignoring lisa, not bart."
64217,Marge,definitely a cup.
63608,Marge,no! don't talk like that! there's always hope.
58099,Marge,"well, there it is..."
57161,Marge,"i get food through the mail, but in a different way. every month good housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
64468,Marge,so we're right back where we used to be.
62892,Marge,i guess we have to move on.
67532,Marge,because.
67640,Marge,"we've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean, i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but i--"
63306,Marge,i was on the computer all night!
56399,Marge,"stay away from me, homer!"
58902,Marge,"ooh, talk to me, baby."
57706,Marge,isn't that clever? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building.
67125,Marge,"oh, perfume."
64772,Marge,"please! homer, i am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
59323,Marge,"look at these. you bought them after the nagano olympics, and never skied once. if you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe..."
64002,Marge,homer!
67701,Marge,just those who need help with french.
56957,Marge,oh my.
63214,Marge,hm...
65595,Marge,i can't believe we spent the whole day here.
60603,Marge,i know a great nametag place. they do fabulous work.
66625,Marge,"mother hubbard central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them. uniforms, fixins... it's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money. what kind of corporation does that?"
55052,Marge,i do.
63409,Marge,here's five more dollars.
55366,Marge,that was your idea.
60832,Marge,"uh, bob... i know you're enjoying fall preview week, but i was wondering if you made any progress towards finding homer's killer?"
60931,Marge,"homer, we can't sue the church. they'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin."
66521,Marge,okay with no friends. that's the saddest thing i can imagine my daughter saying to me.
61970,Marge,i would like it. you never come to my mother's.
54652,Marge,there'll never be a worse president. never.
55344,Marge,"operator, i'd like to place an order for my husband."
57653,Marge,"well, i never thought it would come to this, but i guess we'll have to sell grandma's civil war doll."
66905,Marge,oh... lisa's class.
58674,Marge,"oh, homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it."
58444,Marge,should we get started?
58928,Marge,"yes, that's it! lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman!"
61046,Marge,the first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.
64969,Marge,give me a double espresso to go.
64476,Marge,it's so noisy in here! i can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
56574,Marge,i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
62464,Marge,"well, i guess you showed you do trust me after all."
54977,Marge,hank?! hank who?
55925,Marge,i don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
60652,Marge,"homer, this is all your fault. if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa, none of this would have happened."
66128,Marge,dear christian god...
67327,Marge,you'll see.
60363,Marge,it's seven-thirty!
59145,Marge,"i understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on a treadmill?"
59686,Marge,"homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip."
54725,Marge,"children, it's time for you to go to bed."
56571,Marge,could you start fixing it pretty soon? the basement is getting awfully flooded. and i think the cat's down there.
57020,Marge,"oh, homie. c'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. i'm sure you were a wonderful son."
58911,Marge,ooh-woo. a complimentary basket of hooves.
62952,Marge,i always say that.
60597,Marge,look who's here. it's this thing!
64984,Marge,homer!
58280,Marge,i'd like to believe you...
54986,Marge,but i guess i was wrong. you are a bad father.
56090,Marge,and don't take candy from strangers.
65823,Marge,read the rest of the title!
58814,Marge,my darling bride manjula / i hereby mend my ways / i'll shower you with valentines / for seven love-filled days!
63747,Marge,chazz busby says you're really making progress! do you need more leg warmers?
62649,Marge,that's a female replacement hormone.
58542,Marge,"what's the point, bart? i punish and i punish and i punish, but it never sinks in. so you know what? do what you want. you want to play with little hoodlums? fine. have fun killing things."
67547,Marge,"it stands for ""springfieldians"
58692,Marge,"i know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?"
60793,Marge,"hey, if tv can give mike o'malley a home, it can give us one."
62104,Marge,"plus, we get free apple, orange and grapefruit juice!"
64897,Marge,why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
63263,Marge,"okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. for me, it's the family photo album."
55230,Marge,"we have three kids, homer."
60264,Marge,let's stick to original monopoly -- the game is crazy enough as it is.
57182,Marge,the outlet store.
54871,Marge,homer? homer!
58320,Marge,"""this is geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. so, here come de beep. here come de beep."""
57032,Marge,yay.
59078,Marge,"honey, i know you want to see japan, but we're down to our last million yen."
55466,Marge,"homer, please. don't make me choose between my man and my god, because you just can't win."
56783,Marge,how's my special little guy?
63374,Marge,you make them stop -- by doing the right thing.
64142,Marge,cue the band.
55405,Marge,i play an aging southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law stanley.
56867,Marge,now just a darned minute! this town is a part of who you are.
61969,Marge,"well, maybe i'll go to moe's too, seeing as i'm now part owner."
61022,Marge,election night is so exciting. i'm on pins and needles.
65070,Marge,which is our room again...
63017,Marge,"i did it! what's that strange feeling? it's ""of accomplishment""!"
60818,Marge,maggie?
61282,Marge,"homer, are you spooning that snack?"
61001,Marge,what?
65612,Marge,homie! do you know what yesterday was?
62756,Marge,what's with the kimono? are we having lachoy?
62523,Marge,and i threw out all your old comics!
62788,Marge,"should we take all our stuff, or are we coming back on this boat too?"
67818,Marge,"i didn't know then, and i don't know now."
55994,Marge,"homer, stop that! it's just a weather station."
61554,Marge,"well, you talk like marge, sorry i set the bed on fire."
66058,Marge,yes. and it's a big one. remember?
63212,Marge,hoo-boy.
57337,Marge,"we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library cards... bart's lawyer is here."
59099,Marge,"of course, homey. aren't you thinking about me?"
56735,Marge,"homer, hold on to the wheel!"
59666,Marge,"all right, but this better be the best toilet paper i've ever had."
60882,Marge,amen. over.
55279,Marge,"i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
60606,Marge,"what's wrong with him, doctor? it can't be mange, i just had him dipped."
54870,Marge,"bart, your father and i don't want you doing that. homer, say something."
56415,Marge,"homer, i'm impressed. you're taking this quite well."
58721,Marge,"oh, the hippo's missing..."
63777,Marge,there's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do. and that person is right here!
66885,Marge,it's not gambling! it's math.
58291,Marge,"lisa. lisa honey, wake up!"
57017,Marge,she's nice.
62729,Marge,now i really hope we win that contest.
63269,Marge,that's why i got duplicates!
56627,Marge,homer!
65363,Marge,"he's no ned flanders. and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. god help me, i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies."
67873,Marge,"well, no... just ringo starr."
57703,Marge,"oh, it's so beautiful! this is what i imagine paris must be like!"
55673,Marge,no. don't you have health insurance at work?
58853,Marge,so?
63645,Marge,"without the commercial interruption, i could really follow the story. tivo, you've got a season pass to my heart."
56828,Marge,i just want to relax and forget that i'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
67223,Marge,bart! quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
64565,Marge,and it means the world to me.
55565,Marge,ow!
59546,Marge,the furnace?
59873,Marge,all of that is you. you've gotta take this more seriously.
67779,Marge,"well, don't worry. there are still plenty of fish in the sea. right, homer?"
67889,Marge,i don't think i can.
57983,Marge,i've left homer.
61210,Marge,"okay, you can help us."
64880,Marge,i've always believed in you even when others didn't. can you help save our family christmas? marge simpson.
62293,Marge,lisa's going! we're all going!
67809,Marge,oh dear.
66665,Marge,i'll go make up the couch for you.
57996,Marge,how did you know we were being robbed?
61443,Marge,"there, there, i can help you kids."
65023,Marge,"ooh, the ""fan cam!"""
59298,Marge,broke! you broke your pencil.
55605,Marge,we pretty much went straight home.
67087,Marge,"oh, homer... my brilliant beast."
64361,Marge,now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
65460,Marge,"bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths."
65337,Marge,this house is not an embarrassment!
60907,Marge,"a little of this and a little of that. bulkenoids for my lats, mesomax for my delts, and estrogen blockers for that minty taste."
66110,Marge,i'm marge simpson.
57455,Marge,you know who the real victim is in all this? milhouse.
58341,Marge,monkey! there's a monkey in the house!
54934,Marge,"look homer, lisa's taking her first steps."
57010,Marge,a tombstone?!
58067,Marge,"oh boy, i've got a lot to learn before that license test."
57832,Marge,stakes!
61103,Marge,"eh, we can spend another week at the ranch."
63806,Marge,"thank you, dear."
57742,Marge,"""some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
61860,Marge,"oh sure, you love me now, but you'll turn."
61052,Marge,mock...
58171,Marge,all right! all right! sorry!
59759,Marge,"okay, players! that's a wrap!"
66930,Marge,"homer, you tell me that all the time."
66668,Marge,i'm just happy you're happy.
66436,Marge,i could write a check with... today's date on it.
67660,Marge,because we love your father and enjoy his company.
62005,Marge,"homer, i made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. and besides... i love you. you're my homie-womie-romie-domie..."
58607,Marge,"a cell phone? last thursday's ""variety""?"
61974,Marge,"come on, go home."
55867,Marge,will you excuse me while i go and freshen up?
59138,Marge,and then afterwards...
61724,Marge,"no, homer."
60885,Marge,goodbye kids.
62214,Marge,"oh, he must smell leftovers."
55866,Marge,you did?
57661,Marge,not really. they just had corn on them. kitchen -- corn.
55653,Marge,i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born.
62679,Marge,that was the most horrible part of all!
65456,Marge,homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
59807,Marge,that's depressing.
54734,Marge,i must apologize for my husband.
56214,Marge,"homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely."
62303,Marge,"honey, you can be anything you want to be."
64343,Marge,let us in. we have the chosen one!
64400,Marge,"ned, there's only one man i should be eating whipped cream with."
54936,Marge,"did you hear that, homer?"
61011,Marge,but this is the east side.
67367,Marge,"oh, homer. your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
57954,Marge,"no, that was gophers."
56171,Marge,"get a rope, bart!"
59259,Marge,"you know, i saw apu today. he's really frazzled."
56430,Marge,"good morning, dear."
56602,Marge,"hey, i'm just hangin'."
66908,Marge,"""dear friends of the simpson family: we had some sadness and some gladness this year. first the sadness. our little cat, snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. but we bought a new little cat, snowball ii...so i guess life goes on. speaking of life going on, grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. maggie is walking by herself. lisa got straight a's, and bart, well... we love bart. the magic of the season has touched us all..."""
67856,Marge,but mr. schindler...
60366,Marge,the demolition derby? that'll scratch my itch.
56315,Marge,"so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
63815,Marge,food?
63883,Marge,he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary.
62528,Marge,me neither. oh my god! i took the salesman's pen. i'll be right back.
59931,Marge,there's still more meatloaf.
60838,Marge,that museum has been nothing but trouble since it opened.
60895,Marge,grampa! i'm not afraid!
64823,Marge,"well, if he's got you cornered, and milhouse isn't there to help you, there's only one way out: make him feel good about himself."
60423,Marge,of course.
65803,Marge,look at me!
56960,Marge,"why thank you, homie. you might say the extra ingredient is salt."
59728,Marge,"oh. they ought to call that a ""large island iced tea."" no, ""long"" is better."
63387,Marge,he just needs it for walking upstairs.
61793,Marge,these magazines are from before we were married. maybe you should throw them away.
64089,Marge,skee-biddy-bob-boo! dot-doobiddy-dum-doo!
55304,Marge,"now, now, he's an ex-convict. he's paid his debt to society."
59231,Marge,it certainly is. why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
62437,Marge,"oh kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. we're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here."
61311,Marge,that's the rich people's mall. let's shop till we droop!
62537,Marge,i'm singing a song with bart tonight.
66571,Marge,i don't know. uh... how about... that's a lot worse!
64388,Marge,"ned, to make up for what happened, i want to invite you and the boys over to dinner tomorrow night."
63928,Marge,can we use your phone?
61099,Marge,"homer, those are elk."
61800,Marge,thanks for taking the job. i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
63696,Marge,"homer, stop!"
60484,Marge,"oh, where could your father be?"
64723,Marge,yes!
67848,Marge,"homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination."
57716,Marge,"what happened to you, homer? and what have you done to the car?"
65965,Marge,"bart, you're in charge of grampa."
59868,Marge,i thought you had your own court.
65177,Marge,they're selling cds in the restaurant.
55436,Marge,"i'm looking for my sister, stella."
57055,Marge,"lawyers... lawyers. ooh, lionel hutz. ""cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
58645,Marge,that's a risk i'm willing to take. so long!
62739,Marge,really? you manage a whole office?
65231,Marge,you make electricity. it runs the hospital!
64940,Marge,"homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. it's twenty-five years old."
60185,Marge,"oh, it's okay, homie. the bee's all gone."
67384,Marge,"i don't care what i said. this family has had its differences, and we've squabbled, but we never had knife fights before... and i blame this house."
67425,Marge,"well, he's a fine role model. bart, give me that ball!"
57855,Marge,"""you are my sunshine, my only sunshine / you make me happy, when skies are gray / you'll never know, dear / how much i love you / so don't take my sunshine away..."""
60850,Marge,"oh, i can't stop worrying about homer and lisa."
61192,Marge,"moe, i'm glad you're here! i wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so i knitted you a nice warm sweater."
63241,Marge,i overslept!
56003,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
58141,Marge,what's wrong?
55545,Marge,i think one side of our house is sinking.
67680,Marge,i'm for equal rights. but do we really need a whole amendment?
58764,Marge,"well, i guess your new name is really opening doors for you."
63739,Marge,"wait, you mean she danced well, into her seventies? or she danced, well into her seventies?"
66165,Marge,just put on the kiss record.
54961,Marge,"lisa, i hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
56197,Marge,i just think they're neat.
67466,Marge,"here you go, bart. a lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer."
57295,Marge,"girls, lisa. boys kiss girls."
59874,Marge,that's all i ask.
59788,Marge,"c'mon, it'll be fun."
62657,Marge,"well, tell your regular bully. he won't like it one bit."
65085,Marge,this ends now!
63569,Marge,"you see, the problem is, we've grown apart."
54830,Marge,i said crazy house!
66268,Marge,why did i do this for money? why did i do this for money?
57737,Marge,"oh, bart, you didn't have to do that. oh!"
60833,Marge,"well, just a little one."
62770,Marge,"homie, i missed you so much! put your pants back on."
60900,Marge,wow!
58575,Marge,"aww, somebody's in love."
57190,Marge,"come here, maggie."
59867,Marge,"okay, we'll be right out."
58188,Marge,you can't go on that. you have a heart condition.
67772,Marge,it's patty who chose the life of celibacy. selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
57067,Marge,ninety-nine cents!
66348,Marge,that's it. that was the story.
57498,Marge,"homer, i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
56945,Marge,"aw, honey, you're not a monster."
57522,Marge,...and you're from mars.
67359,Marge,"oh, homer."
56784,Marge,marge!
64195,Marge,"well, i'll make you forget all about it."
60994,Marge,"and ned, i haven't seen you this happy in years."
59806,Marge,"okay. now, i wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut."
67665,Marge,"""... soon the rain will fall / my dear one is departing/ but first please heed this call / that always will i love you / my one, my love, my all."""
60077,Marge,"oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade..."
64266,Marge,"henry the fourth, part one... henry the fourth, part two..."
60140,Marge,ahh!!
55769,Marge,oh my god. he's dead?
63620,Marge,i wish there was a gym for us regular ladies.
57007,Marge,what are you talking about?
62032,Marge,"homie, i think you did great. and to celebrate, i made omelets from the eggs people threw at our house."
64109,Marge,"the giant's causeway is the result of a volcanic eruption. well kids, isn't that an informational fact? kids?"
62619,Marge,what the hello kitty?
67641,Marge,"what are you saying, homer?"
57892,Marge,did you ever tell him that?
66190,Marge,they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks.
60846,Marge,i agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. i had to share mine with my uncle.
67165,Marge,oh. well... all right. when do we start?
62985,Marge,class all the way.
67858,Marge,i never got any. and i never painted again.
61216,Marge,"i don't think maggie wants you out of her life, moe."
57412,Marge,i'm third generation.
55850,Marge,oooh! oooooh! oooooooh!
55721,Marge,"while we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember great aunt gladys."
61453,Marge,"and today, lewis' promise has been fulfilled."
59899,Marge,"oh. oh, i'd do anything."
67834,Marge,"oh, all right. if he passes obedience school, we can keep him."
63734,Marge,it's upstairs in my disappointment closet.
61913,Marge,"when we published the story, we received the school's highest award."
57571,Marge,you see? a little persistence and patience paid off. that'll be 300 dollars.
65424,Marge,do a lot of people pay?
65453,Marge,"homer! this is bad for you, too!"
65697,Marge,did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
67786,Marge,"well, you want to try that h. powell?"
61691,Marge,listen... i'm married.
60471,Marge,dude sure got his comeuppance.
65266,Marge,"why do you say ""future?"" this is now."
56878,Marge,i'm happy for the school. it sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
64707,Marge,perestroika?
66570,Marge,well... it could be worse.
60407,Marge,"remember, homie. i'm doing this for us. see you on monday."
56068,Marge,yeah.
63433,Marge,which one?
62046,Marge,please give me back my boy! i just want to tell him i love him one more time.
66470,Marge,you know lisa's a vegetarian.
55298,Marge,"you've got a wonderful family, homer. please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
61308,Marge,"come on, homie. we'll go to the ""make your own sundae"" place."
61935,Marge,we've gotta go now!
58821,Marge,"it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?"
55864,Marge,mr. hutz! this was all a misunderstanding. i didn't mean to take anything.
65347,Marge,that's odd.
58532,Marge,"he didn't go to nelson's, did he?"
66579,Marge,"here's what i would do... in the middle of the night, clean bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
60584,Marge,"no, no, no, let's just keep playing. what's the score?"
58746,Marge,locked.
66532,Marge,yes.
57008,Marge,what?!
59968,Marge,"i don't know if it matters, but it was a time magazine. does that matter?"
55761,Marge,"well, honey, i--"
57759,Marge,see!
59782,Marge,"homer, get up! up, up, up!"
67527,Marge,humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?
62694,Marge,"ooh, carl."
63469,Marge,longer!
67885,Marge,"mr. burns, i've had enough of your... posing. i can finish the portrait myself."
64815,Marge,"homer, lisa, could you please step outside? i have a few choice words for this gentleman."
67598,Marge,"well... i guess i can't, which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons."
62954,Marge,"listen, bub. we are out of the marriage counseling business. and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. but not me, 'cause i think they're disgusting."
58419,Marge,"good night, homie."
60572,Marge,did it again!
59763,Marge,"come on, homer. they're only in town for eight months, then they're gone!"
65889,Marge,it's as yummy as your poorly-produced local commercial said.
56252,Marge,"you, too."
65151,Marge,knitting one sweater for someone costs twenty-seven americans their jobs.
61073,Marge,"lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. but it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. so i can't apologize."
63653,Marge,of course.
58703,Marge,no...
57662,Marge,he is quite a charmer. your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
63570,Marge,another thing... i don't know where you go at night.
61619,Marge,sure there are downsides. but a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
56100,Marge,"bart, it's time to get ready for the show."
64384,Marge,why don't you just roll me?
60733,Marge,dad left the milk out / yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck...
62307,Marge,"you've got a big house, ned. if you need extra money, why don't you rent out a room?"
60695,Marge,i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing.
55454,Marge,what!? what would help!?
66072,Marge,"gee, i thought you'd be some kind of creep. but you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--"
57038,Marge,sleep tight.
66012,Marge,did you pass?
66667,Marge,those are in the kitchen!
55729,Marge,oh. are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
57148,Marge,"i used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. i can show you."
56645,Marge,"""australia was originally founded as a settlement for british convicts."" lisa, watch your camera."
55825,Marge,you lost five percent of your brain.
65171,Marge,nowhere scary!
67298,Marge,really?
60921,Marge,"you know, i really do miss being a lady."
56112,Marge,but that's the longest.
62028,Marge,"oh homie, don't worry. i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea."
63417,Marge,"""school bus..."" ""bart and lisa?"" bart and lisa are almost home from school! and we have a dentist's appointment at three o'clock! thanks, maggie!"
66575,Marge,"/ no good, no good. what do i do? what do i do?"
59730,Marge,mmm.
58717,Marge,yeah.
58795,Marge,what a lovely home!
67413,Marge,well i think the non-card question is a valid one.
63585,Marge,"great. now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then?"
59989,Marge,"oh, no! it's eating us!"
64579,Marge,"oh my god, homer's gone!"
56031,Marge,i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
58437,Marge,safe at last.
63533,Marge,homer! i'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
55473,Marge,"lisa, i know a song that will cheer you up. there once was an ugly duckling..."
60221,Marge,"look, i don't want to start a whole thing with this."
66653,Marge,"really? but the franchise agreement says mother hubbard inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. clause twenty-seven c-3."
59116,Marge,it's true. he does.
57808,Marge,you've got to get him out of there!
67875,Marge,"well, maybe not, but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
59760,Marge,squibs!
58858,Marge,"geez! try the gas pedal, gramma. it's right there, next to the brake. oh, forgodssa-- go back to new jersey..."
54910,Marge,if you eat too much you'll have nightmares.
60884,Marge,i'm sending the cat up with your lunches.
60162,Marge,ooh... it must be chinese new year.
59965,Marge,"ooh, you're right. and that's not his wife."
64675,Marge,"homer, can we please find bart?"
64349,Marge,it tastes like... cuddling! / it tastes like clean clothes!
55869,Marge,now you kids be good while mother's in prison.
57021,Marge,let's find out.
58091,Marge,that house is on fire.
56738,Marge,uh-oh...
62556,Marge,no!
63277,Marge,"oh, it is not! watch me."
57828,Marge,i said we were having a special guest tonight -- mr. tim conway.
55532,Marge,well punish him!
63193,Marge,"i say ""cool waves."""
54598,Marge,this place is just like the brochure... autumn leaves...bull sessions...
56145,Marge,"homey, i'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with ned? your family needs you too."
67403,Marge,"homer, i am not sleeping with the lights on. they're just children's stories. they can't hurt you."
56491,Marge,i hope you kept the homie fires burning...
67619,Marge,"yes, i do."
64674,Marge,"walt, it's a nice face, but i don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie."
67904,Marge,sure.
59037,Marge,homer! don't you think you're spoiling...
55106,Marge,bart?
63007,Marge,"well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse."
60984,Marge,"oh sure. i mean, not on your father's salary, but i could... give piano lessons."
67461,Marge,"well, i'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
59563,Marge,"oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. make it part of the background noise of your relationship. that's how i polished homer into the perfect... homer! no, that's ice!"
55978,Marge,i'm not sure.
62709,Marge,i thought they might enjoy it if i took them here.
63314,Marge,how could you kill your own mother?
66687,Marge,you always do the right thing... sort of.
65721,Marge,i'm going to bed.
61804,Marge,i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
55658,Marge,"lisa, time for your feed --"
63057,Marge,"homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home."
57385,Marge,he sexually harassed me.
60887,Marge,why did homer buy those? no one's ever gonna use 'em.
58792,Marge,"well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
57383,Marge,careful of the apple pie on the seat.
67258,Marge,'bye. we miss you.
60207,Marge,maybe there's murder afoot!
65714,Marge,you've been through a traumatic experience. are you sure you wanna go to work today?
66296,Marge,it was me! i was the one who told the fbi.
54693,Marge,duffman!
57147,Marge,what about the symphony -- or the theater?
61204,Marge,i don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
63177,Marge,"excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. what happened?"
58323,Marge,we don't have a clapper.
67057,Marge,come on. you can do better than that.
61038,Marge,"bart, you can hear us?"
58421,Marge,"oh. oh, did you want me to...?"
55486,Marge,where'd you get all the money?
61010,Marge,"i never thought i would say this, but i think we have to move."
66431,Marge,"if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? we were just trying to be... kind."
66143,Marge,mr. burnsum! you should treat these poor people with respect!
55328,Marge,homer!
61277,Marge,"homer, you couldn't be in more trouble. they're going to put your head on a pike. they're practicing with melons."
63946,Marge,"okay, but first the chest."
64379,Marge,garden view?
62716,Marge,"ned, are you checking up on me?"
55551,Marge,"where does the bible say ""racket?""...."
59241,Marge,"you did it, homie!"
54756,Marge,"well, it's not that i don't love the guy. i'm always sticking up for him. it's just that he's so self-centered."
61546,Marge,"the doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter."
64066,Marge,it's irresistible. you ask him to do something and he does it. he's like a
63550,Marge,damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!
63512,Marge,i don't want to live like that.
61824,Marge,i guess i was the last one.
57083,Marge,"my son may not be perfect, but i know in my heart he's not a shoplifter."
66080,Marge,"ooh, i love that show!"
55244,Marge,no.
59267,Marge,ohhhhh.
55192,Marge,where's maggie? where's maggie?
56830,Marge,it's for your own safety.
54628,Marge,why not?
67431,Marge,a simpson on a t-shirt. i never thought i'd see the day.
60169,Marge,"new underpants? homer, what are you up to?"
67120,Marge,the place where the waiters sing.
59060,Marge,"oh homer, not again."
65290,Marge,"homie, i'm glad you're passionate, i just hope you're not riling people up with your show."
59520,Marge,"well, the fabric really brings out the red in your neck."
62852,Marge,"oh, you seem sweet, but i could never have a favorite."
59933,Marge,"i don't do things that way, lisa."
62926,Marge,"thank you, honey, for opening my eyes."
63125,Marge,you really made my daughter's christmas.
64197,Marge,ooh. the label is all in lowercase.
56781,Marge,you just don't want to take that test.
65943,Marge,what do you think?
64067,Marge,genie.
60932,Marge,"homer, for the last time..."
63320,Marge,"homer, what took you so long? the game's almost over."
57023,Marge,"so, mother simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
59946,Marge,i won. don't take that away from me.
67212,Marge,"don't strain yourself, dear."
56806,Marge,thanks benevenstanciano.
66669,Marge,homer simpson!
64417,Marge,"the yawning monkey? ""the pair of tongs?"""
66345,Marge,it's not a secret. it's a funny story.
54901,Marge,"bart, wipe your feet."
65990,Marge,you'd better be asking for something p.c.: pie or cake.
56653,Marge,we have them in america. they're called bullfrogs.
66735,Marge,you sound great! your licks are really... juicy.
57854,Marge,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
59757,Marge,"after we got maggie to a safe house, of course."
65824,Marge,"oh, dang it!"
67862,Marge,clever title.
61553,Marge,i don't talk like that.
63227,Marge,"oh yes. i'm so proud, i feel my chest might burst. can you edit that? i don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
67254,Marge,"yes, bart."
64427,Marge,that's right! it is!
66263,Marge,what would baby jesus do?
66228,Marge,what about your own children?
66994,Marge,"ohhh, homie. i think i'm going to be sick."
58073,Marge,"oh, thank you bart, thank you lisa, for all your help!"
56964,Marge,i didn't mean to take sides. i just got caught up in the rhythm.
64574,Marge,do you have any safety tips?
62631,Marge,"you know, if i was born three months later, emerald would be my birthstone."
61558,Marge,"oh, my head!"
55533,Marge,how could you let this happen?
57111,Marge,it's sick! and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. like mr. burns.
54837,Marge,you've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
57309,Marge,so where do you want to show off your new hip togs? the sherbet shoppe? the candle district? big sue's tap water taffy?
60142,Marge,"concentrate, homer."
54707,Marge,how much money did he piss away on this?
59671,Marge,like the one in berlin?
54765,Marge,do i have to do this?
62111,Marge,honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. what would the kids and i do if something happened to you?
67525,Marge,"a sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of msg."
63632,Marge,"homie, i'm back!"
56880,Marge,"when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. after that, she never forgot him."
58921,Marge,"lisa, we got another postcard from your father!"
54637,Marge,i will!
55856,Marge,ninety-eight point six. you're fine.
66498,Marge,nothing for thirty years. you're perfect for each other.
59324,Marge,this chair lift sure goes high...
67796,Marge,"ohh, dear."
66929,Marge,"i get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, homer."
63814,Marge,none of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you.
60607,Marge,i knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream.
64831,Marge,homer!
61284,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
62470,Marge,okay.
57487,Marge,this down here in the first place!
59174,Marge,"oh, it was an accident! an accident!"
62099,Marge,"selma, she's beautiful!"
66492,Marge,yes.
63801,Marge,"ooo, ""regularsville."" sounds like my kind of place!"
59239,Marge,"he shouldn't have deceived me, but i'm just so relieved lenny's okay."
62242,Marge,you didn't validate my parking.
64396,Marge,"oh, nothing fancy..."
58412,Marge,what are you doing?!
56405,Marge,i don't approve of that.
67675,Marge,whoa--
66552,Marge,lisa's door's unlocked!
61169,Marge,they had to admit homosexuals.
59401,Marge,"oh, my. ooh-hoo. it's going to cost us $500 a week to keep duncan!"
55836,Marge,i know.
60774,Marge,"wait, wait! my son, my husband and the van houten boy are in there!"
58889,Marge,i guess...
67402,Marge,"children, bedtime."
56663,Marge,homer!
56676,Marge,"homer, homer why didn't you tell me?"
66679,Marge,"if someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it?"
56013,Marge,chasm?!
60689,Marge,oh well.
63975,Marge,what have you done with the old ones?
61255,Marge,"oh no, they heard me."
66246,Marge,"sweetie, about the submarine... what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? i'm going shopping tomorrow."
61575,Marge,"look, i'm not sure this place is working. the drinkers are smoking, the smokers are drinking, and the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves."
66347,Marge,"okay, so helen lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
62027,Marge,solar.
67512,Marge,"hmmm, well, thank you. gee, everyone's so nice here at the monster truck rally. look, homer, champagne!"
62181,Marge,the prison snitch is killed! and that could be you! because you're the prison snitch!
60419,Marge,this campus is so lush and verdant.
66504,Marge,"after thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right."
63690,Marge,but our happiness was about to unravel just like kevin costner's career: because of the postman.
67429,Marge,"now, homer."
54942,Marge,stick to the subject.
56808,Marge,excuse me...
62022,Marge,who wants to help me clear the table?
63888,Marge,no. all i care about is finding my boy. and then i'm never letting him out of my sight again...
56490,Marge,oh really?
54991,Marge,"well homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
60498,Marge,i love these jesters. they're exactly what i need to forget about my first husband.
65059,Marge,why did you seat us in siberia?
58920,Marge,"oh, all right. good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip."
55491,Marge,my name is marge bouvier. i'm here about your ad.
62998,Marge,what are those noises? they sounded zoological!
57723,Marge,"well, it is. i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
59292,Marge,"you know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing."
58123,Marge,for once we're gonna celebrate christmas as a family.
62233,Marge,"homer, i know where ray is."
56139,Marge,"oooh, the walls are melting again."
60266,Marge,"lisa, it was probably an accident."
55656,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart, you're too little."
58643,Marge,"no, no, you just stay put."
59527,Marge,"come on, bart. while your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip."
63330,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie -- i want to snuggle, but i'm just not feeling it."
55499,Marge,"you know, you look a little flushed. maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people."
67470,Marge,"homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters."
65680,Marge,"play along! ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. glug, glug, glug. that's a good little mammal."
64588,Marge,you said it's your lunch. eat it.
60749,Marge,"accidentally giving me breast implants is not a ""simple misunderstanding."" my surgery was botched!"
58656,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. you got the highest grade in the class."
59163,Marge,who wants pork chops?
57407,Marge,"""maison derriere""?! i can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart to work there?"
63885,Marge,pull over -- bart's in this field!
57126,Marge,"can we get rid of this ""ayatollah"" t-shirt? khomeini died years ago."
58857,Marge,s.u.v. coming through. open up for marge. thank you! whoaaa! daylight! c'mon. c'mon.
64632,Marge,"ever hear of the expression ""not in my backyard?"" well, that!"
60361,Marge,"well, i'll be in the kitchen if you need me."
65294,Marge,i listen to him.
62091,Marge,wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
67921,Marge,why?
63090,Marge,really? you think people would be kent-rested in me?
55939,Marge,"good, now you hold maggie. i'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop."
58850,Marge,"outta my way, nature!"
63079,Marge,that's so wasteful.
56722,Marge,now throw compost on it!
64375,Marge,cuddling's for after.
55741,Marge,"oh my god, you're delirious."
64283,Marge,what was that?!
55187,Marge,"no, homer."
60110,Marge,"homer! homer, you're alive!"
65515,Marge,"...and that's how berber carpet got its name, according to some. lisa, how was your day?"
63520,Marge,"well, i guess he told me not to worry."
56946,Marge,"hmm. bart, what's wrong? there's something a little off about your hug."
60219,Marge,"wow moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
60012,Marge,where did it go?
63662,Marge,"homer, your behavior is heinous."
57902,Marge,"oh, honey, i can't right now. bart's gonna be late!"
63880,Marge,it shows you care.
56225,Marge,i love ya! i love ya! i love ya!
59293,Marge,haven't any of you ever had a dream?
57740,Marge,"oh, he's so smart!"
57649,Marge,bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
64119,Marge,it's not a big deal. we'll just go to city hall and get married there.
59536,Marge,"all right. i'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, vicki."
57365,Marge,"listen to me. the instant that homer's in any kind of danger, i want you to throw in this towel and stop the fight."
62672,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride."
60059,Marge,the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
59493,Marge,this looks like a terrible place to relax. we're gonna get you to a--
61404,Marge,"""chapter one: starts and beginnings."" ""swim, swim, swim, thought the whale, flapping his... floppers."" brownie break!"
56272,Marge,"oh, look. there's bart. wave to him."
57304,Marge,"isn't this fun, honey?"
57726,Marge,"homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. your homemade liquor is exploding again."
54744,Marge,we're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. no fishing.
62763,Marge,"charles, please -- your son might see this."
67468,Marge,homer!
56950,Marge,oooh. these look good. guilt-free steakfish filets.
55535,Marge,"homer, do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper?"
65371,Marge,ooh! an apron with a sonnet!
66043,Marge,wish i could get a little of that attention.
61077,Marge,"goodbye, homer! i try to save our marriage, and you just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends!"
62092,Marge,"go, go, go!"
61836,Marge,i look up to you...
57116,Marge,who knocked down the pins?
65178,Marge,back to the car.
61848,Marge,it's the best i could do on such short notice.
64788,Marge,get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! it's picture day tomorrow!
57563,Marge,when can i start? what's my territory?
67157,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
58425,Marge,ooh! ooh! ooh! ooh! sorry! sorry! sorry! do you want me to?
65466,Marge,"sorry sweetie, i just needed to get that out of my system."
54647,Marge,"look, a wedding!"
55143,Marge,fruit leather... tree fresh imitation orange drink... krusty brand duck sausage pizza...
64315,Marge,"i can't back out. this is for a cause that's bigger than i am. if gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, i can do this. besides, i'm a woman. he'll probably go easy on me."
55282,Marge,don't lie to me. are you having an affair with this woman?
55813,Marge,i have no idea. unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
57660,Marge,...pimento nose... and voila! mommy's patented happy-cracker snack platter!
59260,Marge,apu told me all eight babies have colic. although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
61406,Marge,temperance barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham...
62196,Marge,"oh, i am so glad you think so."
67566,Marge,violence-in children's-program-ming.
58623,Marge,"oh, lord."
60827,Marge,i'm never gonna go to paris.
55581,Marge,it's 9:30 in the morning.
65035,Marge,dr. zander? kareem abdul jabbar? anyone?
66757,Marge,"abe simpson, please."
58930,Marge,the light's on. all systems are ding-dong!
57252,Marge,i can't take this anymore!
56485,Marge,homer--
61544,Marge,"enjoy your tour, and take it easy on mr. curtis. your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery."
66918,Marge,homer?
56711,Marge,"well, homer."
60189,Marge,how did you get my number?
64140,Marge,"okay, it's go time."
67542,Marge,"""... in your otherwise fine programming. yours truly, marge simpson."""
59602,Marge,oh... i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane.
62915,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
64439,Marge,then don't have any.
64206,Marge,the only person getting an education here today was me! in how bad it is!
55808,Marge,p.u.
59300,Marge,"excellent, ramrod. civilized people solve their disputes with words."
54643,Marge,steffan!
62195,Marge,when i was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
65832,Marge,the top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
55633,Marge,we're going to have another baby.
65725,Marge,no one was laughing. you kept it a secret!
56304,Marge,i knew i shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
64973,Marge,shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo!
61446,Marge,"finally, henry's daughter elizabeth became queen. england's power was never greater, and british actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age."
64187,Marge,try these beets. i boiled all the red out.
63942,Marge,my husband!
66297,Marge,i was just trying to do the right thing! who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
66664,Marge,homie... i think we're not alone.
63983,Marge,never being a grandmother?
57137,Marge,bye bye!
56418,Marge,homer! homie? hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.
59316,Marge,"to be fair, not all evil robots are killers."
62120,Marge,that's right. it's much less expensive than the leading clown-based cereal. you just have to assemble it yourself.
63351,Marge,are bees building hives in your diaper genie?...
59532,Marge,"that's wonderful, honey. we should ask your father, though. where is he, anyway?"
61134,Marge,to hell with the livery commission!
64784,Marge,we'll know.
65542,Marge,looks like the red light's on.
67683,Marge,"... and in another article, i found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!"
63026,Marge,"a dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more!"
56032,Marge,"i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
54785,Marge,i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
60290,Marge,"well, what about this? ""the duff book of world records."""
55837,Marge,"oh my god, it's my old boyfriend, artie ziff."
56154,Marge,i think you'll find that escape is impossible. now each one of you take a floor and get started.
61889,Marge,"well, i'm glad everything worked out so well."
54815,Marge,"whatever it does, it's doing it now."
64799,Marge,there are no books in the car.
58493,Marge,"well, you're not thomas edison."
63850,Marge,harms no one? explain that to... well what about... i think you forgot about... hmm...
56993,Marge,normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on tv. but this season...
63921,Marge,i don't know...
63689,Marge,there is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about. a turbulent part.
56060,Marge,"hi, homie."
64493,Marge,"homer, who's that?"
65122,Marge,did you have a hard day too?
65696,Marge,maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
67943,Marge,"great, i'll come with you. shouldn't you bundle up? here, let me enchant your pants."
62455,Marge,i learned about it in here.
57951,Marge,this is crazy! i'm not a witch!
67825,Marge,"oh, i don't know, i just dip in and out... i'm only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse..."
59579,Marge,"yes. well, i guess i'll go roll socks. it's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done."
67679,Marge,"we were seniors in high school, but we had never even met."
62932,Marge,that's you!
56005,Marge,"well, bye."
59159,Marge,"oh honey, i'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride."
60026,Marge,not right now. your father's in there and --
66163,Marge,must find way... to blame myself.
56241,Marge,"homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class."
60825,Marge,you have to do something to protect my husband.
58432,Marge,"when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our saturdays? driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"
63676,Marge,don't you remember what today is?
67937,Marge,"wow, moe -- you're a troll!"
54759,Marge,"... he drinks out of the carton. he never changes the baby. when he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. i guess that's it. oh no. wait. he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. that's all i can think of right now. i guess you're all tired and i want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
66107,Marge,what the?
60055,Marge,why did you put my name on the sign?
60742,Marge,"oh my god, is that me?!"
55047,Marge,what about bart?
61964,Marge,stop making a scene!
55621,Marge,"kit-ty? ""kit-ty""?"
59524,Marge,"homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for you."
64087,Marge,"oooo, jazz!"
67251,Marge,but bart doesn't speak french.
66713,Marge,but where? i still don't know!
56747,Marge,"homer, homer find a place for all these little miracles."
65270,Marge,"not since they passed ""homer's law."" oh honey, why don't you just relax and bake something?"
57529,Marge,bad cat!
67265,Marge,lisa!
59183,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
57792,Marge,"well, ned, you don't have to stand for that. you just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
64135,Marge,i can't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates! 'cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
55819,Marge,of course.
58834,Marge,what in blazes?
56242,Marge,today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair.
56391,Marge,this is just what i was hoping for. spending the day together as a family.
64480,Marge,a sport that encourages hand-holding.
55943,Marge,uh... mr. hutz?
63174,Marge,my childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
63428,Marge,tell me later!
61712,Marge,we were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
60993,Marge,"ms. sloane, i loved you in ""sleeping with pinocchio"" and ""honey, i scotchguarded the kids""."
61963,Marge,"stow it, you two!"
58518,Marge,"oh, i've never been so proud. you both deserve a big, big reward!"
61827,Marge,even the pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
55647,Marge,"oh, honey... honey... honey... honey. could you please be quiet?"
55679,Marge,i don't know if i like you reading all those cardiology books.
65360,Marge,"i'm trying to make the best of things, but i'm worried maggie is falling in with a bad crowd."
59842,Marge,"oh, jack... you threw it all away, over a stupid feud with skinner."
67395,Marge,ewww.
55369,Marge,that's a very clever idea!
58877,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you can come out now."
61120,Marge,"oh, a mom's work is never done."
57265,Marge,it's grampa. and it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
55492,Marge,single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. must like monkeys. non-smoker preferred.
56736,Marge,"oh, this place is so big. do you think we should split up and look for them, homie? homie?"
67175,Marge,umm-hmm. but i think i'll do much better tomorrow night.
58012,Marge,"so like i said, i've never had a tick burrow in so deep. little guy's just got a mind of his own."
59048,Marge,"oh, homie."
59162,Marge,"this is so exciting, homie. your first restaurant review."
67435,Marge,look! the crosstown bridge!
63470,Marge,where's bart?
65069,Marge,"well, you married someone whose first name is ""fat""!"
54892,Marge,"well, i can't defend everything he does. but let's face it, all bart and milhouse have is each other. they're too young for girls. and they're a popular target for bullies. and in the christmas pageant, they're always sheep. please, please, let them be friends!"
57907,Marge,homer!
54715,Marge,that'll stop her from seeing him.
58479,Marge,you could raise some emus...
58258,Marge,"homer, quiet. you'll queer the deal."
67222,Marge,"oh, bart. excuse me, sir. the party next door seems to be a little raucous. could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please?"
62816,Marge,"ooh, like the paper towels. go on..."
56742,Marge,"okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
67520,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. a heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try."
57620,Marge,i heard that!
60526,Marge,bert and ernie left it to your imagination.
67463,Marge,the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress.
66052,Marge,so many unhappy men. how sad.
64339,Marge,that was so noble of apu to give his life for us.
60624,Marge,"freshen your drinks, ladies?"
62921,Marge,"wow, darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive. and his ship was the beagle, which reminds me of snoopy... my favorite peanut!"
56144,Marge,"honey, i'm so glad you're home--"
67279,Marge,all this senseless violence. i don't understand its appeal.
56014,Marge,"stop that, bart. homer, speak to him."
62050,Marge,which book?
59273,Marge,"okay, daddy-o."
59425,Marge,"glad you made it, ned."
63340,Marge,exactly.
66223,Marge,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
58763,Marge,where'd you meet this trent steel? moe's?
63427,Marge,we're gonna make it!
54733,Marge,"now, homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. remember last year at the winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
60798,Marge,i need that tape!
60436,Marge,that car's as big as all outdoors.
61533,Marge,i never want you in this house again!
64889,Marge,everyone shush!
61228,Marge,"i'm not fooling around, people! park your keisters in front of that tv! now!"
64651,Marge,stop that sniffing! it's not for you! they're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.
66708,Marge,"don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
55054,Marge,"homer, i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary."
63366,Marge,"just come back alive, okay?"
64029,Marge,only if it lasts forever.
55317,Marge,i guess you're just too young to understand.
66170,Marge,really?
62291,Marge,the stars are falling to the earth!
59820,Marge,i might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
58458,Marge,we have to get out of here!
60033,Marge,breakfast!
62809,Marge,"homer, i can't believe i was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
63146,Marge,"homie, wake up! i rented that negligee you like."
61101,Marge,"lisa, welcome to love. it's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. but then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts."
62308,Marge,what are you two doing?
61631,Marge,"oh, it's very sweet, but i don't need..."
56638,Marge,oh my.
59364,Marge,will that really work?
56763,Marge,"bart, leave that crowbar here. you know i don't like you prying and jimmying."
58760,Marge,"oh, lord."
59750,Marge,"oh, this? hmm. i think it is."
59015,Marge,but we lost the olympics to shelbyville.
64075,Marge,"it's okay, homie -- you can have my viewer."
63434,Marge,shake it! shake it!
64818,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie -- you seem upset."
62150,Marge,and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries. it was twenty years ago!
56368,Marge,"no, i've already planned our vacation. we're going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary. i understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
61534,Marge,"oh, what do you think?"
65862,Marge,"but if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside..."
58340,Marge,"that ""mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
58932,Marge,anyone? anyone at all?
61635,Marge,shame on you two creeps!
64966,Marge,"he loves it! he calls me his ""silver belle!"""
60732,Marge,"oh my special little guys. you're okay, you're okay!"
64301,Marge,"nelson, you really have a knack for this."
66954,Marge,homer!
58490,Marge,"well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children."
57015,Marge,"when i asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" you go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
65365,Marge,look! a shooting star!
54766,Marge,"we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble, but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
56875,Marge,"homer, come quick! bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
63580,Marge,i told you twenty times! you never listen!
61523,Marge,no we didn't.
57861,Marge,great! we're all going to new york!
55536,Marge,earl warren wasn't a stripper.
61497,Marge,"sweetie, you seem so blue. did the last of something die?"
54805,Marge,but he's your boss. do you have to mail it right this minute?
65344,Marge,now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
59837,Marge,"just till you make it. remember, i believe in you."
58207,Marge,homer!!
55654,Marge,everyone agreed that lisa was a beautiful baby...
65967,Marge,"so what do you say, moe? will you give me a smile?"
57105,Marge,"since i got my present early, i think you should get yours early too."
61360,Marge,but i haven't endorsed it yet!
60061,Marge,"yup, delaware's got it all."
65513,Marge,it's about not agreeing on something.
66231,Marge,this is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!
57958,Marge,what a day! they found out i was a witch so i had to leave my family.
56159,Marge,"homer, what's going on down there?"
57211,Marge,i wish i'd pay more attention.
55687,Marge,"oooh, it looks like everyone in springfield showed up for this."
65663,Marge,that's not applesauce...
61057,Marge,huh?
66718,Marge,suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
59801,Marge,a sunset!
56077,Marge,think before you say each word.
58680,Marge,no.
56630,Marge,"stop it, stop it. can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!"
64917,Marge,you wanna stay up and talk a while? i'm not sleepy.
62549,Marge,she's not going to get over this quickly -- i know women.
57272,Marge,"what you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating u.s. law."
63791,Marge,"sweetie, don't you think your mom might have a trick up her sleeve?"
58307,Marge,"all right, all right, now. you're over-stimulated. let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed."
58276,Marge,i didn't mean any disrespect. i just can't figure it out.
64639,Marge,homer? i'm-- you!
58429,Marge,"oh, yeah. he's really special."
66949,Marge,"he's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard."
66952,Marge,"you look very intelligent, dear."
64967,Marge,why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and homer? our marriage is rock solid!
59284,Marge,all it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease.
61049,Marge,"homer, no scissors!"
58194,Marge,how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
64231,Marge,fine! you can have your key back!
63046,Marge,how could you eat that goo? you don't know what galaxy it's from!
54784,Marge,"well, i think what you're doing for mrs. glick is very nice. the poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
64517,Marge,"oooh, a cookbook!"
66042,Marge,"let's just enjoy our happiness, homie. accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman. and i think bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior."
62246,Marge,"oh, so i've been replaced by a machine?"
67409,Marge,homer... i'm a bailey booster.
60161,Marge,"aw, i'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
55090,Marge,"dear lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little timmy o'toole, trapped in that well."
56021,Marge,that's not true.
66510,Marge,why can't kids still watch captain kangaroo?
59714,Marge,"are you kidding? there's funky winkerbean! over here, funky! look, it's the noid! avoid the noid! he ruins pizzas!"
59481,Marge,"actually, i took the picture, so i gave my prize to the orphanage."
56951,Marge,"ooo, tres bien."
64418,Marge,okay!
63157,Marge,gil?!!
56825,Marge,i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
56302,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
54933,Marge,"don't worry, he'll be here."
59673,Marge,"to be honest, it's a little chilly."
61259,Marge,"yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
65855,Marge,thank you.
58582,Marge,"oh, that's your cure for everything."
65426,Marge,"bart, no dinner means no dessert."
62576,Marge,you're joking. you've gotta be joking.
66230,Marge,quit talking about that baby!
65675,Marge,made? why didn't you just buy him a toy?
59900,Marge,why don't we stop this nonsense. i'm not mad anymore.
58950,Marge,"uh, i guess."
57752,Marge,"well, i'm sorry!"
63694,Marge,"unfortunately, as i later learned, that wasn't heroin. it was insulin."
62035,Marge,"all too well. rap music belongs in the rubbish bin. it encourages punching, boastfulness, and rudeness to ""ho's."""
57634,Marge,"shary, you did the best you could. but you can't change this family. neither can i. from now on i'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the ride."
57419,Marge,the house is perfectly fine!
64342,Marge,"no! when we get you to the safe zone, we can cure your father!"
61885,Marge,"bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
66900,Marge,they sure did... casino management.
58028,Marge,"oh, bart and lisa! you remember your father, apu. well, this is your father, apu's mother."
64994,Marge,"walther, when a man puts something on a frisbee, he should stand by it."
66339,Marge,"well, he's down to two beers in the shower..."
62850,Marge,wha--?!
59909,Marge,"hey, grampa's running!"
57012,Marge,"oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
62201,Marge,"homer, do something about this leak!"
67267,Marge,you sure have taken a shine to little adil.
62064,Marge,because she's bringing over someone very special. her fiancée.
62226,Marge,geez louise...
66903,Marge,"ooo, careful, homer."
57864,Marge,wow! i feel like such a nobody.
63101,Marge,"well, homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. good job. very thorough."
57963,Marge,it's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
64489,Marge,he usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds. want some coffee?
56570,Marge,lowenstein.
60668,Marge,"i'm so glad this all worked out. thanks for saving my husband, chief."
63995,Marge,"okay, you two. lights out."
59642,Marge,i don't like you ogling her.
64768,Marge,that is so sweet!
66468,Marge,it's not a punishment. but you can't just eat dinner. you have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
56346,Marge,"oh, wait, wait, that's no good. i know, your grandfather."
54662,Marge,let go of him! what kind of jerk strangles a little boy?
57722,Marge,"homer, that's very clever!"
58327,Marge,what on earth possessed you to get an earring?
61907,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
65123,Marge,"it's big to you. would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"
55293,Marge,"all our money's tied up in this woman. if she fails, we're broke. if she succeeds, i have no husband. i don't know what to root for."
61915,Marge,"chloe left town as soon as barney proposed. i would've followed her, but my plans changed when god brought me a wonderful little boy... bart, stop that!"
60239,Marge,good. i'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
56615,Marge,you've worked hard at the bowling alley. why don't you ask for a raise?
56961,Marge,what's wrong lisa? didn't you get enough lamb chops?
61984,Marge,"i know, i used to think of moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. but now that i've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded."
57047,Marge,fresh chocolate chip cookies.
55892,Marge,"you got a letter too, bart."
63462,Marge,be my guest.
67104,Marge,"no way, jose."
66946,Marge,"we could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary."
56234,Marge,"oh homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better."
62962,Marge,all he did was try to help a young couple find their way. does he really deserve to get strung up for that?
66912,Marge,"all right, children. let me have those letters. i'll send them to santa's workshop at the north pole."
63237,Marge,"oh, homie! you make each eight-year interval better than the last!"
61477,Marge,"listen, mr. hobo. you may not have laundry to wash, but i do. now what do you want to show me?"
64492,Marge,homie! we're going to vancouver!
61865,Marge,it's nice to be appreciated.
57049,Marge,they're all gone. the whole batch.
65381,Marge,he won't leave the car.
61688,Marge,you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
60206,Marge,you found a corpse when you were twelve? no wonder you've been so traumatized.
65556,Marge,"homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?"
58754,Marge,"homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. why don't you talk to the producers of the show? maybe they'll make your character suave again."
57664,Marge,"homer, didn't john seem a little... festive to you?"
63119,Marge,"lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
64133,Marge,"there is no ""we"" in wedding!"
66584,Marge,"oh, thank god."
67824,Marge,"oooh, this one looks very reputable."
61369,Marge,awww...
62959,Marge,don't give up on buck. there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place.
56172,Marge,homie!
62160,Marge,my kids are on your boat -- turn back!
63763,Marge,"lurleen lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and i'm gonna fill it."
66939,Marge,good bless him.
62347,Marge,"homer, before i take the kids, i want you to swear you're not up to something."
63994,Marge,are your parents okay with that? they've never met us.
63966,Marge,what would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time i had my doubts about you?
62264,Marge,to give these germans das boot? jawohl!
56040,Marge,that's not fair. the lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
62121,Marge,we saved fifty cents on that purchase!
64716,Marge,first we're visiting grampa.
55199,Marge,"homer, for the last time, i am not putting that in."
58940,Marge,"no, but if you'll just ring the--"
61271,Marge,"turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
56072,Marge,i won sixty dollars last night.
55302,Marge,i do.
61331,Marge,"ou-ay ow-knay, i-ay as-way oung-yay unce-way oo-tay."
57622,Marge,that's carl.
59690,Marge,"oh, i might be able to help you..."
61342,Marge,"excuse me, everyone. i'm a mother."
60118,Marge,and unusual.
62385,Marge,but i'm not coming back yet.
54755,Marge,"oh, homer."
66847,Marge,dare i say it? yippee!
64601,Marge,i give up!
57112,Marge,for what?
61844,Marge,"yes, it's something, dear."
60193,Marge,i will!
64264,Marge,now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare's greatest roles: king lear... hamlet...
62633,Marge,oh god.
64184,Marge,maybe i'll keep this to myself for a while.
62930,Marge,she's married to buck mitchell! i bet that's why she's here tonight honoring america!
56972,Marge,"homer! just give him the donut. once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror."
59156,Marge,"oh. so, bart..."
56222,Marge,"hello, mom? fine. you know, abe had a very nice time with you last sunday..."
67914,Marge,"yes, she is. and who are you?"
58199,Marge,the undersea world certainly is full of wonders.
67129,Marge,"well, it's hard for me to judge since i've never bowled in my life."
63910,Marge,maybe he's going through... certain changes.
59136,Marge,bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and i could have a night out!
60325,Marge,"no, homer!"
67878,Marge,"what were you like as a boy, mr. burns? did you have a dog that you loved."
62199,Marge,you mean get beaten up by him?
67215,Marge,didn't he used to be your assistant?
64192,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
65182,Marge,then i'll have that!
60022,Marge,breakfast!
62204,Marge,it's raining inside!
60472,Marge,"grampa, i gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie."
60438,Marge,it's only fair. we went to europe when lisa lost her balloon.
58981,Marge,no i'm not. i just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash.
62144,Marge,"can't turn off the power, eh?"
63680,Marge,this election is on every channel.
58959,Marge,this could really spice up those pies i've been making...
59657,Marge,"well, we're still poor, but thanks to your father, we'll never go hungry."
60717,Marge,"i'm his groupie! am i saying that right, ""groupie?"""
61039,Marge,"homie, i know you've got a lot of work to do. but this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family."
63289,Marge,it's our house! but what's that thing?
55649,Marge,"bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib."
54589,Marge,...while you play video games with your neanderthal friends.
55552,Marge,"well, lisa, i finished my resume."
65286,Marge,no one's shotgun! now be quiet!
58706,Marge,now it's marge's time to shine!
65391,Marge,it's kind of embarrassing...
56149,Marge,"that was a very nice thing you did, homey."
64731,Marge,well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
58155,Marge,stop this madness. it's just a washcloth.
58485,Marge,"i have to, honey. or... you can stay here and we'll have our own dance. ""every simpson dance now! bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp!"""
54672,Marge,"i feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. plus, i'm dead."
63239,Marge,james patterson!
65355,Marge,we're not monsters. we're just people. people who love each other and love this town. the only place we've ever called home. thank you.
57470,Marge,we never will.
66166,Marge,"anything from ""love gun""!"
59570,Marge,nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before!
59648,Marge,poor homie. i still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you.
62430,Marge,"sweetie, i know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching!"
55697,Marge,it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
63992,Marge,but he'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators.
63442,Marge,this is colby krause. i hired him to help you improve your life. he'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
59365,Marge,"i don't know, there's a lot of buzz around lenny."
56600,Marge,so in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
65912,Marge,okay. but every man deserves a second chance. as long as he doesn't...
61398,Marge,i'm writing a novel!
66331,Marge,"okay, marge simpson, entering the matrix, for a brownie recipe."
65594,Marge,i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan.
57389,Marge,and what's that hitchhiker doing here? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
67731,Marge,homer.
66278,Marge,we wish you a merry christmas / and a happy new year!
63757,Marge,"well, at least she's got a friend."
59814,Marge,"oh. well, you know, lots of people shoot apu. it's just a hundred-dollar fine now."
57548,Marge,"all right, helen, if i'm not wanted, i'll leave."
61597,Marge,six feet by eight?
62641,Marge,not to mention this power point demonstration he did just last week.
65591,Marge,now i'm thinking alex if it's a girl and xander if it's a boy.
67492,Marge,"i've noticed that, too. well, when you feel like coming down, we'll be there."
61314,Marge,"excuse me, can i ask you a favor?"
58859,Marge,c'mon! c'mon! get that corpse off the road! the streets are for the living!
57766,Marge,the dump?
58286,Marge,lisa! come on! your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
56194,Marge,"homer, i want that thing out of my house."
63715,Marge,homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
55155,Marge,thanks again for taking the children while i'm away.
59607,Marge,i really should read the whole headline before i react.
67209,Marge,does this girl like him?
64448,Marge,you like potato... you like tomato...
65093,Marge,we got out of it just in time.
61870,Marge,you've never had one before?
64072,Marge,"homie, i think it's an eviction notice. we're gonna be homeless, like lucille ball in ""the stone pillow""!"
66081,Marge,"such great characters, like buxton the scheming larder-keep. why can't lady cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?"
66685,Marge,homer! turn off that horrible machine!
57042,Marge,don't let the bedbugs bite.
55422,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face!
55353,Marge,there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about...
60476,Marge,so you've settled for branson.
61494,Marge,'got your nose' and other lies...
60478,Marge,"oh, no. there's gambling. we just have to find it."
67460,Marge,"well, i'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament."
57037,Marge,"well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
63643,Marge,the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. and i said no. but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love.
62738,Marge,"so, charles, what do you do for a living?"
54793,Marge,four b.
64156,Marge,you're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
64460,Marge,that's just what we need! but how are we going to get it home?
60263,Marge,oh. we'd better stay inside. at least until the squirrels stop melting.
61945,Marge,"oh, bart, honey i'm so sorry."
60483,Marge,it's been so many years since i've seen your father. i hope he's still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.
66315,Marge,"now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
62875,Marge,mr. simpson?
59582,Marge,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but i think my family likes becky more than me."
59626,Marge,"i learned something: when people reach for their diaphragm, they don't want to see my picture."
65274,Marge,"oh, it's so good to meet the octuplets' octuplets."
60519,Marge,that's right. they have powers.
57420,Marge,"oh, geez -- it's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! it's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
65022,Marge,"homer, the game is right here!"
58174,Marge,hmf. why don't you want to go out there?
60337,Marge,"oh dear, you can't eat solid foods. those are his favorites."
65830,Marge,"homie, do you see anything?"
57512,Marge,has anyone seen homer?
62192,Marge,"homer, just settle down. we just got a postcard from maggie."
56607,Marge,"baby shower?! you know i haven't told homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
61926,Marge,no one's fighting over you!
66497,Marge,"how are you, milhouse?"
64902,Marge,"the moms and i had a falling out, which was a shame. we had been such good friends."
60936,Marge,"homer, that was not very christian of you."
65291,Marge,"speaking for lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore."
58143,Marge,"also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
54654,Marge,there's no time! i need you for the wedding toast!
61276,Marge,"it's partly my fault. i've been nagging you so much on this trip, you couldn't know which nags to focus on."
65073,Marge,"goomar?! that's mob talk for ""mistress."" fat tony has a mistress!"
62499,Marge,awww. i'll be right down.
67557,Marge,no.
58936,Marge,still no visitors! it's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. what's the number for luigi's?
66769,Marge,i don't like the end sounds on that.
65921,Marge,"homer, i'm glad that you tried, even though now i can't find the washing machine."
61823,Marge,i stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust.
55635,Marge,who did this?
65554,Marge,hummingbirds! hum and get it!
59625,Marge,... and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee.
65330,Marge,lisa?
61392,Marge,"anyone? if i write a book, will they tell me when it comes out?"
65763,Marge,"homer, my sisters adopted ling and she's doing great."
60443,Marge,i said you'll be late for school.
62805,Marge,oh don't stop -- you're choking him just the way his father used to.
58085,Marge,do you bowl often?
62568,Marge,"would i?! now let's see... homer cut up my wedding dress to make a badminton net -- which he never uses, he spent my last three birthdays in jail, called out his bowling ball's name during sex..."
60383,Marge,...but then he turned into an octopus!
59548,Marge,where's lisa?
56733,Marge,"excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog..."
58124,Marge,homer! i think i heard a noise.
58742,Marge,"well, we'll just see. murray hill 5-9232..."
67379,Marge,i'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
58313,Marge,"now, why don't you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? you two make an adorable pair."
64491,Marge,"well, they should."
67066,Marge,i'm not sure that we can afford...
54894,Marge,what makes you think i did it?
67897,Marge,your father does that to me.
64946,Marge,my first gray hair!
66933,Marge,"well, sure, okay..."
58466,Marge,"wow, a lot of people have pools."
63867,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. leary. sometimes it's hard to be a parent."
56684,Marge,"i think we should call a town meeting. if we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all."
62461,Marge,homer! i can save you both! just let go of the rock!
59816,Marge,titles are hard.
63456,Marge,"homer, you did it! you landed a jet!"
55274,Marge,where were you all night?
59973,Marge,and these musical garment bags aren't bad either.
55739,Marge,"well, to cheer you up i rented a couple of videos. ""boxing's greatest weigh-ins"" and ""yentl""."
56207,Marge,and those.
55921,Marge,"and i learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
55306,Marge,"that's them. now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
64591,Marge,i don't see any chewing!
65999,Marge,i am so proud. i would've been happy if bart was just a piano mover.
56332,Marge,what's brunch?
62008,Marge,it's true. you'd be quite a catch... if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath.
58401,Marge,that's the kind of faucet i want for your bathroom.
57542,Marge,"no, i'm not."
58030,Marge,"well, i'm glad you were having fun, because i've had my hands full with apu's mother."
66801,Marge,"homer, come here."
61866,Marge,"hey, kids, i just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. you know what that means -- open lanes!"
56492,Marge,homer.
64641,Marge,homer?
64132,Marge,"all right, people, i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation."
65340,Marge,i'll get a couple glasses.
57373,Marge,"thank you, moe. i know you gave up your dreams for homer."
54623,Marge,"homie, i got so caught up in the world of college that i forgot how important your love was. can you find it in your heart to take me back?"
60381,Marge,please. we went out once.
57704,Marge,"i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. i guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, homie?"
59166,Marge,"oh, yeah? what's a palate?"
57323,Marge,"homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
67056,Marge,"well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. it's what shows up on the surface that counts. that's what my mother taught me. take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. and then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow."
66092,Marge,not a good time!
59012,Marge,i'm not thinking that!
55026,Marge,"oh, homer."
67079,Marge,"oh, i'm sure they're just fine. after all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done."
58934,Marge,yess!!
63342,Marge,we should stop now.
55923,Marge,what's wrong?
60131,Marge,"homer, no! we're not bad parents."
65505,Marge,"ned, how did you sleep?"
66312,Marge,and getting the termites out of the trees.
58991,Marge,"the point is, great artists are always trying new things, like michelangelo or shaquille o'neal. you just need some inspiration."
58402,Marge,"can you help him, doctor?"
63626,Marge,"well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed mount everest and got everyone else killed."
65068,Marge,you've never supported mine!
60586,Marge,what would that accomplish?
61389,Marge,"well, i could use a muffin."
58169,Marge,"okay, who wants dinner?"
63950,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil! but i think we should unpack first..."
65960,Marge,that poor man. we've got to do something to change his life.
60729,Marge,what?
65963,Marge,maybe i should come too.
55102,Marge,"oh, look at that, a shoe box house. lisa, you're so clever."
63425,Marge,"how you holdin' up, maggie?"
63635,Marge,"homie, you look good!"
56623,Marge,"""a young springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'the bart simpson comet.'"" oh honey, i'm so proud of you."
59886,Marge,i just wanted to win for once. please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
56409,Marge,"oh my. lisa, go to your room."
61594,Marge,he's eating my beauty!
59631,Marge,swings!
58841,Marge,m-a-r-g-e.
66357,Marge,lisa!
60579,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
57884,Marge,"not to us you're not. i mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor?"
67690,Marge,"""bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. now, the more you help him... the more you hurt him."""
66402,Marge,"actually, homer got up early to count and sort pills. then he called the police when a frisbee landed on our lawn. then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel."
62010,Marge,"goodnight, both of you."
59169,Marge,"i'm having a hard time seeing. homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?"
58392,Marge,"just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. you can get a picture of your mommy with a mummy."
58826,Marge,homer?
58149,Marge,but mr. trebek --
56770,Marge,thank you.
59948,Marge,yeah. the uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
57897,Marge,those were the days.
56702,Marge,yes.
61574,Marge,"my drinking problem is out of control. at oktoberfest, all i could think about was beer! i couldn't even celebrate... the harvest."
64583,Marge,okay.
57399,Marge,you've already used up your birthday and christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. and you hardly ever play with that anymore.
64733,Marge,i suppose i should get something to eat.
66866,Marge,"lenny said you were babysitting. and if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? i could use a night out."
63908,Marge,i just did.
60362,Marge,this place is so dull. the nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
59083,Marge,you honor us.
59317,Marge,"okay, here goes..."
62182,Marge,"homer! homer, where are you?"
61762,Marge,you don't sell roadside corn.
60787,Marge,why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
55027,Marge,you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song.... it can't be wrong / when it feels so goo/right / cause you -- you
59331,Marge,"hi, pumpkins!"
63882,Marge,"oh my god, he's out of frame! zoom out! zoom out!"
59967,Marge,"oh, honey, we're so proud of you."
64766,Marge,"oh, roger! you really know what you're doing!"
56046,Marge,homer!
66206,Marge,"homie? aw, you're shopping ahead for maggie."
59419,Marge,that's right.
60116,Marge,it's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
57717,Marge,i don't think it had broken axles before.
66897,Marge,"maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. and i'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, i'll get my husband back."
58580,Marge,"homer, do something! the ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!"
61093,Marge,don't rightly know. i just soaked up the lingo like a biscuit in a bucket full of gopher gravy. i'll stop now.
55140,Marge,"alright, don't whine. just put it in my left hand."
54867,Marge,"homer, this is the flanders' entire living room set. how much did you pay for this?"
61656,Marge,we're ditching our kids and taking a second honeymoon!
59134,Marge,"""thank you in advance for a world-class meal. you're an inspiration to our entire organization. thank you again, bart."" ohh, what a lovely gesture!"
60398,Marge,"homer, don't talk with your mouth full. i've told you before, it's rude."
64927,Marge,what are you talking about?
63669,Marge,i'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
67946,Marge,what a fun quest! aren't you glad i made you take that nap in the middle?
66017,Marge,"sweetie, you're just gonna be who you are."
57294,Marge,"well, did you call one of your friends?"
60249,Marge,"ah. well, you do have a present under the tree. i guess no one told santa you were a buddhist."
54738,Marge,shhh.
54845,Marge,"well, when i used to get stuck like this, i'd go for a bike ride. do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
59737,Marge,yeah?
59534,Marge,"don't smart mouth, lisa."
66551,Marge,"hm. well, that makes me feel better."
57912,Marge,"homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did."
56426,Marge,dad!! daaadd!! homer!!
60966,Marge,"well, that's great, honey."
63907,Marge,no more non-dice board games.
63495,Marge,"come on, sweetie. everyone's going to sleep."
58434,Marge,homer!
56477,Marge,"will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
59800,Marge,what a waste of talent.
67535,Marge,i'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons. i don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before.
58710,Marge,"no, of course not!"
63913,Marge,"now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. it's cinnamon! nightie-night, sweetheart."
66644,Marge,there is no drive thru!
57218,Marge,"sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
57914,Marge,i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
63537,Marge,"okay. i'll visit you, dwight."
58160,Marge,mm! who knew that lee marvin could do such marvelous splits?
62290,Marge,"homer, i'm glad you're getting exercise, i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
54945,Marge,what was that? was that a yes or a no?
57452,Marge,lisa! why don't you come sing for us!
59124,Marge,"homer, we agreed we'd discuss the medication with bart."
59386,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't care if you're a billionaire. i love you just because you're..."
63010,Marge,"bart, here's a letter from your school!"
60416,Marge,"marge, if you're watching this, then it means i've figured out how to work the camera. last night i crashed a certain fake prom. that's right, artie ziff's fake prom."
55909,Marge,i think this is a great opportunity. you could learn so much.
61037,Marge,"well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
60693,Marge,"dr. hibbert, this is a top-notch resort. can you recommend some activities?"
62417,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
61251,Marge,"principal skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?"
62378,Marge,i've bonded with him!
58376,Marge,that's what i call break-neck speed.
58777,Marge,"well, i'm glad you changed your name back to homer simpson."
60344,Marge,"pardon my french, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
66191,Marge,if you're happy i'm happy.
64838,Marge,"hm... well, okay."
57088,Marge,lisa's on the sleepy train / to rest her weary head / her ticket is a candy cane / made out of gingerbread.
59327,Marge,i'm sorry!
57761,Marge,"you did the right thing, sweetheart."
57782,Marge,homer! will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? it came from the dump.
65655,Marge,"homie, you have such a way with foods. let's go inside."
60432,Marge,"ohhh, is that where boozer drank the pee?"
65949,Marge,how?
64751,Marge,"actually, i'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
62342,Marge,"now bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?"
57735,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. here, you can have the junk mail."
59818,Marge,"oh, and guess who's up for parole? my diamond-in-the-rough."
62673,Marge,"well, we better start looking."
59526,Marge,we need something quick. my husband's eyes are really shot.
65170,Marge,"why do old squirrels always crawl into my engine to die? guess we'll be making an unscheduled pit stop, gang."
59465,Marge,"my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10
69808,243,293,homer simpson: ah"
66356,Marge,homer!
61794,Marge,"the articles, eh? so you wouldn't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes?"
61636,Marge,"stop it! no one was planned! now, we have to pack for great-uncle tyrone's birthday tomorrow. in dayton!"
67483,Marge,mom! you made it! how are you!
67189,Marge,i'm a married woman. please don't call me that.
60317,Marge,"oh, hello homer."
58724,Marge,kids! / i can nag and nag till my hair turns blue...
62452,Marge,"hi, sweetie."
60248,Marge,"oh. hello, lisa."
57169,Marge,"all right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. we can't afford a single slip-up. they're judging us."
66227,Marge,late night at moe's eh?
66785,Marge,none.
67347,Marge,"bart, it's past your bedtime."
61018,Marge,don't you see? he's pointing out how sexist men can be.
64312,Marge,what? that's crazy.
63220,Marge,i did!
61528,Marge,i thought you were playing catch with artie.
56345,Marge,of course. remember when... your aunt selma got married?
59394,Marge,"never, but it's my number one concern!"
56932,Marge,it's so quiet here without the kids.
64052,Marge,i think we should go see our mortgage broker.
66093,Marge,the dowager grandmum!
60585,Marge,we have to do something to save that marriage. maybe i should just tell manjula. or you could talk to apu...
67938,Marge,who are we hiding from?
56224,Marge,"uh... i love ya, mom!"
65856,Marge,"homer, do something! they're killing each other!"
67770,Marge,i want you to find a husband for my sister selma.
56047,Marge,still no help.
63952,Marge,i can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
60072,Marge,how romantic!
65876,Marge,"homer, that's you."
59318,Marge,"this box? oh, nothing."
55918,Marge,no. i want those geeks out of my house.
58998,Marge,oh lord. what now?
66060,Marge,he forgot our anniversary again? he remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
59442,Marge,don't panic! don't panic! don't panic!
56559,Marge,why does daddy have to leave?
67950,Marge,you know who else fell? dr. hibbert!
67343,Marge,of course. homer!?
58803,Marge,"well, pretty much. except weekends."
61700,Marge,"no, it was clearly you in that suit. you'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start."
62953,Marge,that's it! we're outta here.
62561,Marge,"homer, please! we're about to have tea!"
67812,Marge,"for five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. now it's your turn."
60422,Marge,i really appreciate you helping me find homer.
59981,Marge,what? what is it?
61813,Marge,it's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind. but i think i'm up to it.
57175,Marge,"at times like this, i guess all you can do is laugh."
65703,Marge,oh homie. i'm so sorry.
66961,Marge,shush.
56910,Marge,"enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
60485,Marge,"okay, it has been twenty years, and you suitors have been very patient."
56882,Marge,"i must say mr. burns is being awfully inconsiderate. selfish, even."
58309,Marge,that ralph wiggum boy. he's a real winner.
63500,Marge,crie? what does that stand for?
67504,Marge,lisa's recital is saturday night.
62399,Marge,so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
55632,Marge,no.
57719,Marge,why do you have so many bowling balls?
55999,Marge,stolen?!
58101,Marge,"but small. really, really small."
63890,Marge,oh my god. you've taught me a valuable lesson!
64668,Marge,is your room clean?
61253,Marge,"well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?"
58383,Marge,oh my goodness gracious!
67283,Marge,"oh, eight carousels. we're in for a real treat!"
59808,Marge,let's let a little sunshine in.
58072,Marge,i passed!
56793,Marge,"homie, these games are fixed."
58967,Marge,"i'm sure god will let us return soon. i mean, how long can he hold a grudge?"
63041,Marge,i forgive you my darling. get well.
62409,Marge,look who's sleeping in our bed again.
64665,Marge,we better go.
54828,Marge,oh my god! mother was right.
57215,Marge,"ah, poor homie. poor, poor..."
60843,Marge,i get to tamp the powder!
61810,Marge,"oh my god! someone, somewhere says i'm better than someone else!"
60279,Marge,"get out, homer."
67926,Marge,because i'm a ghost!
63042,Marge,"as for you, young man: the next time you save your principal, try not to risk your own life."
59482,Marge,just kidding. i would never do that.
56122,Marge,"lisa -- ordinarily, i'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
57207,Marge,what kind of apprentice?
57817,Marge,homer...
62750,Marge,no!
62401,Marge,"oh, wait a minute. there's no batteries in this thing."
58002,Marge,"i'm talking about his ""personal area."""
56755,Marge,"rev. lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the regional director of the irs."
62172,Marge,then it's agreed! we ask frank gehry to build us a concert hall!
65937,Marge,"homer's pie man costume, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, sunday-best bart..."
61930,Marge,"lisa -- breakfast! i know you're mad at me, but i hope you're not mad at cap'n crunch..."
64621,Marge,tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said.
58588,Marge,"i tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques."
59220,Marge,"homer, no!"
60724,Marge,"kids, look what i got you for your third grade field trip -- matching fanny packs!"
59954,Marge,why don't you try reaching out to this new girl? see if you two have a common interest.
59412,Marge,that's a pretty lousy lesson.
66803,Marge,yes.
64094,Marge,you're even more beautiful than i remembered.
64457,Marge,oh thank god you're okay!
59881,Marge,"well, actually, the name of bart's partner is..."
65537,Marge,"i know we shouldn't feed this, but grease brings raccoons."
54669,Marge,"promenade? with you? forget it, bub!"
56532,Marge,sock puppets.
62815,Marge,i'm just trying to take the pressure off of you.
59659,Marge,"geez, so many dolphins..."
63029,Marge,"this is shirley. yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. goodbye!"
62560,Marge,this is my husband homer.
65981,Marge,a library volunteer? someone to purell the cpr dummy?
63266,Marge,restage the photos?
56652,Marge,"it's clever, just like you. huh? huh?"
67484,Marge,"dinner! dinner time, everybody! dinner!"
61036,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
65815,Marge,"look, maggie! they have a story lady!"
58380,Marge,"whatever you say, sweetie."
59773,Marge,homer!
58054,Marge,"otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives."
56330,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
56322,Marge,sure.
65567,Marge,uh-oh! do you hear that rattle?
62594,Marge,"bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?"
66818,Marge,oh lord.
62753,Marge,no.
62375,Marge,what do i do?
67687,Marge,"excuse me, is this room 106?"
64332,Marge,where did they all go?
61522,Marge,artie ziff!
60820,Marge,anything good?
55201,Marge,how shall we end it?
65740,Marge,and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school.
66098,Marge,where's it from?
58537,Marge,killer? why did he call you killer?
56058,Marge,why?
61526,Marge,we had one date. and you were not a gentleman.
66684,Marge,is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes?
60852,Marge,hello?
61179,Marge,yay!
55374,Marge,"don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. he is your brother."
64575,Marge,but it says here in the brochure...
54746,Marge,hello. i'm mrs. simpson.
61561,Marge,okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
66859,Marge,no!
63538,Marge,i just want to go home.
56671,Marge,"i'm sorry. all we have is nescafe. i'm very, very sorry."
61230,Marge,no thanks. i'm wearing my cure for depression.
65102,Marge,"i'll call you back! come back, pooter toot! people might be offended by your mild tastelessness!"
57672,Marge,come on. you liked john this morning.
58864,Marge,"well, somebody go first."
60784,Marge,your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
61641,Marge,"well, i-i... let's just rent a movie."
59064,Marge,eww...
65031,Marge,there's one right here!
67363,Marge,homer!
56502,Marge,no!
61009,Marge,"homer, we haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, the dog has eaten all its hair...and the fixtures won't stay in one place."
56510,Marge,"homeie, i can't quite..."
65457,Marge,woo-woo-woo-woo!
56583,Marge,"no. the family simpson, which has just five members. and only two of those members have special rings."
59092,Marge,"hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is."
63485,Marge,she's perfect! for the first time since you became an opera star i can finally relax.
60289,Marge,"lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books."
67295,Marge,"well. when we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils."
63813,Marge,"for once, we'll do what maggie wants."
67014,Marge,arrrgh!
64687,Marge,you know what? i'll just cook this later.
62021,Marge,"lisa, could you pass the salad?"
67811,Marge,"well, lisa, here it is; the bouvier family quilt."
64010,Marge,i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet.
62422,Marge,homer!
67933,Marge,"then ""yes"" -- hither me forth on mine arduous quest!"
58365,Marge,"homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
62592,Marge,excuse me... mister mayor... they say you speak english?
65004,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no -- i don't want the money back, i just came for my dog."
56921,Marge,squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... dogs mating on dining room table?
57756,Marge,"wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
57795,Marge,"oh, all right, let me talk to them. put me on with the lead boy."
56334,Marge,he seemed to know a lot about brunch. but it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
54762,Marge,get back in bed.
60108,Marge,hello police? i think my house killed my husband.
55216,Marge,"that's nice, bart. you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. but they said he was too heavy."
60382,Marge,artie made mega-bucks with a revolutionary invention -- a converter that changes that horrible modem noise into easy-listening music.
57507,Marge,remember your promise: no drinking.
55360,Marge,this money was a blessing. we can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
65691,Marge,i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids... except lisa. i breastfed lisa for nine months.
56213,Marge,"maggie, we have a surprise for you."
59766,Marge,look at those exotic positions.
58116,Marge,$300 for doing nothing?! i feel like such a crook.
61130,Marge,we'll see.
57841,Marge,"well, it's time to say ""good night."""
62311,Marge,"c'mon. you tell him right now. ned, homer has something to tell you."
62762,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i love homer."
64243,Marge,"lisa, you are going to look so pretty."
59646,Marge,no dessert until you eat your broccoli.
64793,Marge,there's my old house!
65509,Marge,where on the internet?
63455,Marge,"now you listen here, bub. we paid you all the savings we had in the world. you could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
66978,Marge,"well, everything. your dip sign, for instance. now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road."
63934,Marge,they have a pe-dal car.
57898,Marge,and you knew where you were then...
62178,Marge,he's turned it into a prison!
65795,Marge,"bart, would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk?"
59439,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i just thought you..."
58474,Marge,all you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? don't you need a notebook or something?
55073,Marge,"homer, does this mean --"
61109,Marge,there's no net!
62075,Marge,no! i can't let this happen!
57474,Marge,"an automatic dialer? is that legal? i don't want you getting arrested, homer..."
67457,Marge,hmmm. i was going to wash my hair.
61704,Marge,i got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
65350,Marge,what's going on? why is there a picture of us? this isn't good.
55835,Marge,"hello, principal dondelinger."
56484,Marge,homer! wake up! wake up!
56150,Marge,sandwich.
64042,Marge,"oh homie, the insurance bill is due today. can you make sure to mail it?"
65825,Marge,i lost my other earring.
65186,Marge,"so, did all of your cars break down?"
58146,Marge,"""...you'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. sincerely, moe."""
58055,Marge,friends of the library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
60501,Marge,hamlet! what'd i tell you about running with swords?
56351,Marge,"but in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed."
59228,Marge,i'm with lisa. let's take 'em to the cleaners.
58464,Marge,you mean this thing?
56500,Marge,don't turn on the light! don't turn on the light!
56723,Marge,homer! bart! maggie! company eating rules.
65017,Marge,but...
55691,Marge,and those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
60641,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry. i can't. i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. the kids growing up, grandchildren..."
66977,Marge,"oh, homer. i am so proud of you."
58848,Marge,of course not!
61788,Marge,but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
60912,Marge,let's do it!
58600,Marge,tree!
57333,Marge,that's slick willie for you. always with the smooth talk.
67947,Marge,i thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so i redecorated using the hello kitty expansion pack.
65089,Marge,what's wrong?
61420,Marge,what do you mean? my book is set in whaling times.
61867,Marge,"whaddya say? it'll be blam! bart, lisa and mom. huh?"
58547,Marge,"bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here."
66862,Marge,whatever you want.
58741,Marge,let's call the company.
60865,Marge,oh no! i pepper sprayed ralph!
61096,Marge,oh no! they're making beautiful music together!
67103,Marge,"no! look, i don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. lisa, bart, what did you two learn in sunday school today?"
56894,Marge,i was just asking if you'd seen it. there's no need to be a prickly pear.
54796,Marge,"i don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
62596,Marge,here's a cute fact. this sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
57436,Marge,hello marge. how's the family? i don't want to talk about it. mind your own business.
56901,Marge,"bart, why are you talking like that?"
56318,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
56687,Marge,but my new idea is different. i think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.
58730,Marge,i'm so happy you're going to the big game. my dream has always been to see the bolshoi ballet.
61765,Marge,"look at you go. type-ity type, type, type!"
63949,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil!"
61021,Marge,"krusty, why did you just drop your pants?"
67178,Marge,"oh, jacques! it fits. you got it in my size and it has my name on it. it's really for me."
62955,Marge,then i guess you'll do it without me.
59879,Marge,"oh, hello, homer."
66285,Marge,this is fun! and it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
57718,Marge,that's funny... i used to be able to go down there.
66586,Marge,there's only one thing left to try.
59467,Marge,i don't remember the air in the kitchen being so wavy. good lord - that's gas!
57941,Marge,"homer, no!"
65886,Marge,"why'd you do it, willie?"
55277,Marge,i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
62460,Marge,where's my apology?
65282,Marge,that's toothpaste!
66848,Marge,"ooh, i didn't know we could decorate our cars."
55110,Marge,"now bart, i think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
66457,Marge,"first, mazel tov! second, don't! please, please, i'm a mother. surely you have a mother too."
55049,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i said that this is how i pictured my wedding day... but you are how i pictured my husband."
57322,Marge,"the polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. shoo, shoo!"
55650,Marge,homie... i think the baby's coming.
64648,Marge,my mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
55118,Marge,did you two have fun?
60611,Marge,college is no place for a young girl with those quadrangles and study carrels and syllabi...
66695,Marge,yes it does!
56530,Marge,"yes, but i'd rather not talk about it."
58212,Marge,there must be a way to outsmart them.
54608,Marge,"homie, go home. we'll talk about this later."
59019,Marge,i want you to get rid of these springs.
59571,Marge,"ooo, ooo, i've always wanted to use rosemary in something."
63474,Marge,"see? isn't it nicer, with just you and..."
67277,Marge,"oh, bart, my baby boy. welcome home."
67299,Marge,leave homer?
63532,Marge,"well, if i know doctors, he's probably golfing."
61341,Marge,"oh no, it's raining! and maggie's diapers are extra-absorbent!"
61652,Marge,"homie, look at them!"
65933,Marge,"i know this seems bad, but nothing brings out the best in springfield like a crisis..."
63070,Marge,what's with the lined composition book?
56709,Marge,why don't we all take a five minute break? it'll clear our heads.
66445,Marge,"homie, there's someone here to see you."
59473,Marge,get it away from the house!
64282,Marge,"there's less of you to love, but i love you even more."
58292,Marge,because your father has a big surprise for you!
66483,Marge,sh-sh-sh!
62382,Marge,homer?
59772,Marge,"seems like animated shows are everywhere. or were, last year."
59655,Marge,what?! you threw our precious babies into the woods?! we could have sold them!
64495,Marge,but homer tries his best.
65153,Marge,they're all pretty big...
64894,Marge,"homie, i know you had a terrible experience, but it's over."
56288,Marge,"honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. no matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. i always thought i had the tallest hair. but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes."
66295,Marge,i'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
66284,Marge,"bye bye, maggie!"
63142,Marge,"please, just a few more days."
57865,Marge,it's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the williamsburg bridge! fourth avenue! governor's island!
61655,Marge,what about uncle tyrone?
57537,Marge,oh. come. come in.
59510,Marge,those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
60939,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. looks like god has packed up and left springfield."
55115,Marge,see how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
66197,Marge,"it's me, talking in your earphone!"
66834,Marge,he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me.
66784,Marge,you've been working so hard lately. maybe you should take a break.
59735,Marge,"that's no gentleman, that's my husband."
57484,Marge,my main finger?
64097,Marge,"i'm sorry for fibbing. tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home."
66865,Marge,yup. and i know a place that could use this smile.
56693,Marge,"just a minute, homer! oh, look what you made me write! anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. sincerely, marge simpson."""
59045,Marge,"lisa, did anyone force you to come here today?"
65435,Marge,it means i'm mad!
58700,Marge,we'd better stop and get the car washed.
56493,Marge,homer! homie! the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
60559,Marge,"homer, it's over. i want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again."
62356,Marge,away from you.
61906,Marge,"homer, why do you always have to show that to company?"
64080,Marge,"goodnight, bart."
55597,Marge,i really think that was the character's name... don quixote!
60777,Marge,"i finally feel like me again. you're not disappointed, are you?"
61795,Marge,i'm not wearing any clothes. so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table!
62465,Marge,"oh, homie..."
63353,Marge,is your baby a suckaholic?!
64933,Marge,"you know, this is the first time i've ever been at moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying ""this is not a safe place to drink."""
64441,Marge,you like tomato...
55715,Marge,"kids, i have some bad news. your great aunt gladys has... passed on."
67716,Marge,"congratulations, artie."
66837,Marge,how can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
65893,Marge,i think i'm interesting!
57849,Marge,"well, it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the middle of the semester."
66670,Marge,"so. he likes ghosts better, eh? fine."
60021,Marge,hibbert's really losing it. we're going to dr. nick's.
64556,Marge,"and there's a map of the subway system attached. homer, we've got to stop him!"
64486,Marge,"hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
56677,Marge,"not too good, lisa. frankly, he's underneath the table."
58606,Marge,"homie, are you okay?"
57904,Marge,hi honey! how was your first day of school? honey?
67073,Marge,my feet are getting wet!
62456,Marge,no.
64652,Marge,"homer, no!"
62837,Marge,"homer, this says i've won homemaker magazine's ""clean for a day"" contest!"
61110,Marge,"stop it, homer, that's inhumane! use the choke chain!"
66808,Marge,maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.
59565,Marge,"well, it doesn't have to be. otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you."
66564,Marge,how permissive?
55033,Marge,"i need you to drive me to the doctor, homer."
60707,Marge,get in.
66039,Marge,"i know carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?"
63240,Marge,"ooh, how about ""little bo peep?"""
65436,Marge,"why, if it isn't jimbo, dorf and ernie."
65296,Marge,"it wasn't just her, homie. it was all of us."
64201,Marge,"schools have bathrooms! and i'm a woman, so my going in unattended won't cause a panic."
63117,Marge,i'll whack you with the whole salad set if you don't start thinking about others! you are going to that party.
57538,Marge,"i don't believe you, homer."
64592,Marge,"not air bites, real bites."
57102,Marge,"oh, bart. i can't believe you did this."
57677,Marge,"homer, i don't think there's a problem with bart. but if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. goodnight."
55645,Marge,just imagine what we can do with this place.
58063,Marge,i'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
62853,Marge,"i may have lost my memory, but i'm not an idiot."
62625,Marge,"lisa, i'm not sure that letter is ""age appropriate"" reading. why can't the government edit our mail like other countries?"
59713,Marge,hold still.
54916,Marge,"homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say."
66887,Marge,"but it's okay for you guys to know, because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information."
66688,Marge,my sandwich!
58177,Marge,you don't deserve an allowance.
60222,Marge,"oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
62575,Marge,i feel a happiness i've never felt. i not only have friends... i have a hat to prove it.
66351,Marge,don't take too long!
61690,Marge,i'm not being trampled. what gives?
61961,Marge,"well, the drug company won't do anything to help us."
65598,Marge,it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
61811,Marge,my dessert!
59726,Marge,"the dog thinks so, too."
66945,Marge,"two points. your turn, dear."
67590,Marge,that's nice dear.
55708,Marge,we're too late!
62883,Marge,why are we having dinner in shelbyville?
67109,Marge,"go on, lisa. we've all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear."
61770,Marge,"yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. the garage made it to heaven too!"
54907,Marge,"homer, maybe you better take milhouse home."
55558,Marge,"lisa, sh! someone may be listening."
65932,Marge,how did we get bedbugs?
67282,Marge,"ooo, i've got to go, homer. my sisters are here."
55324,Marge,we'll discuss it later. is milhouse okay?
63313,Marge,i was killed... by my own son.
55013,Marge,"bart, i want you to go down to moe's tavern. i need you to bring your father home."
63195,Marge,"homer, no! revenge never solves anything."
60539,Marge,that's it. from now on i'm growing all our vegetables myself.
63781,Marge,"if you ever come near homer again, i'll strangle you with your own hair extensions. that's right, i know."
64191,Marge,blabby's gonna build an abbey. groovy.
55810,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
60955,Marge,"i heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
61296,Marge,"well, i'm proud of you, homie."
55040,Marge,"oh, homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
54742,Marge,i'm going to church alone today. you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life.
66381,Marge,"shut your eyes, they're too bright."
55861,Marge,$24.95!
55553,Marge,what are you putting in there?...
64204,Marge,this school has really gone downhill.
61547,Marge,"mmm, it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on!"
63840,Marge,"marge simpson. well, mr. farrelly, the least i could do is offer you a cupcake."
61845,Marge,he sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!
55031,Marge,"homer, maybe it's the champale talking, but i think you're pretty sexy."
59370,Marge,don't worry about a thing. we'll take good care of your house!
64607,Marge,"well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with milhouse?"
63236,Marge,homer! don't kill the foreign man!
61999,Marge,that sounds like homer.
58418,Marge,i'm going to bed.
67110,Marge,"why, bart, why?"
56788,Marge,"hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him."
67866,Marge,"well, thank you, professor lombardo."
60642,Marge,my love. you saved my life.
65254,Marge,we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday when it closes forever.
67632,Marge,"homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
61376,Marge,i need to be alone right now.
66627,Marge,i'm sorry.
59038,Marge,"oh, how awful."
61728,Marge,i kept my heart too.
55188,Marge,"yes, homer."
56336,Marge,is thursday okay?
56861,Marge,"years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
62069,Marge,i don't think it's exactly what mom would want.
66160,Marge,get up / everybody's gonna move their feet
60390,Marge,"you can't use the word ""sex"" on the internet."
62392,Marge,homer! do something about the noise!
63460,Marge,griddler on the roof? thank god it's fried eggs? luftwaffle's?
65858,Marge,it's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills. what kind of person revels in disapproval?!
62319,Marge,what if there's a fire?
59636,Marge,... a smile.
60454,Marge,i think we should try to restore bart's faith in buck. and we could start by getting buck to quit drinking.
62095,Marge,do it for me.
64786,Marge,just sugarplums and buttercups.
66549,Marge,"lisa. lisa, wait..."
54863,Marge,"that's the problem. even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the tv instead of getting some much-needed exercise. those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
57128,Marge,"who's ""disco stu?"""
66050,Marge,"trust me, homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from."
59854,Marge,"yes, it says here he's the movie magician behind ""creepshow,"" ""friday the 13th"" and ""dawn of the dead."""
54849,Marge,"homer, look! they give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow."
59110,Marge,"look, they're making a movie! robert downey, jr. is shooting it out with the police!"
56715,Marge,oh really? did you see the loom? i took loom in high school.
63441,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
60510,Marge,we've been charged for calls to brazil that we didn't make.
56823,Marge,"apu, no."
54969,Marge,who's using the power tools?
55754,Marge,"the point is, i want you to stop making these calls."
60781,Marge,"wow, it's so fancy. it's like moby's house on ""cribs""!"
65235,Marge,"i'm sorry to bother you at home, mr. marlowe..."
63050,Marge,the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
67257,Marge,"goodbye, my special, my special little guy. you will write us, won't you?"
66084,Marge,why are you singing that?
67161,Marge,no.
60858,Marge,there's a happy baby. aren't you? aren't you?
56037,Marge,his name is bart.
61386,Marge,it's the only way to talk to bullies.
60546,Marge,i'm sleeping on the couch.
62315,Marge,"bart, get your things. you're leaving with me!"
65882,Marge,what's odd?
65796,Marge,"all right. fine. if you boys want it, i'll tell you what i really think."
60667,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're alive!"
64783,Marge,you're alive?
57073,Marge,"bart, what's taking so long? if you're having that problem with your zipper, i can send your father up."
59934,Marge,it's been a whole week! why are you letting my husband die? what does that have to do with baseball?
62744,Marge,i don't get it. are you saying you're the tree?
58820,Marge,"i do too. but it was sweet. women really like that sort of thing, homie."
64286,Marge,i think you may have put on a little weight.
62614,Marge,"i knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me."
59369,Marge,uh-huh. the fire department.
57303,Marge,"well, duh! with what, ned?"
55716,Marge,"no honey, gladys looked more like your aunt patty."
65083,Marge,"homie, are you even listening to me?"
56473,Marge,"oh, well thank you homer. but take one of the kids."
56187,Marge,you know we should really stop hiring him.
65013,Marge,/ ooo!
62545,Marge,"if i give you money, how is the gift really from you?"
65841,Marge,"your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year."
59663,Marge,"more wheat cakes, mr. mayor?"
54687,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
59506,Marge,"this family has hit a new low. we're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... and it's all your fault."
55430,Marge,forget about him. let's rehearse the bottle scene!
61437,Marge,it was only my imagination.
62900,Marge,i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
64886,Marge,you have a magic wand?
57769,Marge,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
56327,Marge,oh!
64150,Marge,he's right here.
61665,Marge,"no, no. that's the noise the phone makes when you've been on too long. bye now! love you."
66185,Marge,ooh!
55891,Marge,"lisa, you got a letter."
57586,Marge,who are you?
66924,Marge,"oh, bart, that's so sweet. it's the best present a mother could get and it makes you look so dangerous."
58783,Marge,let go of those.
55911,Marge,"you don't know, do you?"
67486,Marge,lisa! my goodness! that's very impressive!
60899,Marge,"ruth powers, my old neighbor? oh, my goodness, look at you!"
65674,Marge,and what's with the scarf? it's soaked in neck sweat.
55728,Marge,"a hundred and one frozen pops. a nobel prize winner... an nba all-star... ooh, one of the ""sweathogs!"""
61305,Marge,my husband's a power-mad star.
55421,Marge,i just don't see what's so bad about stanley.
64435,Marge,time to try out my new deep fryer.
63861,Marge,"sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. as it is, i'm buying frozen peas on installments."
64015,Marge,no!
65635,Marge,please say it's the vegetarianism!
58235,Marge,"all right, already! but do you love the leader more than having your very own, brand new -- hoverbikes?"
56308,Marge,that's not true. romance is all around us. in our neighborhoods...
54736,Marge,i have never been so embarrassed in my life.
60049,Marge,you could give the money to the orphanage. i hear they need a new wall.
63284,Marge,"fine, i'll log onto wahoo or yippy or a-o-k, or pooka-dooka, or whatever it's called."
64983,Marge,you ate his yogurt in the car.
58371,Marge,how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
64899,Marge,"when it's closed it's a chair! when you were little, i used to take you to a mommy-and-me toddler gym."
67028,Marge,"what on earth are you talking about, homer?"
55148,Marge,that's nice. do you think you could loosen my cuffs?
58549,Marge,how's this for later?!
67306,Marge,"but, homer, it's so expensive."
65431,Marge,on the tv!
57641,Marge,an occasional hug is all i ask.
56271,Marge,bart...? are all these children friends of yours?
65843,Marge,"oh honey, that's just silly! this'll show helen lovejoy, always bragging about her he-she cousin!"
66617,Marge,"well, what do you want a job for?"
66964,Marge,"bart, what happened?"
62686,Marge,and how. but this is different.
63294,Marge,still nothing. but maybe now. or now. the only thing that changes is the banner ad.
65167,Marge,"come on kids, fun comes from inside -- it isn't about what we actually do."
64019,Marge,sounds promising so far!
61067,Marge,well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
61008,Marge,no!
56380,Marge,such a violent motif.
54622,Marge,i'm getting you off this stuff.
67777,Marge,"well, selma hated egypt, too. a camel spit on her."
60213,Marge,burly to the rescue!
58337,Marge,"no! no, bart! that money's going toward your college education."
58705,Marge,"you mean, you've never splurged and, say, eaten an entire birthday cake, then blamed it on the dog?"
64440,Marge,you like potato...
60635,Marge,"oh homer, what are we going to do?"
57489,Marge,"dear god, this is marge simpson. if you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. so if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
63524,Marge,are you sure? hugs are dru--
63843,Marge,cakes!
64637,Marge,why do i waste my breath?
56205,Marge,"good for you, homie. you know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
56476,Marge,well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
66257,Marge,"we can't afford christmas. and when you can't afford christmas, you've failed as a family. that's what all the big stores say."
67695,Marge,"hmm, i don't know."
64471,Marge,you like tomato...
66096,Marge,show's over! whoo! that turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
65561,Marge,but my car is down there!
64962,Marge,the a.a.? no!
56353,Marge,"there's that side of it. but there's also... help me out here, lisa."
58329,Marge,are you sure you'll be okay?
63354,Marge,experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement!
55710,Marge,homer? homer?
60223,Marge,"oh, that's sensible."
61784,Marge,"relax, we're just looky-loos. we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
58181,Marge,"kids, i made some lemonade for you."
58870,Marge,"i'd like to help you, chief, but my license was revoked. seems i'm full of rage."
67728,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
67319,Marge,no. because you're wearing a bib.
63878,Marge,what are you doing at this construction site?!
66162,Marge,"well, for some reason it relaxes me. now do that thing gene simmons does."
60634,Marge,"this is ridiculous. you've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
67376,Marge,homer! what's this thing in the corner?
67845,Marge,"homer, are you sure this is the right way? the road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy."
67720,Marge,what are you doing here?
56883,Marge,strained carrots for maggie... strained carrots for grampa.
66267,Marge,all eggnog is terrible!
55393,Marge,"you know, i spend all day alone with maggie... and sometimes it's like i don't even exist."
60330,Marge,mm. i guess you just can't use the law to nag. maybe i should just stop trying to change the world.
64794,Marge,we're not here for rabbit. i used to live in this house as a girl.
56192,Marge,"that's sweet, honey."
65629,Marge,what does that mean?
62047,Marge,"oh bart, i'm so glad you're okay."
59741,Marge,i'm right here!
57274,Marge,"oh, homer. are you rounding up immigrants?"
62994,Marge,just make it happen!
67673,Marge,"no, it's true, bart. we used to shoot pool... and go dancing..."
67441,Marge,you'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
59217,Marge,"yeah, but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?"
63252,Marge,grampa's driving me crazy!
56603,Marge,"homie, i--"
56926,Marge,can you see them?
57588,Marge,"homer, did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
56888,Marge,where is everybody?
56981,Marge,homer? where are you?
59742,Marge,no! no! get off me!
64378,Marge,homie?
67272,Marge,"everyone here in the united states is fine. we think maggie may say her first word any day now. lisa got an a in math, which i'm only mentioning as news -- i'm not putting you down. and your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you."
62482,Marge,and i am glad you're okay.
64626,Marge,should we inform the chief?
56052,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
62993,Marge,is it in a safe neighborhood?
56568,Marge,"oh well, thank you, doctor, you've changed my life!"
55770,Marge,"have a good day at work, honey."
67042,Marge,"homer, wake up! wake up! oh my, here let me wipe off that drool."
62945,Marge,"homer, please!"
64189,Marge,noah. i like that name. no-ahhh. noah. noah!
63258,Marge,nothing solves everything forever like a wedding.
60463,Marge,"oh, my god!"
58567,Marge,it's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
62914,Marge,"okay, be cool. i've got some candy in my purse..."
63132,Marge,"i promise you, he'll leave after today."
59811,Marge,"that's charming, sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke."
56137,Marge,"bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?"
58904,Marge,that was a horrible trick to play on your mother!
56920,Marge,what's going on here?
65498,Marge,thank you! everyone's having a great time.
60069,Marge,"you can do it, paul."
64012,Marge,are you saying lisa's not there?
55463,Marge,"let's go, kids."
57242,Marge,selma! troy doesn't love you at all! he's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!
58117,Marge,why do you always wait until christmas eve to do your shopping? the crowds are just beastly.
58774,Marge,you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
65351,Marge,"moe, it's me, marge! i'm your friend!"
55568,Marge,"well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
55724,Marge,that's nice.
63217,Marge,"homer, is that you?!"
63155,Marge,gil!
54592,Marge,video games and too much beer. you sure know how to show a girl a good time.
62423,Marge,"sweetie, we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have."
66188,Marge,that's even worse. could you say it one more time?
58037,Marge,the police auction...
56647,Marge,no. i said coffee.
58036,Marge,"ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! they say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
64929,Marge,"i remember why i left this group seven years ago, and it's why i'm leaving now! good day, ladies."
55446,Marge,"no, homer, you got it just right."
56544,Marge,hmm. that would have to be my first day of school.
59888,Marge,"darling, you're so much handsomer than my first husband."
62331,Marge,i wish my family was with me.
57944,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
66761,Marge,i'm sorry. i'm trying to find my husband and nothing's open.
64913,Marge,"fine, i'll do it!"
59081,Marge,every truck-load of fish we gut brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home.
58561,Marge,not as hard as you think.
55410,Marge,"maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime..."
61373,Marge,"it says ""yes on two thirty-two"". we want no on two thirty-two, yes on two forty-two."
65846,Marge,your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. we've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
64415,Marge,"homer simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our dvd player."
65321,Marge,no tv on a smart phone!
60388,Marge,"okay, hold onto your hats. ""dear artie..."""
58953,Marge,"oh, thanks."
54675,Marge,doctor marvin monroe?! are you alive or dead?
54983,Marge,"now, don't pout."
58538,Marge,what are you hiding there?
63991,Marge,now you know how i'll feel when you go to college.
60651,Marge,i don't care what they say. i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
62778,Marge,"grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
64020,Marge,"you got a letter all the way from new york city, and that's something!"
65116,Marge,homer! stop teasing!
60544,Marge,"yeah! i did it! marge is in the house! or, i will be soon. 'cause it needs some cleaning!"
66768,Marge,"c'mon, maggie. the first ride we go on will be for you."
56912,Marge,shoo! get outta here!
58752,Marge,"your character provides the comic relief. like... ohhh... marlon brando in ""apocalypse now."""
65373,Marge,"oh bart, you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about!"
55803,Marge,"doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. so we'll need something a little more... affordable."
58326,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie."
63285,Marge,sunny?
63135,Marge,"wait, you don't have a place to live?"
60688,Marge,my homie's dead? how will i go on?
55973,Marge,"""mrs. simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
61200,Marge,"wow, she really likes you. maybe the next time i need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
67415,Marge,"well, i don't feel like snuggling."
58175,Marge,the kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean.
64708,Marge,no time! i don't wanna get stuck behind the joggers from the fat camp.
65199,Marge,gordon ramsay!
57473,Marge,what a wonderful evening! a magical way for two people to renew their love.
58219,Marge,you what?!
65003,Marge,"um, hello... i'm marge simpson... i think i've given you money a of couple times..."
63281,Marge,"say, rainier, you're in show business. would you mind taking a look at this screenplay i wrote?"
62726,Marge,i'm not wearing a hat!
62118,Marge,we need to start saving!
61585,Marge,"i'm afraid what i like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
55458,Marge,"lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. please show him the error of his ways."
63081,Marge,all those women are so impressive.
59907,Marge,perfect.
66997,Marge,"but homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the man upstairs?"
60253,Marge,we'd better call the police.
55853,Marge,"mm-hm, if you'd like to learn more about colonial times we could take a field trip to old springfield towne."
63989,Marge,"listen lisa, i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town."
58047,Marge,"please, lisa. i don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but i really wish we could make peace before sunset."
55982,Marge,"i am lucky. i have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much."
56892,Marge,i think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
61764,Marge,why don't you publish your poem?
67127,Marge,uh... i-i'm saving it... for a special occasion.
61194,Marge,"oh, lord. why do they keep changing his medication?"
67626,Marge,...so i guess that may not count as anguish.
57064,Marge,"well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
59864,Marge,chief wiggum! are you here to make a bust of some kind?
62312,Marge,you know what i mean.
64450,Marge,"okay, who's ready for a wedding-theme knock-knock joke?"
67922,Marge,"um... mr. demon, could you come back for my sisters later?"
59272,Marge,dancing!
57787,Marge,"come right this way, mel. i... tim, hold my calls."
60613,Marge,"i put those ""cathys"" on the fridge for you. i don't even like them. they've gotten so smutty."
67260,Marge,adil?
54646,Marge,i thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
67574,Marge,excuse me. excuse me. he was addressing me.
58863,Marge,no thanks. but thanks.
55599,Marge,mmhmmm.
64330,Marge,"i'd just like to say one thing. i only agreed to this fight because i wanted to stop the violence. and sure i got into great shape and met some fun people, but i ended up discovering my own dark side. so from now on, the only thing i'm fighting is this cold i'm coming down with."
55152,Marge,no. i mean a vacation by myself.
59235,Marge,hello? homer? where are you? you promised you were going to have a tea party with maggie.
55207,Marge,you hit so many home runs this year. what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you?
55561,Marge,"we need the money, and my life is pretty boring. last week some jehovah's witnesses came to the door and i wouldn't let them leave. they snuck away when i went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
60637,Marge,but we're innocent! it was the man with the braces.
55583,Marge,oooh...
54902,Marge,i've got some good news. krusty the clown is coming to dinner tonight.
61432,Marge,hello?
67152,Marge,sure.
63844,Marge,i'll do it!
67368,Marge,"oh, homer, honey. come here."
63097,Marge,yee-hah!
60746,Marge,what if i just do aerobics and ...
58786,Marge,"of course, honey."
65335,Marge,is it on your father? little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
63222,Marge,"""dingle's berries"" in provo, utah?"
60172,Marge,devil beard?
63656,Marge,impossible! their commercial featured a talking frog.
65473,Marge,"got what, homer?"
56364,Marge,my prom date.
58571,Marge,why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with maggie and me?
62511,Marge,no.
63529,Marge,point zero nine.
61083,Marge,"another cover? my god, let it die."
64997,Marge,"homie, you know all the bits. maybe you could help him!"
66045,Marge,"oh homie, what a wonderful anniversary!"
66376,Marge,"uh-oh. it's horndog hank. well, nancy knows how to keep him away."
55153,Marge,"no homie, no. i still love you. a lot of couples take separate vacations."
59122,Marge,that's amazing! ...and darling.
58738,Marge,right. na--
58108,Marge,"mmmm. goodbye, ned. if the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, i want you to call me right away. or you can beep me. in fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? we'll go to a hotel."
56039,Marge,i knew it. if only i had nagged more...
65512,Marge,it's angry.
67138,Marge,thank you.
63695,Marge,homer really did need those injections.
65002,Marge,got a better idea?
57985,Marge,why can't we stay here?
60242,Marge,you think we can bribe her back with christmas?
67722,Marge,homer?
55975,Marge,"homer, please. you know it's hard for me to make friends."
64382,Marge,"this one has an action, and this one has a body part. see?"
62441,Marge,"oh homie, you got chicken pox. but how?"
67805,Marge,"hello, doctor hibbert? this is marge simpson."
61063,Marge,looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
56118,Marge,that sounds like a good movie.
63812,Marge,"we listened to music radio in the car... and, since you kids behaved, we'll pick one fun thing to do here."
66533,Marge,"mm, hm."
59102,Marge,shh!
58264,Marge,"ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt."
59288,Marge,"hm. well, did you see that picture of me in..."
62094,Marge,"okay, don't do it for her--"
67721,Marge,i also said i hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
60962,Marge,darn it! i keep pouring juice for five.
67708,Marge,yeah!
63094,Marge,well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
65840,Marge,i think this is great! old gay men are adorable! like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
60986,Marge,"lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing."
58589,Marge,really? that seemed awfully quick.
60258,Marge,"and don't worry, honey, i'll pray double hard for both of us. now let's get you some christmas cookies."
55669,Marge,"oh, homie, i was so frightened."
61160,Marge,only with kisses.
63936,Marge,but i can't take a dress from a man who looks so good and smells so clean.
55433,Marge,why can't you be a little more supportive?
66786,Marge,"homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday."
64346,Marge,"what is it, moe?"
61197,Marge,"grampa, stop!"
59876,Marge,what? we're not ready to compete!
54919,Marge,"much better! oh good, the curtains are on fire!"
55504,Marge,fruit is nature's candy!
65751,Marge,enough with the singing!
66221,Marge,it's not good! none of it's good!
65636,Marge,"lisa, dinnertime!"
57159,Marge,pleased to meet you. you look like such a happy bunch... of people.
65887,Marge,this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! it got three-and-a-half stars in the springfield tire guide!
56594,Marge,homer...
56298,Marge,wake up!
62215,Marge,"well, he does seem happy here..."
62943,Marge,"buck, tabitha, welcome. we'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here."
64483,Marge,if homer can join with me.
54872,Marge,"i know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but i'm not sure about the people bart's working for. i thinks they're criminals."
65075,Marge,"sorry, the occurrence, but to use your lingo, homer and i have to be ""that guy."""
55195,Marge,"homer! bart, you did a very cruel thing."
59224,Marge,can i interest you in a mincemeat pie? there very...
57409,Marge,i have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from springfield.
64070,Marge,ned! i think we have a gas leak!
56686,Marge,now i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. like switching to the metric system...
61863,Marge,"here, take this. my daughter didn't want the lunch i made."
62380,Marge,i've got my groove back!
56923,Marge,what?! no! you can't! i won't let you!
59008,Marge,"and it's all because of your letter, lisa."
64125,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. but that's an awful lot to pay for a dress i'll only wear once."
66091,Marge,can you follow everything okay?
54614,Marge,why don't we put on some music?
67150,Marge,jacques.
63430,Marge,don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
61936,Marge,"i'm coming, sweetheart!"
65621,Marge,there's exactly one rita lafleur living in springfield!
61381,Marge,"oh, it's very wise. it's written by a rabbi -- who surfs!"
64813,Marge,would it be so bad to turn out like me?
64936,Marge,now it's ready for garbage!
61868,Marge,fine! i'll take my mothering elsewhere.
60233,Marge,a little much.
55066,Marge,homer... come home with me.
62684,Marge,"mr. burns, isn't it more important that you got a child to smile at you?"
60543,Marge,shoo! shoo!
61283,Marge,"homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. all that candy is rotting your brain."
60320,Marge,hello?
56845,Marge,"homer, i'm on duty."
55747,Marge,he called you a bad father.
60650,Marge,no beer!
66589,Marge,ohh.
61629,Marge,i'm afraid this time a coat of whitewash won't cover it.
58684,Marge,"oh, homie. i'm so glad you're all right."
59253,Marge,"say, whatcha got there?"
59961,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous."
66358,Marge,where could bart be?
66867,Marge,"really? awag? really? well, if you think tha--"
62863,Marge,i remember bart!
59505,Marge,you went to the snack car?
63539,Marge,i promised that bank robber that i'd visit him in jail. but i just can't do it.
58038,Marge,what are you doing with that?
56757,Marge,"she's right, homer. there's something about his face i don't trust."
62454,Marge,"really? well, just for that i'm gonna erase all the saved games on your playstation."
58716,Marge,sure you do. you have the right to remain silent.
55039,Marge,"""marge, from the first moment i saw you i never wanted to be with anyone else. i don't have much to offer you... except all my love. will you marry me?"""
61338,Marge,whatever.
62817,Marge,what a fascinating cross-section of humanity! you've got the lonely but loveable loser...
66794,Marge,i really do miss my homie this time of night.
54925,Marge,"it's your father, he's missing."
56028,Marge,"that video really opened my eyes. i can see that i'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. by nagging you when you do foolish things, i just enable your life-script."
54772,Marge,"kids, could you lighten up a little?"
63614,Marge,"i've lost my perfect twenty-six, twenty-six, twenty-six figure."
59047,Marge,"oh! you're not going anywhere, missy."
59519,Marge,"my goodness, what a lovely suit, sheriff. is that seersucker?"
56818,Marge,"well, thank you, honey."
62929,Marge,"homer, we need those tickets to get in!"
63705,Marge,"kids, knock it off. i'm uncomfortable driving your father's car as it is."
65268,Marge,"she's coming home for christmas! and bart's bringing the boys! and lisa's coming with zia! for once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!"
56695,Marge,"hello, i'm marge simpson and this is my husband, homer."
66491,Marge,"now homie, i hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life."
61438,Marge,"""as temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean, she realized it was... the end."""
56084,Marge,and my necklace.
57590,Marge,"oh, homer, i know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the mafia's not getting one cent of my money!"
55297,Marge,"kids, will you come in here?"
64669,Marge,good. that'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
62323,Marge,"let's just change the subject. bart, would you like to say grace?"
61659,Marge,this is so luxurious! i feel like i'm princess grace and princess di smashed together!
56597,Marge,did you have to be so graphic?
55502,Marge,"oh, homer."
64419,Marge,"uh-huh, and now hand me your neck..."
64377,Marge,maybe this will take your mind off work.
58484,Marge,"but they're counting on you to take tickets. and if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
57438,Marge,"well, i pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. i pictured napkins... homer, i want to throw a dinner party."
57939,Marge,"that sounds beautiful, ned. and let me just say, my family and i share your vision for a better now!"
67853,Marge,"now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece."
64763,Marge,he's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
66733,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this band has brought out the best in you."
58785,Marge,"sweet dreams, honey."
62548,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is."
55365,Marge,maybe we should play another game.
66116,Marge,"no! no, that's bart's cereal!"
57100,Marge,"you can't hide from me in this house, bart! i spend 23 hours a day here!"
66219,Marge,you have a baby together?
66429,Marge,"okay... i see your point. we should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the van houtens."
61088,Marge,i really don't want to do a lot of flip-de-loops.
66346,Marge,"oh, i bet my story's more interesting."
65913,Marge,i'm not hungry. goodnight.
65718,Marge,i thought the basement looked cleaner.
60819,Marge,no one will ever know.
55873,Marge,i'm marge simpson. your new cellmate.
61094,Marge,"thir-what year old?!! lisa, you're only eight."
59795,Marge,"well, look at that painting."
55179,Marge,"oh, i don't know..."
54804,Marge,we got exactly what we wanted out of this: we gave an old man a second chance.
61193,Marge,"no, no all that's in there is love and gratitude."
63215,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie?"
55516,Marge,oh...
59242,Marge,homer!
54858,Marge,"we can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --"
63536,Marge,"dwight, use your noodle. if you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. i'll tell them you're a good guy."
66800,Marge,they've run away!
56640,Marge,undersecretary for international protocol. brat and punk division.
60086,Marge,what? bart is dead!
63816,Marge,shelter?
65092,Marge,"okay. okay, the spare key is somewhere in here."
59310,Marge,"sorry, how long will he take to recover?"
63917,Marge,"homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers. they don't look like the stabby kind."
62885,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
67569,Marge,please stop. please. be quiet.
63892,Marge,i think it's time for us to go home.
57442,Marge,"bart, company's coming. go put doilies under the coasters. hurry! hurry!"
61006,Marge,"look, can you please just tell us why you've changed the flight paths?"
67210,Marge,homer!
57555,Marge,"hello, helen."
55706,Marge,"mr. kobb, what can we do?"
62960,Marge,let's go.
65314,Marge,rag soup!
58597,Marge,"well, it looks like the lake is the place to be, huh?"
67315,Marge,"thank you for coming on such short notice, ms. botz."
65678,Marge,holy areole...
59592,Marge,that's crazy.
62534,Marge,"hello, bart. just so you know, i sold our bike."
67447,Marge,what exactly did he say?
61498,Marge,"well, i know who you are. and here's something to help you never forget!"
56934,Marge,you mean maggie?
54640,Marge,but homer's so supportive. he's paying for me to go to college.
60713,Marge,"so to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. do you like it?"
61249,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? even your brother's adding his kudos."
62918,Marge,well then i choose... uh...
59054,Marge,"no, you weren't."
58394,Marge,bart! what have i told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?
62053,Marge,"homer, you married every gay couple in town."
67456,Marge,i wish this family was as close as the flanders.
55752,Marge,"why didn't you ask our permission, lisa?"
61792,Marge,playdude magazines? have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
65528,Marge,"so, this is basically what we can afford."
61850,Marge,"i told him to use a land line. okay gang, let's get this party started -- or should i say barted?"
66874,Marge,not even homer?
62650,Marge,that was yesterday.
60415,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad to see... a tape on the bed?!"
57506,Marge,"eight spices! oh, some must be doubles. ""or-uh-gahn-o?"" what the hell...?"
60794,Marge,your school chums are going to be so jealous of your little outfit.
63819,Marge,i'd stay away from poodles. they give the dog... ideas.
62825,Marge,"why, a woman invented liquid paper."
58282,Marge,"mm, if you'd just apologize to louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want."
61080,Marge,"well, you'll never have to."
57087,Marge,i don't know. why don't you go to bed?
65970,Marge,"oh moe, this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes!"
57306,Marge,"lisa, that's not at all like you."
63112,Marge,i wish i'd married lenny and his friend!
59374,Marge,"hmm, i know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
66355,Marge,"bart's usually first in line for taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
65072,Marge,that was a mirror!
59869,Marge,"will you get serious, homer? i'd like to win at least once."
61233,Marge,win your own t-shirt!
62426,Marge,something's wrong with maggie. we should get her to dr. hibbert. but i don't see him anywhere.
59845,Marge,"i believe you, jack. now let's get you out of here... wait for my signal."
55256,Marge,"oh no! those are my numbers! if it wasn't for that dog, i would've won!"
59598,Marge,i thought you said the law was powerless.
62294,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie!"
65607,Marge,i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
63681,Marge,"that's what you said about yellow fever, and that was no fun."
56997,Marge,"let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
67855,Marge,well...
66720,Marge,it's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.
63517,Marge,bart?
59516,Marge,i'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip.
59441,Marge,hmm. a night out is a night out.
67682,Marge,"oh, the shop kids are smoking again."
55403,Marge,"homie, i didn't get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid."
54987,Marge,"bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
66024,Marge,stop it! no karate monsters at the dinner table!
62302,Marge,homer!
65899,Marge,i'm not going to sleep!
56800,Marge,see?...
55313,Marge,"there, there..."
58987,Marge,"that's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if i, i don't know, entered a belching contest?"
64572,Marge,"homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
65439,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, i'm trying to put maggie to sleep!"
55080,Marge,yes!
63611,Marge,"oh homie, i'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me."
60937,Marge,i really enjoyed your sermon. particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane fifteen.
64345,Marge,there must be another way...
57127,Marge,"i don't care who's consolidating their power. well, we don't need this."
55678,Marge,homer!
60496,Marge,"""just then, sir lancelot rode up on a white horse and saved joan of arc. they got married and lived in a spaceship. the end."""
57973,Marge,does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
62802,Marge,marge obedience temperance sexwon't.
63671,Marge,my eye!
63588,Marge,hold on -- i still have to caramelize.
60211,Marge,chief wiggum!
65366,Marge,on a night like tonight i have to believe there are.
66097,Marge,that's great. i wonder what surprise your father has in store.
55172,Marge,and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
61176,Marge,all right. everyone inside. let's go.
65942,Marge,what about my dress?
63404,Marge,my cake!
56390,Marge,"see all that stuff in there, homer? that's why your robot never worked."
58424,Marge,mmm.
58251,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
57652,Marge,"oh, then i guess this is goodbye, roy. maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
59521,Marge,"dang, i wish i could. but in august, our chain gang has to dig for tar."
57618,Marge,"homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one."
64317,Marge,"""beat, slay, shove."""
57276,Marge,just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about.
55711,Marge,"homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
60240,Marge,you're gonna get a bath tonight.
59850,Marge,"i just saw you! get him outta here, chief!"
61537,Marge,"okay, fine, he is."
67882,Marge,doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
64464,Marge,"so bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
56123,Marge,"i had a malibu stacy when i was little, and i turned out all right. now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
54717,Marge,"man, things sure have turned to crap."
63170,Marge,"ooh, this is one of our trips to barnacle bay! we used to rent a beach house there every summer."
61894,Marge,this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose.
66426,Marge,well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
57807,Marge,"swipe at the dominant male! c'mon, ned, knock that monkey down!"
62007,Marge,you showed me you could be a really sweet guy. you can make a woman very happy some day.
63904,Marge,"wow, lenny went all out!"
60150,Marge,"shh. no, we can't play now."
64411,Marge,bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
58782,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
62530,Marge,aren't they jazzy? they match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!
62685,Marge,i can see there's only one way to turn you into human beings again.
61023,Marge,"there he is. krusty, we came to see how many campaign promises you've kept."
57216,Marge,"kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
67021,Marge,"uh-uh, homer. lisa's making these for her teacher."
61045,Marge,the box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. and why would a box lie to a person?
66477,Marge,"homie, i don't have a problem with you. except your buttons are off one.... actually, this is a collar button... see? it goes like this..."
67625,Marge,"...although he doesn't really like school all that much,"
63672,Marge,"homie, this is your party!"
63879,Marge,"honey, keeping track of someone because you love them is not wrong."
63854,Marge,how dare you?!
59147,Marge,and their beams.
67214,Marge,eugene fisk? isn't he your assistant?
57342,Marge,"well, we could use the extra money... and this house is falling apart."
65916,Marge,what does this do?
63622,Marge,we have a family.
55160,Marge,whenever she needs it.
62187,Marge,"governor, i think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers."
58984,Marge,"here he is. this is where the... ""magic"" happens."
67036,Marge,"oh, homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck."
62977,Marge,homer!
66164,Marge,lumbar! it means lower back. how many times will you make that mistake?
54624,Marge,"you're right. but i'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, britney spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit."
57689,Marge,for life!
63488,Marge,"well, arthur fiedler used to, but i'd better take a look."
65027,Marge,i told you you should've stopped the tickling.
65538,Marge,quit bageling my english muffins!
65118,Marge,just vote! it's your duty as a citizen of tv.
60829,Marge,the late frank grimes...
58118,Marge,homer! look at this mob! the good toys are probably all gone.
67388,Marge,look at me. i've never been so angry. my hands are shaking.
59416,Marge,"i do! i do! wait, no i don't."
60857,Marge,"apu, where's your bathroom?"
60737,Marge,"ah, homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?"
56026,Marge,i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
58454,Marge,"oh, we drank so much that night."
67742,Marge,bart!
58368,Marge,you've signed my name lots of times.
60495,Marge,"of course they didn't, honey."
58899,Marge,this sounds juicy.
60306,Marge,but we're on hiatus. everyone's everywhere.
57667,Marge,... sexual.
64112,Marge,i want to talk to howard.
57191,Marge,"oh, homie, i like your in-your-face humanity. i like the way lisa speaks her mind. i like bart's... i like bart. and i like my old green dress. i didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
62258,Marge,"don't you mean ""tough love?"""
60481,Marge,bill.
59075,Marge,i'd like to see the japanese take on the club sandwich. i bet it's smaller and more efficient!
64542,Marge,you practiced all day on my birthday!
63765,Marge,...but still no sign of lurleen's dad!
60385,Marge,"artie, get off of me."
54800,Marge,bart does.
59082,Marge,family wish show... hmmm... that gives me an idea.
61090,Marge,why don't you just chase the beavers away?
63682,Marge,i wonder who that could... beeee!
56504,Marge,i simply can't wait that long. maybe we should get some help... how 'bout a book?
67145,Marge,i don't see what he's doing that's so different from what i'm doing.
65583,Marge,my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday...
64335,Marge,i guess i could!
66369,Marge,sounds like that would take a while.
57422,Marge,"here i come, everybody!"
63857,Marge,"homie, i've got a confession to make: i'm an erotic baker."
61159,Marge,"i love you, too."
65693,Marge,hurry up! i want to get grampa back here by three so we can get him and maggie on the same nap schedule.
56268,Marge,won't this overload the motor?
66678,Marge,what happened?
58151,Marge,"they've forgiven us. it's a miracle! you know, deep down, people are pretty g-- hey, wait a minute! they're taking our stuff!"
56071,Marge,no.
56148,Marge,"but, why would the advisory board give us bad advice?"
63498,Marge,"oh, i don't want to bother the internet with my problem."
62232,Marge,ray's not coming!
55128,Marge,but gambling is illegal.
67005,Marge,"oh, homer."
55220,Marge,"morning, honey."
59368,Marge,"that's not an award, that's part of the set."
54683,Marge,that is so beautiful.
66520,Marge,they're always bragging about their trip to rome. it was twelve years ago and it was a layover. i want new friends!
59622,Marge,"okay, the material was a little corny, but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen."
67235,Marge,"i've been thinking, homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? you taught bart a very bad lesson. your boy idolizes you."
55592,Marge,"hm, what about the bread? does that have much fish in it?"
63287,Marge,"paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! kids, get in the car! we're going to pennsylvania!"
55798,Marge,lisa needs braces.
59877,Marge,get 'em off! get 'em off!
55995,Marge,me too.
65601,Marge,just yell across the house like you do everything else!
66132,Marge,i've been having snuggle dreams!
55325,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking about what bart said. if he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should buy him a guitar."
64620,Marge,"lisa, sweetheart -- it's almost dinnertime. why don't you come home?"
59562,Marge,mm-hmm?
62799,Marge,"i see you met our devout leader, ned flandish."
63067,Marge,"all right, but no combat."
67264,Marge,homer!
60638,Marge,"we appreciate your coming to comfort us, but we're not catholic."
66102,Marge,i have three kids.
60727,Marge,"well, make sure you don't. and try not to let your brother get under your skin."
61238,Marge,thanks for the meatloaf recipe. i claim it as my own.
55002,Marge,what do you mean?
61812,Marge,well...
60486,Marge,"well, look who the fates dragged in."
59182,Marge,it's impossible. i killed you.
65582,Marge,what a wonderful thought.
67274,Marge,"hello, homer. what's that?"
58319,Marge,"nnno, that stinks. let me try one."
58559,Marge,i'm sure we can work this out. he's just a child. let me talk to him.
55555,Marge,curator of large mammals?
59431,Marge,homer? homer?
67301,Marge,yeah.
56604,Marge,"i've got to tell homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. until then please, keep this to yourselves."
60096,Marge,"ooo, that really covers the cat crap!"
59539,Marge,okay.
55007,Marge,"well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
57754,Marge,you told me about that candy bar you found three times!
56387,Marge,you're sure she'll have fun here?
67064,Marge,"we're just browsing, thank you."
65219,Marge,this is nice -- a family fun day!
64901,Marge,but they were a bad influence on you.
57063,Marge,"well, if loving my kids is ""lame,"" then i guess i'm just a big lame."
62216,Marge,homer!
64528,Marge,yup. one-oh-three on the dot. you're stayin' home.
63785,Marge,"honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars."
67027,Marge,"well, bart, i hope you're going straight to the principal about this."
65750,Marge,"homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me."
58301,Marge,you poor little boy.
66734,Marge,are you okay?
64106,Marge,"bart, if you hate belgium so much, maybe i should take your tintins away!"
55900,Marge,i don't think this is such a good idea.
64892,Marge,"dear lord, watch over my sweet homie while he's in the hoosegow."
59055,Marge,"lisa, thank god you're okay."
64642,Marge,homer my mother's party's starting any minute. get busy.
63613,Marge,"look maggie, i'm wonder woman."
63905,Marge,"bart, i've had it with you! i'm taking away all your tv privileges."
57860,Marge,"oh, homer. of course you'll have a bad impression of new york if you only focus on the pimps and the chuds."
54914,Marge,"oh, my land!"
61532,Marge,no. your problem is you never think of anyone besides yourself.
57823,Marge,just a little more... then he won't have any reason to resent you.
62602,Marge,uh-oh. he's getting that stabby look.
59321,Marge,i'll never get rid of this useless junk.
55318,Marge,"go ahead, patty."
54629,Marge,there will too be women astronauts!
55315,Marge,"oooh, there's krusty the clown! krusty, krusty, say something funny."
62879,Marge,that sounds horrible!
58769,Marge,"oh, my lord! i feel like cinderella."
60282,Marge,why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
62933,Marge,"give me a kiss, homie."
65589,Marge,you never told me about that.
56628,Marge,"get in the shelter, homer."
67332,Marge,how come all the lights are on?
66851,Marge,sure!
65187,Marge,"""when you stick a pancake into a friend's mouth, it's a 'goorsha.'"" everybody goorsha!"
59752,Marge,it's ten in the morning!
60082,Marge,morning!
66362,Marge,of course not. it's just duck.
61950,Marge,"well, i like t-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
59991,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? he named it after his wife."
67787,Marge,"bart! lisa! if you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home."
66266,Marge,setting it up!
67591,Marge,sure.
62705,Marge,homer! we're not in high school.
67681,Marge,not if i have to do heavy lifting or math.
55910,Marge,"homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
58220,Marge,you what?!
60167,Marge,no! everyone should be paired up.
57428,Marge,uh... sorry.
58704,Marge,that's it.
63558,Marge,"um, what are we doing here?"
61977,Marge,"i had a feeling you'd say that. so i prepared something that might help you ""change your tune."""
67476,Marge,it's in the second drawer from the right.
55626,Marge,"well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: ms. pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young joe piscopo taught us how to laugh. before lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the lower east side of springfield."
58729,Marge,i guess.
60978,Marge,it's on my apron.
55987,Marge,"oh, that's nice."
55015,Marge,"okay, let's see... ""ahoy maties! if the water turns blue, a baby for you. if purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
62466,Marge,"bart, wake up. i got that bike you wanted!"
58791,Marge,"well, i'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage?"
62193,Marge,she's really enjoying alaska.
60553,Marge,hello?
59133,Marge,"oh, grow up."
56125,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
61056,Marge,"oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?"
62348,Marge,and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
60801,Marge,"yes they did, look closer."
59537,Marge,but you just said that...
59987,Marge,look!
60847,Marge,"okay lisa, now open the present from your father and me."
55249,Marge,"i'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and i found a way to stretch the food budget. fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. ham night will be spam night. and porkchop night..."
57124,Marge,"well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
57466,Marge,"only three cavities, bart. your best check-up ever. i'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
62690,Marge,"there, there... the fact that you tried means everything."
62856,Marge,who are those freaks?
60052,Marge,"oh, homer won't be able to play for a long time."
65524,Marge,"homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!"
55350,Marge,how cute. they don't open their mouths do they?
61017,Marge,how can you say that?
56975,Marge,"homer, stop looking!"
58332,Marge,i put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
63778,Marge,"no, no, that's just our old christmas decorations."
67167,Marge,"yes, very."
63310,Marge,"ew, i can't watch this."
56074,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i have been spending too much time at the casino. i'll be around more from now on."
56439,Marge,have you noticed any change in bart?
56245,Marge,"homer, don't you have to get to class?"
62987,Marge,"actually, he's ten."
62725,Marge,maybe he's getting married!
57757,Marge,"yeah, he's broke!"
63647,Marge,"here's a message for you: ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop!"
56590,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah two. let's get to the baby pictures."
55275,Marge,you should have called. i was very worried.
56232,Marge,hm? hm?
64953,Marge,a completely new hairstyle!
62755,Marge,"ooh, your toaster takes bagels. how ritzy!"
57879,Marge,"we're not jumping, homer."
65936,Marge,...debugged and fresh as a daisy.
64928,Marge,you know nothing about my son and even less about apples.
59287,Marge,none of you? really? i could have sworn that ramrod...
60905,Marge,"no, no!"
58112,Marge,mm-hmm.
64865,Marge,"more oxycontin candy, sweetie?"
67143,Marge,thank you.
65891,Marge,"uh, i'm thinking of getting maggie swimming lessons."
59309,Marge,why are you doing that?
54948,Marge,"homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
61319,Marge,what's that?
57268,Marge,"well, things were bad everywhere."
57871,Marge,only in new york!
65844,Marge,abe... we found your storage locker.
56767,Marge,that's it. we have to get them back to school.
65954,Marge,"all right, at least i can delete these westminster dog shows."
60004,Marge,they're for after dinner.
58297,Marge,it says the ceiling was donated by the velcro company.
67852,Marge,"now, homer. we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you."
54995,Marge,of course. all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe.
67650,Marge,what would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
63733,Marge,"lisa, have i ever shown you my shattered dreams box?"
60406,Marge,you need that surgery. we'll have to call artie.
55521,Marge,and what if we don't?
65098,Marge,"well, maggie, one key left for us!"
56358,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
64130,Marge,"okay, i want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces."
66380,Marge,well then maybe i need to give those kids a better example. goodnight!
59704,Marge,"you are not pretending to be dead, young lady. this family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
65736,Marge,"you've been in public education a long time, haven't you?"
65959,Marge,what kind of accident?
63769,Marge,she needs to see you right away!
67783,Marge,it's the hospital.
60440,Marge,"oh, i see you drive on the left up here."
63849,Marge,"marge, calm down. for as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. it fills a need, and harms no one."
67830,Marge,"my quilt! six generations, gone."
62664,Marge,on the back of your head.
62748,Marge,"oh, how nice for her!"
63147,Marge,"gil, listen. we've been very patient, but i want you to..."
58707,Marge,"you know, homie, there's so much more two wives could do for you."
60030,Marge,shoo!
58886,Marge,homer...
55381,Marge,"good-bye my special little guy. lisa, watch out for poison ivy. remember, ""leaves of 3, let it be."
58277,Marge,"homer, i insist you steal that car."
59718,Marge,i'm proud that you won the pulitzer...
66404,Marge,maybe.
58182,Marge,what the? what are you doing inside?
59372,Marge,seems a little wasteful.
59193,Marge,"oh my, war is terrible."
59701,Marge,"now honey, let's turn on the news and forget our troubles."
65117,Marge,"homie, it was maggie."
60699,Marge,"homie, it's five p.m. we're having dinner."
65113,Marge,he's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
66616,Marge,no lawsuit! you're hired!
62209,Marge,"well, he better high-five our roof!"
64755,Marge,this is that videogame reverend lovejoy said you shouldn't play!
55767,Marge,what's so funny?
55799,Marge,lisa needs braces.
58283,Marge,"um, you're just having a bad day. i had one last week. i burned the roast, my cake fell, and i ran out of butter so i had to spray the english muffins with pam."
65444,Marge,"i'm sorry, sweetie. maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""mr. steak."""
60280,Marge,"homer, i don't know if i can ever forgive you. please go away."
58257,Marge,"homer, bill gates is here."
61542,Marge,"kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra."
65993,Marge,"okay, let's try again."
58173,Marge,i'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
58802,Marge,eighteen hours? nobody works that hard.
65947,Marge,tell her she's wrong!
57196,Marge,"what are you going to spend your money on, kids?"
67638,Marge,my name is marge.
57919,Marge,"come on, honey. i guess this is a world you'll never know."
59026,Marge,"we're walking, homer."
63874,Marge,"okay, bart went to the comic book store."
55087,Marge,"i'll get some at the store tomorrow, homer."
67839,Marge,"say goodbye to grampa, everyone."
61625,Marge,"edna's with comic book guy? oh god, she's on the rebound! and you meet the worst guys on the rebound. it's how jackie got her ""o""!"
66463,Marge,quit comparing me to ben chapman!
54886,Marge,"hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
65341,Marge,"you're going with me! but lisa, after this, i don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. if you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me."
64682,Marge,we can enjoy each others' company.
66220,Marge,i'm a schwarzenegger wife.
65220,Marge,it's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
65198,Marge,but this was all i had!
58482,Marge,"ohh, so you don't have a date. you can still go and have a wonderful time."
58334,Marge,"homer, i painted that for you."
60640,Marge,it's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
56689,Marge,"you like my idea? actually, i have several others..."
61182,Marge,"well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations."
67472,Marge,"well, okay. let's see... can you do the cranberry sauce?"
55023,Marge,"homer, do you ever think about the future?"
58951,Marge,"speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?"
55406,Marge,i don't think so.
64970,Marge,"look out, chicks! the silver fox is coming to the hen house!"
57405,Marge,i've got rocks that need washing at home.
66869,Marge,"well, not all of them. like, um, ninety percent?"
64975,Marge,"odd, that's what the valet just asked me."
56584,Marge,i meant our wedding rings.
65853,Marge,is this true?
60244,Marge,just do it. do it. do it now!
58655,Marge,no! we're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school.
57971,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. no weapons."
61019,Marge,those jets keep going lower and lower.
61198,Marge,"oh, lord."
55788,Marge,but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red...
55870,Marge,"i'll be fine, dear."
61518,Marge,"oh, your nightlight's burned out. and the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
63677,Marge,it's the first of the month. the day you promised to start your new diet.
66788,Marge,"homer, i have to use the porta potty."
59975,Marge,on the ground?
63732,Marge,"a ballet academy here in springfield?! move over, europe!"
59617,Marge,"they told us what to wear, how to dress, which clothes we should put on..."
62758,Marge,where's ben?
63061,Marge,don't worry. i have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.
59717,Marge,do you want turkey sausage or ham?
65875,Marge,"well, she's just a substitute. maybe you could transfer ms. cantwell to another school."
63987,Marge,i don't know. all it takes is one troubled loner.
57878,Marge,i hope your father had as much fun as we did.
65377,Marge,"homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
66007,Marge,i signed you up for the ten-and-below talent show next week!
66318,Marge,"bart, your school requires you to give everyone a valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
66727,Marge,what?
65165,Marge,i've got it!
57509,Marge,it looks so complicated... do you know how?
54836,Marge,"no, it is not the truth, homer. it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
65476,Marge,i have to take maggie for her checkup. and a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
61623,Marge,"i won't let edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die."
60569,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
57607,Marge,"oh, all right, all right, i'll get your milk!"
56498,Marge,hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
65487,Marge,"also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!"
65948,Marge,"sorry maggie, i just don't have the touch today."
60530,Marge,"excuse me, we think this boy might be here."
67464,Marge,now i suppose you both have to sign this. i hope blood won't be necessary.
65189,Marge,"""three?"" you mean, one, two... me?"
55806,Marge,that doesn't sound like they like you at all.
55986,Marge,mayor quimby! what are you doing here?
60376,Marge,i'm taking him to dr. hibbert's this afternoon. you know how hard it is to get a doctor on wednesday morning.
62868,Marge,"i'm sorry. you seem like... a colorful character, but i just don't remember you."
63652,Marge,"oh, lighten up. you tv fat cats have plenty of money. my cousin maureen saw you flying in business class!"
55286,Marge,her manager? that's ridiculous. i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
62325,Marge,i knew they'd try to convert you! that's what they do! well i'm not having another twelve kids.
65596,Marge,"well, maybe we should check into a motel."
56251,Marge,get out! get out! get out!
56669,Marge,what's that supposed to mean?
56593,Marge,i don't know if it's such a good idea. can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
54809,Marge,oh... thank you.
65402,Marge,"mona, you're alive?!"
66057,Marge,"hi, homie! a crazy thing happened when i was ordering your anniversary gift."
57251,Marge,"with bart gone, and now you and your father, i'm not going to have anyone to--"
59568,Marge,"bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
63211,Marge,this alley looks dangerous. i'd better turn my ring around.
64974,Marge,i'm looking for homer simpson.
67390,Marge,"oh, don't call me lady. my name is marge simpson, this is my family and we're not going anywhere. we're all going to have to live together, so you better get used to it... please."
62629,Marge,"homie, what's wrong? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?"
66003,Marge,"helen lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot."
61144,Marge,"oh, you're really coming along, homie."
55944,Marge,"wait! before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
65239,Marge,"look, i came to talk about my husband, and... how did we get in here?"
65032,Marge,"you'll be fine, you always are."
58583,Marge,"oh, lord. i was hoping this day would never come."
61790,Marge,maybe you should turn off the power.
56911,Marge,you did the right thing by telling me.
65907,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
59337,Marge,i couldn't sleep knowing that window had a smudge on it.
60943,Marge,it's reverend lovejoy!
62789,Marge,"homie, stop! you're not a god!"
54865,Marge,"so bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
63675,Marge,aren't you going to drink?
59459,Marge,"aww, just like her mommy, maggie senior. so, what did everyone do today?"
54674,Marge,"this is all your fault, homer, for wanting somebody new!"
62171,Marge,"there must be something else. think marge, think. culture... vulture... birds of prey... pray in a church... the father, son and holy ghost... ghosts are scary, scary rhymes with gehry! that's it -- architect frank gehry! he could build us a concert hall like he did in los angeles."
59749,Marge,"uh, sure looks that way... but at least bart and homer are spending quality time together."
59776,Marge,forget it.
60028,Marge,"oh, no. we're out of gas. i couldn't figure out this stupid italian gas gauge."
55827,Marge,an invitation to our high school reunion.
58883,Marge,"come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair."
56421,Marge,go crazy?
67544,Marge,"well, that's what we want them to do, homer."
60187,Marge,hello?
64043,Marge,homie! what are you doing home so early?
65972,Marge,"and look over there, moe."
57562,Marge,i'll take it!
54791,Marge,a-positive.
59501,Marge,"oh, no."
58065,Marge,helping people find homes... that must be really rewarding.
66976,Marge,"you did it, homer."
59470,Marge,bart!
64311,Marge,really?
62268,Marge,"bart, don't use that word... oh crap."
62017,Marge,i know how to save this park -- i'm gonna organize a charity carnival!
56520,Marge,you didn't want to have bart.
66598,Marge,"so, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?"
54915,Marge,"ooh, a new pacifier."
63382,Marge,i was talking about--
58804,Marge,maybe we should leave.
67702,Marge,why is there make-out music on?
62813,Marge,who else has a story?
60835,Marge,"honey, the king of mardi gras has to ride around on a float all day. you'll be a sitting duck."
65401,Marge,we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
57162,Marge,"didn't everybody have a wonderful time? i thought it was so opulent -- like the playboy mansion, but non-sexual."
60548,Marge,uh-oh.
59480,Marge,isn't it adorable? i guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film.
63752,Marge,"homie, lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy."
60107,Marge,that sounds like a lie.
65902,Marge,what are you doing home from work?
56434,Marge,"relax, honey. you were just having a crazy nightmare. you're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out."
58942,Marge,"ohhh, it's heavenly! ""why do birds suddenly appear... over there, over here..."""
60503,Marge,no way i'm cleaning up this mess.
61033,Marge,i didn't know mr. burns had an electric eel pond.
55385,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful."
67752,Marge,no.
63265,Marge,nooooo! it's gone! that family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
67888,Marge,i thought there was some good in everybody until i met him.
61048,Marge,"ooh, look how late it is. let's get you kids some coffee."
55407,Marge,"no, homer."
58255,Marge,what exactly is it your company does again?
62074,Marge,she's a man! looks like patty's gonna get something she didn't register for.
66963,Marge,"well, come on, you two. don't forget about the film festival."
66064,Marge,"i am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
54771,Marge,"oh my, the house looks wonderful. grampa, what's your secret?"
65419,Marge,suzette!
57793,Marge,hello. listen lady.
54803,Marge,"homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
64499,Marge,boo yeah!
67471,Marge,"honey, please. you're in the way."
67821,Marge,homer!
59832,Marge,"well, jack here will do great work for you."
63006,Marge,you are not bringing that thing home.
59693,Marge,when you spy a quarter in a pie...
62117,Marge,"oh, this is only based on a story. a true story!"
60257,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're back."
65810,Marge,"okay, no tv at all."
58114,Marge,but i...
59023,Marge,i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. when was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
67007,Marge,"homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?"
55456,Marge,homer! are you actually giving up your faith?
58005,Marge,"milhouse, stop that!"
67469,Marge,"oh, my best dress."
64449,Marge,potato... tomato... let's call the whole thing--
64459,Marge,"the laundry. the machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it."
64695,Marge,at least in hell the heat still works.
64816,Marge,you what?!
58342,Marge,why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
62732,Marge,"that's very sweet, but i..."
67829,Marge,"come on, homer. i want you to see what your sick little girl did."
56398,Marge,i'm so embarrassed. i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die.
54778,Marge,"for months, i worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
64546,Marge,well then there won't be any sex!
59805,Marge,"welcome to ""freeing the artist within."" not literally, of course."
64617,Marge,"homie, i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic. it usually does not end well."
57903,Marge,"ooh, there's the bus. goodbye, sweetheart!"
65258,Marge,this is the part where i get the kids out of the room.
63093,Marge,"homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. i'm as hopeful and full of life as i was in the years before i met you."
59495,Marge,not now.
60188,Marge,person-to-person?!
64397,Marge,strawberries and whipped cream.
64612,Marge,it's making our meter run backwards!
56019,Marge,"homer, this is terrible!"
61235,Marge,don't tell me you're actually going.
56930,Marge,...and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
62076,Marge,"patty, it's not what you think. veronica is a man!"
54813,Marge,"oh, my! it's mr. burns."
60032,Marge,bart!!!
57805,Marge,donny!
64099,Marge,what is that soothing sound?
54890,Marge,"mrs. van houten, i'm bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
61142,Marge,"that's okay. i can handle it. homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?"
66138,Marge,perfect! perfect!
56117,Marge,"oh, that'll work out great. we're out of lucky charms."
56344,Marge,"well, as jerry lee lewis would say: ""there's a whole lotta frowning going on."""
59178,Marge,no.
66398,Marge,it's eighty-two degrees!
64478,Marge,it's not the same.
58553,Marge,oh my goodness! look!
55212,Marge,"children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. kids?"
65780,Marge,"well, at least we have time to get the pets' christmas presents."
62350,Marge,my christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early.
61323,Marge,"no. i'm gonna parcel my anger out over the next few days and weeks, jabbing at you just when you seem the most content."
60301,Marge,"well, i'm going to have a talk with them. where are their worldwide headquarters located?"
56277,Marge,does that earring mean you're a pirate?
56132,Marge,"but on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
66966,Marge,"oh, well."
54884,Marge,"""for heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... employee-of-the-month!"" ohh, homer!"
65872,Marge,did you tell the teacher?
54883,Marge,"homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? and what's all this?"
67181,Marge,what's brunch?
60551,Marge,hello?
61948,Marge,"bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!"
62982,Marge,and i can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
64536,Marge,there's no such thing as prayer blocks!
62541,Marge,"your job isn't to worry about me, it's to give me things to worry about."
55738,Marge,do you feel any better?
57572,Marge,"i should've said ""limit -- one per customer."""
61254,Marge,those fudruckers!
58314,Marge,but...
61043,Marge,"this is even better than our screensaver. and i love our screensaver. nicely done, lisa."
64463,Marge,"i'm not a dude, i'm a hottie!"
55938,Marge,"bart! you should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they'd rather listen to that old war of the worlds broadcast on npr, hmmm?"
67245,Marge,"i know how you like 'em, homer."
59345,Marge,"well, it has been a week."
65920,Marge,i'm glad you're okay.
58384,Marge,my casserole is not filth. eat it.
54929,Marge,maybe.
60844,Marge,what are you doing here?
61708,Marge,you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
55083,Marge,wha'd you say? i can't understand you with all that distortion.
58231,Marge,"now, how are we going to get my homie back?"
67393,Marge,you... you speak english.
57587,Marge,what are you talking about?
61374,Marge,"and the bumper stickers misspelled ""on""."
57431,Marge,is it really necessary to watch tv while we're eating? we're getting food all over.
64657,Marge,"a lot of people sound like sideshow bob, like frasier on ""cheers."""
63452,Marge,"homie, what are you doing? you don't know how to fly!"
56541,Marge,thirty dollars will be fine.
65233,Marge,i'm your wife.
55875,Marge,well... once.
66620,Marge,i'm too nervous to sleep.
65630,Marge,"abe, we were so worried."
66780,Marge,we're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
62798,Marge,"good sir, i do not approve of your fleshly gaze."
58577,Marge,here comes the flying saucer!
60618,Marge,what does he want now?
64307,Marge,"pleased to meet you, chett."
67909,Marge,yes.
67236,Marge,"yes he does, homer. and when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. you owe your son better than that, homer."
55787,Marge,you've saved more than a hundred dollars. i found it in your pants.
54996,Marge,bart! bart! turn to the financial channel! aunt patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
58354,Marge,"for you, homie."
56621,Marge,"what did you do today, bart?"
67734,Marge,my prom date.
58074,Marge,a headset telephone?! i thought those only existed in the movies!
58601,Marge,this is such a secluded area. i wonder who lives in that house?
65640,Marge,"water's coming in the house, and we've got carpet mushrooms!"
66476,Marge,"all right, you've made your point."
64915,Marge,shh!!!
56469,Marge,no.
62635,Marge,"well, then you think of something!"
54848,Marge,"here we are, kids! the watergate."
60789,Marge,don't you have any rooms? we can't live in our house for six months.
59131,Marge,bart! get those oranges out of there.
67485,Marge,"okay, lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
58452,Marge,"you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?"
65783,Marge,that's why they took our kids so quick.
63513,Marge,"well, no one's disputing that."
55820,Marge,"grampa, please. he's in a coma."
62906,Marge,"oh, i know all them!"
63581,Marge,i get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
67217,Marge,bart.
66281,Marge,"oh, the happy sound of a blender."
61657,Marge,and we're blowing off uncle tyrone's birthday!
64114,Marge,kirk and luann split up...
56296,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
57139,Marge,"honey, i don't think these clothes are us..."
55055,Marge,i don't know. i heard radiation can make you sterile.
57601,Marge,"excuse me, sir. i can't find my children."
59918,Marge,"well, i'd like to go. how about you, maggie?"
63242,Marge,the family can't start the day without me!
63830,Marge,homie?
56508,Marge,"this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. it's a book on tape by paul harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa."
66306,Marge,"well, come in! i'll explain how it all works. okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
57886,Marge,"no i don't! what i mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
63804,Marge,i didn't.
62191,Marge,"homer, we're separated now. you can't just walk in without knocking."
54600,Marge,and did you also know that history is written by the winners?
65732,Marge,"are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
65854,Marge,i so wanted him to be gay.
66503,Marge,"no, i'm going to join him forever."
64181,Marge,it's like a sauna in here!
67667,Marge,"oh, homer, homer."
65765,Marge,"i think it's time to go ""off family."""
55774,Marge,do you ever hide beer around the house?
64177,Marge,"man, i love saturdays! finally, i can have fun with something i bought for myself -- a new water heater!"
58098,Marge,because it's so dilapidated.
60154,Marge,what's that noise?
61313,Marge,i think these are my homie's size...
61485,Marge,maggie!
61495,Marge,"look lisa, there's something in here for you!"
58925,Marge,so many doorbells... i'm in way over my head.
65111,Marge,"well, there's ned out on his power walk. maybe you should talk to him."
63661,Marge,"well, i guess the rest of us should pay our respects."
66117,Marge,"it's the only way i can get him to take his ""vitamins."""
65387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. a diaper just isn't sexy."
59928,Marge,"oh, homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. you eat while you brush your teeth. you're eating a huge sausage right now."
54789,Marge,"what are you doing, honey?"
65230,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
65232,Marge,that's because it would kill you.
60731,Marge,the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace! a mother knows!
62129,Marge,"don't you think you've had enough ""fun?"""
58223,Marge,homer!
64175,Marge,"jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
64026,Marge,"homie, please, nothing good will come of this."
59445,Marge,rockin' fun zone? that sounds funnn...
61909,Marge,did you just swallow another bone?
62413,Marge,"well, i hope he's accompanied by the ""how was your day"" monster, and the ""foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
67159,Marge,but...
60590,Marge,is that windex?
56549,Marge,i don't think so.
62427,Marge,dr. hibbert?
57205,Marge,"sweetheart, maybe you just want krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. i went through the same thing when lyndon johnson died."
57928,Marge,balzac!
62468,Marge,i thought he was in a coma!
54974,Marge,this is from the national fatherhood institute. it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
66629,Marge,"thank you, homie."
64310,Marge,"at least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. but in this sport they don't put anything in anything. and if they did, i wouldn't want to see it!"
59976,Marge,ohhhhhhhhh.
60756,Marge,yes!
65346,Marge,"all right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?"
58224,Marge,i'm not leaving my home!
61211,Marge,you guys are the world's worst cops.
56176,Marge,"bart, this isn't the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with mr. burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. this could provide for your entire future."
67740,Marge,"aren't you ready for church, homer?"
59911,Marge,my bart?
63259,Marge,"oh, i don't know, he might come home any minute."
60151,Marge,she's gonna find us!
59861,Marge,can you believe it? kent brockman playing on our court!
65130,Marge,we'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets!
59462,Marge,your plan makes no sense.
60064,Marge,"ohhh, thank you."
64693,Marge,"well, i am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that."
60467,Marge,"grampa, come on."
60775,Marge,"i've gotta stop them from shooting... i, i, don't... lisa, don't hate me for this..."
63560,Marge,okay. but i-i'd feel better about it if you got rid of the gun.
67213,Marge,"homer, is this some kind of stag party?"
66410,Marge,"ooo, that could be the one."
66395,Marge,oh... i'll see what i can do.
66626,Marge,shauna! i saw that! i'm going to have to let you go.
55082,Marge,bart! be polite.
60184,Marge,burly. you're so rugged and manly...
65206,Marge,"yeah, you always do. well, here's where to meet us..."
57104,Marge,"i love you so much, my little bitty barty."
55357,Marge,"how was your day at work, dear?"
57599,Marge,bart? lisa?
56495,Marge,there are only forty-nine stars on that flag.
60610,Marge,"bart, don't slurp your soup."
65125,Marge,"well, what brought you to springfield? was it our frito lay distribution center?"
63493,Marge,"goodnight, teddy bear. goodnight, justin timberwolf. goodnight, bedtime krusty."
55693,Marge,i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street.
56156,Marge,oh bart. cleaning doesn't have to be a chore. here... work to the music.
61590,Marge,really? even zima?
65433,Marge,this is the stupidest fight ever!
60252,Marge,we were looking for lisa!
63727,Marge,the load is on the road.
58120,Marge,"i couldn't agree more. from now on, it's plastic all the way."
67387,Marge,shush! shut up! quit trying to push us around. stop saying those horrible things and show some manners.
65288,Marge,how can you refer to your audience that way?
65077,Marge,this doesn't make any sense. there was a wedding. you exchanged vows.
61677,Marge,"you win, kids. just sleep here tonight and we'll all go back to springfield tomorrow."
63071,Marge,"seventy-two lousy events, and grampa hasn't won a single medal."
64234,Marge,yeah. a house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
60560,Marge,why are you keeping that thing?
65651,Marge,"hm, i guess you're right. i guess i'll have to scratch that off the list of things i say."
56527,Marge,i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
65835,Marge,we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
62400,Marge,"lisa, honey. i know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore!"
57639,Marge,kids? kids?
66853,Marge,yes.
65364,Marge,"homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
66795,Marge,we're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.
61711,Marge,anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner.
67810,Marge,i knew it.
64516,Marge,"cheer up, sweetie. maybe we can find the answer in the library!"
57014,Marge,homer?
59319,Marge,"well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the..."
67565,Marge,substantially-less
63073,Marge,"homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives."
66554,Marge,a mother's greatest fear.
55547,Marge,i could get a job.
61962,Marge,"now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage."
57960,Marge,we're here to eat your kids.
59151,Marge,"oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero."
62135,Marge,"well i hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause i'm not speaking to you!"
57610,Marge,what kind of hair?
63665,Marge,"well, this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good."
67533,Marge,because i said so.
55852,Marge,i think you might like this... it's about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident...
67335,Marge,oh my goodness.
56002,Marge,didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
57258,Marge,"homer, are you laughing at me?"
65922,Marge,ohhh.
60318,Marge,what are you talking about? is that dinner?
67171,Marge,hmmm.
57223,Marge,"bart, lisa! it's 11 o'clock at night. where do you think you're going?"
54963,Marge,"no, bart. no one's going to make her. this is something lisa has to decide for herself."
58672,Marge,"oh, no!"
60404,Marge,"wow! homer, that was amazing."
64118,Marge,who are you calling an old lady?
60721,Marge,"get back, honky cat! those systems are too expensive."
58931,Marge,"uhp. it's not a toy, lisa. we'll just have to wait until someone comes."
65158,Marge,"... and here's a marble for lisa for cleaning her room, and a marble for bart for not trashing lisa's room."
54913,Marge,"homer, there's something i don't like about that severed hand."
63803,Marge,"i get it -- every title means the opposite of what it means! then i bet i'll love ""chernobyl graveyard!"""
65850,Marge,i hope someone saw our ad.
55310,Marge,white. and what would you like for appetizers?
62991,Marge,he's just drumming louder!
63658,Marge,yowza!
60477,Marge,let's take a quick gambling break. a little action will really sharpen our senses.
61971,Marge,"until you pay us back, you're answering to me! and there's gonna be big changes."
58157,Marge,i'm over here!
67416,Marge,i don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
55920,Marge,you changed your grade with a computer?
67694,Marge,"well, i don't think you're my type."
54767,Marge,to who?
57354,Marge,weren't there three indians last year?
55780,Marge,what was that noise?
61851,Marge,"for our first game, i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower."
61053,Marge,ing...
55906,Marge,it's so good to be home again.
62253,Marge,"aw honey, please take this seriously. when people used to ask me how you were doing, i said ""at least he's got his health."" now you've got nothing! nothing! for me, please try a healthy vegetable."
59732,Marge,mmm. i'd like to visit that long island place. if only it were real...
66031,Marge,maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
63096,Marge,my own art show?! i'm so happy... do you mind?
67083,Marge,his name isn't bigfoot. his name is homer.
63654,Marge,stop it! stop it!!! i'll watch the commercials!
55012,Marge,"i want you to take baths, bart."
64907,Marge,"seven years. a lot of memories. talking, chatting..."
60090,Marge,"hi, ultrahouse."
57789,Marge,"we all need a little time to ourselves, helen. just give him a day or two and i'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
56151,Marge,underpants.
58269,Marge,they have those. they're government listings.
58088,Marge,but... all i did was tell the truth.
67099,Marge,"now, move it!"
54682,Marge,"choose me because i'm not bitter yet, i can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time."
62126,Marge,no more oriental mustard!
57381,Marge,there's not enough room!
66553,Marge,"lisa, just say something to me."
61107,Marge,"pointy, pointy, spiky, stylish... where's baldy?!"
66229,Marge,three.
67391,Marge,sure.
64405,Marge,you said you were at a parenting class!
60811,Marge,"oh no, everything's ruined. our good bellows... our stereopticon... squiggy! homer, your strop! your strop!"
65420,Marge,it's no fun to live in a town with a ninety-nine percent unemployment rate.
57514,Marge,your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. or a police car.
61701,Marge,"so... pie man, why don't you show me your superpowers? pie man?"
57784,Marge,"oh, lenny, i'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
56989,Marge,"oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. when's your next coffee break?"
60024,Marge,lisa!
62615,Marge,"come on, we're going to that store! before the next commercial makes me do something else."
61137,Marge,when will they stop?
58772,Marge,"aren't you coming, ed?"
67313,Marge,precious? i think i hear the doorbell.
61219,Marge,"bart, run like the wind!"
62681,Marge,oh...
64090,Marge,give me my baby back!
63944,Marge,"we sure did. rekindle, rekindle... okay, let's go."
54665,Marge,you are the first person who ever said that!
57856,Marge,"well, he's got more confidence!"
61287,Marge,"homer, there's no rear on that thing."
63549,Marge,"don't be silly, lisa. in fact --"
58723,Marge,"oh, homer..."
56629,Marge,one more hour.
64654,Marge,"and where there's exotic fish, there's gotta be a..."
54753,Marge,call this number if grampa falls in the bathtub.
54664,Marge,you're an idiot.
62949,Marge,this house is spectacular. you must have had a great view of the riots!
65587,Marge,i can't believe we're never going to have another child...
66029,Marge,finally! actual science!
67711,Marge,"you know, homer, you're like no one i've ever met before. you're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
67887,Marge,don't you listen to him. he's just a mean little s.o.b.
66812,Marge,homer!
63467,Marge,"oh homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus."
55290,Marge,mrs. homer simpson.
62794,Marge,"hurry, my little puritans -- we must flee england and its insufficiently puritanical ways."
62891,Marge,i really know where you're coming from.
56942,Marge,where we going? where we going?
65284,Marge,now i have to change the nipple!
54882,Marge,"dear lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, i'll try to be a better christian. i don't know what i can do... ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive i'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
56552,Marge,wait! daddy! wait! please don't leave. take me with you!
57034,Marge,we can always get more shoes! movemovemove!
55166,Marge,oh.
65101,Marge,homer? could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are?
64288,Marge,yes!
66793,Marge,"well, i guess it'll have to be in bart's room. and i thought when homer cut off his thumb was bad."
67930,Marge,"wow -- it's like a renaissance fair, but without all the chubby couples!"
62252,Marge,cottage cheese!
60616,Marge,"oh, i can't wait to see my surprise!"
60880,Marge,"oh my goodness, it looks just like the kwik-e-mart!"
66860,Marge,homer simpson. working with those plants is great! it's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
56967,Marge,"please pass your father the syrup, lisa."
58973,Marge,i'm serious. you never finished painting the garage.
65679,Marge,"i'd love to, but maggie's a little shy..."
58013,Marge,"well, at least i'm making conversation."
60534,Marge,everything here is something.
60605,Marge,my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
61439,Marge,"please homie, don't hurt him!"
63270,Marge,bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
57710,Marge,"oh, i do. i'm just a little concerned about the kids. maybe i should call."
61749,Marge,"you were right, homie. we shouldn't have rocked the boat. then none of this would have ever happened."
60019,Marge,"homer, help!"
66453,Marge,"you know, you're pretty rude."
66907,Marge,hello.
65739,Marge,"well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"
67330,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's no answer at home."
58446,Marge,"what's wrong with us, homer? have we lost the spark already?"
61408,Marge,"perfect! now, let's see if lightning strikes twice!"
63398,Marge,all out! i can't make my famous raisin sponge-cake without raisins! kids love the zing of raisins!
67555,Marge,the answer is all around you.
65557,Marge,are you going to fix the faucet or not?
56393,Marge,yuh-huh. i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. are you kids gonna be alright?
65586,Marge,"i guess... that's that, then."
57680,Marge,"oh, homer, please. you're embarrassing yourself."
67406,Marge,"homer, we're a mary bailey family."
67676,Marge,pick one.
58133,Marge,homer! you won't believe what's happened! it's a miracle!
66337,Marge,"okay, i guess."
58385,Marge,now that's just non--
56637,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake, bart! use the plunger!"
56027,Marge,shhh!
60928,Marge,i'll just call a plumber.
56352,Marge,i give up. did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
64252,Marge,i think mel would be happier as an understudy. a six-feet-understudy.
62507,Marge,no.
61299,Marge,how did you get her out?
67643,Marge,"homer, look at me."
59744,Marge,"could you cut it out, you two? mommy needs some quiet right now."
59798,Marge,"well, i studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
66618,Marge,"professor... could you say ""welcome to mother hubbard's sandwich cupboard"" without making any other noises?"
57439,Marge,"i don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
63323,Marge,"well, he's done very well for someone who came out blue and backwards."
56516,Marge,"here he is, rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one! that tonic really works! you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together."
62869,Marge,what's snuggling?
64353,Marge,that does sound like homer.
62797,Marge,"noble sir, you may accompany us to america in my late husband's clothing."
57655,Marge,"oh, homer, look! look! a tv guide owned by jackie o.!"
64033,Marge,"homie, please come inside."
67649,Marge,"please, homer. can't we try it?"
66240,Marge,"it was a crazy time, the eighties."
67396,Marge,"look, homer! radish rosettes. these are hard to make. they are a very advanced race."
67709,Marge,consonants.
59581,Marge,"yes, i hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes..."
57285,Marge,now this i like.
66022,Marge,confidence is so attractive in a man.
55340,Marge,"but homer, we're the only family he's got..."
62638,Marge,upward bound: the toughest behavioral modification camp in northwest oregon.
59451,Marge,i'm not sure mosquito season is the best time to visit larva lake...
58477,Marge,"i'm sure they didn't ""ditch"" you, honey. maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you."
67200,Marge,thank you.
61244,Marge,i'm so proud of you lisa.
58654,Marge,don't look at me! i wanted to eat him!
61740,Marge,"if there's one way to get the truth out, it's on a cable news channel."
62284,Marge,"here's a pretty little wig for lisa, and a handsome toupee for bart!"
63088,Marge,i made it myself.
61024,Marge,no.
62677,Marge,huh? / you knew about the coins? / the coins are down here? / etc.
55615,Marge,no. no. could you wear the mr. plow jacket. just uh... for fun.
63760,Marge,"listen, i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like, oh, i don't even remember..."
62042,Marge,thanksgiving's not for months.
55858,Marge,there is no such thing.
59406,Marge,i wonder what would happen if they had a baby?
63660,Marge,"bart, i know this is nuts, but try to look sad."
59984,Marge,this song has been going on for hours.
59221,Marge,what is it? carrots? peas? maybe it's okra.
55423,Marge,"heah you ah, homah."
56109,Marge,"hmm. oh, we're low on milk for maggie. you wanna come with me to the kwik-e-mart?"
55168,Marge,"homer, that's awful!"
62224,Marge,"hey boy, want a treat?"
59791,Marge,somebody help him!
67736,Marge,"homer, we talked about cable before. do you really think we can afford it?"
65752,Marge,it's like god's vacuum cleaner!
55222,Marge,"oh well, you'd be surprised."
54874,Marge,how long does it take to deliver a pizza?
67723,Marge,why are you doing this? why can't you accept that i'm here with someone else?
67754,Marge,"no, homer, not over this. no, no."
57947,Marge,they're like this every rainy day.
66911,Marge,"oh, for heavens sakes, homer. it's in the utility drawer."
62536,Marge,"let's see... what would be a good duet? hmm... ""just the two of us""... ""you and me against the world""... ""ebony and ivory""..."
55273,Marge,"homie, aren't you coming inside?"
55950,Marge,"lisa, stop being so suspicious. did everyone wash their necks like mr. burns asked?"
62078,Marge,"grampa, you're a greet grater! i mean a great greeter! now look who's senile!"
64850,Marge,what's that?
61555,Marge,"moe's tavern? that's your fun place, like me and the lamp store."
67836,Marge,"hmmm, what are you doing, dear?"
63365,Marge,that's the fire siren!
61898,Marge,evergreen terrace.
67382,Marge,what's going on out here? homer! bart! lisa! maggie! stop it!
65827,Marge,can you find anything you like in this bed?
64056,Marge,why are you here? you already own a home.
66158,Marge,he's such a little dickens. although dickens was pretty well-behaved.
54720,Marge,"c'mon, marge, it's either you, or..."
65481,Marge,don't give me that load of--
58825,Marge,"""i love you... cactus? blobby? upsilon?"" oh, who am i kidding? homer would never surprise me like that."
65297,Marge,no strangling on school days!
67548,Marge,"for nonviolence, understanding and helping."""
67309,Marge,"goodness, must be a crossed wire."
63607,Marge,why don't we do something special for you -- get you all snazzed up.
66970,Marge,sure! you never forget. it's just like riding a bicycle.
63058,Marge,so they're not shipping you overseas?
56826,Marge,um-hmmm. who called the police?
57544,Marge,"oh homie! homie, i'm so sorry i doubted you!"
55766,Marge,"well, i got an idea! why don't you run a hamster through a maze?"
59256,Marge,"i enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as ""sideshow marge."""
55520,Marge,"well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
56259,Marge,why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
62715,Marge,"lookin' good, rod!"
63978,Marge,you're teaching bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
62765,Marge,well...
62479,Marge,i should've known something was wrong when we got this week's tv guide.
66934,Marge,homer! why are you seven hours late?
54764,Marge,homer?
60998,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, ned."
58125,Marge,what happened?
64098,Marge,"ooh, look! a welcome mat that tells you your weight!"
66832,Marge,"homer, you have to choose. and i think the choice is clear."
58195,Marge,"so mr. cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry?"
67899,Marge,"hmmm, lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and i think you should take her."
56036,Marge,"oh, thank you."
59929,Marge,you're really not gonna eat anything?
62072,Marge,the toilet seat's up!
64972,Marge,brambles!
60377,Marge,i haven't lost so much sleep since little barty had the scoots.
61880,Marge,"nelson, what are you doing out this late?"
56316,Marge,oh!
64691,Marge,"well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so i thought you deserved a reward."
62540,Marge,"bart, you are a wild heck-raiser. and i don't want to see you turn into that."
60911,Marge,"hey, hot stuff. i've got a competition tomorrow. i could use a good-luck snuggle."
60919,Marge,"oh, my gosh, you're right: steroids have turned me into everything i hate. let's go home, sweetie."
55247,Marge,"no. i'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
55162,Marge,uh-huh.
56879,Marge,i have an idea.
55005,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
59851,Marge,"thank you, honey. they come in a squeeze bottle now."
65094,Marge,at some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.
64504,Marge,no surrender!
66581,Marge,they've been at it all night.
64437,Marge,who wants fresh donuts?
63150,Marge,christmas card? i haven't even taken the photo yet!
66861,Marge,i didn't mean to use that word! it's okay to have a feminine side. it's good in fact!
54656,Marge,this is serious. pay attention!
67297,Marge,"oh. okay, well thank you."
59992,Marge,"well, now i've heard everything."
66798,Marge,"chief, i hope this is the call i've been praying for."
55078,Marge,how could he? he's only ten minutes old.
65042,Marge,"while your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods, i thought we could do a little bonding of our own."
64977,Marge,true beauty isn't about hair color?
61756,Marge,there's a ship! we're saved!
59817,Marge,"terrific. bart, sideshow bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
67012,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
60230,Marge,these new pews are so comfy.
66396,Marge,"well, thanks for the chicken dinner. how did you know i wanted one?"
66300,Marge,"homer, tell them your side of the story. i know i hurt you, but please trust me now. it'll work."
64293,Marge,"bart, let him go!"
58239,Marge,"sorry kids, there's no such thing as hoverbikes. they're just a couple of huffys on a fishing line!"
60574,Marge,homer? what's going on?
55970,Marge,thank you. why?
66698,Marge,homer works at a nuclear plant! he can help us get home!
67846,Marge,homer?
67408,Marge,i wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
67275,Marge,"oh, my."
62133,Marge,my scrimpings!
67771,Marge,she's the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
60599,Marge,they miss their father. are you sure you don't want to take him back?
59069,Marge,"c'mon, homer! japan!"
57797,Marge,"oh, good morning, maude."
55238,Marge,"well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
66248,Marge,don't listen to them. they're the ding dongs.
58662,Marge,hip hip--
64445,Marge,and toast... valerie and daaaaave!
62184,Marge,"oh, you must be michael's dad!"
57814,Marge,i only have five lobsters. are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
58050,Marge,"it's wednesday, homer."
55311,Marge,"okay, we've got cocktail wienies and swedish meatballs."
63113,Marge,don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
56383,Marge,bart!
66286,Marge,an illegal download? but hollywood says stealing from hollywood is wrong.
63445,Marge,"so, how was your first day at your new job?"
56869,Marge,"bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. this town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
59702,Marge,"oh my, they made you a shrine!"
59433,Marge,"homer, are you all right?"
57504,Marge,"mmm, i suppose i could..."
60435,Marge,it's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
62057,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so proud of you. you stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
56829,Marge,"bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
58122,Marge,seven a.m. no earlier. and you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause i got 'em!
55134,Marge,"extra mustard for bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... light mayo for lisa, cut off the crust... double bologna for homer...."
61442,Marge,"jack ruby was a man, not a jewel."
57490,Marge,remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. it just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
64044,Marge,you mean back to the poor house?
67658,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
66239,Marge,"i thought i'd show you this when you were older, but..."
62152,Marge,you don't take anything seriously. not even your bankruptcy hearing!
56785,Marge,"lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding gums was a good friend to you. but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them."
54952,Marge,then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
62425,Marge,that's not what you do with a hymnal. homer!
65041,Marge,and now my son is a bully. can you fix him?
56239,Marge,i don't know what you're talking about.
55016,Marge,pink.
55746,Marge,"homer, we're going to my sisters'! remember, pick up bart!"
65861,Marge,"i don't care if bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person."
59775,Marge,are you crazy?! i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
63584,Marge,"sweeties, we weren't fighting..."
54959,Marge,"well, it's a lot. in fact, your father had to take a second job."
57638,Marge,thanks for everything!
65289,Marge,"no, we're out."
61379,Marge,it's no! his old bike is fine!
56461,Marge,"lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug."
60834,Marge,"oh my, it's stuck!"
62611,Marge,really?
54801,Marge,"bart, you have to help someone in need. it's the only decent thing to do."
66013,Marge,"well, i'm glad your side of the deal worked out."
64563,Marge,why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
64127,Marge,that's for a child's birthday. we're going to get this one.
67273,Marge,remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can to your adopted parents.
58596,Marge,"yes, we'll go to the darn lake! now go back to bed. it's four a.m.!"
60612,Marge,"oh, and this kitchen isn't?"
55936,Marge,gimme that.
57068,Marge,"homer, didn't you get any milk? all i see is egg nog."
59079,Marge,be careful. we need that money to get home.
62458,Marge,"young man, you go work on your spelling... or i'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!"
60493,Marge,don't burn her! she's just an innocent child!
57229,Marge,umm... how about... ghostmutt?
55190,Marge,"there was more than enough in the swear jar. and if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
54722,Marge,"lisa, tell your father."
67890,Marge,i can't make that man beautiful. i'm just not good enough. i guess i'm no artist.
67203,Marge,until inevitably...
63327,Marge,was there even a baseball game yesterday? i don't remember!
64389,Marge,ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-...
64159,Marge,your daughter barely knows who you are!
59937,Marge,"and kids, you're gonna miss the school bus!"
66414,Marge,"well, i guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
57992,Marge,what about the gun?
63881,Marge,look at bart go! he must be running away!
58639,Marge,lisa?
63604,Marge,"and until they do, you can stay here."
63126,Marge,why don't you have dinner with us tonight?
55589,Marge,"... and finally, moe's tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""welcome to springfield."""
64350,Marge,it tastes like hot steaming cocoa mixed with rainbows...
61503,Marge,lisa's gone! you have to find her!
57876,Marge,"you know, when i was a girl, i always dreamed of being in a broadway audience."
59376,Marge,"stop that! cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like bill crosby and david letterson."
67861,Marge,apu! what are you doing here?
67808,Marge,"lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. have a nice day at school, bart."
54840,Marge,i thought you might want to snuggle.
55671,Marge,"doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my homie well."
63322,Marge,"i need a dress to wear for my son's big game. he's the star, i'm his mom, and he's my son."
57003,Marge,good. good for you.
60181,Marge,and burly's still got soaking power. spill something else.
63078,Marge,"lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! we're going vermonting!"
65622,Marge,hello? rita lafleur? did you know a man named abe simpson?
56199,Marge,"ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
60917,Marge,"damn straight, i didn't sacrifice my period for second place!"
66623,Marge,"homie, i'm a little worried. do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
65890,Marge,so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
65417,Marge,mike's hard!
55241,Marge,"oh, honey. seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. we really can't afford this operation."
60561,Marge,"don't worry, homer. you don't need mary jane to laugh at mr. burns' jokes. just picture him naked."
65141,Marge,homie... you're paralyzed. but we love you and will never give up hope.
60156,Marge,"that's odd. he's outside, digging."
62782,Marge,grampa no!
65747,Marge,"all right, but i'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid."
59483,Marge,"homie, for god's sakes, it's two a.m."
61257,Marge,"that's the last of them. you did the right thing, bart, and now you can keep the money."
60114,Marge,"oh, how magical!"
58076,Marge,"thank you. thank you, everybody. i'm going to do my darndest to uphold the principles and ideals this jacket represents."
58916,Marge,"yeah, c'mon homie!"
67877,Marge,"now, homer, don't worry. all i need to do is find mr. burns' inner beauty."
66005,Marge,"of course. but very, very, very angry at all the time i wasted."
55660,Marge,bart! don't write on the rug!
54702,Marge,we've got a winning hand. we can take the rest of the tricks!
60326,Marge,you'll be condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes!
58487,Marge,"okay, but you've accomplished a lot. you've made me very happy."
63357,Marge,"okay, okay, you can have it back!"
65179,Marge,"oh, i'll just have a side salad..."
63361,Marge,"last night, someone ate all the food in the fridge."
58330,Marge,oh my god!
57637,Marge,but we're happy just the way we are!
57094,Marge,i think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
63466,Marge,hi... you!
55032,Marge,what if we get caught?
60124,Marge,"oh, homie, no. we can't."
57874,Marge,if only i didn't already have a pair of shoes.
56097,Marge,"oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
58129,Marge,looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas.
67851,Marge,"oh, homer, don't be jealous. i was a schoolgirl, the beatles were very popular and i had a crush on them."
63245,Marge,"bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. if it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour."
64507,Marge,see. all good.
64630,Marge,"homer, maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween. what's going on?"
67487,Marge,"now, just wait a minute! i'm sure there's room for both."
66213,Marge,"wow, i've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick!"
65895,Marge,the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation.
65776,Marge,"well, i must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of."
57359,Marge,a competent doctor!
57338,Marge,what lifelong dream?
58725,Marge,"yeah, we're scared!"
63838,Marge,they took my cupcakes!
66262,Marge,"homer simpson! ask yourself -- ""w.w.b.j.d.?"""
62516,Marge,"you know, honey, i've really started to look forward to our little bike rides."
62667,Marge,i'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
58598,Marge,"homer, your spine!"
61529,Marge,"oh my. well, homer, maybe you should take him to moe's."
65880,Marge,objection! unhealthy!
67497,Marge,"homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves."
57936,Marge,you're a good father.
61600,Marge,"now sweetie, you shouldn't hang around with people who beat you. they're not true friends."
62114,Marge,"i know, i just wan--"
62695,Marge,"so, you're gonna be ""chillin'"" with me tonight. do you want to play a game?"
58939,Marge,ring the bell!
60614,Marge,"homer, cathy is a woman."
64077,Marge,i can't miss out! just one little peek.
64037,Marge,oh really?
62440,Marge,"all right, we get it!"
63774,Marge,and major marge!
67652,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?"
64409,Marge,a branch must've knocked out the power lines.
61869,Marge,"great roll, nelson! here, i cut up your hot dog for you."
67397,Marge,sorry. your game is very nice.
55479,Marge,"oh, i don't know that she's as attractive as jack nicklaus..."
60817,Marge,three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best!
60285,Marge,why don't you just take britney beers and get outta here!
61125,Marge,is my husband there?
64422,Marge,bart simpson!
62976,Marge,must have cost a fortune.
65541,Marge,not with the camera on.
58695,Marge,homer!
60071,Marge,the buffalo are gone. i think you shot them all.
60410,Marge,forwards?
65308,Marge,enough!
59892,Marge,"oh, you little-- come on, bart."
59878,Marge,"oh, that's okay. bart's doing fine. you just have another beer."
59919,Marge,squaresville sounds pretty cool.
62983,Marge,someone poisoned these meatballs. homer...?
65438,Marge,now you be careful with bart's undies.
66310,Marge,"homer, i want you to take kumiko and comic book guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?"
55356,Marge,you mean a spoon?
56494,Marge,"well, we can dress it up a bit. we can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... and the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
65786,Marge,what if they are better for the kids than us?
56088,Marge,"homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance."
62167,Marge,"let's see. there's ""equus"" starring sideshow mel... ""the three dollar bills in 'gay, gay, gay!'""... ooh, ""song of shelbyville""!"
60450,Marge,i'm not sure i approve of selling whiskey to children.
59129,Marge,"good morning, honey. how's my special little guy?"
65506,Marge,"here's your lunches. with some cake. you'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
57250,Marge,"hello?... oh, homie, hello! i can't remember the last time you called me from -- oh, you want to speak to lisa?"
57663,Marge,"mmm, i don't think he's married, homer."
56599,Marge,what?
58546,Marge,"oh, my good, gray extension cord."
67515,Marge,what a fun-filled evening.
57384,Marge,"grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
59656,Marge,go back and get them!
65047,Marge,"okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s?"
60625,Marge,"i am so sick of doing her dirty work. she's taking advantage of us, homer."
66070,Marge,"is that him, getting the text?"
55242,Marge,i know you're upset --
57145,Marge,"alright, i will buy it. it'll be good for the economy."
59936,Marge,"homer, you're still here? you should've left for work an hour ago!"
55953,Marge,this is dangerous. i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie.
57995,Marge,homer! you said you got rid of the gun. you lied to me! again!
57946,Marge,"mm! shoo! shoo, fly!"
64829,Marge,i'm so glad you two are friends again.
67791,Marge,"would you like to hold the baby, herb?"
64487,Marge,"what's up, seymour?"
62146,Marge,you don't belong on the lawn. you belong in your bed with your wife!
63475,Marge,i want you to stop flirting with women.
58650,Marge,he looks like an ordinary... ow! son of a--!
60073,Marge,this reminds me of our shotgun wedding.
65243,Marge,luann?
62093,Marge,"homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform selma's life."
67365,Marge,"homer, are you still awake?"
67206,Marge,"goodbye, homer."
58489,Marge,the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done.
54896,Marge,hello?
62450,Marge,get out of this house!
59884,Marge,"i was thinking mantle, too! talk about being on the same wavelength."
58410,Marge,and look as handsome as the day we were married.
61464,Marge,"you know, i think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
65797,Marge,"you're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause i still like the dog."
61173,Marge,"well, thank you. i'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible pre-teen brave experience."
61301,Marge,we did -- homer took him. didn't you?
62453,Marge,uh-hmm.
67477,Marge,"no, no, no, no, the other one."
61843,Marge,"homer, the capital of kentucky is frankfort."
62478,Marge,he still thinks that hobo was a bird.
64993,Marge,"bart, why are you tugging on your collar?"
59487,Marge,"oh, honey, don't panic. if you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
63426,Marge,sorry-sorry-sorry!
58095,Marge,"so that's how you see me? as a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
66499,Marge,"well, i don't miss his nonsense. there's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that i'm starting to suspect was him."
66175,Marge,yolo?
67133,Marge,you can't take it back. you had your name engraved on it.
62220,Marge,i don't want to hear any more about ray. tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
62443,Marge,stop eating the oatmeal! that's the third tub you've eaten!
65728,Marge,"i'm proud of you. society may have crumbled, but our decency hasn't."
59261,Marge,"yes, dear. from the nuclear plant."
61610,Marge,principal skinner is having second thoughts? poor edna!
65399,Marge,at last we'll get to the bottom of...
62662,Marge,"uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. i like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
55384,Marge,whoa!!
59915,Marge,"none of those girls has had three kids, i can tell you that."
55707,Marge,homer.
55022,Marge,you don't know homer like i do. he's sensitive and sweet.
66673,Marge,"well, i do have a favor. patty and selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
60274,Marge,here's the keys.
59341,Marge,talk to me.
57580,Marge,are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
65998,Marge,that's not the way american police do things!
58562,Marge,run for it.
57355,Marge,"no, i don't."
65418,Marge,rum cake!
65877,Marge,power.
63316,Marge,who cares? i'm dead.
67374,Marge,what on earth was that?
54821,Marge,maggie!
58312,Marge,not hang out. play date!
55132,Marge,"i am not cleaning that... ah, who am i kidding?"
62122,Marge,"oh, we're just saving for... a very rainy day."
65620,Marge,got it. papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
67642,Marge,"oh my lord. well, i don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
65450,Marge,and i sold our good china.
64219,Marge,we don't need a bed. we're not gonna be sleeping.
62124,Marge,i have a book from the library with the same information!
65497,Marge,"well, you're all invited, so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres."
54905,Marge,"krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? you'll feel better."
56746,Marge,"oh, my god! she's having babies! oh, i'm sorry, girl. i thought you were just getting fat."
63052,Marge,"wait, i have an idea! the martians are only killing humans, so we should pretend to be animals!"
65712,Marge,"until then, why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences."
66562,Marge,maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
55284,Marge,has she kissed you?
63993,Marge,...so lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! she's finally doing something the book said she would!
66125,Marge,why didn't you call us?
65644,Marge,i don't care for silent auctions. it just encourages hovering.
60046,Marge,mm. that sounds perfect!
65836,Marge,i wasn't laughing -- i was being worried.
60186,Marge,"""dear burly, comma, i've never written to a registered trademark before. are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? in either case, i would love a signed photo. sincerely, marge simpson."""
57125,Marge,you'd get some fresh air and exercise.
64134,Marge,i can't believe you're ruining the second thursday before the wedding!
65378,Marge,"well, at least you remembered i like her."
63547,Marge,perfect!
61415,Marge,"ned, that's so considerate."
57965,Marge,"oh my god, homer! they're right next door!"
67864,Marge,do you really think so? my high school art teacher hated them.
54739,Marge,"i want to make sure the kids don't hear. when i was young, i always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
59408,Marge,furious d?
64868,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
65362,Marge,is it iraqi journalists being murdered?
62779,Marge,where is the baby?
65816,Marge,have you seen lisa and maggie?
63726,Marge,it's four o'clock on a saturday.
67302,Marge,yeah.
65014,Marge,i can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
63832,Marge,my son's a good-for-something!
60999,Marge,not the swear jar! it's the only thing holding back the filth!
54602,Marge,uhhh... not exactly.
64735,Marge,homer! take me home!
67916,Marge,it's me!
67317,Marge,"'bye, now. be good. gotta go."
60413,Marge,i knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. keep your money. i'm going home.
63657,Marge,eh.
59569,Marge,"now, lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables."
59670,Marge,we can't go on fighting with olde springfield. these people are our neighbors. we see them every day.
63712,Marge,jeez louise. are you okay?
58983,Marge,that's my life you're describing.
58661,Marge,hip hip--
57040,Marge,...go again.
54835,Marge,"well, at least we got a free sample of reading digest."
54681,Marge,she doesn't know what a good thing she's got. i like a man who can relax. not like grumpy-lumpy there.
64333,Marge,"no. let's go home. we can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
54763,Marge,sure.
59432,Marge,hello? is there anybody in there?
62405,Marge,isn't this lenny's house?
67137,Marge,excuse me... where do i throw this?
54878,Marge,principal skinner!
57065,Marge,-- you never know what --
57998,Marge,i'm talking about treating serious injuries.
64220,Marge,"you know what a girl likes, mister. so, can i see you again?"
60196,Marge,"congratulations, i feel ridiculous."
59553,Marge,"homer, look, we're invited to otto's wedding!"
62589,Marge,"gee, i wish we could explore a little more of italy."
55546,Marge,we have to do something...
67198,Marge,really!?
64748,Marge,why do you say such ridiculous things?
58971,Marge,"oh, right. the sins."
64737,Marge,i'd like to return this handbag. unused.
64958,Marge,there's a woman who's got it all under control.
63363,Marge,it was you.
55736,Marge,your lips are turning blue. i think you'd better stay home.
56579,Marge,"homer, a man who called himself ""you know who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter."
65427,Marge,"he exercises so much, but he looks the same. i guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future."
59429,Marge,"so, you said on the phone you had something to tell me?"
64146,Marge,homie?
55848,Marge,"oh, that's right. i invited a guest speaker to talk to the class."
60153,Marge,"all right, we got lucky that time, but i want everyone in this family to raise your hand and promise not to break the law for one full year."
56433,Marge,"no buts. you march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
67869,Marge,"okay, shoot."
55488,Marge,"homer, what's wrong?"
65517,Marge,"now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. i stopped reading after ""top student""."
67122,Marge,"homer, we're having dinner tonight at the singing sirloin."
57700,Marge,"well, we have to run. i'm sure you kids will work things out. good night!"
63107,Marge,"homie, i realized that my most enduring creation is the life i've sculpted with you."
58748,Marge,"homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named anthony michael hall who stole your car stereo."
61367,Marge,i try my best. they ridicule me. they mock everything i cherish.
60225,Marge,fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
66787,Marge,i thought you were going to try to relax.
60037,Marge,except your thumb! and lisa's science project!
64910,Marge,who's kicking?
58794,Marge,i didn't turn it on yet.
66079,Marge,"well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so i guess that's true."
65514,Marge,"bart, just tell us the problem!"
55612,Marge,our driveway's snowed in!
65689,Marge,then to save us... we need something incredibly unnatural!
58369,Marge,"i'm really proud of you, homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?"
65811,Marge,"fine, no tv for twenty-four hours."
61751,Marge,"lisa, that's not funny. you believe in the bill of rights."
63484,Marge,that's nice!
67197,Marge,you certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
67540,Marge,... but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way...
62877,Marge,know what?
66909,Marge,...homer sends his love. happy holidays.
65080,Marge,one hundred.
59596,Marge,"don't mess with me, i've got jimmies!"
66443,Marge,that picture has brought out the worst in everyone! please... just let it go!
59840,Marge,"oh, don't fight. all great art is controversial at first. but years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""that's a jack crowley."""
62893,Marge,i'd love to.
64954,Marge,"so, what do you think?"
61399,Marge,thank you!
64845,Marge,"homer, are you scaring those kids?"
55763,Marge,"homer, i want you to encourage lisa with her science fair project."
66833,Marge,who's he giving a piggyback ride to?
56697,Marge,"oh, i invited my sisters over."
54701,Marge,i should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
55138,Marge,"videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, homer's dry-cleaning -- i think that's everything."
66650,Marge,i don't understand you.
66938,Marge,homer!
56729,Marge,"all right, who broke my vase?!"
57541,Marge,"please, let's just go to sleep."
60319,Marge,why didn't you just turn off the oven?
66642,Marge,how could they open another franchise so close to me?
61698,Marge,i don't care.
64599,Marge,see? dylan is clearly a girrr--
64531,Marge,"y'know -- i think bart might have too much homework. if they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
57394,Marge,"i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble."
65462,Marge,"bart, glad you're here. we're all gonna watch a movie together."
57465,Marge,"homer, i don't need you around me 24 hours a day. i'm a grown woman -- i can take care of myself. now, will you please just go away!"
60451,Marge,oh.
59543,Marge,and you will be a dancer.
64740,Marge,"well, i learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than i could afford."
67043,Marge,"well, i'm still trying to figure out what's bothering lisa. i don't know, bart's such a handful, and maggie needs attention, but all the while our little lisa's becoming a young woman."
67907,Marge,yes.
67228,Marge,why you big...
59367,Marge,"homer, sit down."
61777,Marge,"oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
67870,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
67586,Marge,"yes, dear. all you want."
67334,Marge,"oh, homer, don't say that. the way i see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
61208,Marge,maggie's gone!
67316,Marge,"here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining and the motel where we'll be spending the night. you'll have to put maggie to bed now. but bart and lisa can stay up for another hour. until then, they can watch a tape from our video library."
54680,Marge,"homie, someone owes me a back scratch."
67616,Marge,"what do you think, homer?"
57916,Marge,bart's gay?
66008,Marge,"bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart."
58184,Marge,"i see. well then, no chores, no allowance."
61064,Marge,i'll fix you something.
64684,Marge,i didn't see you come in.
63145,Marge,uh... hm...
67325,Marge,this is fun!
62927,Marge,"i can't wait to see what evolution will make next: maybe a bird with a people face, or a bear with pants on!"
58361,Marge,oh lord! now what are we going to do? just let the trash pile up?
60920,Marge,club soda will get that blood out.
54594,Marge,i'm afraid it's top ramen again.
61407,Marge,"ooh, i just finished my first paragraph. spell check!"
57494,Marge,"i started making some calls last night, and before i knew it, practically all of springfield was offering to help."
58676,Marge,"well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel."
59998,Marge,very nice.
57535,Marge,"hello, can i help you?"
62412,Marge,what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? hm?
58406,Marge,"oh, sorry."
61596,Marge,that doesn't look so big.
62210,Marge,"come on, kids! we're gonna visit grampa. then we're gonna take the dog to the v-e-t..."
66657,Marge,"i couldn't help noticing this school is located in... i'm not one to judge, but... um..."
61465,Marge,you'll be like an owl saying milhouse who? milhouse who? milhouse whooo?
56681,Marge,that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
58100,Marge,"some people would call it ""cozy."""
67832,Marge,"no, i'm afraid i agree with your father."
56208,Marge,and those!
65108,Marge,"actually, sometimes you do push ned around."
66947,Marge,i think it's under the short leg of the couch.
62796,Marge,"finally, we shall bid goodbye to england and its drunken, decadent sinners."
61455,Marge,"bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
56307,Marge,i mean romance not love.
61337,Marge,i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity. not like janey's mom.
58333,Marge,"homer, you know we don't have..."
54970,Marge,"well, we're going to the beauty parlor. maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone."
66089,Marge,are you watching it?
59379,Marge,"homer, who are you calling?"
55695,Marge,"your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
57629,Marge,"oh, i can see myself!"
65801,Marge,don't watch that dvd!
57813,Marge,"hmmm... ""nitzi""..."
60949,Marge,"honey, you did have a great time doing those commercials. and you made a lot of money."
58531,Marge,"we need bart to help fold your father's underpants. where is he, anyway?"
58761,Marge,when did you start liking thai food?
57980,Marge,you lied to me! you promised to get rid of this gun!
58856,Marge,i'm almost done. and tell bart to get out of my purse.
56152,Marge,bowling ball... more underpants...
67196,Marge,sure.
64942,Marge,"hey, they're your gutters too."
60874,Marge,"all right, just to the mailbox and back."
67879,Marge,"mr. burns, she's just a baby."
57114,Marge,uh-huh.
58436,Marge,"quick, the barn!"
57868,Marge,"wow, governor's island looks so insignificant from up here."
59192,Marge,love ya lots!
58910,Marge,you didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
63615,Marge,never compare yourself to a standee.
65822,Marge,"homer, that's for children!"
66198,Marge,"come down, homie! ""you only live once"" also means when you die, you die!"
62244,Marge,that's right -- you're all crooks!
54862,Marge,don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
58948,Marge,oooo. what a beautiful garden. it's almost like paradise.
65566,Marge,it says on your facebook page you have no kids.
58851,Marge,canyonero!
66550,Marge,no. i think i went too far.
64750,Marge,"brother bear said ""sister bear is inconsiderate."""
67339,Marge,oh! the little tiger tries so hard. why does he keep failing?
55935,Marge,"i don't hate you, i'm proud of you. you came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
56428,Marge,donut? what's a donut?
65656,Marge,no idea. the important thing is that they did.
59305,Marge,homer!
67753,Marge,"oh, homer."
58007,Marge,"you know, homer, it's very easy to criticize."
61757,Marge,"oh, i've always wanted to go to france. your women don't age -- like catherine deneuve."
54888,Marge,i think that game is too old for her. why don't you go play with milhouse?
54993,Marge,"bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
59517,Marge,"okay, bart. i'll sweet-talk the sheriff, while you grab his keys."
58150,Marge,there's no shame in being a pariah.
63045,Marge,that almost tore my head off!
59601,Marge,it was healthy. he reciprocated. he reciprocated!
66683,Marge,our water was on fire.
58161,Marge,i thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
54618,Marge,he is!
55312,Marge,"ah, that's sweet."
63312,Marge,i'd like that very much.
64527,Marge,"bart, pants."
59490,Marge,"quiet, you two! you know your father's had a breakdown."
66529,Marge,"you were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you."
64259,Marge,all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. unless you're not man enough.
61608,Marge,"ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
63900,Marge,"dang that bart! thanks to him, i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat."
66014,Marge,"no, he cheated."
65010,Marge,a perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. i can't count the number of times homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather.
67040,Marge,"no, bart. this note isn't about you."
65527,Marge,"homer, that sounds like ""the sweet smell of success""."
59612,Marge,"oh. well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. except you cutting my brakes!"
60098,Marge,not a very good one?
66789,Marge,no woman uses one of these by choice.
60860,Marge,that's not a purse. it's a diaper bag.
54719,Marge,is he making chicken noises?
58755,Marge,bart?
57746,Marge,"besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with bart."
67871,Marge,kids. remember what i told you about showing a little support.
55951,Marge,how'd you know he's a vampire?
61989,Marge,mm-hmm.
62513,Marge,you haven't had any tea.
66189,Marge,ooh!
64713,Marge,lisa? are you in here?
67865,Marge,then i'm in the class?
63180,Marge,"i guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember."
56256,Marge,"but, isn't that a sin?"
66078,Marge,"what the heck am i saying? homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered."
66508,Marge,"homie, i can't find my spatula! can you get another one?"
65639,Marge,homer! the roof is leaking!
61741,Marge,"when we explain our side of the story, the hate calls will end. i won't have to hear ""suck my such and such"" or ""hell this"" and ""bitch that..."""
66538,Marge,"yes, for us. but not for lisa! never for lisa. we're going to help her make friends."
58564,Marge,sorry. i didn't realize i was in the way.
63719,Marge,"go, go, go, go, go!"
59446,Marge,i don't see the need for razor wire.
56212,Marge,uh-oh.
56854,Marge,"no, it's officer simpson - of the police!"
64803,Marge,you kids play nice up there!
58142,Marge,stop that!
65641,Marge,"while you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house."
64129,Marge,we'll take lemon.
64593,Marge,"shopping. every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. you stay here."
59574,Marge,"well, nobody's perfect. let me just pick those out."
63437,Marge,you'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of fox news.
66146,Marge,"i too am a freak. one eye is blue, and the other a pale brown."
63859,Marge,"homie, what do you say we go to bed? you, me and the cake?"
58183,Marge,what?!
62848,Marge,now i have a question... who are you people?
65441,Marge,"lisa, are you out there in your slippers? come inside!"
59299,Marge,that's right. and what else have we learned?
66891,Marge,homie. how did you end up at the casino?
57437,Marge,"homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
57016,Marge,i don't know what to say. i finally have a mother-in-law. no more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
58367,Marge,"oh homer, you didn't beat city hall! they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name. period."
56666,Marge,"bart, i told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
55515,Marge,"well, i'm sorry... i'm sure bart doesn't really mean to be bad."
64005,Marge,i'm just trying to--
55907,Marge,"bart, run upstairs and get grampa's medicine!"
66253,Marge,"homer, you have to take the halloween decorations down before you put the christmas ones up."
63534,Marge,"homer, i have to go. if i don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
67195,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
63864,Marge,okay. milhouse?
57880,Marge,bart? why are you doing that?
64985,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. you'll get your chance to say ridiculous things."
63020,Marge,perfect!
56769,Marge,"well, i'm sure some of you already know me. i'm bart simpson's mother."
55378,Marge,you're what?
63623,Marge,switch stations!
55620,Marge,he does not.
59859,Marge,"you know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. i hear mel brooks has one. i mean, sir mel brooks."
56342,Marge,good. does anyone else have a love story?
67924,Marge,"uh, gee homer, don't quit..."
63618,Marge,"who thought walking could be so difficult? well, i'm sure everyone else is having trouble too."
63410,Marge,yes there is!
65038,Marge,"look, now my son needs your help."
67311,Marge,"well, tonight is a very special night. your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing."
58657,Marge,the highest grade.
60639,Marge,how can you have such an appetite at a time like this?
57122,Marge,"homer, maybe mr. burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
63596,Marge,why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
66440,Marge,you really think we're still doing the right thing?
62243,Marge,"wait, there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense. why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear?"
60890,Marge,"ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? a lemon!"
64336,Marge,"now lisa, you're a vegetarian, but these cows have made a different choice."
65753,Marge,and here comes santa's little helper!
59198,Marge,"oh, no!"
63764,Marge,"i've talked to over five hundred men named lumpkin... everyone at lumpkin, lumpkin and rosenthal associates, an asian or pacific islander named cho lum kin..."
56011,Marge,homer?!
61427,Marge,did you read the book?
65112,Marge,that was a traffic signal.
58270,Marge,i've really gotta get dinner started...
59426,Marge,"homer, you help too."
63160,Marge,i'll tell you what. we're going to scottsdale!
59555,Marge,no knife games on the kitchen table!
58379,Marge,me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
66599,Marge,but that's so many sandwiches!
63472,Marge,"you know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage."
54617,Marge,could he be singing about me?
63221,Marge,"okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. in colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum."
56847,Marge,"i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
58102,Marge,"well, that about does it for houses in this area..."
65429,Marge,"you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? and when i wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!"
64746,Marge,"lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever."
65688,Marge,stop your trendy arguing! i'm trying to call the fire department!
57753,Marge,"homer, you didn't tell me mr. burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
57602,Marge,no.
67478,Marge,"i don't think that it's broken, honey. here, let me try."
58922,Marge,wish you were her. how many of these is he going to send me?
63161,Marge,sure!
59608,Marge,"oh, my. i've been so unfair to becky. maybe i am insane. i mean, i am talking to myself."
57001,Marge,con: i am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
56034,Marge,brad goodman is coming to town!
59664,Marge,that's not true.
56338,Marge,"i made the right decision to stay with my homie, and there was no harm done. so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
59604,Marge,i'm not insane!
67121,Marge,homer?
65511,Marge,"ned, i realized long ago, there are some things homer and i will never completely agree on."
64729,Marge,is that the cat in there?!
63303,Marge,okay... activate my level seven power stones... wield the orb of oblivion... and zap!
61506,Marge,i hope this typeface catches people's eye. it sure didn't move our old fondue set!
59430,Marge,missionary work?
64534,Marge,bart! put down those books and go play this instant!
60507,Marge,"ooh, that's the movie phone guy."
64354,Marge,"eh, well..."
66038,Marge,"hi, homie! did you get the money? the kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!"
56164,Marge,"homer, it looks like it could gore."
61119,Marge,"okay kids, stay together!"
56452,Marge,"i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. how about letting her ride up front, too?"
57552,Marge,"well, we're trying to, but you're blocking our way."
63610,Marge,"i'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
66104,Marge,i said no!
59904,Marge,"where have you been, young man? it's nearly bedtime."
62759,Marge,what an odd thing for a man who's not interested in me to do.
57447,Marge,the only thing i asked you to do for this party was put on clothes. and you didn't do it.
65009,Marge,wait! wait! wait! wait!
55375,Marge,"herb, i appreciate your generosity, but i don't need any gift from you."
59344,Marge,i think so too. bye!
67003,Marge,"gee, homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?"
62355,Marge,all right.
55744,Marge,with norman fell as zeus!
55184,Marge,"actually, homer, you brought up ned flanders. i never said a word --"
57508,Marge,"thank you for your concern, helen. homer isn't drinking today."
63564,Marge,"dwight, do something!"
60243,Marge,time to begin operation xmas-remind of-how good is.
57713,Marge,"oh, bart, we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home."
60238,Marge,"honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
58712,Marge,"good hustle, kid."
62024,Marge,i can't take any more!
56200,Marge,what's going on in there?
59266,Marge,maybe you two should get a nanny.
63976,Marge,"homie, it's very open-minded of you to have bart's muslim friend's muslim family over."
55231,Marge,"no, maggie!"
60465,Marge,but you were very open with your feelings.
60981,Marge,"congratulations, sweetie. you're in the finals!"
64741,Marge,"sweetie, you could still go to mcgill -- the harvard of canada."
64949,Marge,really?
59833,Marge,it's a small liberal arts college. very law-abiding. no convicts at all.
55997,Marge,maybe we should call it a night.
63525,Marge,homer! lisa is receiving the student of the millennium award at school.
67570,Marge,"oh, please. all right. i'm trying to earn a living here. all right! stop! stop!"
58240,Marge,"oh no, no, no, no, no, no! they're due back at the store by six. get off 'em! get off, off! get off!"
61184,Marge,those cavalry kids are bigger credit hogs than the red cross.
66662,Marge,homer look what someone left in the kitchen. frosty chocolate milkshakes.
65483,Marge,this car's so clean! i'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
63933,Marge,"homer simpson, i wish i'd never met you!"
54740,Marge,"homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
55206,Marge,that's all right dear. i can do it.
57540,Marge,"homer, please! i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. please just let it be."
61505,Marge,"fine. ""extremely satisfied."""
67439,Marge,"see you after the game, when you're a big star."
55434,Marge,what kooky projects?
61732,Marge,"how's the ice cream, kids?"
63076,Marge,"lisa, i'm sorry you got a bad grade on your ""moe and tell."""
55291,Marge,hmmm. i thought you said she was overweight!
63740,Marge,"i think you've got a point! homie, i'm gonna be a dancer!"
66046,Marge,"oooohhh, i'm going to hell!"
63022,Marge,that's right.
58202,Marge,"hey, someone's boarded up our windows!"
61837,Marge,...because you let me down.
64166,Marge,"wait a second, marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?"
57011,Marge,"get out of here, you ghouls!"
65588,Marge,"no, s'okay. we can share this with you... homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
64238,Marge,"no, a husband!"
62336,Marge,let's go!
60658,Marge,"well, they're both lovely."
54827,Marge,"homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. i can't fill this out for you."
67876,Marge,"i'm painting his portrait, homer."
62961,Marge,leave him alone!
63790,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart. but sometimes your mom knows best."
66245,Marge,"either way for forty-five minutes you're not my problem, sweetie."
62666,Marge,"wow, it glows in the dark."
61661,Marge,"hi, sweetie. we're just calling to check in."
57456,Marge,"i must say, luann, you're really handling this splendidly."
59573,Marge,"actually, that was becky, too."
67052,Marge,"okay, bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. be nice to your sister."
55812,Marge,arrrgh!
56659,Marge,"i'm glad you're okay honey, but i wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
65146,Marge,wanna go home and celebrate?
60133,Marge,"you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much i love my kids."
60209,Marge,thanks for understanding.
57528,Marge,bad dog!
61428,Marge,did you like it?
61871,Marge,"and uh, where's your dad in all this?"
67677,Marge,uh... well....
63768,Marge,"she's thirty-four, and she's having a rough time!"
57521,Marge,...we had a fight?
64628,Marge,"that's not sesame street, that's a gay bar."
65405,Marge,uh-oh.
57780,Marge,i don't know... guilt?
56169,Marge,oh my lord!
55167,Marge,"hello, room service? this is marge simpson. i'd like a hot fudge sundae. with whipped cream. and some chocolate chip cheesecake. and a bottle of tequila."
63889,Marge,those walls do look safe.
59114,Marge,"according to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""frasier."" and that's where ellen degeneres and anne heche live."
54615,Marge,"yeah, sure."
56762,Marge,bart! lisa! what are you two doing home so early?
61430,Marge,and you're fine with me trying to get it published?
57591,Marge,we're going to do what we do every day. we're going to make pretzels.
64170,Marge,"okay, no more delays. i've got to watch this."
55913,Marge,"homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
62203,Marge,"that teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!"
64398,Marge,"ned, you got whipped cream in your mustache!"
60013,Marge,i cut off my husband's thumb!
57899,Marge,coming out of my eight-track...
65710,Marge,bart and lisa.
57226,Marge,oh dear.
66068,Marge,what? now? why?
66541,Marge,i don't know! i invited everyone that lisa's ever met.
67346,Marge,"well, maybe it would help him to be left back. it won't be so bad, bart."
67915,Marge,"oh, and homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so i can have a girls' night out?"
55919,Marge,"an ""a plus""! how did you do it?"
62282,Marge,"sweetie, don't worry. god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced. he'd send us signs, like, i don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
63024,Marge,i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.
56839,Marge,"hello, lisa. help me bite crime. ruff, ruff."
61380,Marge,when bad things happen to cute children says that a new pet will pull you out of your sorrow cycle.
57596,Marge,"oh, it's just a mob war. go back to sleep, honey."
61068,Marge,maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
55028,Marge,our song.
59723,Marge,you're not my husband.
61114,Marge,this is where duffman lives now. but i'm not sure we should go in there.
62055,Marge,straight.
62449,Marge,you don't trust me? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! how dare you!
58397,Marge,we've got to get you to a doctor right away.
62018,Marge,"god, that junior league burns me up."
59107,Marge,"oh, you poor thing..."
54818,Marge,"well... then i guess the moral is, ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
62212,Marge,i'll tell you what it means when it's over.
55554,Marge,chauffeur... seamstress...
55329,Marge,"bart, what's going on?"
56506,Marge,shh. i don't want people to see us looking at these books.
58617,Marge,"you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc."
57444,Marge,"oh, good. that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham."
61825,Marge,these other dishes look so pretty. and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners. i'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine. yes... medicine.
57863,Marge,"homer! homer, those legs belong to the man behind you."
59046,Marge,"hm. well, no one's forcing you to stay."
65724,Marge,"homie, i never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble."
63033,Marge,"switch, switch, switch."
57264,Marge,"oh, we've tried everything. olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj..."
59843,Marge,then why are you hiding?
67550,Marge,i can protect my own children.
54949,Marge,that's illegal.
63293,Marge,"i sent everyone i know an e-card for st. patrick's day... but not one person wrote me back! maybe if i hit ""refresh""..."
56873,Marge,it's almost lunch time. do you know where your brother is tutoring?
61642,Marge,"what i want is a really good ""weeper."""
60284,Marge,you insensitive jerk! maybe this family would be better off without you!
61735,Marge,bart! that hobo skeleton is not a toy!
56030,Marge,"homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
58903,Marge,oh my god!
56463,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
60960,Marge,"oh honey, i can't believe this is happening. i'll miss you so much."
64879,Marge,auf wiedersehen.
56435,Marge,bart! lisa! time for church.
67320,Marge,except for one thing... no chaperone.
57224,Marge,"i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. homer, you go, too."
67404,Marge,well leave it to good old mary bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
58849,Marge,let's do it.
60765,Marge,"homie, i could use a little more excitement in my life."
58372,Marge,"i'll have to say drugs, too."
66512,Marge,keep it! let's go!
63075,Marge,see.
58887,Marge,she didn't say it yet!
64625,Marge,"what is it, ned?"
63429,Marge,"oh hi, kids. you're just in time to go to the dentist!"
64341,Marge,"homie, where have you been?"
60276,Marge,you and ned married a couple floozies?
62718,Marge,i am not an unfit mother!
58362,Marge,bart!
67895,Marge,"hmmm, i feel that way about your father."
62265,Marge,no you didn't.
59022,Marge,"you're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?"
67743,Marge,"bart, you're no longer in sunday school. don't swear."
64547,Marge,"i just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize."
61164,Marge,"kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. we're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
64706,Marge,your week's up! time to go home!
59969,Marge,what? what?
65034,Marge,the school called and said bart is out of control. i think we may need some therapy for him.
61434,Marge,the harpooned heart ii: thunder down under. chapter one. temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...
56943,Marge,"oh, maggie, you're a simpson again!"
64115,Marge,"so homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."
59903,Marge,look! krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode.
67131,Marge,the holes were drilled for your fingers.
66001,Marge,"bart, i've never been so proud of you. never, never, never!"
63748,Marge,"well, the important thing is, someday i'll be watching my little marge dancing at lincoln center."
65789,Marge,"homer, listen to the g.p.s."
61772,Marge,marge!
63153,Marge,"that's right! i just found my gumption, and i like it!"
58701,Marge,"you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me."
55144,Marge,ahhh!!
59960,Marge,"isn't that a little excessive? i mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
56143,Marge,"homer, that's our wedding photo."
67794,Marge,"actually, i just told you pretty much everything."
58801,Marge,"oh, yeah, homer's a real go-getter."
66731,Marge,"oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. what if -- all the dads jammed together... in a dad band?!"
58031,Marge,"oh apu, give it up."
67304,Marge,"oh, homer."
61976,Marge,"well... as fabulous as your regulars are, a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush."
57081,Marge,wait! wait! i don't want maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
65548,Marge,"here's your smoothie, sweetheart."
59382,Marge,all i'm saying is don't get too comfortable. mr. burns will be back tomorrow.
56515,Marge,"oh, homey, what's--"
60547,Marge,what's that billowing down the stairs? it's smoke!
62436,Marge,welcome to our pox party. save room for punch -- maggie's bathing in the bowl!
65562,Marge,"no, i'm here to buy one myself."
64071,Marge,he won't come over!
55685,Marge,"well, i think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
64989,Marge,go! save yourselves!
67107,Marge,well then come down for breakfast.
59381,Marge,"homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. you're not a billionaire."
66370,Marge,don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
65632,Marge,don't take grampa's meds!
63786,Marge,we're putting a stop to this right now!
64673,Marge,"excuse me, have you seen this man?"
62404,Marge,"homer, can you help me out here?"
67140,Marge,hm. well... all right.
66004,Marge,mopped myself into a corner...
66739,Marge,see you soon!
67023,Marge,homer!
61280,Marge,all this attention! i feel like a secretary on administrative professionals day!
67162,Marge,"oh, that's very funny."
55556,Marge,"oh, i see."
59059,Marge,we were saving that money for our family vacation. now we're gonna have to start all over again.
59554,Marge,"ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. zig-zag!?"
60204,Marge,it would be a good excuse to use my yaqui tea set...
67348,Marge,"wake up bart, rise and shine, little guy. time to wake up."
56378,Marge,we'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
65831,Marge,the kids?
56750,Marge,"look at branford ii! isn't that cute? he thinks he's one of the models, inc."
67727,Marge,"oh, artie!"
61946,Marge,no harm done.
61826,Marge,baby ear medicine.
59423,Marge,what floozies? what are you talking...
56243,Marge,"mm-hmm. i'm happy about that. but, i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
55976,Marge,what's so special about it?
65671,Marge,your father took you to a korean gangster film festival?
65455,Marge,you'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us... enough!
56805,Marge,"strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. i'm crossing over to deviled ham. whoa!"
65354,Marge,if i may speak.
64874,Marge,i'm trying! it just keeps popping off.
60006,Marge,no!
63856,Marge,oh no! those were for mr. smithers' commitment ceremony!
64722,Marge,"ooo, i wonder how much that one is. gotta look without looking like i'm looking."
64537,Marge,i said he could take a break.
57262,Marge,there. now that gum should lift right out.
65802,Marge,i threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
57833,Marge,bart!
56701,Marge,no reason.
58568,Marge,"oh please, lisa. everyone's already figured that out."
64144,Marge,"homer, that's you!"
64734,Marge,thank god!
64276,Marge,and on the very top floor was a daycare center...
66574,Marge,the doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. go to bed. i'll take care of him.
64551,Marge,it's working!
57493,Marge,no! come on!
58935,Marge,i would have feigned interest.
63795,Marge,"okay lisa, i'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. huh, i have over four hundred text messages."
60768,Marge,"it's for my back spasms. if guys didn't keep pinching my tush, i'd never stand up straight."
65979,Marge,don't stand up!
54749,Marge,"grampa, could you do something?"
63292,Marge,"that internet has it all. today i found i had the same birthday as randy quaid, i mapquested a great new route to the armory, and i got a list of local houses where i'm not letting you kids trick or treat anymore!"
60964,Marge,i don't think this is a good place for a ten-year-old boy.
63572,Marge,and you have fun at your ridiculous event.
66595,Marge,then that's what i'm gonna do.
62222,Marge,"yeah, i bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
55467,Marge,i'm only going to ask you one last time. are you sure you won't come with us to church?
65237,Marge,i don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so homie can go back to his old job?
66159,Marge,"i have no regrets about that. it was a perfect pregnancy. didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. and every night before bed, homer would give me a little kiss... music. could bart have been prenatally screwed up by the kiss music?"
67437,Marge,fourth street and d!
60636,Marge,i can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
67340,Marge,"bart, honey... you're going to miss your bus!"
59066,Marge,there is for a mega-savings vacation. chuck garabedian says you can fly mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
61167,Marge,"you are so right, ned. there won't be a single minute where bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... homer, get over here!"
62902,Marge,"oh, i don't..."
65076,Marge,enough!
56662,Marge,"i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that. he may not be a big success like you, but i can always count on him to provide for the family."
54705,Marge,"don't ask me, i'm just hair. your head stopped eighteen inches ago."
56706,Marge,"homer, please pay attention. there's just one more movie."
61293,Marge,"mr. connor, thank you for helping find my husband. i don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like fritos."""
55343,Marge,"oh, homer, i love you just the way you are. lisa, what's that number?"
60676,Marge,those were for the church breakfast.
62033,Marge,dissin'? do rappers still say that?
57949,Marge,how horrible.
65510,Marge,why would you believe him?
57166,Marge,"homer, please. i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
55088,Marge,"maggie! you talked! can you say ""mama"" again?"
60744,Marge,"now, i need some liposuction -- just enough to make me attractive to this man."
66724,Marge,when will this tea get out of my system?
61466,Marge,"homie, i'd like to know what you've been doing after work."
67421,Marge,homer... homer... make them stop.
61521,Marge,good. can you play with him for half an hour?
62693,Marge,no rudner.
61789,Marge,"oh, homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor."
60567,Marge,"i like ""little dot."" could you rip that off? i mean, who's gonna know?"
58254,Marge,is that my good butter?
65579,Marge,"maggie's not a baby! her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months! being a mom is who i am, and i'm not done being who i am."
62928,Marge,that was two seasons ago!
58407,Marge,"lisa, we're home! sorry about the museum! you'd better go up and apologize."
59708,Marge,when did this happen? when did we become the bottom rung of society?
61982,Marge,"boy, what a night! moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. here, watch."
63325,Marge,bart's coming down!
62097,Marge,"homer, no stop! you're thinking of buckingham palace!"
64003,Marge,"these be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties."
63945,Marge,fine. but i don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
57922,Marge,"yeeesss. well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
64442,Marge,potato!
64406,Marge,"well, i think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in lisa's life is which boy will marry her. right, homer? homer?"
65775,Marge,but we know so little about them.
64644,Marge,every time i plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.
59409,Marge,so many horses. i don't know who to vote for. can't i just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?
61102,Marge,"you, homie."
61004,Marge,how much longer is this going to go on?
55200,Marge,"oh, that's very good, lisa."
61153,Marge,lousy homer... i'll show him... tonight his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples.
64160,Marge,maggie.
58060,Marge,i found this hat!
60430,Marge,"for god's sake, homer. give them back their flame!"
60083,Marge,"gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens."
63103,Marge,"homer, i wanna show the world how i feel about you."
67256,Marge,yes! yes!
60840,Marge,orlando? are we going to sea world?
58509,Marge,"oh, dear. i hope i wasn't too rough on him."
59206,Marge,then why are you driving so fast?
62784,Marge,and i don't know who's more handsome: the bull taunter or the bull stabber.
57054,Marge,go crazy?
56086,Marge,"well... yes, i do. but they're all heirlooms, too."
60735,Marge,"ooo, look. there's your father."
57144,Marge,"oh, sure i do. i treated myself to a sanka not three days ago. but this is a real find."
56864,Marge,"i can't believe you vandalized your own home town, bart. what would jebediah springfield say?"
62720,Marge,"excuse me, mrs. toot, i need to talk to you mother to mother."
55295,Marge,"just so you know, while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, maggie cut her first tooth."
58664,Marge,i never realized history was so filthy.
58261,Marge,"they need a good, stiff, all-purpose dress shoe. something for church, but also for doctors appointments dental check-ups, piano recitals, building dedications, visiting elderly relatives, haircuts and shoe shopping."
58003,Marge,"look, i want a cup."
56343,Marge,"lisa, not all romances turn out that way. bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
59896,Marge,it's totally unfair for one side to have a professional player.
56538,Marge,can't talk. keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
56608,Marge,"actually, when i was about to have bart..."
66438,Marge,give back the painting! the whole town's turned against us!
67760,Marge,one. and two. and three. and reach. and five. and six. and seven..
67371,Marge,i still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
61123,Marge,my husband has our card...
60480,Marge,bill... bill...
66126,Marge,"well, what made you--"
67116,Marge,umm-hmm.
64819,Marge,is it milhouse?
67685,Marge,"hm, i guess it's the tissue paper inside."
61887,Marge,i don't like the sound of that. tomorrow i'm taking you to doctor shapiro.
61928,Marge,"lisa, let me explain what happened tonight. sometimes when your mom has half a glass of wine, she goes cuckoo bananas."
58979,Marge,"you, an artist?"
62490,Marge,"uh, he's just faking loss of vitality, reverend."
67491,Marge,"lisa, i'm very sorry about what happened."
59541,Marge,there's our broadway baby!
57520,Marge,yeah.
60587,Marge,"homie, it's eleven at night. have you told him yet?"
64211,Marge,the what?
59731,Marge,you don't know what i'm missing.
60295,Marge,i don't know how this town got so fat.
64209,Marge,"what if we got a small apartment there? we wouldn't have to live in it, but we would have a waverly hills address."
63262,Marge,this disasterette was a real wake up call. we need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
57246,Marge,"oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
55156,Marge,"homer, can you bring maggie out?"
61097,Marge,"homie, i'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up."
54747,Marge,oh my. where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
60089,Marge,"no housework, eh?"
64462,Marge,i thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. at least that's what the letter said.
63254,Marge,i invited selma here to watch grampa watch the kids.
66391,Marge,you're both coming home with us!
64576,Marge,"shalom to you! shalom is the ""aloha"" of this place."
60508,Marge,"we've met you many times, ms. naegle. why do you keep changing jobs?"
64711,Marge,bup-up-up! safety locks!
57426,Marge,"well, i also have a song to sing!"
57685,Marge,ho-mer.
61877,Marge,"lisa, just take a bite. one bite -- that's all i ask!"
60859,Marge,oh god! oh god! oh god!
65608,Marge,"homie, maybe we should wait."
58435,Marge,hope that farmhouse has a phone.
59155,Marge,thank you for stopping the tank.
57321,Marge,"remember, kids, there's no need to bump! just enjoy the ride!"
57141,Marge,it is.
59866,Marge,would you boys like to play tennis?
65422,Marge,which he didn't.
55637,Marge,i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
60331,Marge,that's the best one!
62309,Marge,bart! turn away from that screen and look out the window!
62190,Marge,"oh it's so great. we can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. i'm so proud of you. lisa, graduating two years early, and bart... graduating."
55662,Marge,it's not good for your heart.
55091,Marge,bart! what's wrong with you?
62474,Marge,you told me he was at culinary school!
56458,Marge,"don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your mother. i know. how about we play the basketball? i'm no harvey globetrotter, but..."
59389,Marge,"bart, stop that! now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here."
67361,Marge,"homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?"
61639,Marge,"we're staying at the dayton arms hotel. it got three diamonds from ""five diamond"" magazine!"
62123,Marge,"well, i just think we should be building a nest egg."
66464,Marge,"actually, i'm a little surprised lisa likes him."
65242,Marge,see? luckiest man in the world.
54810,Marge,"homer, i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
58059,Marge,you bought a car?! without consulting me?!
63743,Marge,it won't go down!
59988,Marge,let's just float by quietly...
65525,Marge,"all right, who took the microwave?"
54745,Marge,"oh, that must be the babysitter."
57424,Marge,what about the sleaze and the depravity?!
58800,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad we were able to get together."
57313,Marge,"okay, bart, your turn, your turn."
63868,Marge,"i don't think i could. mr. leary, i'm so sorry. i'll send you your phone back right away."
65997,Marge,ugh. speaking of police...
60898,Marge,you've just been marge-inalized!
61226,Marge,why is bart so tall? and shaggy?
62840,Marge,"don't be so naïve, lisa. those people all talk to each other!"
62344,Marge,"oh bart, i knew one of these dumb things would work!"
65615,Marge,"fine, he'll be around forever."
64705,Marge,"aw, you think i forgot you? babies shouldn't jump to conclusions!"
62699,Marge,"i'm a ""star wars."" now let's see who you've drawn!"
66387,Marge,"oh, urgent notice."
67620,Marge,"yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother. he's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
58497,Marge,oh?
67552,Marge,all right.
60353,Marge,"i don't know what you said, but i'm sure it was beautiful. oh homer, this is the kind of night i thought we could never have together: incident free."
57270,Marge,"so apu, why didn't you go back to india when your student visa expired?"
63701,Marge,this is a terrible valentine's day.
63870,Marge,shouldn't you just be happy for their success?
64322,Marge,someone should tell your principal!
66566,Marge,"homer, get up!"
54723,Marge,"homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. there's a little girl upstairs who needs you. her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her daddy."
66968,Marge,"are you all right, homer?"
66567,Marge,"krusty, i brought some homemade chicken soup. we used the play-doh maker for the matzo."
65267,Marge,i just got a message from maggie in my brain.
55169,Marge,"well, good. i'm coming home, honey. you can pick me up at the train station in an hour. and bring the kids. bye!"
65370,Marge,stop! stop! this is everything we put behind us!
56423,Marge,"hello, police? this is marge simpson. my husband is on a murderous rampage. over."
66401,Marge,they're not coming for another twenty-nine years! did your earlobes get longer?
58966,Marge,"god, you have every right to flick me out too. but before you..."
61649,Marge,stupid kids ruin everything.
67191,Marge,"oh... yes, hello, helen."
56668,Marge,"homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. their necks are brittle."
57820,Marge,"you'll have to face him sometime. and when you do, i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
67293,Marge,"hello, i'd like to talk to dr. monroe."
55412,Marge,that sounds awfully harsh.
58167,Marge,"homie, this whole town runs on a tune! / our churches, our clubs our government too."
60198,Marge,"do something, mesmerino!"
64802,Marge,"oh, that's ancient history. ooh, here's my paper on ancient history."
60946,Marge,you've gotta get rid of those furbies. they've turned feral!
62777,Marge,i remember him.
56396,Marge,it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over.
66639,Marge,good everybody. you won't believe it but we actually turned a profit today.
62706,Marge,maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
61265,Marge,you punched out three people on the street.
56844,Marge,homer!
62772,Marge,"well, it's a cinch springfield won't be that lucky city."
61722,Marge,"no, homer."
65578,Marge,"homie, i want another baby."
64424,Marge,"oh, barty, i'm sorry. but your father and i think that three kids is just perfect."
63337,Marge,besides that!
59240,Marge,"now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. so we'll just stay here and not disturb him."
55507,Marge,it's our only hope.
58364,Marge,go! go! go!
60191,Marge,oh my god! dinner with burly!
60831,Marge,"these are homer's friends and family. they don't want him dead, they just want him to suffer."
59311,Marge,what will become of our kids?
67672,Marge,"homer. it's not the end of the world. you know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
66972,Marge,"your father's gone, too."
62636,Marge,"oh homie, i always believed you were gonna make it, no matter what that pushy casket salesman said."
55180,Marge,"how was detention today, dear?"
65870,Marge,i wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.
64073,Marge,"you know, it says here that grampa has to remain in the house, but we don't. how about a family outing?"
58248,Marge,"oh, all right. you can stay up late tonight. but tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock."
62648,Marge,bag or keister?
57543,Marge,"these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! and look at the fine stitching on ""dope!"""
66772,Marge,aww.
62281,Marge,i guess i'll just cut my own hair.
66420,Marge,we should have it appraised!
62703,Marge,what's wrong with your teeter-totter?
64274,Marge,maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect.
67074,Marge,"we all are, dear. your father says there's nothing to worry about."
61051,Marge,"james taylor. homie, remember that song we used to sing?"
64629,Marge,"although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring, but... we're going home."
65332,Marge,"well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. now start quilting!"
63477,Marge,homie... i miss our alone time. i miss you.
63678,Marge,i'm just really worried about your weight. bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
63204,Marge,you killed my husband!
64686,Marge,but you can keep me company.
65723,Marge,"lisa and maggie are downstairs, and bart's in his room with milhouse."
67172,Marge,yes.
62742,Marge,that's wonderful!
59049,Marge,"homie? well, look at you..."
55500,Marge,he's not dead.
61556,Marge,"no, it'll have to do."
56885,Marge,i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.
55957,Marge,marge simpson.
62683,Marge,"and why do you really want it, anyway? moe, will the gold bring back edna's love?"
58879,Marge,stone philips again!
65019,Marge,they even have a day spa staffed by former all-pro linemen.
56186,Marge,i'm very concerned. mr. burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
54752,Marge,"all right. all right. goodbye, children. and behave yourselves."
58947,Marge,"oh my. gracias, señor."
66985,Marge,do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
59140,Marge,i thought you'd like it. and i'm enjoying the friendship between showgirl and that seamstress.
57380,Marge,we're not picking him up!
64258,Marge,"""in last night's 'macbeth,' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan, followed by duffman as macduff, lenny leonard as lennox, eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, homer simpson."""
55294,Marge,i gotta go. homer...
61696,Marge,"well, whoever he is, the pie man would never cave in to blackmail."
63012,Marge,"the letter doesn't say. but from now on, no peanut products are allowed on school property."
55663,Marge,"homie, what is it?"
60038,Marge,"boy, this sure was one crazy day...right, mr. teeny?"
57206,Marge,ye olde toast.
55044,Marge,bob?
59963,Marge,"that's quite an act to follow, lisa."
67480,Marge,just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. bart. bart?
62624,Marge,hoo boy.
62012,Marge,love love will keep us together
58308,Marge,you know who's nice?
63527,Marge,"homer, you cannot miss lisa's big day. and you have to come sober!"
61441,Marge,that's the best review i've gotten. seriously. these reviews are terrible.
56233,Marge,"we don't think you're slow. but, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything."
67859,Marge,"i think it's a very nice idea. don't you, homer?"
63066,Marge,don't you dare go limp!
54820,Marge,"bart, watch maggie while i get the laundry."
65961,Marge,"no, no, it has to be something big that'll change his whole outlook. why don't we take moe on a road trip?"
56119,Marge,that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie.
61876,Marge,"well, maybe not. but you did a great job on the lawn."
59437,Marge,"homer, i'm so impressed. everything you're doing sounds so rewarding."
61520,Marge,"how about a little ""interrogation?"""
55437,Marge,my name is blanche dubois.
58805,Marge,you don't know what they're saying.
65248,Marge,homer! are you... schmoozing those men?
67044,Marge,"good night, homer."
63497,Marge,"maggie's so clingy! homer, hold her while i pour the milk!"
59699,Marge,we don't have a stash.
56955,Marge,"that's it, honey. get into the spirit."
59530,Marge,"well, looks like we got everything for bart's camping trip: blair witch repellent, antler saw and deep woods scrabble."
58778,Marge,g'night.
64745,Marge,cut it out! you're upsetting the gravy boat!
59908,Marge,"oh, please. you get exhausted watching ""the twilight zone"" marathon! i'm a regular billy crystal."
60959,Marge,"please don't go, bart. i'll let you swear in the house. everything but the big three."
54924,Marge,"my goodness, what's wrong?"
59218,Marge,oh.
63515,Marge,"at least you need me, sack of potatoes."
56064,Marge,"oh my god, barney, thank you. i would never have forgiven myself."
55386,Marge,"dear kids, i hope this letter finds you well. we are doing great. your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever."
67867,Marge,really? you're so supportive. i wish every teacher was like you.
62917,Marge,"lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. my son's a brat but he's a special little guy. your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
58137,Marge,tap the brakes! tap the brakes!
64372,Marge,no!
63087,Marge,"look, maggie, i made another you! out of sticky orange wood!"
62682,Marge,"if you all don't drop your guns and behave, no one gets the gold."
62476,Marge,i'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
64141,Marge,dim the lights.
60130,Marge,no!
63800,Marge,"homie, she's not making a snuggle film."
64032,Marge,"well, that's what's missing. our lives would be horrible without the kids."
60291,Marge,it's got pictures of deformities.
59882,Marge,i'm bart's partner.
59076,Marge,"oh my goodness, homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars."
61306,Marge,maybe now we can get that padding that goes under rugs.
55193,Marge,there's maggie!
63776,Marge,"uh, yeah..."
65007,Marge,"now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours."
64624,Marge,"lisa, i know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair, so i got you this book from the ""being different"" section of the bookstore."
60704,Marge,"oh, homie..."
58806,Marge,"oh, i hope we didn't get apu in too much trouble."
64951,Marge,i brought home fried chicken...
65799,Marge,you are invited to... a grand gesture? oooh!
66588,Marge,lenny used the uck-word!
61273,Marge,what difference could it make? he hit the friggin' queen!
56337,Marge,thank goodness i drove down an ironic street.
55639,Marge,you don't have a cousin frank.
56147,Marge,there. i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
67948,Marge,bart?! you brought me back to life!
65529,Marge,"oh, forget it."
63009,Marge,"well, i like the idea of you as a handyman... and i love the idea of you reading!"
61727,Marge,"oh, homie! you did care."
58750,Marge,no he's not.
62846,Marge,my head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
58923,Marge,it's not fair. your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...
65303,Marge,homie...
63542,Marge,"okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
64952,Marge,and a completely new hairstyle!
64226,Marge,"you don't need a wii now that i'm here. because you and me make ""us."""
55041,Marge,yes.
60315,Marge,don't worry. i'll do the legwork.
59790,Marge,there's so much evil in the world.
59395,Marge,"homer, lisa's in that."
66899,Marge,i want my husband back!
60659,Marge,"hold your heads up high, kids."
54900,Marge,"sweetie, i'm sorry, but krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
59210,Marge,"well, it's probably just a bad growing season."
63918,Marge,i said they were thrill-crazed drug seekers. don't put words in my mouth!
64605,Marge,"that's drug talk! but i could be mistaken. let me just listen to a little more, out of context."
61956,Marge,"homer, these are people you work with. show some restraint."
57000,Marge,con: you're running the air conditioner non-stop. it's freezing in here.
58024,Marge,"how was your day, sweetheart?"
58296,Marge,unless you're a man.
66217,Marge,"if he's not in there, where is he?"
66661,Marge,homer!
64649,Marge,"homie, slow down!"
66636,Marge,as many as you like...
56837,Marge,"and that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
58837,Marge,good lord. how am i supposed to get in this beast?
65459,Marge,purple!
65699,Marge,we don't want a raccoon.
63040,Marge,"homer, i was pretty upset with you, but in the end, i... i... i-beam!"
67739,Marge,ooh. that's a good idea.
63731,Marge,"aw marge, if there was a reality show called ""fat guys who really love their wives"", not only would it be an enormous ratings success, but i'd be the first one on it."
63674,Marge,"because i didn't want him finding out about the party. i mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring sarah, and i just don't care for that woman."
56459,Marge,"hey, watch out for the shaq-attack!"
62870,Marge,"mr. simpson, i don't even know you -- i'm not making love with you!"
60112,Marge,kids it's eight o'clock! you're gonna miss the bus to wizard school!
61237,Marge,you stole this entire room from ned flanders' house!
56462,Marge,"hm, i better go check that out. now homer, don't you eat this pie."
65137,Marge,"that's great, homie! come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
62574,Marge,"ooh! well, now i really hope my chute opens!"
61778,Marge,and white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
57266,Marge,but where are we going to put him?
63986,Marge,now take it off before they sting you!
57824,Marge,"i wouldn't bother him, honey. he's making some kind of model for a contest. he says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
58019,Marge,"apu, you're a bachelor. get up there!"
63302,Marge,"that's better. now, let's role... play!"
55573,Marge,oh really? i came to see you three times today. twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
59044,Marge,"young lady, this may be the high point of bart's life. cut him some slack."
55614,Marge,"this might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind..."
57298,Marge,"wave bye-bye to our house, maggie. bye-bye, tree."
60137,Marge,"i just can't do that, homer. it's a matter of principle. and i need you to support me in this."
66342,Marge,"oh, absolutely. these sessions keep me on an even keel."
60201,Marge,"oh, no..."
67704,Marge,bien.
61539,Marge,bart!
66196,Marge,homer!
60951,Marge,"of course, the stock market's been down lately."
61224,Marge,"ooh baby! did i find something to throw out today! if you like space in the attic, are you gonna be happy!"
60588,Marge,tell that woman it's over between you and her.
61958,Marge,"homer, that was apollo twelve!"
58303,Marge,ralph certainly has a lot of imagination.
63013,Marge,"let's see what you've got... peanut butter and jelly sandwich, trail mix -- starring peanuts, good grief! more peanuts!"
58084,Marge,my pleasure.
59839,Marge,what's wrong with my sundaes?
61925,Marge,i'm so sick of names!
56104,Marge,"yes, he's raking leaves."
65773,Marge,just for standing on a thing?
63797,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
63698,Marge,well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- homie is where my heart is.
62974,Marge,"oh, you're a widower."
67499,Marge,bart? you're home!
61834,Marge,she's already ahead of me.
67607,Marge,"is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
58745,Marge,"742 evergreen terrace, springfield. oh, hiya, maude! come on in."
59658,Marge,but you seemed so happy in the ocean. all that playful leaping.
65666,Marge,you're all bald!
65421,Marge,mr. burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived.
61155,Marge,oh my god. it's so beautiful.
57320,Marge,kids! stop that! don't make me get the carney!
54635,Marge,are you saying that america was founded on... misconceptions?
55872,Marge,"knock, knock."
56153,Marge,no one's going anywhere. we're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
58713,Marge,"but only by two points. and they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory."
67124,Marge,...and my sisters.
59007,Marge,"ooh, i don't know. could be. i need some inspiration."
66129,Marge,sorry. dear god... you know which one i mean... thank you for returning our homie. he's still got a lot of unfinished business down here.
62367,Marge,i'll call you back!
63296,Marge,"for amusement only... ""credit card information may be sold to korean gangsters""..."
62457,Marge,"innocent?! after all i do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. i'm finished with him."
63463,Marge,forget it! one day a week i should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
64757,Marge,these classic board games are fun and safe.
63836,Marge,this was such a pleasant st. patrick's day till the irish people showed up.
64900,Marge,you were friends with three other boys and i became close with their moms.
58033,Marge,"i don't know, but i'm sure it's spicy."
57910,Marge,"bart, would you like to read a book?"
63056,Marge,"homer, with all the things you've done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the navy -- i never thought you'd join the army!"
64208,Marge,...and because of cutbacks they were combining math with p.e. they were playing dodge book!
59652,Marge,"son, i don't like you watching that fire. it's too violent."
62119,Marge,go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
67164,Marge,twenty-five dollars!
56982,Marge,"do you see towels? if you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again."
63834,Marge,"yeah, well, we're adding clowns."
60583,Marge,"oh, this is so awkward. today's the day we play badminton with them. oh, i hope no one makes any double entendres."
56896,Marge,"the police have such a strong case against homer. mr. burns said he did it, they have homer's d.n.a..."
65906,Marge,"no! i'm tired of your broken promises! ""marge, i'm gonna lose ten pounds."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight p.m."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight a.m."" ""i'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life."" i'm done!"
65287,Marge,"homie, you can win this argument! just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports!"
55854,Marge,"hello, barney. are you playing the town drunk?"
56275,Marge,i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered?
60696,Marge,house of pain. this must be where you pay the bill. why am i always so funny when no one's around?
56237,Marge,"homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. you've ruined a perfectly good jacket."
58818,Marge,"oh... just once, i'd like a parrot to say that to me."
55509,Marge,"homer, get back here."
61071,Marge,"yes, homie?"
67884,Marge,"that's wonderful homer, i'm so proud of..."
60323,Marge,i was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
65397,Marge,what do you see?
59780,Marge,"sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere."
60411,Marge,"oh, that's very sweet, artie."
59725,Marge,"oh, homie!"
62322,Marge,"don't you touch bead one! homer, maybe we should be concerned. catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on friday..."
62407,Marge,what a lousy party.
58271,Marge,four drink minimum?
58241,Marge,"willie, i'm not sure we're making any headway here."
59599,Marge,"this isn't over, becky. i know where you live: my house!"
67216,Marge,"sorry, homer."
55824,Marge,uh-huh.
62446,Marge,"homer, you're crazy!"
56585,Marge,"all right, all right. it's lisa's turn."
67881,Marge,"i'm so sorry, mr. burns."
67577,Marge,yes. i'd like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. thank you.
60246,Marge,hm. it's a pity.
56953,Marge,"i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for once. besides, i'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... god only knows."
55236,Marge,"homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
62751,Marge,"well, i liked the genie part. that was fun."
56810,Marge,"you got it, little buddy."
62459,Marge,"so, i got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
61349,Marge,i'll cut to the chase. i brought with me the very best reason i can think of for what i believe in.
58244,Marge,"homer, come back!"
61058,Marge,"oh my god, i forgot all about this. where did you find it?"
62079,Marge,i'll take a cart.
59977,Marge,"homie, did you remember to tip kitenge?"
56015,Marge,"why do you read that ""free"" column, homer? they never have anything good."
61602,Marge,"oh bart, my troubled little lamb. you'll be in jail for so long. but i'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty."
56846,Marge,you have to move your car.
58678,Marge,"well... i said i'd do it, so i guess i'll have to."
63355,Marge,"maggie. honey, this is for your own good. growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy."
54819,Marge,but it certainly was a memorable few days!
60570,Marge,"no, you're angry. look, you're punching the cat right now."
63586,Marge,i'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
56140,Marge,"homer, that's not god, that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there."
64990,Marge,abe? are you feeling all right?
60592,Marge,"i just wish there was something we could do... oh. oh, homer, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
64543,Marge,you were never going to apologize!
56066,Marge,i'll catch up to you.
54972,Marge,"homie, we're back."
59472,Marge,you danced for hours just because they told you to?
63926,Marge,that's the fuel gauge.
57443,Marge,"lisa, quick. screw these back on."
55418,Marge,"i'm sorry, llewellyn. i just... i just don't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley's face. couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
62697,Marge,"what do you think, maggie?"
61916,Marge,why would homer write his name in grime?
54737,Marge,come here!
61221,Marge,"homer, it's trash day. will you just take him out to the curb?"
58766,Marge,"wow, look at this place. the house number is spelled out with letters!"
60922,Marge,"oh, homie."
57178,Marge,uh-huh.
63421,Marge,we're gonna have to run. there isn't even time to stretch my quads!
66748,Marge,why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
63590,Marge,we can't have a space creature living in our house.
60578,Marge,are you sure you can get your deposit back? it's in pretty bad shape.
56209,Marge,"homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake."
58635,Marge,"ohh, how are you feeling, sweetie?"
66877,Marge,"yeah, so, uh, i'm going out to rehearse... the revue."
67826,Marge,"ohh, that dog!"
54710,Marge,he cares so much about those doggone dugongs. i wish i felt that kind of passion. maybe i should join him on his mission...
55254,Marge,you wouldn't want what he's eating. it's mostly just snouts and entrails.
66106,Marge,i'm gonna do what i've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.
65611,Marge,another way is don't drink.
57231,Marge,but?
62138,Marge,i'll let you sass me!
64961,Marge,what kind of card?
63621,Marge,"""rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
59794,Marge,"try to focus on something else. umm... you like jimi hendrix, right?"
60531,Marge,i don't think my daughter should hear this.
65784,Marge,she's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.
62654,Marge,"oh. chief wiggum. uh, are you still with the police department?"
56505,Marge,a tasteful book.
59511,Marge,and y'all hardly ever bicker anymore.
59503,Marge,"you seemed so understanding before. what happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
56157,Marge,you're not done. i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides.
56404,Marge,"oh my, it looks like we're doomed!"
58411,Marge,you mean frank grimes?
58016,Marge,"homer, mr. burns can't see you winking."
64752,Marge,you're not going to the dentist!
63577,Marge,"homie, i made you my ""killer"" lasagna."
58483,Marge,"oh, honey. a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. unless it was especially skilled. or one of those super-babies from brazil."
65414,Marge,"homie, what are you drinking?"
64666,Marge,"guys, guys, i'm married!"
57701,Marge,"make sure he brushes his teeth, lisa."
66763,Marge,homer?
60146,Marge,let's go.
65634,Marge,lisa!
57648,Marge,yes we can!
61615,Marge,"no, i'm here to have a little girl-talk with mrs. krabappel."
61624,Marge,"let's just say in an emergency, i wouldn't count on either one."
56782,Marge,"homer, this is an operation!"
60556,Marge,"homie, i don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
59148,Marge,i think we should take him off the drug.
66524,Marge,"you will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand."
61817,Marge,fish scales?
61166,Marge,i am so tired of that tautology.
62101,Marge,"okay, one quick snuggle."
66914,Marge,"oh, dear. maybe bart is a little more realistic."
54851,Marge,"lisa, the contest isn't for three hours."
55004,Marge,look at all those worried faces -- except for lenny. he looks great.
66000,Marge,bart!
55428,Marge,"for god's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!"
59938,Marge,it's only two blocks away!
60863,Marge,why is it ned flanders?
60517,Marge,"oh, aren't you sweet? sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy."
60947,Marge,i can't believe you talked me into this.
55346,Marge,better give me the weight loss tape.
66113,Marge,"well, i was trying to buy you snack cakes..."
66336,Marge,thank you.
66321,Marge,"homie, i think the kids are just hungry."
63436,Marge,"i invited him to stay with us for a few days. his career is ruined, and i was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide."
56936,Marge,there's bart's ring!
60741,Marge,i'm worried homer might do the same thing. what would make a husband lose interest like that?
55281,Marge,was it lurleen?
58192,Marge,i don't know.
61191,Marge,my baby!
65756,Marge,i don't know if we're gonna be able to get out. what are you writing?
65499,Marge,"helen, have a canapé! there's enough for everyone, but not too much."
60119,Marge,"well, maybe it'll be fun. you'll get to spend more time together. make sure your father takes his mood medication."
65974,Marge,"oh, good. he needs his sleep."
62975,Marge,flowers every week! i wish i was dead.
66377,Marge,"darn it, they're stuck."
58358,Marge,"well, we'd better start our love day clean-up. you kids take care of the wrapping paper. i'm going to dismantle love land."
55064,Marge,homer?
59104,Marge,will you stop acting so jealous?
67123,Marge,and the kids.
66251,Marge,"this has gone far enough. i'm starting to think this ""school project"" is more than meets the eye."
54696,Marge,"freeze him out. it's cold in marge's doghouse, baby."
66290,Marge,maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
65782,Marge,it all makes sense now.
54590,Marge,why don't you just stop playing?
61516,Marge,"homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you."
62257,Marge,forty-seven?
64228,Marge,where have you been? we have mirrors to hang!
54893,Marge,"well, i knew his mother would come to her senses.."
65407,Marge,"spin the top. if it falls over, we're in reality. if it spins forever, we're still in a dream."
58499,Marge,homer! you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
55607,Marge,we went fishing.
57296,Marge,"we have each other! when i was a lonely little girl, i always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend."
58145,Marge,"oh, homer. i'm so ashamed."
62626,Marge,"uh-oh. ""i know i'm just a lifeguard, but i want you to run away with me. if you don't reply to this letter, i'll know that you've chosen to stay with abe. but i know in my heart that the baby you're carrying is mine."
64501,Marge,"c'mon, baby!"
58423,Marge,"homie, you got your, your elbow in..."
64963,Marge,"a.a.a.? no, i'm not in triple-a. i don't like their ""westways"" magazine. they'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet."
60997,Marge,his answer's not at the bottom of a hedge.
56578,Marge,"i know, i know."
56365,Marge,why so glum?
55382,Marge,"you can have the shower to yourself, homie. i'm finished."
62419,Marge,"don't worry, we're not evil spirits."
55042,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking. if the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name larry?"
58941,Marge,"lisa, no, no, don't! it won't be the--"
55508,Marge,"well, i'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies."
65311,Marge,"well, it's not just kids using springface -- it's moms like me. marge!"
62668,Marge,i'd like to get into some blue pants right now.
63461,Marge,bodacious frittatas? buffet the hunger slayer?
61261,Marge,"a subscription to ""bartforum"" magazine, , and bart will say ""eat my shorts"" on your home answering machine."
54601,Marge,"if you think that, you should meet my new professor. professor august has shown me a side of the world i never knew."
56103,Marge,"i saved these for you, bart. you'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
62781,Marge,"grampa, killing yourself is a sin! god wants us to die of old age, after years of pain and reduced mobility!"
67082,Marge,why... that's my husband!
58009,Marge,are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
55111,Marge,"no, no, no, you have to try it on."
64065,Marge,"well, let's see what else is in the job jar."
56489,Marge,"yes, yes, yes. that's fine. good, good."
56643,Marge,that's better.
58525,Marge,you stay away from nelson muntz.
57815,Marge,"calm down, homer. calm down. answer the door."
64523,Marge,"i don't know what the big deal is. i mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's french. you know, bouvier?"
59391,Marge,i can't wait to do some shopping -- look at all these innovative products. miracle shears...
55794,Marge,lisa needs braces.
67147,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
61327,Marge,"oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. and tears are the sweetest sauce."
57202,Marge,seven hundred dollars.
61333,Marge,backed up by solar power.
62202,Marge,"you know homer, i let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father."
67220,Marge,your father. he's having a boys' night out.
62532,Marge,"bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
64034,Marge,don't open this one again.
58996,Marge,any ideas yet?
59672,Marge,homer...
58873,Marge,"outta the way! move it or lose it! get going, you!"
63008,Marge,"""wisconsin from above,"" ""veterans' day parades,"" ooh, ""smiles of ireland""! redheaded twins? their mother must have her hands full!"
59675,Marge,don't you two have a list of chores to do?
66433,Marge,see what happens when we get greedy?
63810,Marge,no more simpsons movies! one was plenty!
59645,Marge,"maybe i'd better check mine. ""today, your husband will die."" homer, i'm scared."
65348,Marge,why are all those cars parked at city hall?
60896,Marge,you!
66959,Marge,shhh!
62132,Marge,"you shouted it while we were making love! now look here, mister. i pay the bills, i do the budget, and i'm in charge of the money."
65837,Marge,makeup and baby oil!
63862,Marge,that laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. bart! how did you get a cell phone?
66509,Marge,"cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot."
61098,Marge,but they're already acting like teenagers. lisa's with that boy... and look at maggie!
56831,Marge,"don't stop talking on account of me. i may be a cop, but i'm still your friend."
57343,Marge,all right.
59746,Marge,what are you doing? why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
61821,Marge,why can't everyone just play fair and... did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl?
64481,Marge,this is what you're like when you don't drink!
56204,Marge,"honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey december morn."
58197,Marge,"good one, spud."
59535,Marge,"hi, little vicki."
58756,Marge,you changed your name without consulting me?
66200,Marge,are you mocking me?!
64233,Marge,hurry! get out the kids' stuff!
60934,Marge,that is gonna drive me nuts.
58634,Marge,"oh, homie, you made breakfast."
67712,Marge,oui.
62085,Marge,he's done good things for you too.
56297,Marge,"this romance is so full of heartfelt passion. i can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. homer. are you awake? this is important, give me some sign you're awake."
59799,Marge,let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole.
65928,Marge,it sure has taken a beating over the years. might be time to get a new one...
64268,Marge,"that's it, three stories. that's what we always tell."
67345,Marge,"there, there, bart. you're just a late bloomer."
62156,Marge,"we'll stop fighting, we promise!"
60646,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
58627,Marge,"doctor, will he be all right?"
58348,Marge,"i'm proud of you, honey. you're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much."
55209,Marge,like snuggling...
54757,Marge,"he forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
63343,Marge,i'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
58846,Marge,"kids, cut it out!"
57913,Marge,homer stop! would you please look at the drawing?
55811,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
65646,Marge,i always thought the pringles man had the kindest eyes.
56795,Marge,"homer, he cheated you."
65188,Marge,"relax, homie. have some leftover galalalalalalalalah."
59180,Marge,homer! stop that!
66261,Marge,"this is a great thing! we're helping people celebrate christmas, and we'll be able to afford christmas!"
67305,Marge,"i love you, too."
55376,Marge,"homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
64796,Marge,everything's just the way i remember it...
66612,Marge,your monkey just ate all my turkey.
55065,Marge,homer!
64063,Marge,"oooh, hot comes out of hot... it's like i'm dreaming! thank you, ned."
63985,Marge,stop milhousing your sister!
67019,Marge,"excuse me, dear. shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our tv back?"
63709,Marge,"no, i'm kind of embarrassed about it."
54639,Marge,"oh, thanks. it's just a note from my boyfriend."
58933,Marge,"if your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band."
67068,Marge,it all seems so expensive...
65706,Marge,"homer, i told you, don't call me ""mom."""
61644,Marge,bart!
65642,Marge,you're coming with us to the school fundraiser.
55465,Marge,"kids, could you wait outside for us?"
63855,Marge,"sorry, sorry muscle spasm."
59407,Marge,"lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."
66270,Marge,"for your information, gloria, my ""wassail"" is just gatorade i put in the microwave!"
64425,Marge,remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?
58246,Marge,omigosh! maybe he was telling the truth about everything.
56496,Marge,"you know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
67605,Marge,"oh, bart! we thought for a minute you'd gone away from us."
59512,Marge,"you mean, when they marry other people."
63575,Marge,uh... a blender cozy.
54686,Marge,it was my fault! i... i walked into a door.
55895,Marge,"... some ice cream at the store, since i'm saving so much money on diet cola."
57788,Marge,"hello, listen lady."
60684,Marge,"thank you, general. that's a big relief."
57279,Marge,"record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. music is none of my business."
62197,Marge,"kids... i want you to know i've started seeing someone. he's from springfield, i think you know him..."
61104,Marge,that treehouse is never gonna get built at this rate. time to call in the pros.
66544,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. i'm fine."
58514,Marge,that's me!
67029,Marge,"oh homer, that's ridiculous. bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?"
67049,Marge,"do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, bart?"
66018,Marge,"you are unique, you are special, and at some point that's gonna come together and work for you. i know it."
54769,Marge,"oh yeah, sure."
63833,Marge,it's clown trouble. that's your responsibility.
60527,Marge,what a charming neighborhood.
65005,Marge,i hate to say this about the cat lady... but i think she's crazy. she's a hoarder!
64051,Marge,"homie, do you know anything about this?"
57981,Marge,"how could you?! of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable..."
59821,Marge,not till you finish your sundae.
60995,Marge,"lisa, springfield isn't a cultural wasteland. part of ""stroker ace"" was filmed at our airport. and, um, oh! there's our ladies' book club. sara, you're more than welcome to come."
67190,Marge,"oh. well, thank you."
59497,Marge,sweet dreams.
59338,Marge,"oh, i don't want to be a bother."
55404,Marge,"i'll come home right away. all right, i'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken... extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait..."
55171,Marge,i missed you too.
62722,Marge,ned... rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own.
55758,Marge,"aw, lisa. you tried your best."
56513,Marge,the arabian nights room looks nice...
66858,Marge,why are you telling me all these things?
64232,Marge,"i got it halfway-- oh, it went back."
60786,Marge,can you save our house?
66689,Marge,homer! homer. i think there's someone downstairs.
63784,Marge,"and bart, you go with your father to shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs re-beaned."
56542,Marge,"i'm sorry, doctor. he's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him."
57822,Marge,"well, maybe... but i'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
58811,Marge,this is about investment opportunities in yemen.
62174,Marge,i wrote that letter.
57406,Marge,"oh, lisa, i know it's frustrating. but we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
57106,Marge,"lisa, you have to wait."
63336,Marge,you should all be ashamed! passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo! what have you people ever done?
58274,Marge,what on earth -- ?!
57027,Marge,they're ready.
59444,Marge,i guess i'll be driving.
65409,Marge,is that hail coming down?
55269,Marge,"ooh! the paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
65500,Marge,no weird hookups!
66449,Marge,i was just trying to learn the--
58238,Marge,close enough.
64960,Marge,neither did i. i didn't want to know what color the statue of liberty was. but you know what? i was wrong. and these ladies are too.
59295,Marge,"no, you don't have to kill anyone. not if you have jobs."
60653,Marge,"yes, and she's crying."
63655,Marge,"i'm honoring america's advertisers. then we're going to buy some toothpaste, lease a new car, and vote ""yes"" on prop eighty-seven."
61330,Marge,"well, maggie likes roofi. and babies only like good things."
54660,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, but i've got my calculus final tomorrow."
67925,Marge,"i keep telling you, ghost sex is nothing. it's worse than nothing."
55538,Marge,oh my lord!
55101,Marge,"homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
61960,Marge,i just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars!
58420,Marge,"yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the casbah."
63981,Marge,"lisa, add another name to our christmas card list. next to our jewish friends. where is lisa?"
54955,Marge,"homer, where have you been? i was so worried."
60948,Marge,don't go telling your buddies at work about this.
64919,Marge,but i don't want a beach house. sand makes me sad. because it used to be big rocks. but not anymore. not anymore...
57895,Marge,because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them.
65053,Marge,"selma, i just can't get over the new you."
63267,Marge,"okay, we're recreating our series finale party for ""star trek: voyager."""
58467,Marge,"okay, okay. here we go."
54833,Marge,"doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, bart, you'd see how sane he is."
64840,Marge,thank god mr. burns isn't alive to see this.
66804,Marge,"well, here's what happened..."
61954,Marge,"homer, i want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!"
67280,Marge,"hello, homie. i was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work."
55757,Marge,lisa?
54859,Marge,"oh, homer."
55496,Marge,"you keep your hands to yourself, mister."
64023,Marge,hey!
63379,Marge,"ooh, look! pine-cone first ladies!"
65643,Marge,the only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars.
66066,Marge,"homie, i bet you're wondering why i stayed on the computer until four a.m."
60469,Marge,grampa's here to get his driver's license.
59385,Marge,"oh no, you don't! i'm not going to let you trash mr. burns' yacht."
63788,Marge,stop the wedding!
62337,Marge,they weren't following us.
56528,Marge,"homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer. i have to get off the plane. let me off the plane. i'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
66282,Marge,"ooo, date night! i'll go change my bra!"
67047,Marge,"no, i'm very upset."
62301,Marge,a tv shark is not a babysitter!
64104,Marge,i feel like we're forgetting something.
58347,Marge,"oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be bart's people, bart."
58070,Marge,"well, this neighborhood is zoned r-3, which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys, and, oh... oh i'll never memorize all this."
67699,Marge,"oh, and i-i tutor part time."
64863,Marge,"so, lisa. do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece?"
65533,Marge,"our search for culture is thus concluded / for the bard of avon is well-suited / to a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / jeez, i can't stop talking like this."
63742,Marge,"look, lis! i'm as supple as ever!"
64510,Marge,absolutely right.
62942,Marge,"buck, i guess we can help you out. we'll start tomorrow!"
56167,Marge,"ew, homer, there is a bird on your head?"
61409,Marge,"for temperance, the days passed on... as did seven of her ten children."
66051,Marge,i just put all my personal information on their website!
61126,Marge,"homie, where have you been? i've been calling all over for you!"
62180,Marge,haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
59847,Marge,not yet. you have to guess what it is.
66352,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i'm all out. i spent all i had lighting that candle for great aunt betty."
65516,Marge,"whoever this ""truth teller"" is, i'm a fan. it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously."
67488,Marge,"yes, you do! i hope you're happy, bart! you've ruined thanksgiving!"
64500,Marge,yes it will. i'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. because without homer i'm a broom without a stone. no use for anything.
58842,Marge,no one has ever asked me that before in my life.
56537,Marge,in a little while.
58508,Marge,"i'm not saying you're a bad inventor. i'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. or accept them as gifts."
61310,Marge,they're not getting married!
67135,Marge,hmmm. i'll just use my ball.
65673,Marge,parenting shouldn't have a style! parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! are you wearing a wallet chain?! you look like... a barista!
62316,Marge,"bart, i love you. but sometimes i don't love your choices. now we have to find another school for you."
57843,Marge,we're like this all the time!
64611,Marge,"come on, let's go! what are you waiting for? come on."
55574,Marge,here's your money.
66637,Marge,take 'em!
59095,Marge,they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring mel gibson!
58867,Marge,get out of the way!
59930,Marge,"goodbye, homie. here's dr. hibbert's number if you feel weak."
59635,Marge,"so, the next time you see a sheriff, shoot him..."
65717,Marge,you can't have secrets from your wife!
56134,Marge,"don't worry, kids, i'm sure your father's all right."
66224,Marge,"well i'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. i thought that was strange poop on your collar."
63762,Marge,so that's it. she's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
61344,Marge,i bake apple pies!
59629,Marge,"now homer, this is no time to be thinking about food."
62500,Marge,puddle!
66511,Marge,i was making that cake for the block party today! now there's no choice but to go... store-bought!
57269,Marge,it's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
62558,Marge,i read an article about it at the tire store. did you know it's not named after someone named wayne scott?
61692,Marge,"i'm looking up your nose, but i feel like i'm staring into your soul."
59230,Marge,i've never been so glad to be home.
67238,Marge,do it!
58816,Marge,i can't believe it. he covered your whole bed with wildflowers?
57659,Marge,"well, i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret drinking problem..."
62332,Marge,"well then, i'd like to speak with jesus."
67508,Marge,"homer, drive defensively."
58163,Marge,"now homer, listen, i've had enough! / in our family videos, we have plainly seen / you're a singing, dancing, entertainment machine!"
67364,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so sorry."
64762,Marge,this poor man must've been out there for days!
58218,Marge,you bought four of them. thank god the check bounced.
60409,Marge,where are you taking me?
54611,Marge,who gets... cutie-puss?
54605,Marge,i wish you would support my comments.
63818,Marge,i'm used to buying my critters pre-made. how does your store differ?
57675,Marge,"homie, i can hear you chewing on your pillow. what's wrong?"
59205,Marge,look! it's jimmy carter!
64323,Marge,"i can't back out, because if i fight him tomorrow...it'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future."
64650,Marge,"now that it's empty, who's gonna buy their house? what if someone moves in with two barts? or four teenage barts?"
60128,Marge,she's such a butthole.
64710,Marge,"we've got plenty of songs in the car, by maggie's favorite singer: roofi!"
63668,Marge,this magic marker's running out of ink.
67444,Marge,now stop it you two. and don't look too down. i'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
65136,Marge,ooh! we can wear those to the nice mall!
62546,Marge,here's a ten. make your own card.
55785,Marge,you don't have to start drinking right away. i was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
56725,Marge,"you know, fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, i didn't even notice."
56078,Marge,what?
56904,Marge,"oh, lisa, honey, i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
63633,Marge,you remembered i like romance!
55383,Marge,ohhh...
54850,Marge,"wow, the president's bathroom!"
58405,Marge,but--
63264,Marge,now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives.
64363,Marge,"i am! the female tiger woods of the nineteen-thirties, babe didrikson zaharias."
57748,Marge,"what's the matter, bart? weren't you happy with him?"
63341,Marge,okay. if you pretend to be our chauffeur at my high school reunion.
55894,Marge,"bart, i'm going to get you..."
62832,Marge,he's one of bart's friends.
60190,Marge,"oh, my goodness..."
65764,Marge,maybe we'd better go.
56292,Marge,"homer, homer!"
61806,Marge,"in the ovenfresh bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. so i'm entering my dessert dogs!"
58892,Marge,ooh...
59035,Marge,this is so much nicer than the kwik-e-mart.
56070,Marge,what?!
67454,Marge,"now, just a minute."
67558,Marge,no. i'm sorry about the dinners. i'll make up for it tomorrow night.
64267,Marge,henry the fifth... titus andronicus...
62858,Marge,i know what the sun is.
58211,Marge,no fires.
58789,Marge,"oh, i'll make the whole thing."
55300,Marge,homer?
67286,Marge,"hmmm, very... thorough."
54783,Marge,did you make any money?
65980,Marge,let me guess... you need a field trip mom?
63283,Marge,i can't fill out that clipboard. i... don't have email.
58278,Marge,why all the black?
67423,Marge,"i hope you'll space out the tubs this year, homer."
59146,Marge,oh.
60601,Marge,"oh. well, when homer does something wrong, i write a list of ways he can make it up to me. then i shred the list and put it in his food."
57340,Marge,homer! you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
65131,Marge,how are you going to find him?
64214,Marge,please just stay there till bart graduates high school.
61448,Marge,"in 1804, president jefferson..."
59515,Marge,owww.
62737,Marge,how was that?
66501,Marge,phoo! you two don't know what a rough marriage is.
55121,Marge,"homer, i can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
66711,Marge,i want so much to believe you.
57501,Marge,"no, homie, wait!"
67755,Marge,"are you sure you want to do this, homer? it doesn't look friendly."
56665,Marge,"money problems? homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
57715,Marge,all right.
63573,Marge,love ya.
61031,Marge,what's that ruckus?
58896,Marge,"what is it, honey?"
55586,Marge,"but i think i'm allergic to seafood. the last time i ate shrimp, my throat closed up and i went into convulsions."
55699,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
57594,Marge,"homie, maybe we should go inside."
66265,Marge,"well, they don't grow on trees."
65488,Marge,ned and edna married?
56367,Marge,"see kids, that's what i meant by romance."
63393,Marge,"homer, can you breathe?!"
64957,Marge,"need some coolin' down, hot stuff?"
62600,Marge,it's obvious why bob is a vaunted pillar of your community.
66359,Marge,"well, i hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. i don't care for how it circles the cat."
64712,Marge,"no appetite, honey?"
66458,Marge,"homie, what happened?"
63723,Marge,i'm sorry i'm so emotional.
63514,Marge,maggie's completely independent.
63598,Marge,no peeking. i'm wai-ting.
55307,Marge,"selma, i've never seen you so happy. giggling like a schoolgirl."
63562,Marge,"well this mom is not going to say bug-eye. i mean, goodbye."
67725,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
58528,Marge,"while i deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?"
67069,Marge,"used, isn't it?"
66792,Marge,so what do we do?
60909,Marge,"not so fast, busboy!"
57491,Marge,i'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
63649,Marge,"oh tivo remote, you've changed my life."
55629,Marge,"uh, they had 30 sons and 30 daughters."
65692,Marge,milhouse?!
60402,Marge,"no way, no how! i'll get used to the snoring, just like i got used to saying ""courtney cox-arquette""."
62963,Marge,cut that out!
59175,Marge,shut up! shut up! shut up!
67571,Marge,so much needless brutality. i don't know if i'm having any impact at all.
67816,Marge,"you see. now that's a sewing finger, honey."
63579,Marge,how could you not tell me you were an assassin?
62313,Marge,"well, homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?"
64979,Marge,but you said going from blue to gray was empowering.
59265,Marge,uh... no thanks.
57336,Marge,you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
58871,Marge,that's your hat!
56690,Marge,i'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. did you know there are over six hundred critics on tv and leonard maltin is the best looking of them all?
65280,Marge,"cousin kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
61060,Marge,"well, i love you, of course. but a lot of things you do still drive me crazy."
61681,Marge,you've been to space.
67284,Marge,mmm-hmm.
66613,Marge,no!
64069,Marge,our house is up to code.
61726,Marge,i wish there was some way i could believe that.
60594,Marge,"i keep telling you. off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. but if we remind apu and manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems."
60536,Marge,"oh, you two! we're eating genetically modified vegetables! look how big they are."
65690,Marge,fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze.
62361,Marge,i guess i'd better tell them i'm coming home.
56999,Marge,con: you're setting a bad example for the children.
56817,Marge,no.
57157,Marge,"well, we're not."
65011,Marge,"ooh, a pen from the milwaukee hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s!"
57408,Marge,"what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?"
59709,Marge,maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
60645,Marge,mrs. bellamy?
58165,Marge,i think you move like a young baryshnikov!
57850,Marge,"well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
61753,Marge,"okay, kids show off your pipes..."
67078,Marge,the boys certainly are taking a long time. i hope maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
59058,Marge,we were robbed?!
57107,Marge,"now, i know you love video games, and i asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
62472,Marge,david is so helpful...
54953,Marge,homer...
57096,Marge,we're almost finished. there's just a little bit of green left.
61175,Marge,let's admire nelson's love of nature.
65104,Marge,that wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
63492,Marge,"okay maggie, say your goodnights."
57948,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
59831,Marge,i read in the daily fourth gradian that you need someone to paint a mural.
54781,Marge,the poor boy is so desperate. he wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
55839,Marge,shhhh.
57642,Marge,i do.
58236,Marge,what do you have to say about the leader now? hunh? hunh?
65884,Marge,interesting. except you missed one thing.
58749,Marge,another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
55157,Marge,homer! if maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.
57714,Marge,no! no more drinking! i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
59860,Marge,and it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
56258,Marge,"oh my. i'm very flattered, but i'm not really interested."
65726,Marge,how can you call yourself a christian?
60343,Marge,it seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools.
62280,Marge,"oh. i see. well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause i'm not driving you."
63400,Marge,you give that to me!
64781,Marge,we killed an innocent man. we're murderers! murderers!
63704,Marge,"all right! this is a story of two dogs with a love so strong, no hose could separate them. i call it shady and the vamp..."
60758,Marge,"homie! oooo, homie... hey, what happened?"
58449,Marge,"y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
64280,Marge,no. i lost.
65353,Marge,homer! that is not banishment-hearing behavior!
62031,Marge,"time for homer's half-time show. get ready, frank."
57297,Marge,"honey, you'll make plenty of friends. all you have to do is be yourself."
67091,Marge,"let's go, homer."
55069,Marge,would you mind if i took it off now? the oil is burning my finger.
58011,Marge,how can you treat him that way? don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
61076,Marge,"homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
63344,Marge,"homer, stop that."
61458,Marge,"as a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century europe..."
57982,Marge,"until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. come on, kids."
57469,Marge,what?
56257,Marge,funny... the way everything reminds me of homer.
54609,Marge,"homer, your music is so angry and bitter."
63699,Marge,i can't wait to see my valentine's day surprise!
66514,Marge,ooh! game night?
65695,Marge,fine. just stay here and hold down the fort.
60990,Marge,"oh, what a magical evening. the moonlight, the music, the water..."
60710,Marge,rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!
66652,Marge,get the first aid kit!
59357,Marge,i tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
56261,Marge,"homer, what happened to you?"
61491,Marge,all our children are smart. some are just smarter than the others.
55726,Marge,mr. hutz!
64827,Marge,why not?
64971,Marge,"i'm okay, i'm okay."
56898,Marge,no. we can't start thinking that way about our own family members. suspicion could tear us apart.
66292,Marge,homer! what are you doing out of prison? you have to go back and give yourself up.
58057,Marge,i'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
55745,Marge,i can't. the beans'll burn.
57532,Marge,have you been drinking?
57592,Marge,"there, that's the last one."
56737,Marge,"""she's the fastest..."" homer, i don't think that means necessarily..."
56688,Marge,yes!
62338,Marge,i just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.
67179,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
64316,Marge,"if i'm gonna open a can of whup-tushy, i'd better get in shape, with some rhythmic gymnastics!"
60439,Marge,it's so clean and bland. i'm home!
65901,Marge,why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
58210,Marge,no fires!
63826,Marge,"hmm, it smells like concerts!"
65879,Marge,they sure are getting along.
60426,Marge,"but, homer..."
64681,Marge,"moe's is closed, huh?"
56478,Marge,no. i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
64040,Marge,yeah!
65917,Marge,this is not putting me in the mood!
56965,Marge,"bart, no!"
61248,Marge,"lisa, you look so successful. like you're the wife of a businessman."
55751,Marge,lisa.
57450,Marge,so who wants to play a game? hmm? hmm? hmm?
66397,Marge,don't call me a gal. makes me feel like i'm your mother.
59448,Marge,"kids, would you like a balloon?"
66181,Marge,"i can't believe i'm saying this, but i'm starting to regret saying yolo."
64807,Marge,what's so wrong with me?
58906,Marge,mmm.
54663,Marge,i know who i'm in love with.
59885,Marge,"oh, homey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings."
67219,Marge,"stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the rusty barnacle."
57164,Marge,"oh, don't thank me. thank my beautiful new suit."
58087,Marge,"well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
58686,Marge,look out! behind you!
55470,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad to hear you say that."
66423,Marge,kirk and luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
59682,Marge,"oh, that's too bad."
66957,Marge,"bart, i feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... what's that word where you encourage something to grow?"
63166,Marge,"the only house i'm interested in is my own, which you defiled for eleven hellish months. but now i've learned to say ""no!"" no to your mooching! no to your manipulation! and a big fat no to the kingsbridge school district!"
56801,Marge,"ah, i think i'm okay. it was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
62240,Marge,i see ray too.
62692,Marge,"...uh, hmm, let's see, uh just a second uhh... oh, yeah sure, i'd be happy to baby-sit for rod and todd."
57217,Marge,simpson! lie down!
61992,Marge,"oh, i'm too tired to talk."
55263,Marge,you can pet the cat.
65250,Marge,"yours, homie. i'm always on yours."
60143,Marge,"no. no, there it is!"
57228,Marge,no. the b-u-m.
67523,Marge,a dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...
66144,Marge,"well, you are the best this circus has to offer..."
64883,Marge,"so, this stuff will just shampoo out, huh?"
66811,Marge,"so what brings you to springfield, mr. musk?"
66389,Marge,no kennels!
55210,Marge,"children, that's not very nice."
65489,Marge,"congratulations, you two! we're so, so happy for you!"
55056,Marge,did you get the job?
59979,Marge,"ooh, look, everybody!"
58743,Marge,it's vincent price! i thought he was dead.
63301,Marge,face: other.
67246,Marge,principal skinner!
63261,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day."
56557,Marge,wait. i'm remembering something...
66762,Marge,where is this party?!
64470,Marge,you like potato...
67318,Marge,"homer, you look just like a little boy."
66822,Marge,get up!
66565,Marge,"no, no, it's a big thing."
66171,Marge,can we focus on my son? up in the sky?
63637,Marge,what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate?
66367,Marge,"look, i'm really not comfortable talking about s-e-x with k-i-d-s."
61440,Marge,"oh, homie! you're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book."
66502,Marge,"look, life's tough. it's hard to make it through. the only way i know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it."
57460,Marge,you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
63459,Marge,"well, where should we go for brunch?"
63333,Marge,"oh, yeah, that's really something."
57551,Marge,it would be nice to beat those women at their own game. maybe i should look into a franchise.
63519,Marge,he hasn't been home in four days.
62485,Marge,"lisa, do you think you could check on your father?"
56354,Marge,"well, kids, i tried. maybe you're right."
58046,Marge,well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
64469,Marge,oh my god!
58736,Marge,"well, what are we waiting for?"
62025,Marge,"ned, there's more to the bible than blood and gore."
60192,Marge,you're not going to believe it. that paper towel lumberjack is coming here! for dinner! tonight!
56359,Marge,"take me home, artie."
57172,Marge,"...i've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
60499,Marge,"no, last week they became vertiqual."
65522,Marge,lisa snuck out.
64277,Marge,where every child was free to follow their dream. because nothing is... maggie! get away from there!
62023,Marge,oh my. ned's next movie seems even bloodier than the last one.
57534,Marge,good doggy. good doggy!
55380,Marge,"oh, i'm going to miss this."
62480,Marge,done and done!
54621,Marge,"oh my god, you're a junkie!"
66316,Marge,what did i say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
58366,Marge,"homer, this has gone far enough. will you please just apologize to the garbage men?"
67647,Marge,"well, maybe lisa's right. tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner."
55564,Marge,"but, where does it go?"
57829,Marge,"you know homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
57048,Marge,"don't touch those yet. they're very, very hot."
65812,Marge,"we can do without tv for a day! we're taking maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two."
59215,Marge,is that plutonium on your gums?
58539,Marge,what are those cats doing behind you?
65719,Marge,survive what?
61705,Marge,your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
66781,Marge,how was your day?
66215,Marge,where is he?
64482,Marge,i've been training all my life. i once swept red wine off a white carpet.
61203,Marge,"thank you, selma."
58456,Marge,"homer, a hand!"
60155,Marge,"what are you reading, homie?"
64727,Marge,"oh, i didn't realize..."
66193,Marge,that's not helping.
58110,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're okay. and i have something to tell you..."
66563,Marge,sometimes the language on these gets a little b-l-u-e.
66691,Marge,i am so pleased to meet you.
57707,Marge,"oh my god, you walked into the fountain! get out of the fountain!"
60824,Marge,what position is this?
64055,Marge,i worked so hard to make this house into a home. and now somebody else is just going to take it.
59106,Marge,homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
57277,Marge,"""dear parents. due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. by reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
58471,Marge,so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
65443,Marge,"care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
63102,Marge,"oh, stop. just stop. you don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!"
61128,Marge,i guess i'll have to do all your driving chores. that's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
60297,Marge,look at all the empty calories.
63606,Marge,then go to moe's!
64009,Marge,"bart simpson, age three."
56056,Marge,"in honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of nevada?"
60474,Marge,he is your dad.
59111,Marge,ooh!
67775,Marge,he should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
57751,Marge,"well, i think it's a great idea."
58422,Marge,"no, no, no, i have my part in this, too, um..."
66341,Marge,"hello, homie! dinner's almost ready! pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
67392,Marge,"homer, all these flies."
56220,Marge,"well, i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
57583,Marge,"hey, what's going on?"
58109,Marge,hello? anyone home?
63744,Marge,uh-oh.
67249,Marge,deportation! you mean kick bart out of the country?
66411,Marge,"well, they all have their charms..."
56253,Marge,get out!
56983,Marge,we better call ned. he has a ladder.
63578,Marge,you're a killer for hire!
66654,Marge,"if you'll just give me back my original investment, i'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries."
54716,Marge,"i know what homer's thinking. he's thinking that he really wants a baby now. so this should be the time, ironically, that i'll change my mind and not want one. well, no way! i want one more than ever!"
57611,Marge,it's my hair. excuse me.
64041,Marge,free at last! free at last!
63636,Marge,let me get a good look at you!
55125,Marge,"i promise i will get mad, because i always do when you make me promise i won't."
60736,Marge,"well, i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it."
59585,Marge,that was a movie.
67001,Marge,"homer, this is our house."
56572,Marge,oh dear.
55495,Marge,"oh, well, isn't that... whoa!"
65382,Marge,i can see how this show might not be to his liking.
61809,Marge,"well, open it, open it, open it!"
60976,Marge,"okay, champ. i before e, except after c."
63403,Marge,pink frosting fixes everything!
58185,Marge,"well, well, well..."
58302,Marge,is that normal?
56978,Marge,it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
66829,Marge,restore! restore!
62606,Marge,that's sideshow bob!
57986,Marge,no you're not. he's really not.
66893,Marge,"if we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt homer!"
57644,Marge,mmm... okay. just be careful.
64358,Marge,homer?! does this mean you still love me?
59972,Marge,"homer, no! those were made in the sixties."
64154,Marge,just what i always wanted.
61896,Marge,chloe sure turned out successful.
67360,Marge,"i love you, homer."
65977,Marge,"the suit wasn't magic, moe. don't you know the story of dumbo the elephant?"
63504,Marge,"did you hear that, maggie-wags? you're a queen!"
60345,Marge,"you know, tomorrow is the annual springfield formal event. we weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
64058,Marge,ned! you bought our house? why?
66313,Marge,"homer simpson, this was your doing. and i want you to fix it!"
62387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now."
63371,Marge,"well, uh..."
64747,Marge,what about bart's feelings?
56991,Marge,have you lost your mind?! have you thought about your health?... or your appearance?
57222,Marge,"cheer up, homie."
63722,Marge,"i didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night..."
60365,Marge,"good, good, that feels good."
61242,Marge,bet... system... betting system! god is telling me to gamble!
67561,Marge,what do we want?
63187,Marge,three years is a long ways away.
61972,Marge,i'm here protecting our investment. i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
56802,Marge,oh for crying out loud...
61931,Marge,"homer, we've gotta get lisa!"
67134,Marge,"homer, i'm keeping the ball. for myself."
56073,Marge,what happened here?
55755,Marge,"lisa, the only way you'll lick this is one day at a time. if you can make it till midnight without calling the corey line, you'll know you've beaten it forever."
64383,Marge,nuzzle... neck. with pleasure!
54876,Marge,"homer, what did you find out?"
65507,Marge,"bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
59815,Marge,"i don't see any anger. i see a yearning for freedom... um, do you have a title?"
60372,Marge,aww...
55949,Marge,"lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. don't worry, honey, the scary part's over."
65915,Marge,it's a snuggle dungeon!
63894,Marge,we were gone for two weeks!
54651,Marge,no you don't!
62678,Marge,"homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?"
64697,Marge,golf it is.
56165,Marge,bart!!!
58893,Marge,"homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!"
58993,Marge,a claes oldenburg. he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture.
63958,Marge,"homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! it's in us! now take my hand!"
60679,Marge,"homie, you've been such a sweetheart today. let's go upstairs and..."
59285,Marge,"just put it on my sewing pile. okay, i'm doing another load of bandanas!"
58827,Marge,what in the world?
67010,Marge,i don't know...
60800,Marge,i'll just take these tampons.
60512,Marge,"we're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service."
54978,Marge,"homer, you made that up. question two: ""who is your son's hero?"""
67173,Marge,homer... homer.
60702,Marge,that explains that.
67902,Marge,"homer, please."
58386,Marge,"homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. food. i mean, food."
59250,Marge,you don't want something that overshadows the pencils.
57844,Marge,i certainly hope so! that's better.
57146,Marge,"really? you like it? oh, i'd love to wear this someplace special."
65345,Marge,homie! what if that was the last thing you ever said?
61685,Marge,how about a bite of the world's biggest brussels sprout?
60494,Marge,"joan, renounce your faith! save yourself!"
67163,Marge,"oh, dear, i didn't realize there was so much to this game. what do you charge for lessons?"
60267,Marge,stop fighting!
54773,Marge,we're here!
56776,Marge,"ah, here you go, precious. now go off with your friends."
62771,Marge,"yeah, whatever."
66845,Marge,looks like this is all me.
64275,Marge,her building became one of the wonders of the world.
58919,Marge,"good-bye, homer."
65883,Marge,splatter?
58659,Marge,and 40 percent more rootin' tootin'!
55915,Marge,if you're going for a ride i'd like you to take bart and lisa.
61354,Marge,"no, the march primary."
58445,Marge,"hm, something's not right. does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
56443,Marge,"time for church, bart. i bet your little friend jessica will be there."
65271,Marge,"sweetie, i've been waiting to hear you say that for so long. although you could've waited till morning..."
58476,Marge,with cans of grease?
67726,Marge,"artie, please!"
63380,Marge,maybe we should split up.
63909,Marge,"i made it with cheetos, just like you like it. if the sauce is too thick, i can add more root beer."
57576,Marge,"i was wrong to have a dream. wrong as usual. i mean, if you're nothing special, why kid yourself?"
65218,Marge,eat deconstructed apple pie!
58373,Marge,"good god, homer! you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trash-hole."
62835,Marge,"goodbye, mr. simpson."
65241,Marge,i know! and i don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. and i don't really want him to do that.
59720,Marge,"oh, well, that's good... oh."
65307,Marge,i was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. better sort those out.
63207,Marge,"you spent so much time plotting your revenge, you lost everything that really mattered. come on, kids."
57070,Marge,we're getting our christmas picture taken.
60308,Marge,"if you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."
62071,Marge,"i just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married."
60431,Marge,every four years.
56444,Marge,thirty cents off shake 'n bake. homer!
65760,Marge,"homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. the kids could end up wards of the state."
63127,Marge,we'll give you a ride.
63735,Marge,"there were so many things i wanted to do in life that i never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. but the thing i really wanted to be, ever since i was little, was a ballerina!"
61163,Marge,what?!
65530,Marge,just once i'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good.
62776,Marge,maybe homer brush teeth first...
61429,Marge,oh that's wonderful. and the characters didn't bother you at all?
66609,Marge,uh-huh!
62736,Marge,i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it.
64451,Marge,start the joke!
58586,Marge,"there i was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, i was abducted by aliens."
65813,Marge,"homer, a little help?"
54844,Marge,"how's it going, honey?"
60268,Marge,i've been prying them apart since before you were born!
54829,Marge,i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
58121,Marge,bart! put down that yellow sweater! nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.
60577,Marge,okay.
64873,Marge,even mac davis himself couldn't save this christmas.
61303,Marge,you and lisa better go find homes for these puppies -- and don't just dump them all off on some crazy lady.
57153,Marge,"bart, comb your hair. homer, i don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
67500,Marge,"oh, my special little guy! we were so worried!"
55718,Marge,"oh homer, quit pouting."
62269,Marge,"don't worry about the competition, sweetie. whenever i enter a contest i tell myself i'm going to win because, sometimes, if you believe hard enough, god cuts you a break. after all, he works for us. our prayers pay his salary."
63376,Marge,this winning cornucopia is magnificent.
56124,Marge,"honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? the keebler people were very upset..."
61321,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you? christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself."
61922,Marge,how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility?
61417,Marge,what do you know? it is!
61072,Marge,just go. and take your stupid lhasa apso with you.
60604,Marge,"look lisa, there's an opening."
62920,Marge,"homer, please."
58565,Marge,"ooooh-woo! wow. if your fly weren't open, you'd look just like roger moore."
57774,Marge,but you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
57221,Marge,"okay. maybe everything's all right. maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. if he's alive."
55634,Marge,"hear that, bart? you're going to have a little brother or sister to play with!"
65211,Marge,um... i don't know. probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts.
64606,Marge,"bart simpson, are you a drug-o?"
63169,Marge,we're not gonna make it!
57213,Marge,sor-ry. next time get your own darned corn.
66130,Marge,amen.
65573,Marge,"...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! excuse me."
65623,Marge,"homer, she's married to your dad!"
64158,Marge,"here's the score, mister:"
65610,Marge,"you know, i always send the theater manager a check the next day."
59050,Marge,"homer, i've never seen this side of you! but i like it..."
56362,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
63418,Marge,it won't start!
58079,Marge,"excuse me, mr. szyslak, have you ever considered selling your home?"
58370,Marge,who can take this diaper?
54620,Marge,"oh no, narcotics!"
56262,Marge,"oh, here, let me help you."
59638,Marge,"oh, save it for your next book, you little snitch!"
61985,Marge,"homer, moe and i are just work friends. you and i are... marriage friends."
67757,Marge,"lisa, i brought you some lemonade for your protest."
67538,Marge,i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i'm going to write a letter.
66432,Marge,"luann, i hope we're still on thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops."
54708,Marge,this sure beats slaving over a hot stove!
66204,Marge,again? i was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
56319,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
58126,Marge,we were robbed?
58901,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, i need some gossip, here! where is everybody? does this town shut down at 5 o'clock?"
63501,Marge,"ooo, edu-loving!"
59679,Marge,"mmmm, these stigmuffins are to die for!"
64817,Marge,awww.
65617,Marge,grampa's army footlocker! i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
60005,Marge,you can't have a brownie. period.
66119,Marge,did you pack everything you need?
65203,Marge,d'artagnan wasn't a musketeer! he only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
56355,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
56413,Marge,"homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
66904,Marge,"sorry, excuse us. pardon me..."
58762,Marge,who's trent steel?
57502,Marge,"all right, i was trying to keep it from you, but i had a good reason. every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. remember last year?"
55135,Marge,one at a time! one at a time!
60335,Marge,"homer, you're going to get in trouble."
56105,Marge,"if he wants to make it up to you so badly, i think you should let him."
63848,Marge,how could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
63567,Marge,"""you chat up the guard at the gate, while i knife the guard behind me."" i can't do that, dwight."
56707,Marge,all right. it's time to vote for the grand prize.
66309,Marge,"kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
58265,Marge,"oh, yes! as long as it's tasteful... and never at someone, or with... and not..."
62700,Marge,i'll help you.
64347,Marge,he what?!
62990,Marge,why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
63055,Marge,i think she just answers their phone...
58972,Marge,"you know, homie, a lot of men use their saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
55330,Marge,what conversation?
56622,Marge,boy discovers comet.
61511,Marge,how do we get out?
54980,Marge,what are your son's hobbies?
62043,Marge,"ooh, what a horrible thing to say to a mother."
61138,Marge,stop saying things!
60078,Marge,uh... hello.
65519,Marge,i never have any idea what to do for lisa. to be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument i don't really care for. it's so hard.
64950,Marge,she doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair.
61266,Marge,do you understand any part of what you just said?
58360,Marge,and the school nurse says bart has the plague.
64670,Marge,"but that's impossible! if you're the real walt warren, who's taking our son to the baseball game right now?"
59289,Marge,and you still don't...
62340,Marge,"it wasn't a fair fight! your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting cinemax."
55937,Marge,"it's an ending, that's enough."
64570,Marge,but we insist on paying our own way.
57496,Marge,the man who lived next door until his house blew down.
63124,Marge,"come on, homer, let's get the kids out of here. homer?"
57635,Marge,nope.
56260,Marge,"here's your water, moe."
64386,Marge,last night was the making it up to me! the most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
64327,Marge,tap out! don't make me break your arm!
63871,Marge,"okay, here goes. bart, i have something for you!"
59297,Marge,"and when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
61883,Marge,uh-huh.
55723,Marge,what are you kids playing?
61617,Marge,"oh, passion's for teens and immigrants. i'm just glad to have someone to look at when i wake up in the morning."
60822,Marge,kent brockman?!
58958,Marge,"well, it is a sin to waste food..."
61525,Marge,artie ziff! why are you living in our attic?
63077,Marge,"homer, don't drink and drive!"
58890,Marge,it's just until we pay off daddy's desecration of a priceless artifact. i thought i'd never have to say that again.
60956,Marge,"bart, you're suing us?!"
57123,Marge,why don't you read something?
54947,Marge,i am very upset with you.
67288,Marge,"i know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along."
55993,Marge,"beautiful, huh? homer and i used to come up here on dates."
56331,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
57673,Marge,"oh, geez louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. john's a witty, urbane person."
67452,Marge,"well, he's not perfect, but he is very..."
65737,Marge,"""burly paper towels, burlyville, minnesota. dear sir or madam: your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels. but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three. i'm returning the extra towel, unused..."""
60428,Marge,"and our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter."
55494,Marge,what's he saying?
64787,Marge,dinner is served. i tried to make what homer said you liked.
61351,Marge,then wait in the shadows!
55158,Marge,"goodbye, homie."
56531,Marge,"well, everybody's got a fear of something."
60804,Marge,if you just...
56678,Marge,but i like to make you breakfast.
60113,Marge,that's not good for the clock.
62824,Marge,all this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. women are as smart as men.
57058,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
65814,Marge,"instead of watching tv, we can read children's books written by tv stars!"
62610,Marge,christmas is a family day
57475,Marge,or swindling our neighbors.
57203,Marge,"yes, dear. in your mind."
60808,Marge,"bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?"
63247,Marge,'you look at that paneling -- i feel like i'm back in wooden times!
58929,Marge,just do it.
58593,Marge,i can't believe it. jerry springer didn't solve our conflict.
56656,Marge,"our countries may have their differences, but as human beings i think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent."
60062,Marge,"excuse me, hobo. can you play something a little less unnerving?"
62793,Marge,red lobster?
56948,Marge,an alligator with sunglasses? now i've seen everything!
54831,Marge,crazy house!
57857,Marge,"homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
63809,Marge,thank god they're not jeering at us anymore.
60020,Marge,isn't there anything you can do?
55904,Marge,"homer, this is serious."
62598,Marge,no wine for her -- she's only eight!
60861,Marge,"it looks like a purse, that's why i bought it, but it's really a--"
59160,Marge,"well, i'm not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. from now on it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned ritalin!"
62910,Marge,"well, i'm so glad there's a show we women can enjoy!"
63468,Marge,"oh my god! oh my god! quick, everyone put on their long faces!"
59802,Marge,"oh, nothing... how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison?"
58570,Marge,"sorry, but if i let you watch one of these gruesome halloween cartoons, i'd be a pretty lousy mother."
59126,Marge,"honey, if you don't want to take the medicine, we won't force you."
60396,Marge,"look, it's great to see you, but you should know i'm happily married."
66218,Marge,so this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
64138,Marge,"okay, okay, everyone back off! i want to see myself."
59096,Marge,who cares? mel gibson!
59098,Marge,"besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. people magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... homer, let's make love!"
65903,Marge,from the gas station?
55498,Marge,"oh hi, homie."
65107,Marge,no! you should never raise your hand to a child. just leave the crust on their sandwiches. they'll get the message.
65343,Marge,i feel kinda silly i walked all the way out here. you're just fine. you always are.
62157,Marge,"we're not quite there yet, but we've opened up a dialogue!"
62128,Marge,"oh honey, i know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
56986,Marge,"bart, what happened?!"
61802,Marge,and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen?
58015,Marge,he's doing what he thinks is best...
60723,Marge,would you like some ice cream with that?
63406,Marge,"raisin cake! who wants raisin cake? don't worry, it's not too moist!"
57835,Marge,"inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?"
56890,Marge,the police already have a suspect. it's mr. smithers.
64272,Marge,"but her teacher, mr. ellsworth toohey, wanted every child to conform."
57288,Marge,oh. here we go.
56772,Marge,exhausting. it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map.
56987,Marge,"oh, homie..."
64380,Marge,"well, i brought a few items to make our night extra-special. massage oil..."
67000,Marge,they're having a conversation. they actually enjoy talking to each other.
65124,Marge,"well, if anyone saves my homie's life, they get a free meal. which actually comes up about once a week."
61549,Marge,"don't tell mama what mama don't like. come here, you big lug!"
63288,Marge,"six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. wow! and all this time i thought ""googling yourself"" meant the other thing."
63435,Marge,where's the hammer?!
66183,Marge,marge simpson! it's so nice to meet a friend homer met through the mail who isn't a sea monkey!
64100,Marge,if i'm more relaxed i'll be a better mom! can we? can we?
56616,Marge,that's what really happened.
58612,Marge,hey!
57057,Marge,but we did win!
64535,Marge,"dear lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that i am right as usual."
67551,Marge,but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four.
65568,Marge,and what's that smell?
67018,Marge,"homer, how wonderful. our first pleasant surprise."
63136,Marge,i guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
57970,Marge,"no! no one's using this gun. the tv said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder."
62924,Marge,"don't worry lisa, i've got the answer to your problems right here."
65599,Marge,i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
67126,Marge,"whoa... hmmm. thank you, bart."
62944,Marge,"uh, i-i think what homer means is, why don't you tell us what each of you feels is the problem."
65722,Marge,the end of the world as we know it?
54911,Marge,look everybody! my purse exploded!
66365,Marge,"bake sale -- taken... candle snuffing -- taken... baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support -- everything's taken! all that's left is..."
56889,Marge,i don't think we'll ever know who did this. everyone in town's a suspect.
57029,Marge,five tires?! am i seeing things?
63431,Marge,yay!
64047,Marge,oh my god! oh my god! we're totally liable!
54636,Marge,"three to five, right?"
61362,Marge,i guess no one gives a damn about the american family anymore.
59398,Marge,i didn't say they couldn't. i said you shouldn't.
57891,Marge,"oh, now be fair, edna. i liked armin tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt. skinner."
58105,Marge,"no, no. no tricks. it was salesmanship, that's all."
59835,Marge,farm couple?!
65262,Marge,yup!
58552,Marge,"ohhh, oh, honey. oh, come here."
55926,Marge,come on dear. it's time to go.
63824,Marge,"homer, look what i found with your mother's things."
58885,Marge,you agreed to spend one saturday a month doing something with the kids.
54758,Marge,"he blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
60341,Marge,"well, let's see... i was in the kitchen, counting the corncobs on the curtains..."
56051,Marge,"good news, honey. two weeks are up. you don't have to wear your glasses anymore. and your scalp and posture seem fine."
55227,Marge,"lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. but they don't always know what they're talking about."
55122,Marge,"hmm, i guess so."
58152,Marge,good lord!
61002,Marge,why is that jet flying so close to our house?
63282,Marge,"well, at least it got made."
61570,Marge,i don't know what to believe anymore.
65771,Marge,that's moe and a bag of garbage.
64918,Marge,"and anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? they went to the beach every day!"
60621,Marge,"...homer's family needs him too, and that's that."
62411,Marge,"homer, we're not really playing."
60329,Marge,"oh, all right. but take maggie with you."
64623,Marge,"oooh, he sounds just like paddington bear!"
64465,Marge,"well, i kind of got a clue when i heard that ""ballooning safety"" video."
58641,Marge,why don't you play with one of bart's video games instead? hugh downs says they're the latest craze.
63772,Marge,my body wash is estée lauder...
63721,Marge,i think he's been sneakering on his diet.
61567,Marge,are we home yet?
64776,Marge,now!
66545,Marge,"right. right, nothing."
56201,Marge,it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death. those quimby children are so wild and rich. i hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
61847,Marge,plus your school-yard chums: martin and ralph!
57730,Marge,krabappel?
66940,Marge,"this is the best gift of all, homer."
63630,Marge,what's gotten into you?
62847,Marge,two.
55093,Marge,"well, why don't you get it?"
64586,Marge,and just what might that be?
59887,Marge,it's for charity -- it benefits victims of balcony collapse.
60540,Marge,go away! go away!
64959,Marge,"well, thank you."
64084,Marge,hm. you're not usually this greedy.
66816,Marge,it's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.
54750,Marge,"well, i was wondering. do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? i wouldn't ask, except i'm desperate."
66326,Marge,"well, i'm not happy with you."
56382,Marge,"when do you show the consequences? on tv, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. but in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
65619,Marge,the place that changed my life?
60351,Marge,"mm, thank you."
63273,Marge,and they pay big money for photos.
64321,Marge,is there someone in there?
66275,Marge,the pudding will be jell-o.
57785,Marge,"oh. well, it's time to start telling the truth. now, when i have to tell my husband the truth, i cook him a big delicious dinner. by the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what i have to say."
56325,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
63597,Marge,you don't know what color my eyes are?
61965,Marge,what's going on here?
65099,Marge,this looks like it's from a wind-up toy.
65169,Marge,"i'm sorry, gang. i blew it."
64210,Marge,thank you!
59689,Marge,"here's a headline for jay. ""ketchup truck hits hamburger stand."""
66111,Marge,drama! drama!
67356,Marge,he sounds good. hire him.
60355,Marge,"and before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything i say."
67113,Marge,a little?
55234,Marge,"homer, we're on a tight budget here. promise me you won't get carried away."
64281,Marge,"oh, homie... take your shirt off again."
61927,Marge,shiner be gone.
61493,Marge,"look at these courses you'll be taking. ""advanced peek-a-boo""."
62881,Marge,i'm sorry you have to leave. but i just can't think of another way.
65359,Marge,i don't think this place is so great.
64847,Marge,"sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. indiana jones had snakes, the grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, i'm not crazy about opossums."
63914,Marge,scrubbing you / is easy 'cause you've been pre-rinsed / and when you're covered with goo / that's when i'm scrubbing you! / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub...
55401,Marge,maybe i should have taken a nice calligraphy class.
66448,Marge,eu amo o brasil!
59822,Marge,two more bites.
61910,Marge,that's ridiculous. no one's bowl smells... it's like christmas in aspen.
62125,Marge,no more directory assistance! it's not free!
58289,Marge,"homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!"
67951,Marge,the biggest change for me over the last eight years? that's gotta be homer!
65128,Marge,i don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
55733,Marge,"homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you should throw it away."
56480,Marge,i'm sure it'll turn up. take the baby-sitter home now. she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
61329,Marge,"look, maggie. a show for babies."
63362,Marge,"homer, i think you dominoed this."
67630,Marge,"i suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars."
60421,Marge,unless...
61942,Marge,"this is marge simpson, reporting from lake placid where the miracle on ice never happened."
58590,Marge,"nothing, nothing."
61397,Marge,i know -- i got your message.
64589,Marge,yes! enjoy!
66703,Marge,i'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
67058,Marge,"ah, that's my girl."
56448,Marge,we really shouldn't have let them do this. it can't be helping his self esteem.
58751,Marge,no dating.
62354,Marge,"how could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!"
63999,Marge,"great! here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--"
56107,Marge,"lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
66478,Marge,"homer, could you come with me for a minute?"
66122,Marge,you're talking about my husband!
58836,Marge,i don't think you're gay. i just have to do my grocery shopping. now please gimme my keys.
57818,Marge,"homer, why aren't you at work?"
65255,Marge,"isn't that just a rip-off of ""the honeymooners?"""
56127,Marge,"bart, i told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
55640,Marge,"that afternoon, we left bart with my sisters and went househunting."
64692,Marge,homie! i thought you were at that sports bar.
61366,Marge,three!
62935,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
61918,Marge,"well, i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons. where's the award for that?"
67020,Marge,"oh, homer... we love you."
61074,Marge,bart! that's not right.
62647,Marge,uhh... yeah!
63074,Marge,dear pus bag...
66302,Marge,homie...
64269,Marge,"ooo, ""the fountainhead."""
56360,Marge,"yeah, right."
64236,Marge,my daughter's here for her first mani-pedi.
67149,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
56872,Marge,i choose to take that literally.
65461,Marge,"last week that steward brought me extra shampoo... he called me ""lovely lady."""
63486,Marge,"chief, i think we should cancel the performance."
60452,Marge,"well, i think westerns are due for a comeback."
60250,Marge,"lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
67234,Marge,homer! you don't even know why you're apologizing.
60316,Marge,i'm filing a class action lawsuit against big sugar. would you like to give a deposition?
65735,Marge,"excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school."
56866,Marge,"well, i am just shocked by this whole family. whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?"
63947,Marge,"homie, what's taking so long?"
58630,Marge,"oh my goodness! homer, get her out of there!"
63782,Marge,every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs! i want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial!
60183,Marge,"ooo, burly, you're insatiable."
54817,Marge,"well then, i guess the moral is, ""no good deed goes unrewarded."""
55450,Marge,it's church. you have to go.
63407,Marge,i gave you ten dollars.
66700,Marge,"how was your first day at school, bart?"
56347,Marge,it all started on an outing for dinner...
67850,Marge,"now homer, you do have big bones."
61435,Marge,you told me you liked it! you didn't read it at all! you lied to me!
62838,Marge,"""a highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax."" but how could i have won? i don't subscribe to this periodical."
65892,Marge,"when god rested on the seventh day, did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed?"
64027,Marge,"forget it, marge. a girl like you could never land a homer simpson."
61302,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it!
63000,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, bart."
62857,Marge,why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
60954,Marge,"bart, the larynx is not a plaything."
58784,Marge,"he's also thankful for your bounty, lord."
61189,Marge,"no, there were twelve."
61873,Marge,"sometimes i think he's more interested in his ""itchy and mitchy"" cartoons than me."
65194,Marge,"homie, i don't want you to feel excluded. would you like to come with us to dinner at el chemistri?"
65983,Marge,what did he do in the future?
55932,Marge,"more cocoa, mr. burns?"
62916,Marge,"well, i think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing. maybe they could learn from each other."
64688,Marge,"um, i'm gonna go read a book."
62237,Marge,"homer, no one has ever seen ray but you."
62052,Marge,jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion...
59993,Marge,"it's kind of you to take us in, dr. bushwell."
63446,Marge,hello?
66638,Marge,good baby.
67501,Marge,"bart, isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister?"
66969,Marge,"well, i've been thinking, too. you know, homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, mr. berger promised i could come back to my old job anytime i wanted."
67407,Marge,"well, frankly, i don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known."
60633,Marge,homer!
57733,Marge,"bills... bills... oo, a free sample of gasoline... a note from publishers' clearinghouse saying we're out of the running... oh look, lisa! you got something."
63038,Marge,perfect.
61884,Marge,"bart, have you ever eaten a tootsie pop? you know, there's a tough crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside. be nice to nelson and i'll give you a tootsie pop."
63629,Marge,really? but i'm so used to my old one.
58516,Marge,congratulations. your child or children have been selected to appear in who's who among american elementary school students.
57403,Marge,"uh, you know, i think i'll take maggie with us."
62365,Marge,"listen, buster. i had to buy a club soda i didn't want to get change for this phone!"
57997,Marge,"now make no mistake. when i say ""first aid,"" i'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert!"
66690,Marge,"oh, don't mention her eye. don't mention her eye."
56414,Marge,"when you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?"
55419,Marge,"homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
62396,Marge,"this is a little too spooky for me. i don't even like watching ""the count"" on sesame street."
58854,Marge,"oh, i'll come watch you do nothing after i try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights."
62634,Marge,"see, abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
59846,Marge,"oh, chief! i found some evidence that points to the real arsonist."
63873,Marge,like a big-mouthed bass.
56798,Marge,he's getting away!! c'mon! c'mon!
59366,Marge,"i can't help it if i donated the most blood. oh, i'm feeling kinda woozy."
60314,Marge,we want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product.
60518,Marge,how come you talked for four hundred dollars?
58041,Marge,"well... your mother, for one."
55320,Marge,my little guy's first rock concert. i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud.
62384,Marge,"homie, i accept your apology."
61943,Marge,nooooo!
66021,Marge,"i always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!"
65952,Marge,fine. what would you get rid of?
56705,Marge,fine. you're on the jury.
60816,Marge,yeah. if we read books we could form a club.
63954,Marge,you make me feel that way too.
63970,Marge,really? i never knew that.
59630,Marge,"something that swings, with the beat of new orleans."
62049,Marge,"as long as two people love each other, i don't think god cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
66481,Marge,"i know, homie. i know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. but i also know you well enough to know that this will work."
61830,Marge,what a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say. now i've got to get ready for the finals.
58026,Marge,ohhhh. here i am!
59966,Marge,so that's where that went.
59194,Marge,my hero!
60367,Marge,don't hurt me! i'm not like you people! i'm loved!
60348,Marge,"hmm, i'd better polish those jaw wires for tomorrow."
64194,Marge,"no, i gave that to the homeless shelter."
55474,Marge,no! no! i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
59011,Marge,are you talking to me or the beer?
67618,Marge,do you know what i'd settle for if it was up to me? bart's medical bills and an apology!
62115,Marge,you don't smoke!
58519,Marge,are you sure? i can usually smell a scam from two towns over.
62874,Marge,"i don't know. i should give homer a chance... but on the other hand, i feel nothing for him."
63552,Marge,hello?
66169,Marge,it's all my fault. i should never have listened to those kiss albums when i was pregnant.
59691,Marge,with a song about thrift!
64452,Marge,who's there?
66473,Marge,"well, i was just trying to--"
57170,Marge,"i don't know. lisa, tonight is very important. mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
56300,Marge,wake up!
58134,Marge,people saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
64021,Marge,your father's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school.
61363,Marge,mr. burns? you care about children?
59435,Marge,i just don't think it's funny!
58990,Marge,"homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same."
58632,Marge,"ohh, you don't sound so good. we'd better get you some cold medicine."
66854,Marge,at last! i'll earn money for schlepping!
56511,Marge,so am i.
60697,Marge,"""dear homie, had to buy diapers for maggie. love, marge."""
66981,Marge,"oh, homer, mr. burns just said he liked it. once."
66077,Marge,i want to be very clear. i'm a happily married woman. going on ten years. the aluminum anniversary! nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
62890,Marge,me too. i can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.
65769,Marge,"that's where they filmed ""the wire""! step on it!"
61172,Marge,"yeah, indians don't sit around drinking beer and watching tv."
56284,Marge,but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
66926,Marge,cash?
55415,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face...
65781,Marge,oh god! they want to steal our kids!
55587,Marge,"oh, you speak so politely to adults."
55414,Marge,"stanley, stop or i'll tell stella."
57393,Marge,you know how i feel about hoaxes!
66446,Marge,"to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil, like we had the last time, i'm learning the language."
56673,Marge,what's going on in here?
56223,Marge,"grampa, sssh! i know my mother. if you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away."
64126,Marge,uh... a princess?
63587,Marge,"oh, what a wonderful night."
56075,Marge,"sure, honey. i promise."
59118,Marge,put it away. put it away!
56269,Marge,is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in?
66543,Marge,"fine, fine! homer! give him a party!"
57152,Marge,"we ran with different crowds. you had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and i had my home shoe repair course."
64635,Marge,and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time.
64334,Marge,bart ate a tainted burger!
55487,Marge,"grampa, you said that about all the presents."
66576,Marge,"/ oh! breathe, homie, breathe!"
56179,Marge,no it's not.
65503,Marge,why does that make him right?
62142,Marge,this is a house!
63440,Marge,wow. is it much different from a normal plane?
67934,Marge,yes!
63210,Marge,you should feel lucky. not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
60815,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to find a new way to entertain ourselves."
65161,Marge,the kids sure had a good time with you.
54788,Marge,now come on... you can play your little tie-up game inside. i've got some cocoa on the stove. who wants imitation marshmallows?
57859,Marge,why not?
56938,Marge,"oh, my."
67843,Marge,"dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
58062,Marge,"stop, homer! stop it! let me out!"
61911,Marge,"back then, we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism."
58081,Marge,"and here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen, with gas range, central can-opener, and foam under-flooring for enhanced standability."
62617,Marge,"they can't charge me for something i use every day. what's next, a spatula tax?"
58872,Marge,"now if you'll excuse me, i've got some dust that needs busting."
60916,Marge,"starting tomorrow, i'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel..."
60470,Marge,why don't we double date? then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
62004,Marge,homie...
65120,Marge,"kids, enjoy your extreme snack!"
55732,Marge,you've been eating that thing for a week. i think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
64362,Marge,how 'bout history?
55074,Marge,doesn't your job start tomorrow?
55657,Marge,homer!
60380,Marge,"if i'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese quesadilla, i'm gonna scream."
60988,Marge,then all that's left is to protect maggie from the sun.
56664,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
63200,Marge,"don't worry, they're still drunk from school!"
65785,Marge,"homie, i just had a horrible thought."
62275,Marge,"actually, i think your father's still upset about the way things went down."
56985,Marge,"bart, no!"
61771,Marge,that sounds like maggie. but she's right here...
59348,Marge,"hansen's disease. you know, like that horrible cream soda?"
60681,Marge,"homie, i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately."
62979,Marge,"homer, our house is on fire! help me save the children!"
61246,Marge,where did you get that tutu?
60686,Marge,one handsome hubby is all i need.
66323,Marge,i'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
56016,Marge,please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
57531,Marge,"homer, it's two a.m.! what happened?"
63932,Marge,well then she can have you all to herself!
65927,Marge,sixteen.
67507,Marge,"sit down, homer."
56682,Marge,"no, homie. you see. you see, this is the stuff i've been telling you about that you never see."
65247,Marge,and maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
59249,Marge,"oooh, look at all these clever pencil holders."
57237,Marge,sounds like you're really falling for him.
65316,Marge,"well, during the town meeting, which now seems like years ago, i forgot my purse at your bar...and when i came back to get it, i saw how much you love that rag."
58494,Marge,whatever.
54843,Marge,"bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
58078,Marge,"i thought so too, but they said it sells."
63487,Marge,"i'm so tense, i can't enjoy count almaviva serenading the intended bride of dr. bartolo. i just can't."
57446,Marge,are you ready?
67601,Marge,"oh, homie. here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other."
54839,Marge,homie... put down your magazine for a minute...
59624,Marge,we were using fifty-dollar bills as toilet paper. and toilet paper as dog toilet paper.
59219,Marge,"oh, honey, give it up."
62860,Marge,maggie! my sweet little angel!
56655,Marge,"oh, for the love of criminy! gimme that! i know bart did something wrong, but he's my son and i'm going to punish him myself."
59263,Marge,"i knew you had your hands full with the babies, so i baked you some banana bread."
66983,Marge,"oh, i'm not much of a drinker."
55355,Marge,oh.
66725,Marge,what the?
54671,Marge,oh homie! / oh homie!
61725,Marge,"homie, i know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. i guess it didn't mean that much to you."
63202,Marge,"homer, you're back!"
66019,Marge,wrong. you have to walk all the way over to grampa to take a plate of cookies i baked.
65126,Marge,"and when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got lou gehrig's disease."
66775,Marge,"you're the last vote, homie."
57852,Marge,"lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, i'll be here in half a jiff."
65309,Marge,"i think it just froze. oh no. no, that bird just moved."
55830,Marge,"well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. wait, maybe it does."
66466,Marge,"oh, there's my magazine. why, look at this! ""what every father should do for his daughter."""
66846,Marge,"see ya at the bake sale, sucker!"
66390,Marge,when are your relatives going to be here?
54797,Marge,butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
60441,Marge,"nice try. but we're still going to ""riverdance""."
65894,Marge,can you chew with your mouth closed? it's like looking into a garbage disposal.
60117,Marge,uh-oh.
64369,Marge,what's all the hubbub-aloo?
65540,Marge,wonderful stuff! enjoy it!
60444,Marge,"hi, honey. where's that vicious dog? i made him a biscuit."
63023,Marge,it's so unfair -- i'm as handy as any man.
65184,Marge,holy casserole-y! that's good gloop!
55742,Marge,"hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
64890,Marge,i didn't. i got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. so not a peep out of anyone till the fiesta bowl!
64846,Marge,opossum!
62381,Marge,i can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
66328,Marge,for once i'm grabbing the goody.
64736,Marge,"stay cool, marge. stay cool..."
60489,Marge,"ooh, did you say joan van ark?"
63756,Marge,you live here?
64987,Marge,"okay, we're gonna take turns having grampa as a roommate. who wants to go first?"
63891,Marge,so i can't always be there for bart. he's got to learn to take care of himself.
61702,Marge,"while you two are up on the roof, why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter!"
61881,Marge,she's still your mother. come inside.
59065,Marge,"homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom."
57117,Marge,good for him!
61105,Marge,the amish are so industrious. not like those shiftless mennonites.
60218,Marge,"let's see what you have, moe."
56280,Marge,what! what?
67417,Marge,"okay, homer. fair enough. you got it! all right! good! that's it. that's how i'm gonna express myself. that's right. goodnight."
66366,Marge,"but ned, saying nay is your thing."
56038,Marge,"uh, i don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!"
64732,Marge,"you go ahead, i'll stay here. if i get something on this handbag, i won't be able to return it."
65425,Marge,"bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes."
55795,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55397,Marge,"i told you several times. it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named..."""
58510,Marge,it could save lives!
61115,Marge,"give it a rest, barry."
67564,Marge,her group
54802,Marge,the meaning of what?
56887,Marge,that's odd. where's homer? and bart? and lisa? and grampa?
55246,Marge,i've found a way we can pay for the operation.
65992,Marge,"okay, check your mirrors. hands at ten and two. slowly back out of the driveway--"
58398,Marge,"i know, honey. but this is a very unusual situation... at least it would be for most families."
58667,Marge,you can get drunk when we get home.
65110,Marge,"i hope you're proud of yourself, homer."
56089,Marge,"oh, stop blaming the beans."
56356,Marge,"artie, please!"
62239,Marge,electro-shock?
59765,Marge,they always pick the guy with the wires.
64809,Marge,no. just a picture of lisa. who wants to be nothing like me.
55345,Marge,hmmm... hostage negotiations.
60437,Marge,"i hope you enjoy these german sausages. i've been grinding all day, so i'm not sure what organ meat is in what intestinal casing."
67300,Marge,leave pedro?
65485,Marge,the guy from the movie?
60780,Marge,"can't beat a skybox. all the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box."
58381,Marge,"okay, honey. okay. i'll start taking in all your slacks."
62334,Marge,first communion?!
64645,Marge,you said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
67817,Marge,this one's mine.
67060,Marge,"i said you could stop smiling, lisa."
59149,Marge,stop him! he's wacked out of his gourd.
61858,Marge,"well, i guess it's just you and me, bart!"
63367,Marge,"oooh, leather arms! people just give you this stuff?"
60375,Marge,that sounds great.
66999,Marge,"look, napkins."
61456,Marge,"c'mon, bart -- we can make this fun. history's like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize."
58447,Marge,"heyyy, look at that."
66214,Marge,"homer! i know you're here, your car's outside!"
59964,Marge,where?
62888,Marge,"you've been drinking today, haven't you?"
66715,Marge,we brought cheerios for you!
56720,Marge,"homer, don't take this personally, but i've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding."
54748,Marge,grampa?
59243,Marge,are you comparing yourself to our lord?
56273,Marge,"hmm, maybe we should spend more time with bart. he's becoming isolated and weird."
64685,Marge,"well, i don't need much help..."
62565,Marge,johnson's water seal.
66330,Marge,maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
64079,Marge,you guys have treated me like a princess. every day's been like the first ten minutes of mother's day!
61496,Marge,"and maggie gets a shirt, too!"
66222,Marge,that is pretty good.
55337,Marge,"otto, i think you should get a job."
57747,Marge,"oh, maggie, you got oatmeal all over. homer, would you clean her off?"
65523,Marge,what are you gonna say?
56420,Marge,this is less encouraging.
63651,Marge,keith olbermann?!
67303,Marge,yeah.
63065,Marge,"colonel, we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."
56870,Marge,this town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...
63736,Marge,my bosoms came in and ruined my balance.
57155,Marge,"i've told you, i don't like you using the word hotbed. please, lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. and everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. bart, no grifting."
56874,Marge,"well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
60461,Marge,last year's mvp. he sweeps up toenails at the beauty parlor.
66063,Marge,i thought i was buying snack cakes!
58720,Marge,it's only 5:30.
59485,Marge,now what's wrong?
56853,Marge,i don't think that's a very good idea.
66960,Marge,"bart, stop fooling around. homer, stop encouraging him."
63416,Marge,what can i say? maggie and i share a special bond.
58191,Marge,it was wearing a hat!
66717,Marge,is that tea... adulterated?
60029,Marge,"hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
65277,Marge,the contractions?
58642,Marge,"oh, sweetie, you look so much better. ready to go back to school?"
66056,Marge,"""dear 'horny in haverbrook,' sorry, i am not interested in cheating on my wonderful husband, who is described in the attached pdf. say hello to my trash folder, marge simpson."""
67176,Marge,"well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?"
66611,Marge,my store. my offset spatula! mine!
62497,Marge,"maggie, would you like to ride with me?"
62814,Marge,"homer, you can tell the third story. bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest."
58172,Marge,come onnn. you have to go outside to do your... business.
66864,Marge,he's not my lover!
57024,Marge,"i'm so sorry i misjudged you, mom. you had to leave to protect your family."
60075,Marge,"oh well, this is our stop."
58293,Marge,better. come look.
58690,Marge,"you know, i really don't care for that code name."
57089,Marge,"goodnight, sweetheart."
59004,Marge,ohh...
67627,Marge,it was a little hard on me having him around the house
65820,Marge,maybe we should go.
65306,Marge,"actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family."
56266,Marge,"and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you later tonight."
62566,Marge,the nationwide social organization for women of a certain age?
55464,Marge,"i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, i'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
64597,Marge,fish theme! that tells me nothing!
65570,Marge,i still smell it!
66630,Marge,"why, why does this have to be so hard?"
54976,Marge,"they want a name, homer, not a vague description."
60914,Marge,"so then i pop my delts, clench and bam! not a dry eye in the house."
63706,Marge,what the?
56675,Marge,"homer, is this projection accurate? did you borrow money from my sisters?"
67655,Marge,can i just make one suggestion? can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?
62547,Marge,"oh captain, you're so handy!"
57952,Marge,what?!
67953,Marge,"i need a full-time job to support homer, so he has time to work on his rock music, his erotic etchings, his play-doh theater..."
55336,Marge,no.
65071,Marge,"oh, my poor homie."
56401,Marge,how were you a political prisoner?
65304,Marge,"ooo, condos!"
63865,Marge,you did the right thing.
55276,Marge,"well, it's nice. but who is this woman?"
62986,Marge,"bart, put that away!"
55624,Marge,"uh, well..."
64357,Marge,i could do worse...
64432,Marge,what a nice note!
65190,Marge,"uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans saturday night."
57646,Marge,i'm so glad you could join us for homer's big premiere.
63673,Marge,"hmm, okay."
62701,Marge,we had a lot of fun. they're terrific kids.
66559,Marge,the city's broke. the fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
56282,Marge,lisa! i am nice.
60008,Marge,homer!
67568,Marge,no! you're ruining the show. oh... oh... oh. stop.
59895,Marge,"once again, i'm outraged by this last-minute switch."
65558,Marge,"""i'll get to it, marge..."" ""i'll get to it..."" when we first got married, he'd only take six months to do things..."
56692,Marge,"""you can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
64292,Marge,bart simpson! i'm glad your father isn't here to see this!
55595,Marge,don quixote?
67202,Marge,like two fragile bowling pins...
66062,Marge,good question.
66493,Marge,no! i'm throwing you out of the house! you can live with your no-good son.
63048,Marge,is that the cat?
67929,Marge,apu?
58722,Marge,"i'm tired of that show. but i've been hearing good things about ""talk to the hand."" tom shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."""
64359,Marge,i always have.
57059,Marge,bart!
59872,Marge,"i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
60391,Marge,"anti-trust suit... anti-trust suit... a note from marge simpson? well, isn't that a coincidence? i was just thinking about her..."
67806,Marge,"doctor, i think lisa has the mumps."
60734,Marge,"that's good satire -- it doesn't hurt anyone. what do you think, maggie?"
64939,Marge,just hope the kids didn't hear us.
55929,Marge,"hmm, better sew that eye back on."
63659,Marge,that's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
60307,Marge,i'll play it later.
66023,Marge,"thank you, god."
54790,Marge,"lisa, we did the best we could... what's a zebu?"
58205,Marge,homer!
57736,Marge,"... bills, bills... oh a rejection letter from the new yorker subscription department... hmm. who or what is ""santos l. halper?"""
58162,Marge,"homer, you sing all the time!"
55874,Marge,it's so nice not to have to cook.
67623,Marge,"well, i don't know how intense it was..."
59373,Marge,this all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
58260,Marge,"look, homer. there's that bird you like to argue with."
65631,Marge,"grampa, we will never miss a visit again. and there'll be a lot more of them."
55398,Marge,well... i thought i told you..
67473,Marge,the can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
64988,Marge,"homer, i told you he wouldn't sleep through it."
66307,Marge,no woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
55289,Marge,"homer, how much did you just give that man?"
60202,Marge,"oh, homey, you poor thing."
64081,Marge,"homie, i haven't held maggie all day. can you hand her to me?"
63191,Marge,homer!
67017,Marge,"gee, i thought we were making real progress."
58622,Marge,we all blame you.
67232,Marge,"here, if you have any soul left, you'll need these. i know i will."
59611,Marge,shot? wha?
56437,Marge,"i don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. awful, awful hair."
65016,Marge,i'm not a hoarder! do the yankees hoard pennants? does marrakesh hoard intrigue?
57921,Marge,"well, grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when bart was five and lisa was three."
65976,Marge,thank god the kids aren't here.
60393,Marge,mm-hmmm!
60691,Marge,dr. hibbert? but we heard you'd gone mad.
56966,Marge,"sorry, force of habit. lisa, no!"
66298,Marge,i never wanted to say funny vows!
65025,Marge,"homer! just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
62731,Marge,"well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
60066,Marge,ohhh!
56569,Marge,"thank you, doctor. whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i'll think lowenstein, lowenstein."
67186,Marge,"hm, yes, i am, as a matter of fact. here's more treats. but don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner."
61901,Marge,homer.
63955,Marge,what are you doing?
66202,Marge,fine. you can have your old one!
54703,Marge,"ooh, you'd better be careful. the purpose of this game is to make friends. you don't make friends by winning."
58982,Marge,"homie, i'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?"
61671,Marge,"homie, people in the other elevators can see us."
59274,Marge,wooo!
62044,Marge,"it's ""win a hawaiian getaway week"" on channel six."
59125,Marge,tommy lee...
59088,Marge,"oh, i'm afraid this might be the end."
60687,Marge,no bellybutton?! you're a clone! then the real homer...
60087,Marge,the gypsy said it would.
61768,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
61782,Marge,"bart, where did you get those?"
61663,Marge,yup. it's really boring. you kids would have hated it.
65950,Marge,"thank you for finding it, sweetie. and seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself."
60701,Marge,but you did have violent diarrhea. nobody open the hallway closet until i say it's okay.
66988,Marge,here we sit enjoying the shade.
60552,Marge,"honey, i like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. hang on, i've got call waiting."
55108,Marge,oh really?
62173,Marge,"dear mr. gehry: would you please build a concert hall for our town? we may not be the biggest city, or the prettiest, but we were the first city in america to abandon the metric system!"
62208,Marge,"i'm psychic. look, i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars."
62717,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. i never thought this would happen."
55962,Marge,that's one right there.
54751,Marge,"now, if maggie runs a fever, you call this number. if she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. and if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
60324,Marge,dessert's on. i steamed some limes!
66289,Marge,what's going on here? is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
64260,Marge,why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes?
56612,Marge,homer! let your father tell the story.
66719,Marge,ooh. are you mr. clean?
61236,Marge,"you always go with your gut. this time, why don't you listen to your brain?"
54908,Marge,we're home!
58377,Marge,"anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
66841,Marge,"it's because everything you love, you love so much."
54981,Marge,he hasn't done that since he was two.
59615,Marge,no they didn't.
58382,Marge,and your shirt!
56560,Marge,i want to see daddy fly!
62886,Marge,hello there.
60785,Marge,bart! watch your potty mouth!
57056,Marge,bart! stop pestering satan!
59227,Marge,shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
62583,Marge,i thought you liked my hair.
56416,Marge,homer!
58450,Marge,shh! they'll hear us.
67146,Marge,oh!
62569,Marge,"for your information, i am now a junior member of the cheery red tomatoes."
66011,Marge,excuse me.
61573,Marge,this is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.
65881,Marge,i volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes. it's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.
66525,Marge,"don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. when you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
55764,Marge,"bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!"
58860,Marge,"oh, great. what'd i do?"
67285,Marge,hmmm hmmm.
62895,Marge,i've got amnesia and i have three kids.
66535,Marge,"it's okay. i mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. i think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized."
60288,Marge,why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
55239,Marge,"hmm, how much will it cost?"
59647,Marge,but i thought broccoli was--
62808,Marge,"yes, the weather is fair."
63746,Marge,we accept!
56716,Marge,"lisa!! hello! how're you doing in england? remember, an elevator is called a ""lift,"" a mile is called a ""kilometer,"" and botulism is called ""steak and kidney pie."""
58698,Marge,"remember how excited we were when this place opened? then a week later, we just forgot about it."
62768,Marge,"let's go home, sweetie. i'm sure there's a hamper full of homer waiting for me."
57559,Marge,look at them. they've jumped on the one franchise i might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. i'm not cut out for the world of business.
56613,Marge,"homer, you had a head."
63851,Marge,well... okay.
67199,Marge,please.
54786,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
66291,Marge,"lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
63291,Marge,just put on a towel!
59091,Marge,"boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
65874,Marge,we're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
59207,Marge,"holy moly, we can't stay here. it's full of raccoons."
58127,Marge,how could somebody...?
64603,Marge,dealing drugs? that's impossible. he... he doesn't have the math skills!
56790,Marge,that's the same thing! you just replaced dees with doos!
66993,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. sorry."
58222,Marge,"i can't go along with this, homer."
61012,Marge,"occasionally, you might hear a faint roar..."
58551,Marge,eggs?
66634,Marge,"guys, this is gonna be hard for a while, but we'll get through this... as a family."
58744,Marge,"oh, mister price, i loved you in the abominable doct..."
59176,Marge,stop winking.
57606,Marge,can't you get it yourself?
59762,Marge,"ready for the circus, homer?"
61781,Marge,"cut me some slack, i'm a widow."
63761,Marge,she turned down lenny... and carl? that's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hotdogs. what could make her hate men like that?
63370,Marge,"well, i guess every boy should see his father as a hero."
61190,Marge,"bart, plants don't-- wheww!"
56129,Marge,"you know, homer, when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions. first i was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
55439,Marge,"come here. i want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your mouth."
65664,Marge,it sure is! there's nothing more natural than... that. it's just that maggie's already... milked me today!
62081,Marge,i always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families.
61774,Marge,where'd you get that rib?
62689,Marge,how can you be sure?
66886,Marge,it's not a takedown! and i haven't told him about it -- yet.
62016,Marge,those are just reese's pieces.
63895,Marge,i just made a thirty-seven hundred mile car trip. i need to wash up.
67737,Marge,are you sure this is legal?
58189,Marge,you had a quadruple bypass. you nearly died. don't you remember?
59836,Marge,"oh, jack. i know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
67141,Marge,never you mind.
64743,Marge,"you know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them."
65195,Marge,of course.
67398,Marge,will we be invited?
57253,Marge,"aw, aw, there, there, oh, maggie... there..."
57364,Marge,"moe, i'm so glad i found you. please promise me you won't let homer get hurt."
61307,Marge,"oh, homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. i'm proud of you."
59681,Marge,"so, mr. king, what tale of horror and the macabre are you working on now?"
65386,Marge,we're wetting the bed?
60712,Marge,you work a job you don't like so i'm able to be home with the kids.
64203,Marge,ooh! that's bart's class.
62965,Marge,marriage is hard work. but it's worth it -- when you've got someone wonderful like i do.
65096,Marge,"excuse me, has anyone seen my toy?"
59172,Marge,"oh, no!"
61899,Marge,"terrace. evergreen terrace. the street that smells like pee. this is my daughter, lisa."
60952,Marge,but there must be some sort...
67674,Marge,"and a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
60371,Marge,"this family needs a live wire, but it's just not me."
57227,Marge,that does it. one of them has to go.
54775,Marge,ohhh.
56792,Marge,"ah, c'mon, homer, there's lasers. you like lasers."
56309,Marge,even on our jobs...
60783,Marge,they've already told the skybox fans who's gonna win.
60475,Marge,"first he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. your father's out of control."
58522,Marge,"easy, easy. stick with the plan."
55095,Marge,homer!
60754,Marge,"don't worry, maggie, i'll have these silly things out in just two days. till then i'll just try to hide them from the family."
66157,Marge,not me!
60255,Marge,you came back!
67910,Marge,no.
60558,Marge,"homie, you don't need drugs anymore. your eyes are all better."
64165,Marge,you've been spending so much time with her.
66212,Marge,coming through! wife on a mission!
57575,Marge,"oh, no! no! don't do that! you're supposed to be tasting them!"
57110,Marge,"no, i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
62266,Marge,i was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock hold-up. i don't know what to do for dinner now.
55793,Marge,"homer, lisa needs braces."
63198,Marge,there was a happy young family...
59016,Marge,to who?
60889,Marge,i can bench twice as much as when i started! and look at my abs!
55109,Marge,hmm...
55966,Marge,would you two like to go to the ballet?
60237,Marge,"hey lisa, what are you doing?"
56935,Marge,we've never been separated from the kids for so long. i don't know how much more i can take.
59246,Marge,"doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown man from drowning?"
62283,Marge,"ooh, i could be the rachel to your jacob."
66494,Marge,"oh, moe. are we doing this again?"
64270,Marge,"so, anyway, this is the story of maggie roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
60231,Marge,oh no...
54824,Marge,"now homer, don't panic. you have plenty of white shirts."
67170,Marge,yes.
56057,Marge,"then how 'about going as florida? you enjoy orange juice, and old people like you."
58215,Marge,homer...
66814,Marge,what's wrong homer? is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
60575,Marge,"bart, your prank caused ten million dollars in damages."
67081,Marge,there is?
60160,Marge,i thought this was gonna be your bar.
55791,Marge,"are you sure, doctor?"
55922,Marge,what? homie!
65955,Marge,"fine. i'm getting rid of this american masters ""kitty carlisle."""
62527,Marge,"oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. have fun!"
60122,Marge,no! i don't want you going in a bottle. that's what hobos do.
66995,Marge,"homie, get in the car."
58512,Marge,"oh, i just mopped that driveway."
63178,Marge,yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here. they're the most delicious fish in the ocean.
62621,Marge,they blocked my shortcut!
66074,Marge,i know a place where no one in town will see us.
59921,Marge,"lisa, how's your eiffel tower kit?"
62343,Marge,"what's wrong, bart? you love youth culture!"
59614,Marge,"well, that's a relief, too, knowing i'm not crazy. so i guess everything really worked out for the--"
61763,Marge,i can't believe that historic rock is gone.
62622,Marge,"i'm trapped -- like the ""l"" in a b.l.t.!"
67201,Marge,destiny?
66518,Marge,i want friends. any friends.
66573,Marge,"sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
65468,Marge,stop saying what you call things! i'm trying to watch the movie!
55698,Marge,no.
64638,Marge,homer?
62463,Marge,homer!
62364,Marge,"hold on, i'll be off in a minute."
60581,Marge,apu is having an affair?!
60573,Marge,hm. where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?
60680,Marge,"kids, your father made us breakfast."
65024,Marge,"homie, maybe you should stop. we've talked about the gray zone..."
59461,Marge,wait! how do you know this is where lincoln buried the gold? you just started counting from an arbitrary place.
62098,Marge,"mind your manners, lisa."
66338,Marge,"i hate when i come here and the first word out of my mouth is homer. but here we go. again. homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
56884,Marge,"bart! put that down! guns are very dangerous, and i won't have them in this house."
62077,Marge,"well, i've learned a lesson. just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
56939,Marge,"the only thing i'm high on is love. love for my son and daughters. yes, a little ""l.s.d."" is all i need."
59883,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie. we'll talk about it later, okay?"
60961,Marge,he should have done that with the real bart when he had the chance.
56464,Marge,i don't care who started it. i don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. we love you both. you're not in competition with each other. repeat. you are not in competition with each other.
58852,Marge,"that's nice, dear!"
55314,Marge,bart! stop that.
61978,Marge,this place is a diamond / but it's trapped in the rough
59491,Marge,"okay honey, we're almost to palm corners. there'll be nothing to do but lie on the beach and relax."
61418,Marge,"i'm finished! and it's so suggestive. but like they say, ""snuggling sells."" now, do i dare push ""print?"""
66632,Marge,"i was short-staffed and your father volunteered. actually, i was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand."
56731,Marge,i think there's really something wrong with santa's little helper. he was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
62586,Marge,i'll really miss you guys. i'll never forget the three activities we did together.
64573,Marge,"this country's so historic -- for all we know, jesus could have given a talk in conference room c."
60425,Marge,climb up!
65030,Marge,that's great. then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
58962,Marge,i'm toiling! what does it look like?
60147,Marge,get away from that window!
67050,Marge,"you do love her, don't you?"
55807,Marge,"oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
59213,Marge,you got that from a movie poster!
55989,Marge,"you're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?"
57934,Marge,"what ""origin""? we get 'em for a dollar ninety-five down at the safeway."
58176,Marge,"oh, ned! i'm so sorry!"
58506,Marge,they're not very...
58697,Marge,homer!
57176,Marge,i need a formal dress for tonight!
58317,Marge,"okay, great. you kids have fun."
60985,Marge,i just gotta stay one lesson ahead of the kid.
67781,Marge,"very nicely said, homer."
63364,Marge,"sweetheart, come to dinner."
55347,Marge,"homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
62228,Marge,what are you doing? why aren't you fixing the roof?
59212,Marge,"it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
66036,Marge,how am i going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
61170,Marge,"you won't be seeing milhouse for a while. something about that boy just shakes up your soda. ooh, this looks interesting: the pre-teen braves."
66726,Marge,what is that racket?
65964,Marge,grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to capital city.
61499,Marge,"well, then... find a new identity."
61660,Marge,no!
61317,Marge,isn't it kind of dry?
66247,Marge,"well, that's sort of what i was trying to say. but..."
61822,Marge,"you're right. if i can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week, i can do anything."
62746,Marge,that's funny.
65361,Marge,i miss our home and i want to go back.
56710,Marge,i knew this would happen. i put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
56114,Marge,their floors are sticky-mart.
63751,Marge,"there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. look at me, i'm glowing!"
65742,Marge,"would you... like to have coffee, or dinner, or just talk?"
61514,Marge,uh-hmm.
59226,Marge,don't forget your mincemeat pie!
54692,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
55981,Marge,you look... nice.
67287,Marge,"oh, homer."
58765,Marge,you are invited to a garden party this saturday!
60866,Marge,sorry!
65313,Marge,homer! watch the road!
67230,Marge,"homer, i don't even want to look at you right now."
54731,Marge,homer! homer! put a record on!
62660,Marge,poor willie. would you like to spend the night with us?
61150,Marge,i've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him.
55218,Marge,so you think she has talent?
67089,Marge,"very nice, maggie. and lisa you look lovely. bart, assume the position."
56400,Marge,i have nothing to say to you.
65216,Marge,i've got to save him!
55883,Marge,i didn't expect all this.
55690,Marge,many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
54714,Marge,"gosh, what a hunk!"
60262,Marge,we don't need tv to have family fun. why don't we play monopoly?
67084,Marge,"i don't understand. what's this all about? well, i suppose pork chops are his favorite."
67802,Marge,"hmmm, lisa, you don't look well."
59233,Marge,i can't get maggie to eat. maybe if you try...
59271,Marge,it's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
61352,Marge,"then, i guess this means war. with the most powerful weapon at my disposal: a voter-sponsored initiative."
63755,Marge,"i'm taking you to your home, before you wreck mine!"
60715,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, but it's time to come home."
60197,Marge,i guess it was a pretty funny prank. i like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
65545,Marge,give back my baby!
60176,Marge,i'll just take them right back to the store and-- whoa.
62843,Marge,that's her! don't answer it yet! i don't want that judgmental bitch in my house!
57991,Marge,come down here.
67911,Marge,yes.
58448,Marge,"oh, my heart's beating like crazy."
56580,Marge,"you're not a god, homer."
64558,Marge,"mister, you are grounded!"
55845,Marge,i bought a bell.
56974,Marge,these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! and you kids should have jackets on.
65749,Marge,aw.
66722,Marge,"homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and i got one."
55323,Marge,"oh, oh... thank god!"
62059,Marge,"so tell, tell. who's the lucky man? what does he do? let me guess: does he work in customer support?"
55801,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55610,Marge,good.
57482,Marge,"oh, there's so little left: creamed eels? corn nog? wadded beef?"
64753,Marge,lisa? she wants to talk to you.
55265,Marge,"that spot says ""compact only""."
58094,Marge,i thought i'd do anything to succeed in business. but bending the truth... i don't know.
59202,Marge,"no, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse."
55682,Marge,my husband is still alive!
55098,Marge,"sting, you look tired. maybe you should take a rest."
62295,Marge,homie... i'd better start dinner.
64658,Marge,"or lieutenant commander tom dodge in ""down periscope."""
65090,Marge,maggie!
59351,Marge,"oh, thank god you're all right!"
57581,Marge,"oh my god, what happened to your fingers?!"
58193,Marge,let me get you a coaster for those feet.
67065,Marge,homer.
57546,Marge,i'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. they sound a little risky.
63775,Marge,"lurleen, you're giving your dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself. stop getting your self-esteem from the men in your life."
57839,Marge,"well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
57357,Marge,"night vision goggles? a bathroom scale from a soviet sub? a suede briefcase-case? oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems..."
57259,Marge,why not.
63248,Marge,this basement is a wonderful gift to the family. but how could you afford it?
62591,Marge,it doesn't cover mortadella.
56091,Marge,"i don't think the guns are a good idea, homer."
66258,Marge,"well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't. our house is very odd that way."
58083,Marge,"yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. you know, i've always loved the house you're in now."
57647,Marge,shush everybody! it's coming on!
57712,Marge,"parades just bring out so many emotions in me: joy, excitement, looking..."
62554,Marge,have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
64167,Marge,i wasn't talking to you.
62110,Marge,"oh, thank god! he's alive!"
64584,Marge,you people are so pushy.
67778,Marge,"c'mon, patty. you don't want to show up looking like yosemite sam."
61995,Marge,"me too, moe. what a nice surprise that we've become friends."
58032,Marge,"i've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. i've got the extra wine glasses, but i'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
57369,Marge,"homer! homer, he's not going to get tired! you've got to hit him back! hit him back!"
56283,Marge,"homer, i really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange."
61612,Marge,spice up! spice up!
63923,Marge,"um, how long have you two been married?"
66809,Marge,"homer, quick! get your shooing broom!"
65553,Marge,lemme get this straight. none of you had time to take out the garbage?
63229,Marge,"oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
56915,Marge,what about maggie?
66083,Marge,"yeah. alone, i'm sure."
60792,Marge,we are not staying at moe's. maggie's already drunk on the fumes. and she's a mean drunk.
56565,Marge,yeah... you might even say he was an american hero.
54704,Marge,"still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner."
55880,Marge,"oh honey, i've missed you too. homer, is that an old halloween costume?"
61340,Marge,"they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz, which is still pretty good. oh. the second one wants custard, too. that's a little repetitive."
55513,Marge,homer!
61089,Marge,"that was a delicious meal, cookie. what do we do with our garbage?"
65544,Marge,"come here, you. /"
55897,Marge,that man is so rude.
55096,Marge,"bart? honey, i made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
60869,Marge,no! it'll tangle!
67412,Marge,huh uh. i'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night.
65849,Marge,"okay, post this under ""men seeking men,"" but what sub-heading... nothing too serious... here we go -- ""casual encounters!"" perfect, no pressure!"
60429,Marge,"goodnight, homie."
61543,Marge,"well, northern california is wine country -- we could take a tour."
66922,Marge,"oh, i have my secrets. turn around."
60750,Marge,you had no right to make my bosom this ample!
55575,Marge,"mr. burns, you want to see me?"
67377,Marge,evil!
63280,Marge,"sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. it's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
66857,Marge,fine. there's meatloaf...
65925,Marge,not gonna say.
67891,Marge,from the desk of ringo starr!
62473,Marge,david and bart just aren't working out. we have to do something.
55221,Marge,"lisa, i know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. see, this morning i turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for bart and homer."
55392,Marge,"i haven't been in a play since high school, and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults."
56263,Marge,"homer, that's not a good thing."
56483,Marge,they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
63667,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way. we were planning a surprise party for you."
55197,Marge,we'll all help.
62335,Marge,"homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. but i didn't change bart's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic."
67158,Marge,oh!
56667,Marge,"patty, selma. what are you doing here?"
56470,Marge,"homer, we can't root for one child over the other. you wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us."
61054,Marge,bird...
63592,Marge,i guess you should judge a book by its cover.
60942,Marge,"see, i don't know that he is. in the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt."
57530,Marge,bad fawn! hmm. shoo! shoo!
67011,Marge,are we cured yet?
67684,Marge,the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
57711,Marge,"his arm! oh, my special little guy, are you okay?!"
65484,Marge,why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?
65767,Marge,"homer! dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!"
59545,Marge,"yes, our tiny tapper. what was it you were going to say after ""i wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
58400,Marge,"see, bart? there's another boy who played with glue."
57686,Marge,"oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
58615,Marge,you lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
67633,Marge,some string beans?
59761,Marge,"he's doing ""dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
67240,Marge,homer!
63086,Marge,"the story of my life. they get the popsicles, i get the sticks."
61512,Marge,lisa! you're all right!
57352,Marge,i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
60277,Marge,"if i had known there were loose women in las vegas, i would never have let you go."
67237,Marge,"well, i think you should take bart to meet this exotic belly-person. i want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. i want bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
66556,Marge,try to forget that.
63014,Marge,"homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?"
60417,Marge,homer was there?
63246,Marge,you redid the basement!
55831,Marge,and you're a nuclear technician?
67738,Marge,"""myth: it's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. fact: most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam."" hmm, well, i don't know."
61508,Marge,"oh my god, what?"
65210,Marge,"eh, save it for the sitter!"
54864,Marge,"that sounds fine, bart."
61979,Marge,here's my new idea to sell both beer and grub / we will turn this filthy dive into a proper old-time british pub!
56680,Marge,"so homer, how'd you do?"
57545,Marge,"well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. i'm proud of you, homie."
61480,Marge,"homer, i don't need fancy things. and even if i did, this is the wrong way to get them."
59479,Marge,"kids, the new phone books are here. and your picture's on the cover!"
62229,Marge,"i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable ray! who, by the way, i've never even met!"
57499,Marge,"well, don't look at me... just because i'm holding a pair of scissors. scissors which i need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
65140,Marge,he had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
56787,Marge,"what do you do, follow my husband around?"
58399,Marge,"a bus? alone? absolutely not. it's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old. in a few years, when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus."
58034,Marge,"thanks for helping us out, reverend. i know you've never performed a hindu ceremony..."
59703,Marge,we have to tell them you're not dead.
64120,Marge,this isn't the most romantic place to get married.
55571,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
62752,Marge,"yes, i could really picture him. with curly shoes. and smoke all over the place. you're a born storyteller."
59779,Marge,do you feel smarter?
62897,Marge,"i may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. and that means a lot to a woman."
64511,Marge,"very good, bart."
65709,Marge,"keep an eye on the kids, homer."
64490,Marge,you love your son. how can you be so hard on him?
67707,Marge,"homer, you're amazing. before you couldn't say bon jour. but now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""allouette""."
61987,Marge,"ooh, that's a great idea."
54875,Marge,"homer, i want you to go down to that club and talk to them. just see what kind of people they are. please, homie?"
62872,Marge,why can i remember everyone in town except my husband?
60927,Marge,"homer, god isn't some kind of holy concierge. you can't keep bugging him for every little thing."
57573,Marge,"""hang in there, baby."" you said it, kitty. copyright 1968? hmm. determined or not, that cat must be long dead. that's kind of a downer."
62708,Marge,"ned, i know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
61540,Marge,"artie, thank you for doing the right thing. eventually."
54881,Marge,"homie, please be all right."
55243,Marge,"bart, watch your language. oh. you did. sorry."
65323,Marge,"""my darling husband. this valentine's day, i have a present for you..."""
66301,Marge,but the movie isn't in theaters till next week.
66124,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
57002,Marge,there's no cake.
67459,Marge,"homer, i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind."
57781,Marge,"well, i think volunteering is great. deep down it makes you feel --"
66771,Marge,"homer, please! that's creeping me out!"
55420,Marge,"stanley stop, or i'll tell stella."
59077,Marge,maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
56246,Marge,"oh, well that will be..."
64131,Marge,"well, did he take all the blue roses with him?"
56840,Marge,illegal gambling in my house?!
61472,Marge,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
64318,Marge,is he okay?
55163,Marge,hi homie. i feel much better.
64024,Marge,"homie, you're barely eating."
61855,Marge,it's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
66873,Marge,and it's not even against the rules.
63334,Marge,but they make me look dowdy...
65669,Marge,"well sweetie, if it's that important to you, i guess we can try."
57372,Marge,"oh, that's all right. we'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
55266,Marge,"so, what are we going to see?"
62116,Marge,i'm not gonna worry just because homer doesn't have insurance. a lot of people don't!
67596,Marge,i'm not. i think everyone in springfield should see it.
67617,Marge,"homer, what's happened to you? all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
60180,Marge,absolutely. you're about to get a lesson... in value!
63444,Marge,find out if he has a wife! we could double date!
65940,Marge,a high-voltage monkey prod? it is krusty's! he must have my dress. let's go!
58807,Marge,oh dear.
62836,Marge,strangers getting married?! i wouldn't miss it for the world!
66779,Marge,thank god it's just like her busy box.
61384,Marge,you should be glad i did. your father wanted to call you bartzeena!
61874,Marge,that's how we got our kaypro!
61759,Marge,"and yet, i miss america."
60459,Marge,honey...
67580,Marge,yes?
63960,Marge,"me neither, homie."
63594,Marge,there's a bee on maggie!
57654,Marge,"i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
67513,Marge,"wow, a woman mud-pull driver."
60056,Marge,"oh, we're calling it day care."
65394,Marge,why does maggie have to go?
58909,Marge,"well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. they might enjoy being the center of attention."
60011,Marge,we've just gotta get your thumb to the--
55043,Marge,"well, how about louie?"
64544,Marge,you're wrong! and whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
58781,Marge,i don't want to be chesty larue or busty st. claire!
59540,Marge,why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
65626,Marge,that kind of romance leads to children.
66723,Marge,you got very lucky this time. don't push it.
61710,Marge,i used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. they heard it in shelbyville!
57966,Marge,what do you recommend?
62754,Marge,i sure would! let me just get us some iced tea.
55358,Marge,hands across america...
63929,Marge,we'll stay for one hand roll or two nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
59898,Marge,oopsie!
56995,Marge,"you're right. maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice. homer? homer! homer! that's it. that's the one. all right, send him on in."
65205,Marge,"and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. it's too crazy for you."
58159,Marge,what did you get?
66299,Marge,"i didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
65672,Marge,the kids are a mess! you brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
54847,Marge,"oooh, look, homer. the irs."
59072,Marge,i never knew jim belushi made so many movies.
57378,Marge,"i can't excape lisa, our little walking libary!"
67842,Marge,"well, i always enjoy the glass blower at old springfield towne."
65590,Marge,awww... eww... homie! we still have a chance!
63724,Marge,"so, how was your outside time?"
55175,Marge,maybe we should let the dog in?
60632,Marge,"wait, wait! that's a suggestion, not a threat!"
67939,Marge,"hi, bart! it's your mom! i'm in your videogame with you!"
59996,Marge,even on the soles of her shoes.
64392,Marge,hi ned. where are the boys?
61541,Marge,"kids, you'd better take your last look at uncle artie."
58089,Marge,it's awfully small.
66831,Marge,"thank you. although, i think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group."
57163,Marge,"yes. they're better. socially better. and if we fit in, we can be better too. so today, while the rest of you were out being different, i did a very good job of fitting in. so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass. they might even ask us to join!"
56741,Marge,but won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
63644,Marge,"well, maybe i could. but every time i look at you, i see the same adorable boy i fell in love with."
54713,Marge,"hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. maybe i should sit down with them and-- homer, where are you going?!"
66881,Marge,"okay... there's a song about, um... how democrats and republicans can't get along. it's called ""cats and dogs."""
63869,Marge,"of course, you're denis leary!"
62058,Marge,"you're getting married?! patty, that's wonderful!"
56631,Marge,"say moe, was it a duck?"
55523,Marge,"well, we brought some pizza."
65738,Marge,a pillowcase full of quarters?! where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
67118,Marge,i'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
60399,Marge,homie!
60141,Marge,"if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
59030,Marge,and that's where the bookmobile lady used to live!
60886,Marge,"what to do now. too crazy to go outside, not crazy enough to have imaginary friends."
67648,Marge,there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street.
54650,Marge,it's statements like that that... are mean!
64564,Marge,thank you.
66035,Marge,we're not broken!
61513,Marge,just tell her which friggin' button to push!
57036,Marge,i feel so helpless. what if something happens to them?
63375,Marge,"that's it, buster -- you just bought yourself ten minutes watching that man make a wagon wheel."
56895,Marge,"were you talking to me, grampa?"
56138,Marge,"those aren't tickets to the game, homer."
57108,Marge,"homie, you want pork chops?"
61358,Marge,"to overturn these horrible anti-family laws, we've prepared the ""families come first"" initiative. now, the first thing we're gonna need is money."
67531,Marge,i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school?
55753,Marge,"aw honey, i know what you're going through. when i was a girl i had a crush on bobby sherman."
57821,Marge,he doesn't hate you. he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
62211,Marge,...then take bart to get c-i-r-c-u-m-c-i-s-e-d.
59558,Marge,"all right, otto can get married here. but homer, you have to get rid of that elephant."
62543,Marge,i thought it was arm wrestling.
61410,Marge,"oh homie, i've had the most exciting day..."
64767,Marge,that's crazy talk!
66273,Marge,not now. take out that pillow and put it in room three.
64250,Marge,i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
66372,Marge,"no! i'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and i might just have a secret weapon."
67434,Marge,"well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to capital city."
59251,Marge,"how about this ""pöpli""?"
65794,Marge,you should know that me saying i don't care means i couldn't care more.
65066,Marge,can you read by it?
60982,Marge,"don't worry, honey. you can win without him."
55390,Marge,"kids, i won't be home tonight, so i'm leaving you some low-cal microwavable tv dinners."
62236,Marge,homer!
59464,Marge,"""dear countryman: you have come in search of my gold, and i will not disappoint you."""
67080,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
57243,Marge,"i'm honored, bart. and lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with dad. you've been interested in nuclear power for years."
57098,Marge,are you hiding something? what do you have under your jacket?
55483,Marge,who's watching the kwik-e-mart?
56244,Marge,"homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
54667,Marge,what's his name again?
62503,Marge,"he was a singer in the sixties, like the archies and the banana splits."
60023,Marge,"we've got to get to the hospital, homer!"
62867,Marge,"oh, hey ned! isn't today your cat's birthday? i remember 'cause she shares the date with patty labelle!"
56111,Marge,ooh. that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
63377,Marge,styrofoam?
59052,Marge,"hold on, wha-- that's our basement?"
67918,Marge,"hello, krusty."
64791,Marge,i know where we are! this is the neighborhood where i grew up!
66406,Marge,go! go! go!
60373,Marge,"when homer's jaw was crushed-crushed-crushed, his life took a nitro-burning funny turn!"
62469,Marge,you already said that!
65864,Marge,"i thought you might be cold, honey, so i put this chinchilla coat on you."
56519,Marge,"homie, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life?"
65082,Marge,"well... newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
66269,Marge,"enough! stop! christmas carols only have one verse! well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
59061,Marge,"well, maybe for your wedding!"
65677,Marge,there's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere. at least maybe a piñata...?
59591,Marge,why would i do that?
59191,Marge,you're pouring hot butter on my leg!
67038,Marge,homer?
58295,Marge,"ooo... did you hear that, lisa?"
59999,Marge,"hm, quite a promotion."
67085,Marge,is this going to be on tv?
59199,Marge,i'm afraid so. and his wife's with him.
67144,Marge,a little warm and moist.
58574,Marge,"lisa, look out! a skeleton!"
56905,Marge,"oh, it was no trouble. the hobos at the dump were very helpful. except one man who seemed to have mental problems."
64223,Marge,a key to your apartment!
67761,Marge,"homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?"
64494,Marge,my favorite subject. i'll go first. isn't he cute?
63158,Marge,"gil's gone? but i have a ""no"" inside me that has to come out."
56267,Marge,"homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. although i must say, it's certainly refreshing."
63307,Marge,i played a day and a night!
58727,Marge,"you really should have voted, homer."
57988,Marge,"honey, it'll be morning soon. try and get some sleep."
59383,Marge,party? no! no parties.
63144,Marge,"and that's why i have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even gil!"
65759,Marge,"except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job."
67098,Marge,it's because of your irreverent attitude that bart thinks he can sneak headphones into sunday school.
55759,Marge,and this is for my huggy bug in honor of this special day.
57604,Marge,"all right, kids. we'll meet you at the top. just be careful!"
63767,Marge,the father of lurleen lumpkin?
63961,Marge,"i know. we had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. the important thing is, we love each other."
58135,Marge,"well, if you mean the money, i suppose we'll just replace the items the burglar took from--"
67606,Marge,"mr. hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
56605,Marge,oh yes.
56048,Marge,yes.
54868,Marge,seventy-five dollars? ned must be desperate!
57143,Marge,"it fits like a dream, too. but we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. it wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. if it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
56917,Marge,"well, all right, but i'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
57138,Marge,we can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. we just need a tv. we're going to go to the outlet mall in ogdenville.
54917,Marge,"oh homer, this is awful."
55176,Marge,i think he needs a dog house.
59894,Marge,no we're not. you're going down.
58767,Marge,"oh look, it's woody harrelson."
56219,Marge,"you know, mom, you and abe have a lot in common. umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam."
61739,Marge,i swear bart didn't know what he was doing. he was deaf!
67440,Marge,"let's see. upper, upper, upper mezzanine. hmmm. yes, these must be ours."
65084,Marge,because i have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. turns out it was a substitute.
66923,Marge,you can look now.
60164,Marge,oh.
61174,Marge,"nelson, leggings?"
66472,Marge,"homie, i love you. but you can be a challenge, like doing the daily jumble."
67923,Marge,"homer, i don't know you. my wife and your wife are friends. we met just three hours ago."
58022,Marge,what?!
64709,Marge,"you didn't see a boy lose his swim trunks, did you?"
67024,Marge,"that's better, homer. be brave. bye bye, bart. you were always my special little guy."
66405,Marge,"ooh, what's your hurry?"
56813,Marge,"they didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
55427,Marge,"see you later, kids. ah've got to go rehearse with ned."
59828,Marge,you remember jack... he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
58208,Marge,we can't just give up our home. there's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.
61947,Marge,"maybe when the tooth fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized you're not a little boy anymore. so she gave you a grown-up gift."
57044,Marge,sweet dreams.
57557,Marge,uh... oh...
56517,Marge,you could make a lot of money.
57462,Marge,"homie, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep."
55668,Marge,"hello?... yes... oh, dear lord! homer's in the hospital! they think it's his heart."
55879,Marge,amazing!
67072,Marge,shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
61032,Marge,"oh, that's so sweet. i was tired of putting my keys in that bowl, like a cave man."
66100,Marge,when does it get better? when he's eight hundred pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie?
57953,Marge,"that's right, i'm a witch! and i'm the one who withered your livestock, soured your sheeps' milk and made your shirts itchy."
62968,Marge,carpool!
55452,Marge,come on. we're going to be late.
66561,Marge,the water's gonna get cold!
58178,Marge,that backyard is a disgrace. now get busy.
65805,Marge,this so-called educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!
58621,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, put your poncho on!"
65766,Marge,uh oh. i wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians.
59346,Marge,"i'm home, everybody! gee, the house looks great!"
60400,Marge,"artie, that's a sick idea. come on, homer, we're leaving."
59089,Marge,bart!
62652,Marge,"well, maybe someone else can help you, but i am not a drug grocer!"
67543,Marge,... and the horse i rode in on!?
60491,Marge,"bartrand, where is your sister joan? morning bells are ringing. morning bells are ringing!"
57140,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. can it be real chanel?"
58027,Marge,i'm just so honored to have you here in our home.
55771,Marge,"homie, do you ever drink alone?"
55686,Marge,no.
61886,Marge,"nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?"
59469,Marge,"i wrote a poem for barney on this special occasion. ""now that you're one year older, the time flew by so fast..."""
57851,Marge,"lisa, no! this place is just a jail for children."
60769,Marge,i'm afraid all that attention is from the wrong kind of people.
66364,Marge,jasper beardley! you'll never make it!
58828,Marge,"just when i think i have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses."
61161,Marge,"oh, don't be a wuss."
65217,Marge,my dessert!
66783,Marge,"there's a yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
58090,Marge,that's dilapidated.
62936,Marge,"hey, that was my iced tea. i just sweetened it to my liking!"
55229,Marge,bart's grades are up a little this term. but lisa's are way down.
65546,Marge,i brought this on us all. it began when i was a girl...
57287,Marge,there might be one in this cooler.
63808,Marge,"sweetie, i'm usually your number one fan. but, call me old-fashioned, i usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world."
65310,Marge,"uh oh, a draggy backpack."
60918,Marge,maybe death will stop your yammering!
55823,Marge,homie! you're all right!
66913,Marge,"a pony? oh, lisa. you've asked for that for the last three years and i keep telling you santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. can't you take a hint?"
64513,Marge,"it's like when your father and i left the movie ""carrie"" right after she was crowned prom queen! she was so happy -- she'd had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her!"
67130,Marge,"you bought that bowling ball for you, not for me."
60593,Marge,"tonight, we invite both manjula and apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming."
56796,Marge,"it's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
62599,Marge,"bob, your generosity and abondanza have touched our hearts."
65770,Marge,"maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass."
62588,Marge,"ooh, marriage!"
60088,Marge,"oh, no. a salesbot!"
61835,Marge,"well, i didn't come this far not to cheat."
64068,Marge,"no, no. i'm just happy i can finally serve this cake."
64320,Marge,"""eat, pray, love."""
59333,Marge,owww!!
61030,Marge,sounds good to me.
65445,Marge,well of course they don't.
59002,Marge,"well, they're in the business. real people might not be so understanding."
56093,Marge,oh my! i had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
62934,Marge,only if he'll kiss me back.
63025,Marge,"homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
56255,Marge,"kids, your father and i are going through a really tough time right now. and i don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
57305,Marge,"i know you're joking -- but it is! say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
65625,Marge,"well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain."
62424,Marge,maggie!
56411,Marge,"bart, i wish you wouldn't lie like that."
55557,Marge,worked for the carter administration?
57533,Marge,more sausage?
57885,Marge,my next-door neighbor? religious guy?
64921,Marge,"milhouse, i'm getting tired of waiting."
66277,Marge,"listen, i just wanted to say i'm sorry i overreacted. thank you all for coming."
58492,Marge,"all right, already! everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison!"
65953,Marge,fine. i'll just get rid of these itchy and mitchys.
63388,Marge,"i love santa's little helper, but i don't know if we can have him in our home anymore."
67289,Marge,these toys are just adorable. who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius?
60134,Marge,"i don't mean to be disrespectful, judge harm, but we are not bad parents. and there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
63311,Marge,my son is an evil knight! the most successful evil knight in all the earthland realms! not bad.
57668,Marge,you're being ridiculous.
60327,Marge,"please, homie. dump the sugar. for me."
66173,Marge,feels like this play date's gone on forever.
60904,Marge,but aren't there side effects?
63490,Marge,"i'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. no one comes between me and my homie."
66474,Marge,hair volumizer... cologne?
55630,Marge,dennis... brad... mavis... brad...
58267,Marge,"what'd he say, lisa? what'd he say?"
64773,Marge,the pie was poisoned. you were right! i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
66437,Marge,great! now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
56976,Marge,i don't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie.
58504,Marge,"homer, you've got it set on ""whore."""
58304,Marge,mmmaybe he needs some real friends.
60456,Marge,"well, we're not giving up. we're going to cure you of drinking."
58413,Marge,what happened to grampa? he was supposed to baby-sit.
55147,Marge,okay.
55094,Marge,you're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
56906,Marge,"bart, it's class photo day. no dracula fangs."
54891,Marge,"look, i know bart can be a handful but i also know what he's like inside. he's got a spark. it's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
56573,Marge,"oh, homer. don't start stalking people again. it's so illegal. remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
54935,Marge,yes.
64795,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
64779,Marge,soy sauce!
67614,Marge,goodness!
65470,Marge,"there was enough talking during the movie! this date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""date night."""
66371,Marge,that was a sexual harassment seminar!
64903,Marge,"we called ourselves ""the cool moms."""
58414,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to take the kids with us to dinner."
60370,Marge,"oh homer, save me, save me!"
59278,Marge,"""her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."""
67233,Marge,who is this?
59478,Marge,"well, if barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. old friends stick together, like o.j. and a.c., or the falcon and the snowman."
61212,Marge,here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge!
58351,Marge,"you said this monkey would be sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters. and now he just lies there, struggling to breathe."
65790,Marge,"turn right onto first street, head east. homer, watch the road! not this road, the other road!"
63745,Marge,teach?
59857,Marge,"oh, look at you two. you look so ""couple-y."""
62844,Marge,"maple syrup, mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff! this is going to take my whole arsenal at once!"
61743,Marge,"if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, i do hate americans!"
65449,Marge,"no. we saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. and we made just enough for an economy cabin!"
63796,Marge,"lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. maggie and i are washing the soiled foam fingers."
62579,Marge,"when i joined, i never thought we'd be robbing people."
63035,Marge,"you're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself, 'cause i quit... and i'm taking this with me!"
64664,Marge,thank you... you're very sweet...
59216,Marge,but it's only been one night.
58776,Marge,"oh, no!"
62486,Marge,"don't listen to them, maggie. maggie?"
66998,Marge,maybe we should move to a larger community.
65129,Marge,apology accepted. now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
66531,Marge,i'd like to be alone for a while.
56481,Marge,"well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
56672,Marge,you are?
58747,Marge,it's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of admiral.
61334,Marge,"aw, look how happy she is."
65144,Marge,"oh, homie..."
56773,Marge,i'd be thrilled. you can start right now.
65215,Marge,a wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
61672,Marge,"oh my god, homie! look!"
56691,Marge,"""dear mr. sherman. on behalf of the people of springfield, i would like to invite you to judge our film festival."""
67077,Marge,"oh, i don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, lisa."
57341,Marge,it does seem nicer than springfield.
58010,Marge,you shouldn't pressure bart like that.
61933,Marge,"homer, look!"
63805,Marge,we never get more than one move into this game.
56751,Marge,"well, it's just easier this way."
56136,Marge,"homie, you should be proud. only a handful of people have done what you've done."
65731,Marge,everything's normal. the world didn't end.
67462,Marge,the father of the loser mows the lawn -- 
64426,Marge,"and even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. it might be another sister."
57300,Marge,"no, springfield is ""america's crud-bucket."" at least according to newsweek."
61196,Marge,"no, you'll be fine. i'll be right back."
54941,Marge,that's no reason to buy a pony!
60039,Marge,could i have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
65707,Marge,"this isn't the learn zone. darn it, it's a fun place!"
62159,Marge,now pull over!
66790,Marge,what did you give him?
57360,Marge,that's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.
55332,Marge,i don't understand this. why can't you stay with your parents?
56218,Marge,that's not my mother.
57881,Marge,"uh huh, that explains the flags. what about the dog food?"
59417,Marge,it's hard to believe we're never going to see maude again.
58051,Marge,is this all we're going to do today?
56229,Marge,"mom, you can't marry mr. burns! he's an evil man!"
66430,Marge,"oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?"
56482,Marge,"at any rate, i believe you and i think you should go outside and straighten this out. some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
57729,Marge,"wait! wait! you can't do this! all my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. now, i'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. our freedom to drink."
61274,Marge,i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
56980,Marge,just a second!
62493,Marge,i'll take it! i can't believe i own a tandem bike!
63122,Marge,"when you're done putting lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day."
62494,Marge,"our tandem bicycle! when i bought it, you said you'd ride with me."
55071,Marge,"no, because i love you."
56095,Marge,just a minute! don't hang up!
64035,Marge,just stop.
59756,Marge,they're arresting him right now!
56376,Marge,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's little helper. do you want me to write any of this down?"
56174,Marge,"gosh, i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
61385,Marge,"and lord, if you think i'm making lemon bars for your bake sale sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
67733,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
61268,Marge,"oh, look at all these classy british plays."
59544,Marge,and you look adorable.
56804,Marge,"well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
60014,Marge,it was an accident!
64049,Marge,homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. i'm afraid it's growing out of hand.
64224,Marge,"and i've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment."
63663,Marge,...anus! ...anus! ...anus!
60674,Marge,i've got a whole list of things for you to do today.
61587,Marge,"homie, i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
66353,Marge,"homer, quit badgering the boy."
66002,Marge,"you'll need your voice to say ""thanks, mom"" after your next recital!"
60100,Marge,uh-huh. absolutely. / yep. /
67479,Marge,here you go.
60027,Marge,"oh, he's on the blue man group again. c'mon, we've got lotsa time."
57319,Marge,"hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight!"
67646,Marge,"get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!"
65851,Marge,someone's coming!
57518,Marge,"i woke up and you weren't there, and i was so worried..."
63141,Marge,"he's still in need, we have to let him stay. it's what dr. king would want us to do."
57370,Marge,somebody stop the fight! where's the doctor?!
58328,Marge,if milhouse jumped off a cliff--
62245,Marge,"bart, i spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak. have some."
59027,Marge,forget it. nobody's riding any...
57485,Marge,one at a time.
56933,Marge,"i miss the way bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
66706,Marge,the one you booked for us at owl haven. the one you have to reserve a year in advance.
65867,Marge,"ned, homie's a little cranky right now. more than his eye, i think you hurt his feelings."
58563,Marge,"oh, am i in the way?"
61645,Marge,"opinion noted. now if you don't mind, your father and i are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy."
60091,Marge,that voice could use a little personality.
62066,Marge,"so veronica, what do you do?"
61611,Marge,every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
65045,Marge,"oh, i always forget about this part."
55890,Marge,with your father on the road all the time i tried to compensate for his absence...
58045,Marge,what?! she didn't do anything.
67880,Marge,"oh, my."
64548,Marge,i'm going to find my husband. but don't depress the kids.
62003,Marge,i'm afraid so.
65909,Marge,this list is from six years ago.
55070,Marge,"homer, do you know why i married you?"
58602,Marge,secure.
61545,Marge,"we should do more together. you're my best friend, homie."
59283,Marge,"thank you, ramrod."
65683,Marge,"also, i didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because i don't breastfeed!"
59927,Marge,"yeah, but what can you do?"
59301,Marge,"homer, stop! no, you don't understand!"
56372,Marge,"now wait a minute. i'm not sure about this. every time we've ever gone on vacation, i end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
65871,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie? is a book character having difficulties?"
60427,Marge,we can't take his money.
62289,Marge,may eighteenth? that's one week from today!
55177,Marge,i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
62518,Marge,uh... she died.
54965,Marge,"homer, be nice."
62285,Marge,"so, you still think i'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings?"
59356,Marge,does anybody need that much porno?
58433,Marge,ooh. there's the turn!
64503,Marge,"i should be, i'm left-handed. i've been using my right hand all these years 'cause i didn't want to seem unusual in any way."
57467,Marge,why? am i pregnant?
64179,Marge,five more water heaters and we get a free water heater!
57767,Marge,"no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
57339,Marge,"homer, i don't want to leave springfield. i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to hoist myself out of it."
61356,Marge,"attention, everyone."
61013,Marge,we can't sell the house. we can't live here. what are we going to do?
64149,Marge,i'm afraid i'm just... ms. simpson now.
65447,Marge,"just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie."
55816,Marge,it's true. you have good coping skills.
59120,Marge,"a drug? i know bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
55288,Marge,fine. see if i care.
67659,Marge,sometimes it's fun to use candles.
57987,Marge,"not right now, dear."
59650,Marge,do you have to talk like that?
64739,Marge,"homie, you know what happens when you push your luck..."
60068,Marge,"oh, look! a shooting star!"
59722,Marge,homie!
66139,Marge,who are you talking to?
56487,Marge,"homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. it's not gonna happen."
67710,Marge,"merci, i guess."
57964,Marge,homer. we gotta get out of here.
56474,Marge,"homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
66053,Marge,"selma, cheating is a sin. as much a sin as not replying to an instant message. so, if you'll excuse me, i've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!"
63831,Marge,"it doesn't work that way, homie."
66850,Marge,"well, i drive all day and i don't get paid a thing. with the money you make, i could buy a fridge with... an icemaker."
61393,Marge,then i'll do it!
64241,Marge,queen elizabeth ruled over all of england.
56188,Marge,are you sure you can get him back for us?
62873,Marge,have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?
62698,Marge,here's my mask!
65941,Marge,i don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
64877,Marge,right before christmas?
60944,Marge,well here's another low-rated annual event -- spring cleaning!
61798,Marge,i never stopped telling you.
67208,Marge,so how was the office birthday party?
59254,Marge,maggie loves baby talk.
57553,Marge,now you're the one who's being naive.
62321,Marge,"bart, i'm glad you had fun, but i wouldn't get too into that catholic church. with all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like simon says without a winner!"
67037,Marge,"i'm sorry, everybody. but i've only got two cupcakes for the three of you."
56913,Marge,"""good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa."" mineral bath, facial, massage... how did you afford these?"
61106,Marge,family head-count!
60803,Marge,"well, okay. blow out that lamp and i'll take off my victorian undergarments."
58954,Marge,"oh, how cute. let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."""
55194,Marge,"oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
58832,Marge,"oopsie. mm, this could take a minute."
66123,Marge,please. i need people here who are helpful and sensitive.
65367,Marge,wanna make out over the foul line?
62168,Marge,this is the worst crisis the springfield cultural activities board has ever faced.
59912,Marge,but...
63565,Marge,dwight? are you okay?! dwight!
60235,Marge,"her?! she's just kidding, mr. lord."
61447,Marge,"no problem! in elementary school, we girls learned about sacagawea while the boys were learning math!"
59269,Marge,a fifties-style restaurant.
59329,Marge,you mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
56576,Marge,"i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer."
66596,Marge,lakwando's mind won't be on the game. aaaand benched.
67381,Marge,"i'm in the kitchen, homer!"
63641,Marge,i appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. but the truth is... i'm way too successful for you now. i'm gettin' me a trophy husband!
66710,Marge,my biggest sin is that i dare to hope.
60347,Marge,but breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. maybe we can go.
55208,Marge,"oh, homie. you're good at lots of things."
63092,Marge,"i'm so glad you like it, moe."
65490,Marge,homer!
58442,Marge,"oh, isn't it romantic? doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see."
66413,Marge,"that's okay sweetheart. your pig thingy didn't mean it. it's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched tv, there was art going on behind us."
57230,Marge,"what are you going to do with all your money, mr. lampwick?"
59922,Marge,what kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
58107,Marge,"look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the flanders will be."
67529,Marge,so television's responsible.
57486,Marge,now i remember why i put
66235,Marge,"thank you, mr. bergstrom. i'll tell lisa you dropped by."
62864,Marge,it's so great to have my children back.
55057,Marge,"oh, homie. hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking."
64348,Marge,"mm, there's something odd about this beer."
66915,Marge,a tattoo!
64185,Marge,"no it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!"
63553,Marge,"oh, poor johnny stabbo..."
62067,Marge,no surprises there.
64672,Marge,"you have to admit, ""bart simpson will die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
61489,Marge,grocers don't make that much.
67896,Marge,"hmmm, i notice little things about your father, too."
60958,Marge,"homer, don't make things worse."
58417,Marge,"look at this little plastic couple. mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future..."
61436,Marge,well... there is a place called nantucket.
67724,Marge,"i don't know, but it is."
64239,Marge,the year was 1588.
62501,Marge,"well, i heard neil young sing about her..."
55020,Marge,"hmmm, what do you think about?"
66879,Marge,uh... pop culture and current events.
64916,Marge,just a little merloooot.
64698,Marge,"have fun, homie."
59783,Marge,oh no!
57656,Marge,"yes, i have something that i'd like to sell."
54711,Marge,darn these long bank lines. although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. darn these long bank lines.
61595,Marge,i hope he didn't have children. did he have children?
57417,Marge,"i'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable dos equis bottle. it's about a certain house in our town..."
64999,Marge,"and remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. save lust and rage for me and the kids."
60328,Marge,"gee, everyone looks so happy."
65762,Marge,there's really only one choice. or should i say two identical choices?
59010,Marge,"hey, that's cute."
67521,Marge,"how'd it go, homer?"
65283,Marge,that's toothpaste!
65624,Marge,you never looked up to him.
60260,Marge,and a happy and healthy new year.
55388,Marge,"she complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave."
60368,Marge,go around! go around!
63847,Marge,oh my god! this is an erotic bakery!
67597,Marge,hmmm... yes and no.
61603,Marge,"we're having ""make your own taco"" night."
65898,Marge,i'm going to take a cab.
65597,Marge,"ooh, homie, you've lost weight."
60851,Marge,"oh thank you, sweetie."
60757,Marge,"homer, let me explain something--"
64438,Marge,and i even got rainbow sprinkles!
64105,Marge,we'll make it up to you. we'll do something you've always wanted to do but never got the chance.
61177,Marge,our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded native american. say hello to jim proudfoot from the mohican tribe.
66465,Marge,you can do better!
63963,Marge,"another religion? you know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when you go to college and get a jewish boyfriend."
60538,Marge,there's nothing to be afraid of. they're all grown by the vegetable division of union carbide.
64121,Marge,hello?
60340,Marge,how was your day? do you really want to know?
55942,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
55548,Marge,"hmm, i think you have to keep your job too."
58008,Marge,"ooo, he's quite a little dancer."
61286,Marge,"oh, dear lord."
60663,Marge,"homie, please. why don't you just leave town?"
55211,Marge,"oh, dear."
66842,Marge,"i've printed out our driving plan! if we work together, we can get bart to his sports...lisa to her music...and maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today."
61888,Marge,no! i want to hear what happened at the store!
59032,Marge,"well, it's not really on our walking route..."
66927,Marge,thank god for homer's christmas bonus.
61029,Marge,"you're so cute when you're begging for sex, but i'm just too tired."
63346,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, our marriage needs this bed."
59214,Marge,where'd you get that?
55141,Marge,kids! hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
60414,Marge,send the bill to baron von kiss-a-lot.
58757,Marge,but this will be so confusing. the mailman won't know what to do. did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
61162,Marge,i want to thank you all so much.
59935,Marge,he's not moving.
60054,Marge,"that's not my uncle lou, and this man's not dead."
65818,Marge,mm-hmm!
55103,Marge,well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
59085,Marge,"we'll go with ""ow, that hurts,"" skip!"
63710,Marge,did you just unlock the car from here?
57168,Marge,"oh, that would be a dream come true. i'll be there with bells on!"
63835,Marge,fine.
56925,Marge,i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. that is so like me.
65658,Marge,"""scientists prove cat heaven real, human heaven not"" that's so sad..."
65576,Marge,"homer, the reason i hate this car is... i think i want another baby!"
63397,Marge,i've only got twenty-seven minutes! the pre-heat is on!
66201,Marge,come on! just pick one!
66694,Marge,"okay, head count. one, two, three, where's maggie?!"
64137,Marge,bridezilla? a combination of bride and godzilla? how could you say that? more like you're a... king wrong!
57151,Marge,"ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
61975,Marge,"maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a ""dive."""
65006,Marge,we can. it'll be great. like a reality show without the cameras.
59755,Marge,"homie! homie, wake up! they've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!"
59943,Marge,stop! stop!
59447,Marge,when i get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
61218,Marge,"homie, i disagree with your approach to the children."
60215,Marge,"homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?"
59789,Marge,i'm a little disappointed. there were too many aprons.
64298,Marge,uh-huh...
64598,Marge,there's gotta be a clue here somewhere.
62618,Marge,"voila! which is french for ""ta da""!"
56339,Marge,"okay, homer."
65819,Marge,i don't think so. the u.s. embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield.
60271,Marge,"food keeps my family happy, so i make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'cause at six o'clock, we go live!"
57329,Marge,it saved our marriage!
59667,Marge,"ooh, why didn't you say so? hey, is there a bathroom here?"
67764,Marge,patty! selma! we're home.
67868,Marge,i can't believe it.
64261,Marge,"no, it was homer!"
62432,Marge,"no!!! here, here play with your teddy bear."
55868,Marge,mr. hutz!
59719,Marge,but i do feel bad about the starving children...
59695,Marge,"oh, how cute! kids, look who's on the roof!"
57630,Marge,"that shary bobbins is a miracle worker. the kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. it's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!"
66127,Marge,well... i guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
61326,Marge,i've dreamed of the day you'd say that!
57783,Marge,that's ridiculous. nobody is watching us right now.
57101,Marge,"there's no place left to run, bart. hand it over."
67059,Marge,"lisa, i apologize to you. i was wrong. i take it all back. always be yourself. you want to be sad, honey, be sad. we'll ride it out with you. and when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. from now on, let me do the smiling for both of us."
65317,Marge,"it seemed a little... ""ripe"", so i brought it home to clean it for you."
57990,Marge,"down here, homer."
55616,Marge,"homie, please don't go."
60550,Marge,and now i'm guilty of possession! i could go to prison! unless i testify against you...
66962,Marge,shhh!
65971,Marge,no husband of mine is wearing a tent!
62988,Marge,"cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
67831,Marge,"homer, what are you saying?"
55540,Marge,"well, it's been two months. you laid down the law and i'm proud of you. but i think we've gotten through to him."
63479,Marge,we're trapped. your fans will rip us to pieces.
65504,Marge,no video... party over... caaaake!
61016,Marge,that's ccr!
61890,Marge,sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
55255,Marge,what's that?
63516,Marge,"homer, you do know what tomorrow is."
66112,Marge,"ben, ramona, i wanna tell you something i've learned over ten years of marriage. the secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train."
65973,Marge,"every time i call grampa's phone, i get no answer."
67696,Marge,i'm sorry.
66271,Marge,"it's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
62713,Marge,i could never think something that horrible.
57130,Marge,"well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
60121,Marge,"well, you can tell she's never had kids. look how high and firm her breasts are."
54691,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
66374,Marge,and that's why nancy no is the most popular girl in promiseville high.
60520,Marge,he's so adorable. can we have another baby?
58356,Marge,"it's a ""kisses-make-me-boogie-o-lantern."""
63140,Marge,i guess you can stay a little longer.
58393,Marge,"whoops! there goes carlsbad caverns. oh, well."
56984,Marge,no.
61627,Marge,"they're all too old to be dressed up like super-people. homer, let's just hurry up and go home so i can yell at you."
57500,Marge,"well, i just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
65273,Marge,"people learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. and now, patty and selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
54898,Marge,"oh, dear. this is the fifth time he's cancelled. how can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
55737,Marge,... we really appreciate your taking the children on such short notice.
65628,Marge,but i thought you still loved him.
60649,Marge,"finally, some repression."
58866,Marge,"oh, oh, okay, calm down. just think: what would curtis e. bear do?"
57281,Marge,so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
61298,Marge,maggie's locked inside!
62496,Marge,"bart, how'd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom?"
60304,Marge,don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
59812,Marge,"yeah, see how much better that feels?"
66151,Marge,awww...
57616,Marge,"homie, please, i never ask for much, but this is something i really need."
65086,Marge,you can start with the rinse!
55700,Marge,"homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
57510,Marge,woo-woo!
64246,Marge,all i have are some dry-cleaning coupons.
60535,Marge,"all right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?"
59649,Marge,"homer, it's you!! i thought i'd never see you again."
54709,Marge,where is he?! where is he?!
58670,Marge,"oh, that's cute. did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
58227,Marge,"homer, you know i always try to put the best face on everything. but there's no face on that damn bean! we hate it here and the family wants to leave."
55817,Marge,why'd you bring that up?
66115,Marge,find love on the net
65878,Marge,power.
59734,Marge,marge.
56098,Marge,"i don't know, bart. you're only ten."
57377,Marge,"i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had. the mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage."
58071,Marge,easement!
59523,Marge,that's south dakota.
64549,Marge,i'm sorry we ever fought.
64284,Marge,ooh.
63691,Marge,"anyway, i was growing to admire my professor more and more..."
62521,Marge,so... is that standing water?
59113,Marge,eewww!!
66142,Marge,just one m & m.
66528,Marge,one drink.
64631,Marge,i don't see what's so wonderful.
61050,Marge,i can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
54989,Marge,"homie, why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him? i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
62904,Marge,uh-huh. and him.
56545,Marge,the kids at school were even worse.
66480,Marge,"homie, i felt terrible when you said i felt ""stuck"" with you. but then, i realized: i am stuck with you. i couldn't stop loving you if i tried."
66167,Marge,it's bart!
58520,Marge,one reward coming up. ta-da!
62792,Marge,he was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
67635,Marge,"bart, please."
59721,Marge,"oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
56743,Marge,"hey, what did i just say?!!"
59282,Marge,stop that! if you want some food i'll be happy to make you some breakfast.
63219,Marge,"i just found this note in bart's room! ""dear mom and dad: me and my girlfriend darcy have gone to utah to get married. f.y.i., she's pregnant""!"
56163,Marge,"well, they will."
58812,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
64800,Marge,my memorables!
60856,Marge,summary emergency!
56586,Marge,"okay, tv off. it's family time."
58253,Marge,"internet, eh?"
60772,Marge,eighty-nine percent of americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.
56202,Marge,"well, bart, your uncle arthur used to have a saying, ""shoot 'em all and let god sort 'em out."" unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. it took seventy-five federal marshals to bring him down. now, let's never speak of him again."
59290,Marge,"well, good. i guess."
66745,Marge,homer simpson!
66699,Marge,"my sweet baby! ooh, it feels like you have a full diaper."
63159,Marge,"even though gil left, i still have to kick him out. i need this, or i'll never be able to say ""no."""
62747,Marge,"well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
59564,Marge,let me talk to otto.
61666,Marge,"yeah, i've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone."
64290,Marge,that's odd. there isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
60619,Marge,"that woman is taking advantage of you, and we need you to do things around here. the oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium."
67932,Marge,maybe i should run this by my husband first.
55604,Marge,"yes, but it was..."
59115,Marge,"homer, what are you doing here?"
63230,Marge,"mr. burns, we're so sorry. the plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, mr. smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock."
61882,Marge,can i get you a glass of milk?
67177,Marge,"good night, homer."
58874,Marge,get in! get in!
62691,Marge,"ned, that's so generous. but there must be something i could do in return."
62571,Marge,"bye, ladies. you can text-message me any time."
62051,Marge,but reverend... scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament's proscriptions.
57699,Marge,"i know she's young, but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
63507,Marge,one hug can't hurt!
57195,Marge,"oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?"
55954,Marge,"no, i'm the head vampire!"
57560,Marge,mmm... hmm... that's not bad.
64039,Marge,it's the first day of school!
59123,Marge,how will we get bart to take these?
55709,Marge,how fast are they going?
64689,Marge,that's nice. what kind of favor?
58075,Marge,for me?
56555,Marge,okay. okay... but you're gonna make a big deal outta this. he was a pilot.
63822,Marge,"come on, homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever."
59507,Marge,a diner!?
56170,Marge,a female deer.
56841,Marge,i didn't mean to.
63260,Marge,i don't think we're doing this right.
66350,Marge,dr. hibbert.
62730,Marge,"what are you doing, homer?"
63216,Marge,"aw, grampa. we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can."
65152,Marge,don't touch the scab!
57935,Marge,"you know, homer... i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?"
56371,Marge,oooh. recipe-related bumper cars.
55099,Marge,"actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums--"
56563,Marge,my father was a stewardess.
64582,Marge,no thanks.
62247,Marge,"well until that day, i'm still bart's mother, and i don't like him stuffing himself with junk."
56588,Marge,"all right, family time begins now."
58696,Marge,you're guarding the mayor tonight? after fat tony swore revenge?
62360,Marge,can he swim?
60823,Marge,"ooh, these turtles know just where the knots are. it just shows you god has a plan for every creature."
54960,Marge,the kwik-e-mart.
55251,Marge,"lisa, i'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of encyclopedia generica from the grocery store."
65494,Marge,"well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor."
60678,Marge,aren't you a dear.
60648,Marge,homer!
64364,Marge,fine. i'll take off one glove.
61650,Marge,"homie, you know i'm usually good for a triple-x throw down, but between those kids and going to uncle tyrone's, we can't be alone."
56712,Marge,"homie, you voted for the right movie. i'm glad you were on the jury."
55688,Marge,my name is marge simpson and i have an idea. it may sound a little boring at first...
61515,Marge,"you took little children to ""the re-deadening""?!"
55590,Marge,you could see our house in that photo.
60229,Marge,do a nice one for grandma.
59488,Marge,"maybe you should see a doctor, homie. a head doctor."
65174,Marge,i guess we could make a sprint for one of these local establishments.
58021,Marge,"wellll, look who's the ladies' man..."
55113,Marge,"well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... and these... oh look! little bow ties."
62899,Marge,you drink?
56130,Marge,"homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut. you didn't even know how to use a touchtone. but i still respected you, and i always will, no matter what."
58069,Marge,"so, you're married and you're looking for your first house, mr. and mrs..."
65088,Marge,"homie, you're making my toes curl. you sure know how to please a woman."
67751,Marge,"but homer, i'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home."
54596,Marge,i did tell you.
67114,Marge,"well, isn't this nice?"
57135,Marge,president bush is driving on our lawn! he must be lost.
59589,Marge,"why do i always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""shut up, becky!"" ooh, that would've been sweet."
62563,Marge,i'm going out for some air.
67002,Marge,"are you coming in, homer?"
61713,Marge,i told my friends i had a date...
57461,Marge,fine. i'll go without you.
66682,Marge,our water was on fire!
60660,Marge,"homie, to honor springfield's newest hero, i made you your favorite dinner. all three courses are dessert."
62149,Marge,i'll have you know i could have married sideshow mel!
62106,Marge,"hey, hey, it's krusty the clown! what do you say, krusty?"
55459,Marge,"no, homer. he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, lord. he just likes to sleep in on sundays..."
55797,Marge,lisa needs braces.
56850,Marge,"homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
62590,Marge,we've passed the ponte vecchio bridge three times. i think we're lost.
56811,Marge,"homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. you'll always be the man of this house."
59418,Marge,"now homey, you know, ned and the boys need us. and you know what that means."
57846,Marge,"i tell you, chief, i just don't know what we're going to do with him."
63454,Marge,it's marge simpson. i need you to coach like you've never coached before.
64083,Marge,but that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
66965,Marge,what's going on up there?
55569,Marge,"hmm, actually, i was thinking of ""funny hat day."""
67451,Marge,"homer, i'm your best friend, but i've gotta say, i've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor."
63385,Marge,eat some corn!
62373,Marge,and treated like i deserve.
55510,Marge,"thank you, dear. now be good for grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. we'll bring back dinner."
56900,Marge,"besides, she didn't mean it. it was an accident."
66037,Marge,"oh, that's perfect."
64520,Marge,"the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil...,the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil,9

66194,Marge,"jumping on the bed. but i never disobeyed my parents, till i married you."
55067,Marge,any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
67628,Marge,...all that time.
64393,Marge,"it's fun to cook dinner together. homer and i never do it anymore. cook together, that is."
67715,Marge,bringing up a son -- even a blind one -- isn't a lifetime occupation. now the more you help him--
64869,Marge,next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house.
61831,Marge,"well, it's not my fault! lisa, the people in this bake-off are stinkers, who pushed me and pushed me, like the pushy-wushies they are!"
67624,Marge,"...but, well, i guess he did miss three days of school --"
55705,Marge,who are you?
64251,Marge,i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth.
65106,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie."
57194,Marge,"but, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
57574,Marge,here you go -- free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone! one bite and you'll be hooked!
66546,Marge,pizza. mmmm.
57691,Marge,how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob?
59594,Marge,do i have to be dead before you'll help me?
55927,Marge,"homer! you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
60608,Marge,"well, your father ate it all."
67482,Marge,you knew that i was cooking a turkey.
63238,Marge,nothing like reading a well-plotted mystery on the beach. it's amazing how they always solve the crime just before they run out of pages.
60031,Marge,"well, i've already borrowed one car. let's go!"
61941,Marge,"well, looking at you kids, i know i made the right choice in life."
63051,Marge,cylinders?!
57434,Marge,school. school.
60521,Marge,"i don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to brazil."
67071,Marge,"homer, i'm telling you this is not the interstate."
63664,Marge,"milhouse, have you seen bart?"
62278,Marge,you have?! that's so nice!
62386,Marge,i've found a place where i'm needed.
62582,Marge,that's my special skill?
55253,Marge,i don't think you've thought this through.
64050,Marge,your majesty... did you remember to invite ned flanders?
62086,Marge,he brought home your homework when you were sick.
62103,Marge,just think about the day you found that junior mint in your bellybutton.
67255,Marge,"mmm-hmm. well, bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea."
55396,Marge,i'm auditioning for a play.
66109,Marge,what a wonderful anniversary.
63707,Marge,stop it! stop it!
66892,Marge,reverend! reverend! they took homer!
55260,Marge,here boy!
61388,Marge,"business, what business?"
62326,Marge,"forget it! and you know, i went to a catholic wedding once. the incense ruined my pantsuit!"
62234,Marge,"sweetheart, your friend ray is in your head."
60097,Marge,"pierce, that was delicious. can we help you with the dishes?"
63967,Marge,homie?
62653,Marge,i'm out of drugs! see how much money i made?!
58472,Marge,"all those eyes, just leering and leering at us."
60490,Marge,it's never joan van ark.
63192,Marge,how did you make it?
61347,Marge,"is that better? to me, ralph wiggum is sir lancelot."
64242,Marge,every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage.
63720,Marge,this is my husband...
62030,Marge,just poke through.
57260,Marge,are you sure? maybe it's just shampoo. that washes right out.
55333,Marge,"i know we didn't ask for this, homer, but doesn't the bible say, ""whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
59844,Marge,so you really didn't do it?
56907,Marge,no they didn't.
58318,Marge,"bart, it's too nice a day to leave ralph in a closet. you boys should go play outside."
59733,Marge,i'll do it. i always end up doing it.
65482,Marge,head injury?! why didn't you tell me?
64521,Marge,it was a footnote. see?
64076,Marge,there'll be another one in north yemen in 2027.
56634,Marge,"yes, homie?"
57121,Marge,homer! watch your mouth!
65292,Marge,"homie, i love you, and i'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world..."
61766,Marge,some anniversary this is.
58209,Marge,"we don't want to kill them, bart. we just want our home back."
62414,Marge,"lisa, honey. any chance you can stop reading soon?"
60256,Marge,so you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
57103,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this is the best present a mother could get."
64804,Marge,"but it's not good enough, is it?"
58726,Marge,i can't believe it passed.
55779,Marge,"please, homie, i know you can do this."
61003,Marge,"maggie, give me that!"
62298,Marge,the worst part is i'll never see my homie again!
66179,Marge,"you've had the same job, same car, same house for twenty years. and that's all you'll ever have. a cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change. and you're okay with it!"
56533,Marge,sure as sugar.
63331,Marge,you traded our mattress? i had my secret cash in it!
55805,Marge,because they love you down at the plant.
57657,Marge,nooo. it's an heirloom my grandmother passed down to me -- a very rare old figurine from the civil war.
64976,Marge,get your hands off my husband!
58014,Marge,"homer, please."
64908,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, because we're all getting together next week."
58455,Marge,"heh, heh. yeah."
57079,Marge,"what's wrong, honey?"
56909,Marge,"now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. that way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry! eh? eh?"
55014,Marge,"""barnacle bill's home pregnancy test""? homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
60582,Marge,how did you find out?
60389,Marge,congratulations on your recent tv appearance.
59572,Marge,thanks to our own spice girl: becky.
55264,Marge,"oh, there's a spot, dear."
63298,Marge,whoa! look at those bazooms!
57273,Marge,"you know what? i'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
55992,Marge,"phht, it's only midnight. come on, i know a place."
65180,Marge,back to the car!
54698,Marge,should i forgive him?...
54645,Marge,just do it already!
60842,Marge,"wow, this restaurant is so international. le pizza, der hamburger, señor grilled cheese... i hope i don't accidentally order an elephant."
65945,Marge,"oh sweetie, it's not for me. i wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding."
57397,Marge,and where is all that liquor coming from?
57214,Marge,"homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""little rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
55444,Marge,blanche.
57911,Marge,would you like to color something?
55924,Marge,what are you doin'?
64467,Marge,we've got a million dollars?! screw the toast!
59891,Marge,"now lisa, you know that's not true."
59852,Marge,i'd better put on the silencer.
59068,Marge,"hawaii, here we come!"
59141,Marge,i heard about a new bar where men dance with men. doesn't that sound adorable?
63099,Marge,the show starts at three. you promise you'll be here?
56018,Marge,are you sure it's safe?
61264,Marge,england is so classy. every cab has its own butler.
59945,Marge,i did it! i caught the school bus. now hurry up and get on.
58214,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homer. you got us our house back."
56897,Marge,"no. no, no. when i took your father's name, i took everything that came with it, including d.n.a."
63718,Marge,"out of the house, kids! i have to make an adult phone call."
59434,Marge,you've only been gone two days.
63703,Marge,"so that's the end of the story, huh?"
55871,Marge,i'll miss you too homie.
55214,Marge,"ohh, well, i guess he'll be happy when he comes to."
56919,Marge,it's like i'm on some wonderful drug!
66628,Marge,what am i going to do? i'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
60631,Marge,go away!
64774,Marge,"what do you mean, this one?"
64604,Marge,"bart? bart, are you here?"
59777,Marge,"oh, homer, where have you been?"
56369,Marge,it's shaped like a diner. and it's on this really tall pole.
66658,Marge,"well, i guess we could try it for a semester."
58198,Marge,"ooo, what a nice surprise! this is so generous of you, cooder."
66515,Marge,that sounds like fun. i'll just tell homer and--
57071,Marge,"oh, good. so get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the try-n-save."
63583,Marge,stop it! that's my favorite couch!
58988,Marge,you don't understand.
64596,Marge,of course you do. dylan's a... hm... let me check the invitation...
55352,Marge,i don't know if that tape is working. you ate three desserts tonight.
57311,Marge,you'll be my friend. i'm never gonna let you get away.
56814,Marge,"oh, homie, of course i will."
57800,Marge,"reverend, i gave ned flanders some bad advice. now he could be in real trouble."
59200,Marge,why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
64247,Marge,"lisa, let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband."
56425,Marge,"oh my, i hope that rug was scotchguarded."
60281,Marge,"oh, no. she's making him a sandwich."
57401,Marge,"now, the cat needs his medication every morning --"
66287,Marge,"when i watched that pirated movie, i was stealing with my eyes. so i'm repaying the good people in hollywood for the ticket i should have bought."
59000,Marge,"homer, what have you done?"
60449,Marge,take him outside.
59751,Marge,you're a pretty girl.
56373,Marge,"well, there was our trip to the amish country..."
58980,Marge,"hmm, i don't know. i studied art for years, but i just don't get this."
62363,Marge,i love you too...
63130,Marge,you have a bigger problem out there.
63523,Marge,"really? look at you... so grown up... well, i've moved on too..."
55349,Marge,milhouse?
65613,Marge,yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit grampa!
62613,Marge,"merry christmas, homie. i think you're really gonna like this."
54853,Marge,"lisa, what's gotten into you?"
58626,Marge,"i know you feel bad about the juice incident, but i'm sure you can make up for it somehow."
61206,Marge,you have your own baby monitor in our child's room?
61431,Marge,oh homie!
61239,Marge,"homer, it's two in the morning."
61315,Marge,perfect! i'll take it.
55832,Marge,what did you way?
60492,Marge,god wants you to lead the french army to what?
62535,Marge,really? could we do a duet?
65951,Marge,we can have the reception at wong lee's!
55822,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
62397,Marge,go back to your own country!
63773,Marge,i'm really worried about lurleen.
62394,Marge,we have to stop all this construction. the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jell-o.
61895,Marge,she's from springfield! i knew her in high school.
67344,Marge,bring the television up. bart's got his vision back!
65908,Marge,homer...
57558,Marge,"i'm sorry, agnes."
65193,Marge,what are you doing?
67025,Marge,"bart, what happened to you?"
55299,Marge,i'll love you for the rest of my life.
63399,Marge,i saw it first! / you are such a liar!
57366,Marge,thank you.
67383,Marge,"that does it. children, get dressed. we're leaving."
57115,Marge,ooh.
55760,Marge,"ah, thank you, dear."
61195,Marge,"moe, i gotta handle this. can you keep an eye on maggie?"
60720,Marge,a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
59518,Marge,restock the possum bar. we're almost out of claws.
65249,Marge,"for god's sakes, homer! i've given you three children!"
55217,Marge,"honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help."
54777,Marge,"don't gloat, homer. you know, bart, when i was your age, the one thing i wanted more than anything in the world was a child-sized electric lightbulb oven. my parents wouldn't give me the money, so i went to my sisters, patty and selma..."
66714,Marge,i'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
55529,Marge,we're home.
55998,Marge,i think they want us to stop.
62297,Marge,you couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! now good night!
62127,Marge,"can you help me unload this soup from the car? there was a sale, so i bought four hundred cans."
54838,Marge,"homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
56427,Marge,it's bliiiiisssss.
60166,Marge,it's about time mr. burns found a woman. i can't stand to see a man single.
58823,Marge,you just don't get it.
63935,Marge,"there's absolutely nothing to worry about! i'm in my own room, being chaperoned by an actual christian."
62088,Marge,it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
64930,Marge,i think they were never my friends... maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a mommy and me class. they're random people you meet in a college dorm.
62828,Marge,"when i was in school, i loved math. until..."
56363,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
60600,Marge,all right! girls night out! exotic male dancers at the golden banana!
60115,Marge,she'll be killed!
63571,Marge,"well i won't be home either. i'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains."
58066,Marge,selling real estate could be just what i'm looking for. i'd really like to give it a try.
63005,Marge,ooh! a j.c. penney's...used to be here.
63837,Marge,urchins!
66180,Marge,like i say night after night after night: nighty-night.
67732,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
60504,Marge,our phone bill is four hundred dollars! they charged us for a call to brazil.
62663,Marge,"homie, what's that?"
62421,Marge,you're watching cartoons!
61143,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
60298,Marge,"ooo, sugar free donuts."
58144,Marge,so you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago.
59225,Marge,"no, but i use only the fre..."
57075,Marge,"please, bart, no more pranks. it would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
65572,Marge,"hmm. well, it wouldn't start for me. i think this car's a lemon!"
63268,Marge,our new photos are back!
60719,Marge,did they ever find tom petty's toe?
61047,Marge,"turn it over, homer."
63443,Marge,"we're all so proud of you, sweetie."
59062,Marge,not if we want that vacation.
56598,Marge,"oh no, no. n-not exactly. it's just that i haven't told homer yet; and with his new job, i don't know how we're going to be able to afford this."
57315,Marge,"gee, i don't know what you've got planned for tonight, homer, but count me out. didn't you buy any meat?"
67944,Marge,"oh, let's see, should i take the ""trail of death,"" or the ""path of doom?"" maybe i should just go back."
63062,Marge,a phone tree.
66712,Marge,those were your father's sweatpants.
55001,Marge,we heard! isn't it wonderful? we have some great plans for that money.
66488,Marge,if you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. that's all i ask...
65063,Marge,i still can't believe it. i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings.
55562,Marge,but... what do i do?
62130,Marge,"last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
62670,Marge,he'll sleep tonight.
58603,Marge,"stay there, honey. we'll come back for you."
58440,Marge,"well, let's just say the country air did us good."
58408,Marge,do it!
62310,Marge,it's happening in ned's house! why would he allow that?
59080,Marge,"but mr. ambassador, how are we going to get home?"
56717,Marge,"all right!!! lisa, that's wonderful. if only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
60665,Marge,"but you're just perpetuating a negative italian-american stereotype. i mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did i say pizza man?"
63378,Marge,i can testify at the trial.
65336,Marge,"okay. let's ""esque"" him to dinner."
57906,Marge,"homer, i can't get the baby to burp. could you try for a while?"
63083,Marge,my lega-she!
61634,Marge,i do!
64064,Marge,"um... do you have time to look at a few other leaks, faulty wires and dangerous mold conditions?"
64218,Marge,let's go.
55303,Marge,"now kids, i know you're all excited about meeting aunt selma's new boyfriend tonight."
55834,Marge,"that was ""happy days."""
62145,Marge,"lights out, weirdoes!"
62551,Marge,"homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that salamander suit. you look like the mascot for some horrible southern college."
56501,Marge,"oh, bart. it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
62362,Marge,"i'm at a rest stop south of springfield. i know, you're sorry now. then you'll buy me some kwik-e-mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
56786,Marge,"homer, this is a cemetery."
59939,Marge,you can spit on the bus.
57154,Marge,"if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
64859,Marge,"no! for once, a pet ""going to a farm upstate"" really is going to a farm upstate."
56160,Marge,then stop screaming so loud.
66210,Marge,have you kids seen your father? surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
59428,Marge,"from now on, one of us always stays home."
57798,Marge,of course he did.
55270,Marge,well of course he's a spy. you just saw him go through spy school!
57045,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
59090,Marge,"well, that shut me up."
55068,Marge,aww...
64054,Marge,and what will i cook that soup on?
57513,Marge,"no beer, huh? i guess i know what a promise from homer j. simpson is worth."
58913,Marge,how clever! the kids' menu's on the beak.
61168,Marge,"here are some supervised activities we can all do together. future veterans of foreign wars, the 5-h club..."
57739,Marge,a frying pan radio. wow!
59028,Marge,"oh, look! there's the store where i buy my yarn. but you don't want to buy your buttons there."
65173,Marge,that newborn has earrings!
63650,Marge,"i've gotten so much accomplished: i saved ""lost"", watched all of ""rome"" in a day, and got through ""two and a half men"" in two and a half minutes. then i ran out of space and had to choose between ""sophie's choice"" and ""schindler's list."""
63329,Marge,"well, maybe if you go..."
58938,Marge,dammit!
55408,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, i'll be playing blanche. i made some peanut butter brownies for everyone."
64526,Marge,"then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
58585,Marge,it all happened about two years ago...
67045,Marge,"lisa, get away from that jazzman!"
55968,Marge,"well, thank you for a lovely time."
55432,Marge,"i'm sure you won't enjoy it. there's nothing about bowling in the play... oh wait, there is."
60726,Marge,stop! you'll crush your juice boxes!
66340,Marge,everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
64980,Marge,oh.
65000,Marge,awww.
64102,Marge,uh-oh. we're starting to attract swingers.
63137,Marge,no!
61680,Marge,"i don't know... homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?"
57028,Marge,sweet dreams.
66645,Marge,"you're working so hard you've lost weight! we're killing ourselves trying to run a restaurant no one goes to... i've never said this to you before, but i'm saying it now. i'm going to moe's."
57993,Marge,"oh, homie."
56062,Marge,"legalized gambling is a bad idea. you can build a casino over my dead body! blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
56899,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. if maggie could talk i'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
66087,Marge,can i have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
59350,Marge,molokai?!
55526,Marge,"no, no, no."
64545,Marge,"i don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!"
57404,Marge,"and if anything happens, just use your best judgm... just do what i would do."
57917,Marge,"that's wonderful! but still, can't you do anything for bart?"
64352,Marge,i'm still hoping homie will come back.
66252,Marge,"bart, don't use language like that!"
62495,Marge,i was really looking forward to it.
64279,Marge,guess who the garden club elected president?
66840,Marge,absolutely.
67263,Marge,oh. okay.
59932,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share."
59358,Marge,so he's stuck like this forever?
58221,Marge,we what?
65939,Marge,vodka? is this krusty's?
57681,Marge,"what? you never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
62823,Marge,"looking through my purse, looking through my purse... keep walking, monkey!"
58876,Marge,"looks like it's time for plan b. one, two, three, ""b""!"
55984,Marge,"i said, no."
65580,Marge,"well, take a shower, 'cause we're gonna try it tonight!"
65375,Marge,"well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good."
56432,Marge,"listen, kids. you're eight and ten years old now. i can't be fighting all your battles for you."
62241,Marge,when did i agree to that?
63473,Marge,"homer, can't we please be alone? it's our anniversary."
65968,Marge,thatta boy.
55182,Marge,"although actually there's only one. and it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
62821,Marge,"oh, homie, you did it!"
56582,Marge,"homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys. somebody's gonna get parasites."
57786,Marge,"please, one at a time, one at a time! now, who has the most urgent problem?"
63557,Marge,"dwight, please, don't do anything crazy."
57232,Marge,"wait, kids. you can't give up on itchy and scratchy. you're always so good at these things. why, together you've reunited krusty with his father, gotten principal skinner his job back, and helped dr. riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. you've even foiled sideshow bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
55606,Marge,"we drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""all you can eat"" fish restaurant."
58515,Marge,"hey, listen to this!"
61201,Marge,"well, i have so much free time now that moe's our babysitter."
64789,Marge,"yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
64199,Marge,"excuse me, i'm feeling a little... over-hydrated."
56719,Marge,"this? this? no, i - i've just got a touch of the rheumatiz."
66917,Marge,homer!
65593,Marge,"ooh, a christmas ornament museum! can we stop?"
65618,Marge,spiro's...
61066,Marge,"homer, let it go. it's not always going to be perfect. we've been married for ten years."
63054,Marge,"now listen, bub. you go down to those recruiters and tell them bart is too young for the army. i don't want this to be the only memory i have of him."
59211,Marge,"more tumbleweed, lisa?"
65745,Marge,"no, homie! it's too dangerous!"
61718,Marge,"so we arranged to meet again at ""second date rock."""
56543,Marge,but it's a few seconds before 12:00.
56766,Marge,"and bart isn't doing very well either. he needs boundaries, and structure. there's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome."
57840,Marge,at least think of our dentist bills!
58527,Marge,yes?
56455,Marge,i can't even watch. i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
61082,Marge,"nobody owns christmas carols. they belong to everyone, like grapes at the grocery store!"
59380,Marge,"well, don't run up mr. burns' phone bill."
63509,Marge,"huh. thank you, crie! i'm huh... i'm sorry about the kick. i've never done anything like that before."
60159,Marge,running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
54729,Marge,oh! they're here! how does everything look?
56949,Marge,street signs? indoors?! whatever.
61591,Marge,you really mean it?
56250,Marge,all right. okay. everybody out!
56341,Marge,"yes, what did happen to her?"
64758,Marge,"colonel ketchup, i say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener."
63001,Marge,"if we can't find a home for those animals, they'll be put to sleep. your sister's very upset."
55665,Marge,here you go.
58669,Marge,look who's a little cowgirl!
58975,Marge,yup.
58566,Marge,i can't believe it. that's horrible! who'll run the kwik-e-mart?
67026,Marge,a bully?!
57549,Marge,...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
56248,Marge,homer!
66815,Marge,"here's what you do. you just take his hand, look in his eyes and say ""i don't want to be with you anymore."""
67693,Marge,"yes, i remember."
56370,Marge,hmm?
64344,Marge,"hold it right there, bub. what kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
60617,Marge,"a koi pond! it's beautiful. oh you sweet, wonderful man-child. i finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts."
58166,Marge,it's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children!
58058,Marge,i don't want a drug boat.
61951,Marge,"we're big fans, mr. gladwell."
62256,Marge,"they're not kidnappers! they're professionally trained child-snatchers, who are taking you to a maximum-security fat camp."
67495,Marge,"oh, no! my sweet little bart!"
64719,Marge,now remember what grampa said: you can spend the money any way you want.
65020,Marge,"ooo, they even have a zoo -- featuring all the nfl mascots!"
59158,Marge,major league baseball?
63034,Marge,"homer, it's time people knew the truth: i'm doing the work and i want the credit."
67519,Marge,"homer, you're his father. you've got to try and reason with him."
65713,Marge,see? all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation. betcha the dads are doing the same thing!
56128,Marge,pride?
60973,Marge,"oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!"
60080,Marge,i'm not a cop.
62177,Marge,don't leave now! the next piece is an atonal medley by philip glass!
63738,Marge,"no, i'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs."
61419,Marge,"well, what do you think?"
57478,Marge,"when i first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. but i worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
58610,Marge,"homer, you haven't touched your food."
67307,Marge,"oh, oh, homer. i feel giddy. wait, what about a babysitter?"
63412,Marge,kitty cat!
60101,Marge,oh my!
57869,Marge,"i'm so glad we took the subway. ""laser wart removal"". wow, the future is here!"
64945,Marge,homer! we only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
64186,Marge,that'll be our christmas card this year!
58457,Marge,we're trapped!
61538,Marge,i'm so happy to be getting my husband back.
54726,Marge,"homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
60568,Marge,"hm, that little girl sure loved dots."
60755,Marge,not feeling well. going to bed. dinner and breakfast are on the table.
60694,Marge,"homie, something very creepy is going on here."
62359,Marge,"bye bart! i love you, lisa! sleep tight, maggie! today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
62292,Marge,just as you predicted.
64618,Marge,we can't let lisa get her hopes up.
64340,Marge,i don't see the safe zone anywhere.
58346,Marge,no!
65272,Marge,merry christmas eve! where are the kids?
59476,Marge,"cheer up, homie. you don't need friends to be happy. i haven't had a friend in years."
59705,Marge,"now that our son is an honor student, i'm going to get one of those bumper stickers that informs strangers of that fact."
57915,Marge,"with nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
61180,Marge,"let's go, boys. make sure you use pine sol on those pine trees, for that pine fresh smell."
66178,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is."
62585,Marge,don't be so sure.
58534,Marge,"oh, yes. and punish lisa for lying to us."
65761,Marge,"no, our state."
59168,Marge,only your father could take a part-time job at a small-town paper and wind up the target of international assassins.
66828,Marge,what?!
57561,Marge,"your franchise, how much?"
61609,Marge,i'm glad i sent the kids to grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
56045,Marge,"homer, you should be more supportive."
67180,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
56881,Marge,holy christmas.
56210,Marge,"hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! i made a special cake for you to ruin. it's over there."
64522,Marge,"""anyway, i was very proud of eliza, but my husband hiram had not quite caught abolition fever..."""
59128,Marge,it's what i do.
57367,Marge,"celebrities at ringside tonight: star of the ""mcbain"" action films and featured player in the hollywood prostitution scandal, rainier wolfcastle; tv anchorman and springfield institution, mr. kent brockman."
56053,Marge,"hey, there's a turkey behind the bed."
63290,Marge,everyone can see you! get inside!
55186,Marge,"yes, homer."
58338,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. all your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
64227,Marge,we can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
62889,Marge,i think he's a male gay.
62251,Marge,i talked to dr. hibbert today. he gave me a list of heart-smart foods.
57347,Marge,"i can't believe it! i've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
59498,Marge,is he a maneater?
61643,Marge,the sweet love story that is older than the sea...
65808,Marge,i wish i knew what happened...
60217,Marge,"sorry, we already solved it."
64498,Marge,i like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar.
64122,Marge,"whatever you say, ""lance."""
56679,Marge,"""tested,"" homer, god tested moses. and try to be nice to my sisters. it's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
60144,Marge,"we hate her, homer."
63109,Marge,it's in that dumpster.
57773,Marge,"reverend, i hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. i'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
57236,Marge,"homer! that's just an urban legend. people don't do that type of thing with fish. troy mcclure is a perfect gentlemen, like bing crosby or jfk. i wonder where troy is now?"
66333,Marge,who's mommy's little girl? genealogy dot org says you are. you are!
61938,Marge,shut up!
67893,Marge,"umm... hello. my name is marge simpson and i painted this. maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. well, i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr. burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of god's creatures."
57968,Marge,"homer, we need something to protect this family."
56858,Marge,freeze! every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
61316,Marge,what a mall!
62887,Marge,"wow, that's what i would've said. well, i would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."
67700,Marge,yes.
57327,Marge,"i'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, bart. you see... you have a brother."
64677,Marge,"ooo, everyone's coming over to congratulate us! humble faces, kids!"
57233,Marge,you kids must be so happy. your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
67352,Marge,"you know, some women find bald men quite virile."
62139,Marge,you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
66641,Marge,they're opening another mother hubbard -- across the street?! how could they? how could they?!
59600,Marge,yes.
60232,Marge,you should be very upset.
65264,Marge,you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.
60405,Marge,are you snoring while you're awake?
64835,Marge,this isn't the line for a movie. why are you wearing that costume?
57803,Marge,ned! where are you?!
58798,Marge,"mmm, oh, this is delicious. what's in it?"
54642,Marge,when is it due?
66393,Marge,what pills?
57894,Marge,because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies.
55977,Marge,i don't know.
61803,Marge,"great stuff, ned."
65744,Marge,we have to do something until the storm passes. now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started.
57978,Marge,i'm a lucky woman.
64923,Marge,"bart, sweetie..."
62489,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
66721,Marge,"you always save me, trombone elephant."
56181,Marge,are you thinking what i'm thinking?
67838,Marge,"well, you certainly captured the moment. hmmm ."
66059,Marge,"save that sugar for your coffee, bub."
57400,Marge,"oh, all right, we'll go."
59197,Marge,"oh, homer, i bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up."
67155,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
61292,Marge,that man and his foolish pride! we've gotta go follow him.
63457,Marge,"i understand, homie."
65682,Marge,stay back! you know i'll use this... because you saw me using it.
57778,Marge,"okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
63494,Marge,"goodnight, maggie."
58196,Marge,"aw, aren't you sweet? hey, my pearls!"
67919,Marge,crazy horse!
61628,Marge,yeah! you don't need a husband to be happy!
64914,Marge,thanks for the ride!
56377,Marge,"what's the matter with you, homer? we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."
54706,Marge,"this place is so boring. if somebody doesn't do something interesting, i'm gonna have to. but what?"
61412,Marge,temperance had to face the unhappy truth...
58884,Marge,what?
57292,Marge,"... and you're sure the flanderses won't be there? well, it sounds great!"
56024,Marge,i didn't realize people saw me that way.
58544,Marge,drug lab?!
54860,Marge,"hi, ned. homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of."
57371,Marge,"oh, homie, are you okay?"
67046,Marge,"come on, come on. we were worried about you. nothing personal. i just fear the unfamiliar."
55777,Marge,i want you to give up beer for a month.
56349,Marge,that's not my mother.
65914,Marge,mmm... new cushion smell!
60374,Marge,"oh yeah! it's important to grow-grow-grow, but if you take it to the max-max-max, it's gonna get ugly!"
63003,Marge,"empathy means you're looking at lisa, and feeling what she feels. your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. and now..."
63271,Marge,it sure was nice of nasa to send you up again.
55625,Marge,"you know, i don't think i remember... but the story of lisa's first word is very cute."
66006,Marge,gulp?! was that a gulp? are you getting a sore throat? let me give you some castor oil.
67193,Marge,hmm-hmm.
67432,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i didn't say that this scares me a little. but we all have a calling, a reason the almighty put us on this earth. and yours might be to dance on dugouts."
59955,Marge,"okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file. what if you two bond over your malibu stacey dolls?"
63018,Marge,"aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
58459,Marge,we've gotta get home before someone sees us.
59792,Marge,"hey! hey, over here! here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!"
60010,Marge,"calm down! if we hurry, they can reattach your thumb."
64761,Marge,"homie, help him up!"
66536,Marge,"don't you dare say ""ostrich eyes."""
58234,Marge,"so, you kids really love the leader, huh? even more than your parents?"
55348,Marge,don't you usually play with milhouse after school?
62767,Marge,lisa! what are you doing in the nutmeg state?
62339,Marge,"hello, homer."
65536,Marge,"okay, that's it! i'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! uh-oh, yes, homer."
67008,Marge,"all our money, the college funds, the tv. homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you."
61232,Marge,homer!
57567,Marge,thank you.
56238,Marge,whatever do you mean? i don't dye my hair...
59781,Marge,"okay, it's in his brain."
59926,Marge,"well, homie, i believe you're telling the truth about the isotopes."
57225,Marge,"well, if it's just for one more night."
55441,Marge,now here's a tip from blanche you won't regret...
61027,Marge,this is so romantic.
66523,Marge,"you're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late."
66044,Marge,"homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!"
62984,Marge,stop calling her that!
63305,Marge,what are you kids doing up so late?
60506,Marge,"uh, i think we're with comquaaq."
62451,Marge,"why did i marry that selfish jerk? i've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!"
56721,Marge,oh lisa!
61117,Marge,that cat saved your life.
65061,Marge,i was never sure about this marriage.
59980,Marge,he doesn't look so fast to me.
64519,Marge,"this one doesn't sound roadkill-y. and, it comes with a story. ""many years ago, my daughter, eliza, brought a runaway slave, virgil, to the house..."""
61357,Marge,i wish to announce the formation of ppassccatag: proud parents against singles seniors childless couples and teens and gays.
63877,Marge,bartholomew j. simpson!
58969,Marge,"oh no, it's the apocalypse. bart, are you wearing clean underwear?"
55666,Marge,nice healthy oatmeal.
60529,Marge,homer!
66442,Marge,"oh, homer simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed kirk and luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about milhouse."
60690,Marge,"i very much doubt that, homer. these are horrible ghouls from the past."
57626,Marge,no.
67401,Marge,like what?
63021,Marge,i'm here to fix your bookcase. you answered my flyer.
60883,Marge,whack him with the hymnal. over.
64488,Marge,"homer, while you were imagining what the winter olympics were, seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials!"
57697,Marge,"uh, grampa's not coming..."
55991,Marge,i hit it! i hit it!
60109,Marge,no!
62306,Marge,"ned, let me give you a little something for babysitting."
58578,Marge,she's teething. look... her very first baby tooth.
67793,Marge,"hmm, well, i met homer in high school. we got married and had three beautiful children."
59454,Marge,she's president of the united states.
58004,Marge,c-u-p! i wanna c-u-... oh my god!
54887,Marge,"bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
59829,Marge,"that's right, a job."
63489,Marge,chief wiggums! the maestro is the killer!
55619,Marge,bart!
58718,Marge,why don't you kids play one of your old board games?
55461,Marge,"no, it's nothing bad. i'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
58558,Marge,how vile.
57812,Marge,"how about...""mitzi""?"
63931,Marge,why are you dancing with that strange woman?
58646,Marge,"ooh, so plump and juicy. he's gonna boil up nicely."
55174,Marge,what? name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
66928,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll just have to stretch your christmas bonus even further this year."
64506,Marge,"oh stop -- it's the journal of a sweet little girl! keep reading, honey."
66329,Marge,why is it the recipe card you need is always the one homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
67055,Marge,"now, lisa, listen to me. this is important. i want you to smile today."
65826,Marge,wondered where that was.
61786,Marge,"this is the kitchen i've always wanted. ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
64801,Marge,my whole childhood is in this box! my scrunchies! i never really had the hair for these.
58915,Marge,but what if he chokes?
56893,Marge,"grampa, i found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. have you seen it?"
64854,Marge,no he doesn't!
57198,Marge,no.
62505,Marge,a tea house?!
55123,Marge,"ooh, perfume. meryl streep's ""versatility."""
61139,Marge,"hey, i'd like that. i can't. i have to go pick up grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station."
60350,Marge,oh. it's just a false alarm.
64760,Marge,"whew, sure is hot out here..."
66482,Marge,"remember that sewing machine you say i never use? well, i sold it and bought this dress!"
55443,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. by the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up."
63599,Marge,"you really don't know, do you?"
63190,Marge,bart was on the boat?!
63175,Marge,"this was my favorite seahorse. i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling... oh god, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!"
58006,Marge,he's the only coach this team has ever had. and the season hasn't even started yet.
67747,Marge,yes. i ate two grapes. please charge me for them.
64000,Marge,i just said that.
57503,Marge,"okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off. but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
58548,Marge,"oh, i'll come back later."
56799,Marge,"uh, i must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. wee-aah!"
57282,Marge,of course you have a choice.
59466,Marge,"it's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..."" well, isn't that clever? it's a metaphor."
63825,Marge,"maggie, that's the same garry that filmed your birthday party. remember, he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight."
65043,Marge,"we'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes, and watch the four saddest horse movies i could find."
65251,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad you're not an accounts man anymore."
57791,Marge,hello. listen lady.
56082,Marge,"homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
57441,Marge,well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
55702,Marge,mr. lanley? mr. lanley?
60554,Marge,where did you get that suit?
58543,Marge,mmm. what do you think he's doing up there?
63091,Marge,"why did cavemen paint on walls? why do you scratch your name on tupperware? so when you die, something's left behind that says, ""i was here. i mattered. that's my tupperware."""
61842,Marge,that coulda been me.
64085,Marge,"i'll be right in, lisa!"
63940,Marge,we should be getting back to the party.
59087,Marge,lisa!
55974,Marge,"i'm disappointed in you, but it turns out i had a wonderful time with ruth powers. in fact, we're going out again tomorrow night."
59363,Marge,"a field goal? hm... nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... that would win the game!"
57923,Marge,"homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
66603,Marge,he does it to all of us.
66876,Marge,"well, to raise money, we're... putting on a revue."
57062,Marge,all aboard the sleepy train / to visit mother goose / barty's stop is snoozy lane / to rest his sweet caboose.
62880,Marge,no! and i hope i never do! the best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!
56190,Marge,"homer, that's hans moleman."
64078,Marge,it's beautiful!
63898,Marge,where's bart? we're gonna be late for lenny's party.
55776,Marge,"homie, i'd like you to do something for me."
57004,Marge,i'm going out. i run errands during the day.
63957,Marge,take my hand!
58104,Marge,no. there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
59067,Marge,are you going through our garbage?
67541,Marge,... please try to tone down the psychotic violence...
65910,Marge,how many times do i have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the special olympics?
66176,Marge,"kirk van houten, i hope you're not having a midlife crisis."
62434,Marge,"homer, don't touch her! you've never had chicken pox."
63858,Marge,i hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
63771,Marge,no suicide axe!
56460,Marge,i told you to watch out.
54724,Marge,that was our wedding.
55097,Marge,homer!
67634,Marge,some celery with cream cheese on it?
64413,Marge,maybe we could do both.
66073,Marge,"wait, wait, wait! let me get the stain out. but not here..."
59420,Marge,"bart? honey, i think you should go play with rod and todd."
65665,Marge,"homer, i think we should go. we're not like these people."
66663,Marge,the milkshakes have vanished!
59424,Marge,i think it is!
57312,Marge,"because it was the only one in the house. come on, homer, open the door for your mystery date!"
61500,Marge,lisa!
56819,Marge,"homer, give me my pepper spray."
61371,Marge,i always keep one near the bed for you.
67819,Marge,those are very elaborate sneakers.
57416,Marge,it's the light pink '87 wagon.
67645,Marge,"your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, homer."
56069,Marge,go home. you're bad luck!
67651,Marge,i'll have one of those.
56281,Marge,"i don't know, honey. i guess that's the school's decision to make."
54814,Marge,it doesn't do anything.
54741,Marge,"homer, i like to think that i'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. but last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
58232,Marge,"no, no, no. just the first two."
60214,Marge,but whose body is it?
60346,Marge,that donkey is such a bad influence on you.
67294,Marge,"i'm marge, thirty-four, and my problem is my husband. he doesn't listen to me. he doesn't appreciate me. i don't know how much more of this i can --"
56836,Marge,"oh. uh, a looks nice. it's a, it's a good length for you."
64662,Marge,it's probably a de-boner.
56191,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
56406,Marge,"are you two bonkers? we almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered."
55988,Marge,what was it you wanted to show me?
59559,Marge,"let's see. candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
64885,Marge,"martha, the house looks beautiful -- it's like christmas with a childless gay couple. but it's just not the same without my family being themselves."
54990,Marge,"so, mr. hutz, does my husband have a case?"
65440,Marge,"you wanna know what happens on your stupid show? firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from long beach. also, doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell, and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
66931,Marge,"but i think it does have something to do with your christmas bonus. i keep asking for it, but..."
65055,Marge,no!
58409,Marge,"stop it, lisa!"
58311,Marge,i scheduled a play date.
61571,Marge,just take me home.
63988,Marge,okay. one night.
59150,Marge,"... and i'm really worried, chief. there's no telling what he might do."
58790,Marge,"you're a lifesaver, apu. all the other stores are closed."
67927,Marge,that's where you're wrong! get out on that stage!
67239,Marge,"oh, he's sunk even lower!"
67583,Marge,oh dear!
66680,Marge,i guess i do.
66283,Marge,we'll call that nice girl who's getting her masters in child development.
61421,Marge,"well, i guess that part is loosely based on your father."
66955,Marge,"nurturing your brilliant brain, so i got tickets to the opera tonight. hurry up, get dressed! it starts at eight."
54816,Marge,"homer, it's the thought that counts. the moral of this story is, ""a good deed is its own reward."""
60967,Marge,i can't count how many times your father's done something crazy like this.
65265,Marge,just look happy!
56357,Marge,"no, oh, artie!"
67936,Marge,how did you get in my game? are you a virus?
63164,Marge,"gil, remember me?"
61113,Marge,that guy exploits his pets worse than bob guccione.
58511,Marge,i'd buy one.
63943,Marge,uh... the same thing you're doing here.
62096,Marge,"thank you, mr. simpson."
60511,Marge,homer!
60528,Marge,works for me.
58395,Marge,take those silly things off.
56012,Marge,you're right. i am lucky to have him.
59177,Marge,no more murders.
63693,Marge,"whatever, homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life..."
57597,Marge,"don't worry, kids. this is a national park. we can have lots of fun."
67142,Marge,thirteen. double a.
65058,Marge,i'm her sister. and you?
58153,Marge,"look, i know this has been a stressful holiday. but, in a way, having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are."
62041,Marge,we have kidnapped your son. follow instructions and bart will not be harmed.
67498,Marge,children need discipline. you can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
58080,Marge,no.
55283,Marge,have you kissed her?
65212,Marge,"sure, your dad's great, but i'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! d'oh! d'oh! d'oh!"
57173,Marge,"lisa, please!!"
62676,Marge,you never had detention all summer.
60513,Marge,"homer, what are you going to do?"
57776,Marge,"no, i... i... wait, i can't... i-- hello...?"
57390,Marge,oh. yeah. thank you.
55903,Marge,we've left it all behind. how can you make a clean break with your life?
56180,Marge,i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now. isn't there something you'd like to say?
64932,Marge,"well... homer got along so well with the other dads, i couldn't break it to him."
64188,Marge,"well, i..."
67493,Marge,"bart, you can come down to dinner as soon as you're ready to apologize to your sister. and it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody, and you have to mean it."
58374,Marge,i can't believe it's come to this.
63798,Marge,i love documentaries! especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
65720,Marge,it's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. but this is all a little... creepy.
59654,Marge,"but husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?"
66421,Marge,oh my god!
60830,Marge,and the state of florida.
64982,Marge,"bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! let's get this yo on the road, people!"
63896,Marge,"hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger."
62048,Marge,"excuse me, reverend."
56514,Marge,this isn't very erotic. i think it's an actual utility room.
66145,Marge,"with the mighty tongue god's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?"
58200,Marge,i wonder how that happened?
60093,Marge,george lazenby?
54904,Marge,who wants to say grace?
57187,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
64169,Marge,"she's beautiful, moe."
64851,Marge,you brickyard bimbo!
63358,Marge,lisa! stop reading mastheads!
61460,Marge,why are your clothes so dirty? and why do you smell like liquor? have you been clubbing?
67758,Marge,"well, don't give up. when you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing."
61755,Marge,does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
59404,Marge,"honey, don't get obsessed with that. focus on the good things. like this fire extinguisher i got at the fair."
55934,Marge,i think we need a new hairdryer.
59403,Marge,"what are you doing, lisa?"
66776,Marge,doesn't your culture say anything about mercy?
64291,Marge,where's your brother?
63679,Marge,but it comes from a true place...
59109,Marge,"hollywood, here we are!"
58908,Marge,"ooh, i heard about that place on ""the red grocer."""
59232,Marge,"num num, maggie. num num."
57527,Marge,we did it!
65838,Marge,it's not all lady stuff. look at all these fitness publications.
59542,Marge,"hey, dig that crazy rhythm."
56270,Marge,who could that be...?
59018,Marge,are you okay?
58203,Marge,what's going on?
54721,Marge,chip!
59549,Marge,"there she is! hi, honey! wow, look at her go."
61382,Marge,"oh, lisa. honey, it's okay. you're a buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
59676,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
55670,Marge,can't you do something for him?
66925,Marge,where's that bart?
59276,Marge,will you turn that engine off?
61737,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
59678,Marge,"well, you can't argue with results..."
60358,Marge,"hm, all clean, just the way i left it."
57925,Marge,i guess it doesn't matter. all these things cost money and we just don't have it. unless...
62368,Marge,"well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees? but before you answer, consider this: the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant."
54927,Marge,"did you have a nightmare, homie?"
59804,Marge,mrs. marge simpson. i'm here to teach an art class.
65458,Marge,"any place is fun if you're there with ""super lips."""
64749,Marge,mama bear said 'i'm sure sister bear will come to her senses.'
55271,Marge,"oh, shut up, homer! no one wants to hear what you think!"
56601,Marge,why do you say that?
63971,Marge,"jackie ""o."" like spaghetti-o's. i thought that was where her money came from. look, why don't you cheer up by doing a new york times crossword puzzle, huh?"
57387,Marge,i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening.
56973,Marge,sometimes.
60458,Marge,"honey, i've got some bad news for you."
59740,Marge,see? the ladies know what i'm talkin' about.
58964,Marge,"oooh, that's a tight squeeze."
61729,Marge,"no, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
67668,Marge,"his drool! it's warm! he's alive! homer, homer, wake up, you're alive!"
60992,Marge,sara sloane has been involved with every tinseltown hunk from affleck to zmed!
67556,Marge,how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week?
66943,Marge,"oh, homer."
64600,Marge,what kind of a party has two activities? they're just trying to confuse me.
59609,Marge,"becky, i want to apologize to you...surper!"
63249,Marge,shut up! it's an instructional website! shut up!
65662,Marge,maggie's a little hungry.
63111,Marge,you're the worst husband in the world!
55865,Marge,is that bad?
56820,Marge,"hello, mr. hutz."
54999,Marge,"we'll have a savings account. we've never had one. kids, i think everything is going to be okay from now on."
60194,Marge,oh my god!
67400,Marge,"lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?"
66910,Marge,the simpsons.
59021,Marge,i want these springs out of our house today.
55092,Marge,what are you doing to save my baby boy?
55517,Marge,i really don't see how this helps bart.
66765,Marge,i thought i had one of those chirping keys.
67290,Marge,you forgot the special lunches i made.
65616,Marge,"there's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy..."
54638,Marge,"thank you, professor august."
59841,Marge,"now wait, you don't know that jack did this. just because he's an ex-con..."
67032,Marge,that's why he lashes out at the world.
61361,Marge,forget it.
65157,Marge,i know! i know!
64906,Marge,it's all yours.
62037,Marge,"oh did he? homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!"
64926,Marge,so bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. can you believe it?
55947,Marge,"read the back, the back."
58294,Marge,"wait a minute, homer! you didn't ask everybody. what about the women?"
65493,Marge,"ned, edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room..."
59153,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to be hunting for bart!"
67326,Marge,maybe i'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
63860,Marge,"don't feel too bad, homie. you'll be free tomorrow. and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me."
55972,Marge,"well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there."
58914,Marge,"is it safe to eat that much food, dr. hibbert?"
57052,Marge,well homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
63465,Marge,and you can cut your own meat!
56908,Marge,and don't put signs on your sister.
64161,Marge,can you at least bring a sweater for maggie?
65138,Marge,come in and get some more!
58306,Marge,"well, thank you, ralph. you're such a fine young gentleman."
54997,Marge,your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
64656,Marge,why on earth do you think that harmless-looking man...is sideshow bob?
60657,Marge,that commercial is very effective.
63711,Marge,"come and get me, you syrupy stack of man-cakes."
62352,Marge,homer!
58829,Marge,"oh, homie. oh, they're beautiful."
67250,Marge,homer! you didn't even ask where bart would be going.
58524,Marge,"oh, no you won't."
54627,Marge,"no, i'm going to be an astronaut."
55713,Marge,it's not batman!
55316,Marge,because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
59576,Marge,"well, no kicking. it's too dangerous."
59201,Marge,"hello, my husband will be right with you. we're just taking this old christmas tree to the dump."
57771,Marge,"all done! i swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
56183,Marge,"c'mon, honey."
61760,Marge,"i wish we could go back, but i don't think we're welcome there."
64830,Marge,homer? how did you get...?
55285,Marge,i want you to stop seeing her.
66707,Marge,i don't remember that!
67585,Marge,it's time for krusty.
54677,Marge,let's not fight anymore. let's just make him decide between us.
67579,Marge,yes.
57188,Marge,we can't drive this up there. they'll see the dent. they'll see the coat hanger antenna. stop the car. we're walking.
64866,Marge,"wrong holiday, stupid!"
56606,Marge,"wait a minute, wait, i know that look. now promise you won't tell homer."
58463,Marge,just grab 'em!
67291,Marge,now just a darn...
62357,Marge,i don't know.
64082,Marge,"ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! who's a chubby baby?"
67269,Marge,what?
63526,Marge,you have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
63884,Marge,bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. maybe there's too much sugar in his sugar-frosted candy o's.
61592,Marge,"homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. homer!"
61131,Marge,"kids, hurry up and eat! we have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago!"
57674,Marge,"i hope you all saved room, because i made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! both kinds!"
67414,Marge,"no, i'm just fine right here."
65012,Marge,"all of j.d. salinger's books, except ""catcher in the rye!"" used pizza protectors!"
63545,Marge,"i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for dwight. in fact, i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
62531,Marge,"here, try yours on. i got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. somebody here likes princess cakes."
66827,Marge,"thank you, lord. and i'll give up online scrapbooking like i promised."
57519,Marge,"well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. and i was sure you'd head west, because springfield slopes down that way. and then i saw the lighthouse, and i remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
58613,Marge,"well, it's better than that last barbra streisand movie."
65437,Marge,"bart's not home yet, but i'm always looking to encourage non-milhouse play-dates. stick around!"
64943,Marge,i've got summer squash!
64640,Marge,we're breaking up!
61484,Marge,that's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. all they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
57799,Marge,oh my god... ned!
54946,Marge,those aren't even words!
65392,Marge,how do you know about it?
56041,Marge,"homer, i have to go out to pick up something for dinner."
56395,Marge,"hey, the bartender even looks like john travolta."
61853,Marge,"here's lisa! she'll save the party! honey, sit down... have a big slice of cake!"
61695,Marge,homie... are you the pie man?
57763,Marge,"homer, the lord only asks for an hour a week."
57633,Marge,thank you for everything.
62980,Marge,"homer, where did you get that truck?"
55124,Marge,"homer, those are very thoughtful presents. but you have to tell me where you got the money from."
57870,Marge,are we still in little italy?
62981,Marge,"homer, helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. could you pick it up?"
67898,Marge,"lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that i feel that way about your father!"
56340,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
58439,Marge,ohhh. my hero.
63566,Marge,"dwight, that was the most unselfish thing i've ever seen. i'm sorry i didn't visit you before."
62194,Marge,"lisa, your date's here!"
59962,Marge,i'm a horrible mother.
67358,Marge,"don't worry, homie. this year you have an excuse for not remembering, what with your job and --"
61478,Marge,homer!
60810,Marge,this rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
60776,Marge,hey cops! check out this all-points bulletin!
61061,Marge,"a little bit, yeah."
64833,Marge,they have a vaccine!
55804,Marge,"honey, you look fine."
56639,Marge,"bart, did you trick an australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?"
65400,Marge,homie! we're here to find answers to your problem!
57193,Marge,"c'mon, let's go. i wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
62539,Marge,don't call me mother! my name is mom! and my son is no mama's boy!
65372,Marge,a bunny! just like the one i had when i was a girl! how did you know?
60675,Marge,my favorite is number three!
64553,Marge,"oh my god, homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
63300,Marge,"i can make her look any way i want -- let's see... hair: blue, shoes: sensible, body type: olive oyl."
66773,Marge,homer! you have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!
59056,Marge,i guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world.
55072,Marge,come home soon.
59771,Marge,this is terrible. how will the kids get home?
57119,Marge,wow!
63543,Marge,ooh! shlomo's judaica is having a blowout on dreidels.
57492,Marge,ned! maude! you've got to go back to your house. something incredible has happened!
63149,Marge,i'm so sick of gil... he ruins thanksgiving... uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...
55240,Marge,oh dear!
56625,Marge,"homer, what if this doesn't work?"
61598,Marge,no! you're not going to take my baby to jail!
64456,Marge,"homie? homie, can you hear me?"
55643,Marge,let's keep looking.
64790,Marge,"oh homie, maybe we should call it a day."
62967,Marge,"one more crack out of you, young man, and i'm showing everyone your baby pictures."
62314,Marge,that's coming from next door!
54634,Marge,i think i'm gonna like it here.
66856,Marge,"i'm... i'm sorry, but i'm not your mother."
59130,Marge,it's not dope! it's something to help you concentrate.
59754,Marge,"oh, dear. we don't want that."
58186,Marge,looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
62804,Marge,it's really more of an amiable concordance.
63828,Marge,"my purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
62484,Marge,my spine is not a scratching post!
56561,Marge,"daddy?! daddy, where are you, da..."
65609,Marge,maybe there's enough homer in the world for now.
58243,Marge,"homer, you don't have to go with them!"
56335,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
66782,Marge,"oh, sweetie..."
55964,Marge,hello?
58638,Marge,you don't have anything i want.
57090,Marge,goodnight.
65145,Marge,shhh. don't say a word.
65474,Marge,"homer, i'm a single mother trying to raise a family here."
61202,Marge,"oh, a rattle!"
65105,Marge,chief wiggum! stop that train!
64148,Marge,it's all my fault: homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. but no. i had to have spring rolls! they taste like nothing!
64302,Marge,maybe someday you can do lisa's wedding!
59628,Marge,"bart, what do you mean, you have jury duty?"
59484,Marge,i don't know. i'm trying to sleep.
59627,Marge,"hey, you've been riding me all day. why don't you poop in your hat?"
55881,Marge,so how are things at home?
61070,Marge,your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
61152,Marge,"that's us in a nutshell. i care so much about you, homer, but i'm not even on your list. excuse me."
59753,Marge,you were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
57212,Marge,"you know, homer, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
57670,Marge,what on earth are you talking about?
57425,Marge,"oh, can you sing it again?"
55928,Marge,"bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
62909,Marge,"oh, and there's a familiar name. and another one. wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? did he get married?"
59427,Marge,"they don't show police chases, do they?"
65938,Marge,where is it? my wedding dress!
59286,Marge,could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me?
56507,Marge,"oh, i'm just reading up on, artillery."
56947,Marge,"uh, uh, uh, let me guess. a mother can always tell. hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. it almost feels like you're missing something. something important."
64996,Marge,what are you guys doing up there?
64780,Marge,low sodium!
60025,Marge,i stole it from mcbain after i cut off your father's thumb.
55784,Marge,"i'm proud of you, homie."
60247,Marge,here she comes! and-a one and-a two and-a...
67119,Marge,"well, homer and i had a lovely dining experience at chez pierre... or the rusty barnacle is nice..."
57278,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
64103,Marge,maybe we should get out now.
61215,Marge,"thanks, moe. i'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
67718,Marge,couldn't we just use rouge for this?
57940,Marge,"friends with mutants, right."
62374,Marge,"okay, water monsters. be friendly. but not too friendly."
60395,Marge,"artie ziff? ohh, oh, that e-mail. look, i got a little drunk and we..."
63352,Marge,the deadly truth about oxygen...
58441,Marge,"oh, knock it off, you perverts."
63977,Marge,"so, how did you two meet?"
58780,Marge,chesty larue?!
56730,Marge,"well, i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
60309,Marge,"there was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
58629,Marge,i feel guilty coming here every sunday and never actually buying anything.
58619,Marge,"that ain't gonna happen, bub."
66425,Marge,all our friends are like that!
62333,Marge,noooo!!!
56465,Marge,i won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
57842,Marge,"he's just kidding. we'd like to thank fox, and the good people at budget lodge."
66153,Marge,"moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful."
64842,Marge,it's not up to you. we're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. they'll know the right thing to do.
56789,Marge,that's mary had a little lamb.
63309,Marge,i better check on my elf-self!
63692,Marge,"homer's perfect for me! just look at this note: ""i miss you."" aww..."
60813,Marge,"no, homer, no! that's our only way home!"
62810,Marge,look!
57053,Marge,"well, duh."
66937,Marge,maybe i should call the police.
64540,Marge,the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
65318,Marge,"well, that's not true! everyone in this family is your friend."
61467,Marge,i also found this in your drawer.
58611,Marge,"ankle? ""foccacia""? what are you talking about?"
66676,Marge,he has a point...
65798,Marge,mmm! cursive!
62249,Marge,his liver looks healthy.
62112,Marge,you keep almost dying. just look at our vacation photos.
65479,Marge,what?! i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time!
65757,Marge,hey! hello!
65172,Marge,everything's fine... we'll just wait here for the tow truck.
60929,Marge,"you know, most people pray silently."
57578,Marge,"dinner's in the oven. if you want some butter, it's under my face."
66621,Marge,i'm sorry i woke you up. i'm just so anxious about tomorrow. what if the store fails? what if i fail?
63060,Marge,it's not giant and it's not in the distance! it's small and it's in our room!
61807,Marge,"it's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
60915,Marge,and that's why i didn't win!
63912,Marge,"bart, honey, i saw you didn't like your dinner, so i thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off."
58682,Marge,aren't you going to give him the last rites?
62296,Marge,"we're not going anywhere, except to bed!"
62972,Marge,"on the surface, that sounds perfectly pleasant."
62036,Marge,"well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk."
60705,Marge,so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
58540,Marge,bart! did you kill that poor bird?
56556,Marge,you see.
67517,Marge,are you all right?
64030,Marge,i can hardly believe this is real.
67789,Marge,hello.
62029,Marge,billions!
63121,Marge,homie...
64841,Marge,"just because mr. burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless."
60424,Marge,does that work on anyone?
55062,Marge,i heard a noise outside and thought it might be homer.
58709,Marge,but there's only been one pitch!
56133,Marge,"oh, i am so proud of you. and i know it's going to go just fine..."
54943,Marge,let's be realistic. a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
63753,Marge,who was that?
61454,Marge,"no, it's a sacagawea dollar. you can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar! eh?"
58190,Marge,but it doesn't look safe. and the guy running it looks a little seedy. no offense.
60051,Marge,what spinal cord injury?
66597,Marge,and now to make my big move.
56279,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time."
57097,Marge,there you are! you can help me spray the cookies...
60881,Marge,i'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
63390,Marge,it's just flanders. you know him.
65352,Marge,why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? what have we done that's so terrible?
56381,Marge,"oh, please. it was just a figure of speech."
65464,Marge,"excuse me, cruise director priddis. my son has something to tell you."
56295,Marge,"look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?"
61714,Marge,uggams!
55537,Marge,"look, you have to help discipline your son."
60549,Marge,"homer, you're doing drugs!"
60236,Marge,"you know, lisa, around here, buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
66601,Marge,"...so, i cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
59024,Marge,"oh, come on, let's go for a walk! this family's getting so lazy."
55301,Marge,always has been.
61841,Marge,"b.f.d. i've had your scrambled eggs, homer. the secret ingredient is whiskey."
62941,Marge,"well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life."
64402,Marge,"boy, that was worth the wait."
65320,Marge,no tv on the computer!
55603,Marge,"homer, please i just had eggs."
64245,Marge,that's nice.
58554,Marge,hmm... it's starting to cool down. i'll bake another pie.
63032,Marge,why does lenny need a windmill anyway?
59747,Marge,should i just back out of the room?
59086,Marge,"mmm, i don't think that bridge can support much weight."
62200,Marge,"and i'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea."
59621,Marge,i haven't done the laundry yet.
56312,Marge,"no, think about people. about moments in your life that have been very romantic."
63027,Marge,"uh-oh, switch!"
57362,Marge,have you lost your mind?!
66986,Marge,"uh-huh. well, uh... i sense greatness in my family."
59716,Marge,"homer, bring that back in the house."
57547,Marge,"i guess i'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of ""investing""..."
61157,Marge,what?
60725,Marge,now your fannies match.
61618,Marge,well...
58977,Marge,"homie, someone's at the door. they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident."
64123,Marge,"homer, what's going on? the violin, pants with a crease, why?"
65995,Marge,what are you doing?!
55902,Marge,"homer, where's the dog?"
67746,Marge,"oh, of course. it's thou shalt not... uh... covet... graven images... something about covet..."
58349,Marge,"lisa, please. you have absolutely no reason to be jealous. you're still a very important part of bart's show."
56842,Marge,"i'm still all those things. only now i'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
60420,Marge,"grampa, that happened a year and a half ago! we have to go save homer."
62254,Marge,"okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
54998,Marge,it's the miracle we've been waiting for.
55455,Marge,"that's a terrible thing to say. kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
54697,Marge,my sisters are nuts. i'm happy being married to homer. most of the time.
61059,Marge,"homer, i'm sorry you saw that, but i was very upset that night."
58869,Marge,"no, your father drives like an old lady."
67204,Marge,is thursday okay?
54928,Marge,"don't worry, honey, i'm sure your father is..."
58651,Marge,"well, lobster or no lobster, this is still a very special dinner. ba-da da-da da-daaa!"
57825,Marge,"hello, dear. how was work at the plant?"
66935,Marge,"but homer, my sisters are here. don't you want to say hello?"
61269,Marge,bart! stop saying macbeth!
65508,Marge,that is totally irresponsible parenting!
55559,Marge,what?
65991,Marge,there might be some nagging involved.
66385,Marge,"if you defeat this madman, i'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant."
66992,Marge,"well, i'm not much of a drinker..."
56971,Marge,that giant donut.
58352,Marge,i want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
64539,Marge,"let's have lunch at ""crouching tiger hidden eggroll."""
59330,Marge,who's disco stu?
62483,Marge,i was asking for something.
56392,Marge,"ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
54658,Marge,homer! dr. hibbert told you to eat healthier!
66980,Marge,homer!
59603,Marge,"oh, yes. he's kind of everywhere."
61675,Marge,would you two just shut up!!
59152,Marge,i don't think he has diarrhea.
58077,Marge,there it is!
63807,Marge,"lisa, how could you?"
60364,Marge,"boy, things are going really good. good, good, good, good, good, good, good. hmm, look at that freckle. i should dig that out."
56698,Marge,how droll.
60879,Marge,twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
63491,Marge,oh but wednesday's not good for me.
67662,Marge,homer!
54631,Marge,"i don't want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. i have my own dreams and i can't live them with you."
58469,Marge,i don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets.
62996,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
58431,Marge,"homer, don't look."
59914,Marge,"don't be selfish, lisa."
66659,Marge,dum got a job at the tower of london... as a beefeater!
61564,Marge,isn't that a little big?
65777,Marge,a whole weekend? i don't know...
64862,Marge,"bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?"
55053,Marge,what a perfect day.
59862,Marge,"homer, ball!"
66409,Marge,"well, we've talked about it, and if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract."
63919,Marge,aw... young love.
64557,Marge,we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
61923,Marge,"for your information, our electric dishwasher is on the fritz."
55368,Marge,"homer, wait. herb, what're you talking about?"
58614,Marge,you're joining the screen actor's guild?
65866,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe you struck my husband."
63996,Marge,lisa? do you want to be best friends?
54966,Marge,"what's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
60136,Marge,haven't we been humiliated enough?
66155,Marge,i said go!
63047,Marge,"homer! you won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?"
65454,Marge,"no, honey. you just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!"
62260,Marge,"i already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner."
64404,Marge,"oh, darn, the batteries are dead."
56815,Marge,i suppose i would.
58675,Marge,"oh, i know you're scared, homie. but remember why you're doing this. it's for your father. the man who raised you and nurtured you."
60892,Marge,i'm stronger than i've ever been! i don't have to go back inside. i'm not afraid!
65322,Marge,"homie, read this."
67592,Marge,i didn't really expect things to change this much.
57497,Marge,homer!
67920,Marge,what are you doing?
60063,Marge,"ooh, what a handsome man!"
64849,Marge,who's a possum? you're a possum.
63317,Marge,wait'll i tell the other moms you gave two-thirds of your life force to save me. what a good boy.
55659,Marge,"well, i'm not surprised. lisa's crazy about you. she thinks you hung the moon."
60848,Marge,you were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
64446,Marge,"homie, i'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people..."
62267,Marge,"vegetables, you've been promoted from side dish to entrée."
62723,Marge,you'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance.
56768,Marge,"hello class. hi bart. over here, sweetie. it's me, mom. hi. hey. hello."
55037,Marge,what card?
57263,Marge,"hmmm... maybe it needs a little mayonnaise to get going. okay, you go sit in the sun and let it melt in."
64864,Marge,well we've gotta buy something!
61929,Marge,let me think about it. no.
56141,Marge,homer!
58478,Marge,my poor homie. couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
57174,Marge,no-no-no-no-nooo!
56713,Marge,"well, jay, i hope you tell your new york friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
55916,Marge,"oh, for the love of..."
56591,Marge,"here's bart sleeping... here he is dozing... here he is after a visit from the sandman... ooh, here's nappy-time bart... here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
59834,Marge,i know... but the lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance.
67637,Marge,my woman's intuition is telling me something... i wonder what... oh my god.
54644,Marge,"consent, of course."
59336,Marge,"oh, really? well, knock yourself out. just don't expect any miracles from those two."
67455,Marge,bart!
55493,Marge,am i going too?
57396,Marge,"ohhh! give yourself up, homie!"
56988,Marge,here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
58179,Marge,you're just going into our backyard. no one will see you.
65800,Marge,a completed chore list!
57022,Marge,"mother simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
57261,Marge,"wait -- if i remember my heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter."
67194,Marge,"goodbye, helen."
67314,Marge,you must be the babysitter.
67705,Marge,bien.
60711,Marge,"we had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
64101,Marge,"wait a minute, who am i pleading with?"
64920,Marge,what are you boys doing?
55642,Marge,what's that stench?
67030,Marge,shh! this bully friend of yours... is he a little on the chunky side?
67833,Marge,"homer, please. it's not just the quilt. he's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. he doesn't obey. he's not even housebroken. and we've spent all this money on an obedience school and i don't see any improvement."
66469,Marge,not fake attentive. real attentive.
55219,Marge,do you think she could be a professional some day?
56902,Marge,"growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, bart."
62827,Marge,"um... i-i think a woman came up with nylon stockings. i mean, probably. we certainly use them."
62812,Marge,what'd you call me?
66647,Marge,yesterday's whatsit? why does everyone go to them?
60647,Marge,i'm back here.
56083,Marge,homer!
66311,Marge,apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
67815,Marge,you just need to develop a callous. see?
57136,Marge,"well homer, too. they're so much alike."
64834,Marge,"homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
63185,Marge,"well, at least they left your underwear on. that was nice of them."
65547,Marge,it was not love at first sight!
55416,Marge,"homer, can you run some lines with me?"
55593,Marge,"well, i have some tic tacs in my purse..."
60524,Marge,it says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
57180,Marge,"oh, i give up."
62822,Marge,they're coming down the aisles! what if they want to interact with me!?
60448,Marge,"thanks for coming, mr. mccoy. we cooked your favorites: rattlejailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey."
62957,Marge,"tabitha, what a coincidence -- i was just thinking sad thoughts about you!"
56059,Marge,"your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""the gong show."" and you did it in 1977, remember?"
55933,Marge,have you been up all night eating cheese?
55609,Marge,i can't believe you bought that plow. we can't afford it.
64602,Marge,i hope dylan likes trucks.
67841,Marge,"well, i think we better set an example."
66363,Marge,"i have to get to the church. helen lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer signup sheet. in five minutes, every good task will be taken! dang it!"
59500,Marge,"i hope he didn't cause too much trouble, sheriff."
57564,Marge,don't forget fat people. they can't stop eating!
67357,Marge,"happy anniversary, homer."
59710,Marge,"homie, where did you get that ball of money?"
66539,Marge,those are past-due bills.
61346,Marge,"then how would we ever get to see ""camelot""?"
64300,Marge,what else?
58576,Marge,that means you'll have to be neutered.
64505,Marge,let's give the olympics a miracle!
64992,Marge,at least no one else has taken this drug.
67769,Marge,not to me.
64981,Marge,"oh hello, young man! where's your father?"
57777,Marge,"oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the listen lady!"
63297,Marge,let's see -- what kind of goofy goobly should i be?
60488,Marge,"brave odysseus, it has been twenty long years. regale me with tales of your adventures."
57325,Marge,you went into the attic? i'm very disappointed and terrified.
57830,Marge,yes! and it might look something like this...
63897,Marge,"now homer, boys will be boys."
67253,Marge,"bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in france?"
57614,Marge,i was just with dr. hibbert. he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
62102,Marge,"hold still, homie."
61146,Marge,oh my god! let me help you up!
58048,Marge,"well, i guess you were right, honey. but you have to admit, when that angel started to talk, you were squeezing my hand pretty hard."
59700,Marge,"oh, no. my baby's up there!"
57790,Marge,you've just got to accept it. your gameboy is gone. it's at the bottom of the ocean.
65213,Marge,who am i kidding? i'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. i'm calling homer.
60968,Marge,i could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
57391,Marge,can't we just go upstairs?
67774,Marge,and not just any man.
58897,Marge,"is that somebody you, homer?"
63717,Marge,"now that's enough, you each got one in."
58963,Marge,"well, it's a little late for apologies now."
62299,Marge,the warren harding through-hole never seemed so long.
63039,Marge,"oh my god, he'll kill himself! he'll never hear me say ""i told you so!"""
65060,Marge,"he's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
58888,Marge,i don't want a cellular transmitter sticking out of my roof!
62151,Marge,"captain, wait! i have something here that might change your mind!"
67342,Marge,"oooh, your third bowl... i think you may be on the mend. is there anything else i can get you?"
62854,Marge,"ooh, i can't wait to see what kind of home we live in."
62651,Marge,what are you talking about?
59668,Marge,"i don't know why, but i just didn't feel comfortable until i was back here in new springfield, with my own kind."
64086,Marge,"good night, lisa. good ni-ight!"
63683,Marge,stop all this pandering!
57142,Marge,90 dollars?!
67942,Marge,"if they think less of you because of me, then they're not really your minions."
61535,Marge,"okay kids, this book should help you deal with your feelings."
60743,Marge,"faced with a problem like this, i wonder, what would oprah do?"
61383,Marge,"coltrane? lisa, i'm glad you're ready to love again. but a kitty needs a proper name, like whiskers. or paws scaggs."
60018,Marge,doodlebugs!
58625,Marge,"ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?"
56699,Marge,making out the jury list for the film festival. mayor quimby -- krusty -- jay --
55857,Marge,"now, hurry up or you'll miss your bus."
57938,Marge,"homie, is that you?"
58620,Marge,hmf. i think you've had too much strawberry wine.
67169,Marge,smooth.
56402,Marge,"oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
56323,Marge,never.
55617,Marge,"ohh, now homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something."
58039,Marge,"oh, hello, agnes."
58324,Marge,homer!
66753,Marge,"oh, my poor homie! this is what i was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! thank you, moe."
56389,Marge,"it's cute, but i'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
61613,Marge,"principal skinner, i feel so bad for you."
63408,Marge,well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
61952,Marge,what a delightful sprite.
64152,Marge,"oh, i've missed your nonsense."
61345,Marge,and i love baseball!
66835,Marge,"homer, i want to say something extremely important the way a woman does: subtly through someone else. kids?"
58822,Marge,"homer, i've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
59187,Marge,there goes the clothesline.
58843,Marge,"well, that's a first. i've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before."
56849,Marge,you're breaking the law.
66799,Marge,"well, bring him here now! i want my homie back! i miss him and the things he did!"
62508,Marge,no.
54619,Marge,he loves me so much... after what i did to him!
63004,Marge,you could do something nice for lisa.
63233,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no! let's not get crazy."
62878,Marge,no! i'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
61368,Marge,"you're my rock, homie."
64861,Marge,it wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
54653,Marge,my husband... and my best friend!
58880,Marge,but there's only one way to find out!
62477,Marge,"""dear homer simpson -- mr. burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
65049,Marge,"ooh, couples! that way i can enjoy my massage, and make sure you don't enjoy yours too much."
57873,Marge,"bart, no fireworks! put that back!"
60200,Marge,"hmmm. and, bart is set for the week."
60094,Marge,"all right, but i'm doing this because he was remington steele. he was remington steele, wasn't he?"
60563,Marge,"now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on."
57386,Marge,"yay, mom! all right, mom!"
65185,Marge,"oh this, it's just a little zelzel minchet aletcha wat. it's all i ever eat here."
63104,Marge,"they will be! ready, bullies?"
61630,Marge,our marriage is just an illusion. he doesn't care how i feel at all. he doesn't know how to love.
55782,Marge,i don't know if i like you experimenting on your brother.
65552,Marge,"well, cardinal or cannibal, i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love."
63729,Marge,homer jay simpson!
55790,Marge,uh... not to my knowledge.
57579,Marge,"hello? uh, no, pretzel wagon's no longer -- three hundred pretzels?! wait, wait, let me get this down. mmm... mmm... meatpackers union hall... batavia, new york... i'll send them right out! homer, homie, wake up! wake up, i'm back in business!"
66388,Marge,"grampa, what happened?"
61391,Marge,"marge simpson, long-time reader, first-time stander-upper... did you have any special training to become a writer?"
57109,Marge,those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
61353,Marge,i've already drawn up the petition.
62410,Marge,"i spy with my little eye, a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised."
57464,Marge,none! they would have more sense than that.
56293,Marge,i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. you're being completely paranoid.
65555,Marge,"homie, the faucet is dripping."
56816,Marge,no.
62238,Marge,i called that bosom bar. the bartender said you were there alone.
59680,Marge,mmmm.
62438,Marge,"chief, don't you think you've had enough?"
55319,Marge,"well, he fooled almost everyone. but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
60360,Marge,what's going on?
66743,Marge,i don't know.
57872,Marge,"no. no lisa, they're just... sleeping. upside down. and inside out."
58685,Marge,"yes. you've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
64514,Marge,"ooh, good idea. bart, what are you doing for black history month?"
55076,Marge,"homer, for god's sakes, let him deliver the baby!"
57525,Marge,space coyote?
66211,Marge,on a friday afternoon?! i bet he's playing poker again!
61932,Marge,i don't see lisa in any of the seminars!
60739,Marge,that doesn't sound very convincing.
66593,Marge,it's everywhere.
61414,Marge,"this story is as dark as those new milky way bars. ooh, that's a good analogy. i'll work it in somewhere. but now i need some romance, pronto!"
63143,Marge,"it's true -- i do have trouble saying ""no."" it all started when i was seven..."
67009,Marge,"now, doctor, that's not true."
60311,Marge,"oh yeah, like erin brockovich."
54604,Marge,professor august says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.
55622,Marge,"hmmm, i don't think so. oh, maggie, when are you going to talk?"
66028,Marge,dammit!
59830,Marge,i know just where you can get one.
58042,Marge,"there has to be more to life than just what we see, lisa. everyone needs something to believe in."
67514,Marge,"yes, well, we saw a daredevil last night and, well, you know, monkey see, monkey do."
67505,Marge,"now, come on, you two. what time does your little truck game start?"
60322,Marge,professor frink?
56564,Marge,they are?
62839,Marge,cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.
61854,Marge,"lisa, wait..."
59097,Marge,were you or lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
62728,Marge,"homie, i've been thinking. we have been using this tv for a long time. so i entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen tv."
63476,Marge,"you are out of control! the late nights, the eating! you've actually outgrown your cape!"
65312,Marge,"yeah, look!"
55887,Marge,look what i got. now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
63602,Marge,"so you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!"
55750,Marge,"no, no. someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""the corey hotline."""
57239,Marge,it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
55183,Marge,"well, you know, maybe he's right."
56620,Marge,there's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. just rinse it good...
56230,Marge,what about abe simpson? don't you have any feelings for him?
56952,Marge,bart!
65246,Marge,don't talk to me like i'm a client!
58560,Marge,"bart, i'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. your lizards are banned by federal law."
56076,Marge,homer! what is it? slow down.
54877,Marge,"oh, bart. why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
63902,Marge,that was unforgivable. but i'm beginning to think that bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase.
56927,Marge,that's it. we're going downtown to get our kids back. right now!
62913,Marge,"ooh, it's a mugger! i'll hand over all my hugs and kisses!"
67106,Marge,"bart, are you all right?"
55359,Marge,"this chair is $2,000. we could buy a whole living room set for that."
62435,Marge,"oh, i'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! it could leave you sterile down there."
57374,Marge,i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the world series!
65779,Marge,do you have to do that in front of people?
62263,Marge,but... you're still fat!
56226,Marge,"i love ya! i love ya! i love ya! i love ya, mom! gotta go!"
64562,Marge,you mean... he kissed her?
64782,Marge,why did you do that?
58545,Marge,"i don't know, and i don't want to know. and i'm going to find out!"
57682,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe! hmmm, you feel softer than before."
64515,Marge,what happened next?
65046,Marge,"actually, we pay them for each peach we take home."
58946,Marge,"i'm really sorry, everybody, but i've tried everything. i'm afraid we're just going to have to learn to live with it."
63956,Marge,don't be silly. our marriage can weather any storm -- just like this tree.
61683,Marge,more alive than any of you squares!
55145,Marge,noooooooo!!
62070,Marge,of course. everyone should do whatever they want. take a bear to church! read a book with your feet! change your name to gooble-glop!
62100,Marge,"homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest."
57356,Marge,"homer, please, you're hurting my arm!"
65331,Marge,"well. i usually take lisa, but i can just go with bart."
62905,Marge,i don't recognize that name.
60935,Marge,"i'm so sorry, reverend."
61085,Marge,why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
61872,Marge,"nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? i have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
62801,Marge,"my friends call me ""marge""."
57994,Marge,"c'mon, kids. we're goin' home."
61502,Marge,"lisa, i'm surprised. your sister just wants to learn and be like you. well, maybe she needs a better role model."
55030,Marge,you don't have to do that.
58043,Marge,"my poor lisa. if you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... i feel sorry for you."
62946,Marge,"uh, let's see here... ooh, here's something the book's previous owner underlined! ""be honest with your partner about what you're feeling."""
62376,Marge,"okay. uh... you know, up close you're kinda cute."
62894,Marge,you really mean that?
65416,Marge,no! irish and long island!
58272,Marge,here's $42 -- it's everything i have. run home and bury it in the yard.
62113,Marge,"homie, if you die, i'm gonna have three kids to take care of. i want you to buy some life insurance. please?"
66320,Marge,"i don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
60163,Marge,bart!
62176,Marge,i'm so excited. it's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron.
58668,Marge,what is it with you and robots?
61801,Marge,"when virginia woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
61875,Marge,"now, i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt."
62522,Marge,i think i might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
65828,Marge,"homer, bart said the kids were going to the van houtens, but luann just told me they're supposed to be here. they've disappeared!"
55181,Marge,of course i saved them.
64385,Marge,"dammit, why won't you touch me?"
63188,Marge,my husband is out there!
66902,Marge,"homie, after all this, do you still believe in god?"
64738,Marge,thank god! i will never do that again.
62175,Marge,"well, aren't you?"
64529,Marge,one month? that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
65478,Marge,"here, right?"
65261,Marge,"which means, it's the start of christmas season...which means..."
55484,Marge,oh dear. it would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
64225,Marge,surprise! i redecorated!
55849,Marge,oooh!
67445,Marge,"now, now, homer. bart's busy working on his science project."
62785,Marge,you've been transferred to india!?
55161,Marge,don't.
63685,Marge,"lisa, i'm sure this wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter."
60334,Marge,"it may contain brief rudeness, adult explosions, and scenes with garry shandling."
62141,Marge,what are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
57149,Marge,"yeah. hi, evelyn."
63920,Marge,of course we were.
57636,Marge,the house is still a mess and i'm going bald from stress --
67719,Marge,homer!
65559,Marge,everyone relax. i think i've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere.
60220,Marge,who wants some astro-lemonade?
61734,Marge,"oh, you children are too suspicious. it's go time."
55431,Marge,why? are you going?
59142,Marge,is that lisa?
56774,Marge,and i'm gonna keep teaching your class. like it or lump it.
63974,Marge,"okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one christmas present with no hurt feelings. i'm returning this kitten calendar."
63315,Marge,i think i'll go to bed.
66148,Marge,"i'm engaged to you, my love."
57245,Marge,"""parent's occupation... please note: homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. that's why you don't get paid for it."""
58731,Marge,it's so nice to have a peaceful weekend together.
67546,Marge,snuh!
60622,Marge,"well, let me sew that up for you."
62931,Marge,homer? homer? now we have to kiss. the big tv is telling us to!
56195,Marge,"i'm not sure if i'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. how would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
59916,Marge,are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
67560,Marge,"hmmm, sure. oh, dear. i can't. i've got three protest rallies tomorrow."
62250,Marge,"doctor, you're a pediatrician!"
57415,Marge,you're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the english language are marge simpson!
59238,Marge,"kids, turn off the tv. i have some bad news about lenny."
59313,Marge,what about mr. burns? maybe he'll help us out.
63450,Marge,"sweetheart, what do you mean?"
65982,Marge,what did he do now?
57877,Marge,you better start saving now. it's very expensive.
59819,Marge,scary talented. and i'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it.
63218,Marge,"lisa, it was wonderful! i am such a proud hitachee mother."
54641,Marge,"well, i know you'd never say anything that isn't objective..."
60392,Marge,for the last twenty years!
60384,Marge,"artie. artie, no. stop."
65809,Marge,"and now that i know better, no dvds for you kids. just educational television."
66199,Marge,what's going on?
59164,Marge,you always liked my pork chops.
63163,Marge,"i don't care how successful gil is, he's still a mooch, and i need to tell him off!"
56087,Marge,you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar... cute.
64011,Marge,"oh hiya, martin! how's the model u.n.?"
60888,Marge,ten... e-le-ven... twelve!
55570,Marge,"oh, and how about piping in some tom jones music? that always cheers me up."
59252,Marge,how ingenious. the forks are made out of lego.
67928,Marge,"it's getting less and less likely you're going to yell ""surprise"" and have all my friends jump out..."
56859,Marge,i don't think so.
63544,Marge,"all right, this time i'm going. i'm really going to visit a bank robber. a man who held a gun on me. going to see him in prison, where guards will frisk me, paw through my purse, and... oooh, there's apple picking just up the road!"
58201,Marge,that was fun. i wish we had a glass bottom car. i can't help but wonder what we're missing.
60065,Marge,"hey, what are you doing?"
64265,Marge,othello... richard the third...
56518,Marge,you threw them out the window in a fit of passion. you said you were never going to need them again.
58001,Marge,i was thinking more like protection for... down there.
61171,Marge,just like real indians!
63165,Marge,"listen, bub. i have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
61457,Marge,boring? is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
67385,Marge,"let's go, children."
60926,Marge,that's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
60043,Marge,"homer, don't you have any respect?"
60070,Marge,townspeople...
66605,Marge,bubble gum cigarettes?
66624,Marge,we don't have drone delivery! you'll have to find a substitute!
55471,Marge,we have one at home. you never use it.
58147,Marge,"i know you're used to getting hate mail, but i'm not."
55451,Marge,i'm tired of having this argument every sunday. get dressed.
57945,Marge,"ohh, you want more syrup, honey?"
64947,Marge,"homie, you always mean to say the nicest things."
61509,Marge,lisa... lisa...
63224,Marge,stop the wedding!
57959,Marge,his name is homer.
66870,Marge,i hope no one was hurt.
67857,Marge,i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust.
55598,Marge,"well, who was it?"
62083,Marge,"bart, lisa went over to janey's. quick, run inside and go potty!"
60596,Marge,even better.
61377,Marge,"looks like everything's back the way it was, which is the only way it should ever be."
61577,Marge,homer?
61559,Marge,do you have to make such an unholy racket?
55828,Marge,"gee, that's odd. they didn't send one to you."
59315,Marge,"boy, that sounds fun."
57523,Marge,"homer, don't you see? our differences are only skin-deep..."
55893,Marge,hmm. this one's done in different handwriting.
63049,Marge,i have to be honest with you -- i can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
56235,Marge,"... there's that. or, you could take an adult education course."
66105,Marge,leave me alone!
63368,Marge,"next time maggie does that in a pool, tell me quietly, don't announce it."
65842,Marge,"oh homie, you're so... enlightened."
62389,Marge,"i'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband."
57043,Marge,"rockabye baby in the tree top / when the wind blows / the cradle will rock / when the bough breaks / the cradle will fall / and down will come baby, cradle and all."
62164,Marge,"which came first, turkey the bird or turkey the you guys?"
66456,Marge,"yeah, i was a little surprised i wasn't considered before. todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. por favor, perdoa-lhe."
66810,Marge,we love you!
62637,Marge,of course.
57402,Marge,"and the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--"
57725,Marge,what on earth happened down there?
57379,Marge,no! what if he's crazy?
66701,Marge,"stop that, all of you. it's not bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid."
62661,Marge,"that's not a pan, it's a colander!"
57332,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. the waffle iron's in the shop."
63817,Marge,clothing?
60333,Marge,wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got together?
63395,Marge,the school's having a bake sale today! at three o'clock!
63413,Marge,elmo!
54992,Marge,"well, duh."
55472,Marge,that is so sweet.
62060,Marge,oh no. no no. no. i'm just... surprised.
60782,Marge,"c'mon, lisa. it's time to go."
58025,Marge,hello. so... what brings you to america?
56050,Marge,oh that's sweet. guess what. there's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. i got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
65410,Marge,your father must be sleeping on his side again.
59170,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
59528,Marge,"but you need to try things on! every brand has a different idea of ""husky."""
54678,Marge,"those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me. because i know everything that you've done, and yet i still want to be with you."
57858,Marge,"sorry, sorry."
57613,Marge,"homie, i'm losing my hair."
59729,Marge,"well, maybe a sip. i don't want to offend our mentalist."
63922,Marge,"well, we thought we'd wait a little while."
60042,Marge,poor ned. he can't look anywhere without being reminded of maude.
61658,Marge,so much for getting my groove back.
57328,Marge,i think i'll bottle-feed that one.
66428,Marge,sure.
63184,Marge,what a great day.
57411,Marge,oh? i've lived in this town for 37 years.
55006,Marge,"don't worry. whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
61343,Marge,and i'm an american!
54607,Marge,homer! you're embarrassing me!
59236,Marge,"oh no, not lenny. not lenny!"
65845,Marge,"if you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!"
55426,Marge,"that reahlly doesn't help, baht."
56431,Marge,homer! the sky is blue. donuts are plentiful. friday is tgif night on abc. what's gotten into you?
55120,Marge,look at these prices. we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
58694,Marge,that's not the point. and another thing. i asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
55142,Marge,get out.
61973,Marge,quit playing dumb.
67475,Marge,open the can.
57358,Marge,"homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. you're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor."
55527,Marge,"bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
61250,Marge,you were?
59413,Marge,they sound angry... and africanized.
67362,Marge,"homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
65201,Marge,"kids, i was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?"
63483,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
64867,Marge,i could use some help!
57511,Marge,you promised you wouldn't drink!
65465,Marge,"i know my son did a terrible thing. but there's a chapel on this ship, and in that chapel there's a book, and it says, ""judge not, lest ye--"
55888,Marge,"homer, you're going to be famous!"
59797,Marge,a convict painted that?
61905,Marge,"you know, chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place."
57621,Marge,i guess we're not going to find anyone.
59186,Marge,who's going to clean up all those jets?
67292,Marge,"well, maggie, it's just you and me again."
61422,Marge,i suppose i better. your father's a very private person.
57345,Marge,"mr. scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. i keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
65225,Marge,i hope bart's having fun.
64289,Marge,"i googled ""girls having fun,"" and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, i found ""crazy bowling."""
65349,Marge,"not without us, it isn't! pull over."
55940,Marge,homer?! did you eat that donut?
65298,Marge,"bart, it's okay to say that at home, but not in court! take it back!"
67689,Marge,"i'm sorry, i don't even know your name."
57349,Marge,"i knew you'd do well, homer."
64196,Marge,"feeling better, super dad?"
67522,Marge,"well, he's got a pretty good father."
64676,Marge,"well, whoever moves in, it can't be worse than having a murderer next door."
61589,Marge,it's important for me to see you take at least one step. then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
59279,Marge,what in the world?
59550,Marge,"lisa's gone berserk! do something, homer! do something!"
56162,Marge,or double-ply windows! they look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
67804,Marge,"well, then, feed him!"
65758,Marge,just cut the glass!
61390,Marge,"esme delacroix! she wrote ""to kiss a scoundrel!"""
56855,Marge,homer!
66942,Marge,"take it, homer!"
65305,Marge,"lenny, do you live here?"
55009,Marge,that's very clever.
61530,Marge,i'm not.
59897,Marge,"honey, i'll make it up to you in bottle rockets."
62153,Marge,"""dear mom and dad: we don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the rv back to the dealer."" we've got to stop them."
55485,Marge,"homer, those are ice cream men."
57779,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. you've got lots to live for."
64771,Marge,"no, it was berry-peach!"
58336,Marge,they want you to spy on your friends?
64202,Marge,janey.
58252,Marge,what business enterprise?
57582,Marge,"well, here i am -- 11905 dead weasel road, but i don't see any apartment building, i just --"
54909,Marge,"now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
63179,Marge,much better.
55667,Marge,no there isn't.
66604,Marge,what's going on? are you kids eating your feelings?
66417,Marge,"oh please, homie..."
59405,Marge,it's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both lynda carter and george foreman.
62947,Marge,"hmmm... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way."""
60773,Marge,i've heard about you vendors!
64609,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's adorable! this one's going on the christmas tree."
62958,Marge,what? no! no! what? no! what?
59986,Marge,"stay in the boat, homer."
67276,Marge,"goodbye, adil. it was a pleasure..."
63638,Marge,whoa! those buns are poppin' fresh!
66288,Marge,now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
58894,Marge,"oh, that's not the point. we should report this to an omnitouch care-rep. people's privacy is at stake."
60930,Marge,how bad is it?
59264,Marge,"well, you don't have to be sarcastic."
62674,Marge,we couldn't find a way out.
65155,Marge,take off the 3-d glasses!
62108,Marge,he's cleaning out the garage. i can picture it now...
60126,Marge,no!
63601,Marge,fine. since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
56004,Marge,"oh, i don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. i mean these are professional lawmen and..."
66916,Marge,you will not be getting a tattoo for christmas.
59415,Marge,i don't see why not.
63257,Marge,"be nice, homer. don't you see how great it is that they found each other? like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog."
60036,Marge,"it's all right, boys."
63725,Marge,that quick talking is never a good sign.
65931,Marge,they had to! it came from corporate!
58068,Marge,"what in the heck is a ""dwelling""?"
55967,Marge,hey wait!
60661,Marge,dessert is three desserts.
56834,Marge,"you don't have to call me ""officer."" i'm not on duty here."
67509,Marge,"ooo, i think there's one over there."
59813,Marge,"oh jack, that's so soulful. how did someone so sensitive end up here?"
58268,Marge,"ooo, diego's not gonna like that."
57291,Marge,"well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried everything here."
60251,Marge,oh no! our daughter's run away on christmas eve.
66759,Marge,no casual racism!
55838,Marge,homer!
55899,Marge,no!
66973,Marge,there he is!
57517,Marge,"oh, homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
60523,Marge,but homer...
64060,Marge,"come on, kids! let's take our stuff back inside."
63640,Marge,"listen, homer, i gotta be honest with you..."
66061,Marge,one of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...
56020,Marge,i told you this was a bad idea!
61325,Marge,you've made that promise before.
63205,Marge,we were together for five years! now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
66542,Marge,"oh! oh no, you're right, homer! abort! abort!"
55449,Marge,"get up, homer. it's time for church."
58461,Marge,got 'em.
66580,Marge,oh it!
67322,Marge,"okay, but watch out. don't slam my head like last time."
67768,Marge,...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire.
57608,Marge,does anyone else want anything while i'm up?
60714,Marge,"that was great, homie."
65446,Marge,there is no mrs. steak. who could stay married to such a man.
59951,Marge,springfield baby-proofing?
67221,Marge,bart!
58096,Marge,"well, i can too compete. and i'm going to sell a house. end of story."
65299,Marge,"now, lisa tell your side of the story. and use your big voice."
65681,Marge,"fine! i admit it, you... nipple nazis! i give my baby formula!"
64215,Marge,"wow, your first day at the new school! lisa, have fun! bart, don't!"
66033,Marge,maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.
61852,Marge,"gee, i did the best i could..."
62223,Marge,he's become one of them!
67671,Marge,i think this is sick. they're staring at a dot!
62849,Marge,"oh, you're sweet. i'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?"
58375,Marge,moving the whole town five miles down the road! it's crazy!
56096,Marge,what is it?
58481,Marge,"i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance. it's a little thick, but the price is right."
61044,Marge,"here it is, this week's family activity."
67691,Marge,"well thank you, artie."
66737,Marge,apu is a good man. he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the costington center.
55223,Marge,bad dog! very bad dog.
67380,Marge,all right. but if anything happens...
58496,Marge,something electrical might be good.
65238,Marge,"well, you certainly won't be bending me-- wait, how did i end up in your bedroom?"
56135,Marge,who wants ginger snaps?
56054,Marge,"actually, i think it might really help our economy."
55490,Marge,"your doll is trying to kill my husband!... yes, i'll hold."
67241,Marge,homer! what happened?
61620,Marge,"well, it's... in my case... hmm."
63235,Marge,now you can cut!
59025,Marge,"fine. if we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. i wrote another poem about a duck."
55100,Marge,"oh bart, i've missed you so much."
62834,Marge,i don't know. i'm still frowny with you. do you really think women are mentally inferior?
64399,Marge,your perfectly-trimmed mustache...
65518,Marge,i'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
58711,Marge,no!
66041,Marge,our first anniversary.
65279,Marge,"okay, everyone. smile while the pets take our picture."
60007,Marge,stop it!
62498,Marge,i'd love to! i'll be right... wait... are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
56303,Marge,"homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
59257,Marge,"apu, come quick! you're missing the miracle!"
54760,Marge,"homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? i can't believe your selfishness. you can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. you're thinking about fishing, even when i'm talking... right now. right?"
62512,Marge,yes.
61364,Marge,that ad makes me look like a criminal.
66067,Marge,"listen, i want us to be honest with each other."
62818,Marge,maybe not so loveable...
59531,Marge,"ooh, ""tango de la muerte."" i've been dying to see that movie!"
61621,Marge,you just say...
57806,Marge,did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
57687,Marge,"we're very proud of you, by the way."
67573,Marge,"what is it? what? ""smartline?"" yes, i've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. well, i'd love to."
56744,Marge,bart! don't ever say that word again!
64744,Marge,no it's not!
62217,Marge,you're drooling on my goodwill pile!
56970,Marge,homer! where did you get that?
57883,Marge,that's not a funny story.
59848,Marge,"oh, geez..."
59477,Marge,"well, you still have lenny and carl."
67644,Marge,i love you too!
60933,Marge,please give the church back.
56221,Marge,"bart! homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love?"
55232,Marge,but we never ever...
57901,Marge,those were the days.
62630,Marge,"homie, you just met this british man. it's too soon to get so emotionally invested."
64447,Marge,homer! where are you?
59660,Marge,"oh honey, i wouldn't say doomed. it's gonna be an adjustment, no question..."
63100,Marge,"homer, where are you?"
62366,Marge,an oogli-boogli!
66152,Marge,"she's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
61461,Marge,"homie, they're beautiful. that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! i feel a swoon coming on... here it is!"
67511,Marge,thank you so much.
61091,Marge,i didn't gasp like that until i was eighteen!
66274,Marge,any more questions?
57972,Marge,"homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts."
63911,Marge,"homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!"
65253,Marge,"no more tv! we're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the museum... of television."
65746,Marge,"what, 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top?"
61988,Marge,of course not! i'm in bed with homer!
64944,Marge,"well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old tv show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy."
60983,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
61223,Marge,this is more violent than the hip hop awards. you've got to stop your father!
62702,Marge,"hmm, well, then maybe i will come by more often. and homer can spend more time with our kids... he's watching them now!"
57477,Marge,"well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
60369,Marge,so many dings.
56624,Marge,yes.
59325,Marge,finally...
59268,Marge,"oh, look at all that sweet n' low."
61776,Marge,stop that! we're guests in mr. burns!
62969,Marge,"carpool, nelson!"
66279,Marge,no second verses! they creep me out.
55480,Marge,"oh. well, yes, that's what i meant, too. well, tell you what. this afternoon, i'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
58500,Marge,what happened? you didn't fall.
61241,Marge,i really shouldn't be here -- i have a problem with games of chance. i played candyland with maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
65985,Marge,sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
61275,Marge,"bart, you're not helping."
62912,Marge,"go ahead, maggie. you're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."
58702,Marge,"wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! seals and crofts, pablo cruise, air supply, ohhhh, loggins and oates! and it's free!"
66108,Marge,oh my god. our train! homie you do care. you care a lot!
65278,Marge,"everyone, it's a girl!"
60598,Marge,"manjula, come quick! the octuplets said their first words."
61654,Marge,"you know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to miami!"
60974,Marge,"lisa, i'm so impressed you're state champ."
64715,Marge,"lisa, look!"
61256,Marge,which means someone lost it. you'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it.
63973,Marge,"gee, they sure give the christmas spirit the bum's rush around here."
59706,Marge,"an ""a"" in astronomy. how'd you do it?"
66919,Marge,"well, homer and i are looking forward to your visit, too."
66517,Marge,why don't we have any couples friends?
58793,Marge,annnd... now.
63189,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so worried. but if i concentrate, our love is so strong, i know i can hear your thoughts."
61684,Marge,"get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
60872,Marge,what if i can't feel comfortable outside again?
58156,Marge,"besides, it's mine. yoink!"
57926,Marge,"well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
57961,Marge,candied apple!
64297,Marge,"okay, i'm going to put a stop to this ""ultimate punching."""
60809,Marge,he's betrothed to martha take-a-punch.
67622,Marge,"well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better. and he mispronounced words that even i know, like abdomen. and his office was dirty. now that i think about it, i'm not sure he's even a doctor."
58491,Marge,"that doesn't sound like me. well, i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant."
62084,Marge,"lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?"
55646,Marge,"anyway, bart had just entered the ""terrible twos."""
61606,Marge,you're getting acid in the bed!
64876,Marge,"this tree reminds me of your father. it's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it."
56177,Marge,"uh, sure."
59440,Marge,"that's it, bart. you're taking this man-of-the-house thing too far."
61758,Marge,the food is so delicious here. and these chanel suits are five for a dollar! i'm using a jacket as a napkin.
54603,Marge,"professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the third world?"
58838,Marge,"well, that's a nice feature. not much headroom, though..."
60446,Marge,bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
64538,Marge,don't contradict me in front of our son!
55655,Marge,here she is!
56247,Marge,what the darn...?
55130,Marge,you're a very selfish man.
55202,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
58595,Marge,suckers.
61332,Marge,it's on batteries.
54926,Marge,he's been gone for two days.
65730,Marge,"you're a good man, homer simpson."
63372,Marge,you're nothing but a diabolical master thief. the kind that haunts the slopes of san moritz or the casinos of monte carlo.
60102,Marge,"sorry, sometimes i forget."
56838,Marge,"look, lisa. it's mcgriff the crime dog."
65534,Marge,"well at least it didn't end as bad as ""romeo and juliet."""
66530,Marge,homer!
59685,Marge,"look, maggie. christopher walken's reading ""goodnight moon!"""
58462,Marge,clothes! we're saved!
55591,Marge,and this is for the man of the house... which i guess... is you.
65694,Marge,you know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!
56780,Marge,"bart, you said you were going to study."
61517,Marge,"honey, i know you're scared. but there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there."
64905,Marge,you can't buy white wine!
62218,Marge,and why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
62131,Marge,"oh please. from what i hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""google""-ing your own name until lunch."
66403,Marge,i didn't mind that he grew bald... i didn't mind that he got fat... i didn't mind that he got fatter. but no one told me he'd get older than me.
65715,Marge,"i can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush..."
55131,Marge,"homer, i think that chip's got enough dip on it."
62068,Marge,whoa! save something for your wedding night.
65978,Marge,"well, dumbo had a magic feather. he thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time."
65039,Marge,uh... twenty-three dollars... and there's a can of beans in my car.
66622,Marge,"no! no, no, no! it was me that couldn't get to--"
54938,Marge,"homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. if you keep spending time with lisa, she'll forgive you."
62305,Marge,"bart, don't make fun of grad students -- they just made a terrible life choice."
67168,Marge,yes.
54648,Marge,you oppose marriage?
60762,Marge,"thank you, fellas."
67894,Marge,i thought i did.
64304,Marge,"call me a killjoy, but i think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should be able to enjoy it."
63540,Marge,you said you visited him every night.
63414,Marge,um... um...
57238,Marge,"patty! go on, selma, tell me more."
60208,Marge,maybe.
55530,Marge,"bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
64229,Marge,without me? how'd you get there?
62562,Marge,"no, i don't. i'm still upset about what happened today. i don't have many friends and when i finally start to make some, you ruin it!"
56497,Marge,"groundskeeper willie saved you, homer."
60564,Marge,"homer, these people are professional roasters. don't give them fodder!"
58753,Marge,but her forehead's on fire.
64253,Marge,"wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""i dare not"" wait upon ""i would?"""
66254,Marge,"sorry kids, i guess the hats and mittens will have to wait until next year."
60565,Marge,what are you doing here?
56539,Marge,"mm, no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine. and it's too expensive."
59893,Marge,"look, we're all trying to have dinner. so why don't we just... psych! psych! psych!"
57120,Marge,bart! where do you pick up words like that?
54700,Marge,"with his marriage in this much trouble, he's got a lot of thinking to do."
58926,Marge,"excuse me, mister... trainee, i'm trying to find a musical doorbell."
59084,Marge,"no, no, no! we want plane tickets home to springfield."
62087,Marge,"well, let's count that anyway."
61678,Marge,and nobody does it better.
66635,Marge,"gil, i've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
65451,Marge,"yeah... actually, my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for. it took her years to get the whole set."
65228,Marge,if you kissed her that would be lovely.
60748,Marge,what on earth have you done? my mcguppies became bazongas!
60796,Marge,ooh... please be a melon-baller. please be a melon-baller.
55796,Marge,lisa needs braces.
62865,Marge,"nope. i'm sorry, admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
66872,Marge,apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
58968,Marge,"oh, how embarrassing. oh, we slept right through church."
63223,Marge,then that must be it.
64680,Marge,you're home early!
63852,Marge,"oh, homie. i got you something too."
63820,Marge,the door's open! i think someone broke in!
56022,Marge,i can name ten things! i... i made sloppy joes...
60034,Marge,bart!!!
62462,Marge,just do it! trust me!
67935,Marge,all i see is that rock.
54880,Marge,oh my lord!
67575,Marge,excuse me. there is! i think that it's a bad influence on children.
57645,Marge,"'morning, roy!"
61719,Marge,it was years before i could trust a boy again.
60566,Marge,"so, i guess you can't destroy earth, since so many of your favorite celebrities live and work there."
66435,Marge,five figures!
58357,Marge,kiss it and make it boogie!
55448,Marge,"well, maybe just a little."
57134,Marge,"grampa, i know in your day spanking was common, but homer and i just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
61186,Marge,exactly. the pre-teen braves.
66030,Marge,"i still can't believe it was carl who took your winnings. i thought it would have been you, or you, or you."
58505,Marge,"no, bart. homer... all these inventions, they're..."
63603,Marge,"why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? so i put pineapple in my potato salad. live a little, huh!"
67438,Marge,"awww. come to bed, homie."
63213,Marge,shut up!
55457,Marge,"i can't believe you're giving up church, homer."
64726,Marge,"hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
66455,Marge,um... deixar meu marido sozinho!
59978,Marge,nobody's a warthog.
63116,Marge,"bartholomew j. simpson, how can you be so mean?"
65647,Marge,are you doing an app behind my back?
65564,Marge,"well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the rx-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven."
63700,Marge,a carnival? what's so romantic about this?
64031,Marge,you used protection. we never had any!
54841,Marge,"thank you, homie."
63197,Marge,"no, france."
56488,Marge,"look, maybe this whole thing will blow over."
64461,Marge,who's ready for panini?
57283,Marge,you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
57220,Marge,except...
66255,Marge,look at all these out-of-state license plates!
56291,Marge,homer?
59566,Marge,"becky, what have i done here? i'm so sorry."
58592,Marge,i am so -ing embarrassed.
57976,Marge,"homer, i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage."
64014,Marge,"a ""castle""... i know where they are!"
58275,Marge,"so, renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to moe. do you mind if i ask why?"
56175,Marge,then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
57440,Marge,"it's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. and we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... ooh, an oyster mallet! ""made in u.s.a.""? eh, no thank you!"
56724,Marge,maggie! don't talk with your mouth full.
55205,Marge,and the next man wants to hit the ball too. and he does. and there he goes off in that direction. and everyone is happy.
56306,Marge,"yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy? children, your father and i have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. it's time to learn about love."
55585,Marge,gimme that.
61715,Marge,"now, i'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""w-b""..."
61229,Marge,ta-da!
55084,Marge,"y'know bart, i don't think this is such a bad present. maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
65469,Marge,"homer! people are here to see the movie, not listen to you!"
66479,Marge,we need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
58056,Marge,ooo... oo! there's an azalea festival at the public garden!
58130,Marge,homer!
55372,Marge,"maggie, you talked!"
67154,Marge,no.
67166,Marge,"hm, very smooth."
54626,Marge,you know what i want to be when i grow up?
65398,Marge,"relax, everyone knows that if you die in a dream, you just wake up!"
64356,Marge,i guess it is time to move on...
61569,Marge,i can't believe i drove drunk.
54782,Marge,i don't think so.
61983,Marge,"get lost, rummy!"
65223,Marge,"oh honey, i'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. but you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?"
57092,Marge,he's not my little baby anymore. maybe i mother him too much.
54661,Marge,"excuse me, is this room one-oh-six?"
56033,Marge,good. i'm glad we had this talk.
56551,Marge,"ready for breakfast, doctor smith?"
63449,Marge,"look at this business center -- fax, wi-fi, teleconferencing capabilities... i'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!"
58139,Marge,"well, at least the burglar's having a merry christmas."
67823,Marge,"well, homer. there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
67785,Marge,"any luck, homie?"
62544,Marge,bart... lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
64376,Marge,"tomorrow, my love."
55522,Marge,"oh, my poor baby."
60806,Marge,almost done.
61583,Marge,"hey, you're right! what i enjoyed was spending time with my husband."
66101,Marge,"that is so sweet! there i go again, settling!"
60940,Marge,"homer, send these people home. this housewarming party's been going on for two days."
61820,Marge,why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?
66399,Marge,are you wearing sock garters?
60759,Marge,"now, don't get too used to these. that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days."
66216,Marge,"oh, i'm so sorry."
65817,Marge,"homie, help me find them."
62288,Marge,"three million, one hundred and--"
55756,Marge,i think we should go.
65214,Marge,"foodies, help me! my husband's in danger!"
65996,Marge,stop making putin jokes!
58541,Marge,"you disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?"
66205,Marge,how was work?
61007,Marge,there has to be a solution that pleases everyone. from ducks and trees to yous and mes.
59567,Marge,"becky, i know you must feel awful. but at least this didn't happen after you were married."
56732,Marge,"yes, the dog..."
65260,Marge,i hereby declare thanksgiving dinner officially over!
59306,Marge,no!
58523,Marge,"that was no accident! shame on you, nelson."
63256,Marge,"yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening."
64093,Marge,"well, it would be nice if the first thing i saw was a world at peace..."
66741,Marge,wish homer was here.
55191,Marge,"no, behind her."
63631,Marge,i'm going to the successful ladies room!
55956,Marge,"well, i do have a life outside this house, you know."
67713,Marge,maybe i'll wear my hair... up.
55898,Marge,you awful man. stay away from my son.
56081,Marge,that's true. will you forgive me?
58119,Marge,"hey, kids, i made your favorite cookies -- christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for bart."
55623,Marge,"according to 'fretful mother' magazine, if maggie doesn't talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender."
57472,Marge,it's the most perfect wedding i could ever ask for. you even got a hip rock 'n' roll combo.
57977,Marge,"but this is the first time since we've been married that i've actually feared for our lives. so i'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun."
54897,Marge,"oh hello, mrs. pennycandy."
61748,Marge,"well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride."
61479,Marge,you're panhandling! i should have known from that panhandling sign! plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
64878,Marge,but i...
62136,Marge,"kids, come back in the house!"
60971,Marge,"well this is very impressive, lisa. i'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
67820,Marge,a hundred and twenty-five dollars!!
57595,Marge,"oh, i don't hate you for failing. i love you for trying."
64059,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe what you doodily-did for us."
63737,Marge,they came in one at a time.
55889,Marge,have you seen bart?
59057,Marge,who's up for some beers?
55477,Marge,"honey, no one's going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant?"
64700,Marge,you can't even show it in the bar?
55178,Marge,i am not!
64325,Marge,i knew it!
62519,Marge,"well, bart, i guess that's it. we'll have to go back to our separate things."
56824,Marge,that's better.
60802,Marge,twenty-three skidoo!
66088,Marge,no tattling!
62876,Marge,"i've had a lovely evening, mr. simpson."
59504,Marge,homer no. you'll kill us all.
64428,Marge,"oh, there's so many photo ops, but i already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot c sign... the tram... a license plate from canada..."
62632,Marge,"homer, look what this is doing to grampa. we have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
61673,Marge,"that boy failed show and tell, but he's on our ass like sherlock holmes."
61761,Marge,"i think i'm going to like this ""america."""
62105,Marge,is there anything more fun than a nice sunday drive?
58945,Marge,"oh, your father traded our tools for m&m's again. ah, the heck with it."
63845,Marge,"i already don't! homer, i've got great news!"
54613,Marge,have you really read all these books?
64414,Marge,no... we could not.
62745,Marge,"as long as it's not a knock-knock joke. i always ruin them by saying ""come in."""
62327,Marge,"well, homer and bart are well, they're under the weather."
60609,Marge,you'll get the hang of it. today's just a little gusty.
62552,Marge,what's that smell?
63439,Marge,"homer, you smell like chicago. did you fly there on a commercial airline?"
59455,Marge,we're not giving you money.
55036,Marge,"well, i haven't said no to you lately, have i?"
63780,Marge,"well, you're very welcome, lurleen. of all the women who've hit on homer over the years, you're my favorite."
66025,Marge,no karate monsters in the bathtub!
55258,Marge,"homie, did you close the gate?"
65929,Marge,"are there any two words more exciting than ""couch shopping?"""
62704,Marge,chocks?! why don't we try it... freestyle.
67185,Marge,"here you go, kids. special lunches. lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun."
66921,Marge,go get your money.
60460,Marge,there is no xfl this year. the league folded.
64660,Marge,bart?!
57640,Marge,you're missing the itchy and scratchy show! don't you like it anymore?
64530,Marge,thanks for doing the dishes.
58343,Marge,"honey, i'd love to reassure you, but right now mommy needs a tetanus shot."
55213,Marge,"oh, dear."
61551,Marge,"well, i've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay."
56035,Marge,bart! be quiet!
63799,Marge,although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
54906,Marge,"well, look at the time. almost midnight."
56843,Marge,"everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law. dog, no leash. man littering. horse not wearing diaper. car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
65788,Marge,"kids, your father and i have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians."
64991,Marge,at some point i think we should see a doctor.
62491,Marge,a bicycle built for two! and i could be one of those two!
60807,Marge,all of you stink so much.
65687,Marge,"c'mere, little buddy."
63381,Marge,"no, no, i didn't mean--"
66454,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, wait! i wanna say something!"
56113,Marge,"apu, you've been so helpful. if it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the monstromart."
67528,Marge,"no, maggie! bad baby!"
55572,Marge,"well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
63194,Marge,"ooo, now that's smooth."
56660,Marge,this is a special occasion. patty and selma just got promoted at the dmv.
65109,Marge,"don't do that, homie. it rubs off your side hair."
61787,Marge,"homie, when i married you, i knew we wouldn't live in luxury."
64721,Marge,"ooo, so many celebrities have their own label: princess penelope, booberella, the real housewives of ogdenville, even scratchy."
63714,Marge,"your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying. so i hired this nutritionist, betsy bidwell."
57950,Marge,"let's come to our senses, everyone. this witch hunt is turning into a circus."
55931,Marge,well why can't i be greedy once in awhile?
64578,Marge,"but you still have our passports, right?"
64663,Marge,i can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all.
55560,Marge,yeah...
55772,Marge,no.
60173,Marge,uh-oh.
61473,Marge,we finally have something to put in the wall safe.
58555,Marge,"actually, it took fifty-three hours."
55497,Marge,i think you're making him angry.
55518,Marge,"homer, we have a problem here."
61829,Marge,that's an entry?! i thought it was garbage.
60099,Marge,"bravo, pierce!"
62039,Marge,fresh fr-fr-fresh for mommy's baby boy
65208,Marge,uhh... yes! yes! east oak street. that's where you should go. see ya there!
66791,Marge,my husband can't really think he's ten.
59112,Marge,ew!
54630,Marge,it's true! and we'll all live in cities on the moon.
61227,Marge,it's too nice a day to be outside doing chores. come in and watch tv.
61818,Marge,stop! you're tainting my entry!
60047,Marge,"ned, i'm worried about you. you've been working non-stop for the past week."
66234,Marge,"well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!"
60127,Marge,i'm sleeping in the bathtub.
59764,Marge,"finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder."
59793,Marge,"how's your back, homie?"
67844,Marge,hello.
61234,Marge,"oh, relax. i'm sure it's just your brain going crazy."
61487,Marge,"oh no no, she says lots of words. like when she wants something, she says"
58305,Marge,"hello, ralph. when i was little, i used to play by myself, too."
67006,Marge,"...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents."
59262,Marge,"knock, knock!"
55722,Marge,"wait a minute. that was ""prince of tides."""
64016,Marge,you probably would.
59692,Marge,when you get a penny from a chum / don't just buy some bubble gum! put it in your cap! put it in your cap! when you find a nickel in the snow / don't just blow it on a picture show put it in your cap / put it in your cap...
55542,Marge,"homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
66507,Marge,"here you go. put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher."
60497,Marge,"well, it's easier to chew than that bambi video."
59390,Marge,"homer, give him the fifty cents."
63937,Marge,really? me? you did?
67903,Marge,well... i'll tell you what. why don't we invite mr. bergstrom to dinner?
60464,Marge,"homer, your father's dead!"
65044,Marge,"""broken-leg beauty,"" ""sorry, silver,"" ""no more mint juleps..."" and the fourth one has a title so sad i can't even say it."
60175,Marge,"burly?! i bought the wrong brand, maggie!"
62740,Marge,"well, that's very impressive. does that include the people and the furniture?"
60669,Marge,"well then, who shot all the gangsters?"
61400,Marge,hmm... what should i write about?
67797,Marge,i really hope we're not spoiling them.
63503,Marge,"well, maybe i wanted another freezer!"
58438,Marge,very close...
63201,Marge,"ooh, the count of monte cristo! can we go? we haven't been to any parties since that soirée at the bastille."
66813,Marge,"car, wake grampa."
58529,Marge,that's your underwear.
64091,Marge,a mother knows!
63133,Marge,i will.
59707,Marge,"well, we couldn't be prouder."
67271,Marge,"dear bart, how is france? i don't know why you haven't written. i guess you're just having too much fun."
60795,Marge,squiggy?
62428,Marge,"i hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but maggie is terribly itchy."
56236,Marge,that's because you were drunk!
60837,Marge,today's tuesday and you've had six beers.
67730,Marge,"yeah, right."
54768,Marge,all this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
60177,Marge,look at those massive plaid shoulders.
67262,Marge,"well, now that that's settled, i'll just clear the dishes."
64222,Marge,homie?
62680,Marge,how can you take it? we haven't found it.
54861,Marge,"bart, how many hours a day do you watch tv?"
57539,Marge,you're not listening. you're only hearing what you want to hear.
59005,Marge,yep.
60397,Marge,pretty much. yeah.
64836,Marge,"bart, who are you talking to?"
67587,Marge,i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
64512,Marge,i made it into a sampler!
67576,Marge,ohhh.
63939,Marge,i'm just happy you're talking again. you didn't say a word for forty-five minutes.
67784,Marge,bart!
62504,Marge,"i'm a little worried. this part of the county is unincorporated. just to be safe i'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone."
65467,Marge,whoa. /
59360,Marge,where are we?
63036,Marge,darn these counter-sunk molly clamps!
59223,Marge,"well, i'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see bart eating his vegetables."
61893,Marge,what's that rumble?
67351,Marge,"hitler, north dakota?"
62795,Marge,do you have your shipboard entertainments?
66797,Marge,"fine, you can go to school!"
55137,Marge,"there you go, lisa. no pimentos. bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. homer, i'll sew your pants but i'm out of bologna."
63063,Marge,"hello, helen? i'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. well, i have a little plan to fix their wagon."
55588,Marge,that's sweet.
63600,Marge,no.
58581,Marge,"it's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure."
61140,Marge,"i am so sorry, homie. how is your crushed pelvis?"
64004,Marge,"who is this ""mom"" of which you speak?"
58733,Marge,"oooh, how about paint-by-numbers?"
65018,Marge,"it's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance..."
56963,Marge,you don't win friends with sal-ad / you don't win friends with sal-ad...
61892,Marge,"homer, that was for the dog."
60515,Marge,you made that call? but you're the good one.
64798,Marge,this was my bedroom! my bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!
57750,Marge,"lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
64509,Marge,"read a little more, honey."
62026,Marge,"well, i don't like this movie. and i'm going to boycott your financier... mr. burns."
55198,Marge,"that's disgusting. and besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
59245,Marge,well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
61563,Marge,"well, i don't want to be a ""gloom-hilda."" i guess one beer won't hurt."
67128,Marge,"but this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special."
62829,Marge,since then i haven't been able to do any of the calculus i've encountered in my daily life. but that's not going to happen to you.
64653,Marge,"credenza, credenza, lowboy, sideboard, portmanteau..."
61291,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about this. let's check the suit closet.
55021,Marge,it's homer!
57678,Marge,"i don't, but i loved hearing it!"
58530,Marge,he's up in his room. bart?
65565,Marge,this says you are the manager.
65154,Marge,this is the most adorable thing i've ever seen in my entire life!
65480,Marge,"busy day at work? did you get a lot of work done, workerman?"
58115,Marge,"still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck."
63625,Marge,"oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day."
62964,Marge,weren't you just tied up in the blimp?
54940,Marge,that's ridiculous.
67446,Marge,"homie, quit tossing."
67854,Marge,you can put a little something on top for flavor.
55338,Marge,so get that piece of paper!
57816,Marge,hello.
61042,Marge,live from new york it's saturday night!
61127,Marge,"well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so i can reach you."
60545,Marge,"homer, i'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom."
62287,Marge,"homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. and you're reading books! word books! what's going on?"
63458,Marge,we left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
62688,Marge,"oh, that's the new ""femac"" ! the computer designed just for women! the ""you've got mail"" voice is susan sarandon!"
56658,Marge,"no deal! this is my son we're talking about. sure he's not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?"
54985,Marge,homer! i've always said you were a good father. i've always defended you when people put you down.
56321,Marge,hmmm.
60302,Marge,that's lucky.
62140,Marge,homer!
67656,Marge,you looked so peaceful lying there.
66305,Marge,/
56182,Marge,"no. you know, bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
57927,Marge,i cannot believe this. i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
66675,Marge,you ate the food and looked in the mirrors! they're staying.
54912,Marge,"ugghh, homer. where did you get that ugly thing?"
64627,Marge,"i don't know... i'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives, and this room isn't really the best place for maggie to hang out."
55257,Marge,not now.
67331,Marge,"so, i'm worried. i think we should go home."
64309,Marge,"chett, i'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
62896,Marge,mr. simpson?
56535,Marge,"judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
61994,Marge,moe and i are going to the tavern and restaurant owners convention in aruba this weekend. don't you ever listen to me? i told you ten times.
60487,Marge,"oh, i can't stay mad at you."
56860,Marge,that the pants would rip?...
59953,Marge,she got it open.
56592,Marge,homer! tell the story right.
60170,Marge,"well, don't look too hip. you don't want that girl falling for you."
64718,Marge,dammit.
61967,Marge,m631700000642j?! this is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
67611,Marge,"that's right, he did. excuse me, but dr. hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought bart was fine."
56641,Marge,"no, no, no, no! i'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with australia! you'll just have to find some other country to have relations with."
54735,Marge,"hmmm. thank you. i will, dr. hibbert. thanks for coming."
61791,Marge,don't demolish along the way!
64938,Marge,there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad. whoa!
64178,Marge,almost there...
65285,Marge,this is the last airline that would take us.
56959,Marge,"well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
55566,Marge,mr. burns!
57184,Marge,a dollar. let's go.
61199,Marge,"hmp, i finally caught up with grampa. i found him crying in the cemetery. thanks for taking care of maggie."
65733,Marge,i'm afraid not.
62163,Marge,"hey, it's only money. and it did make a cool splash."
60433,Marge,"mmmm. all this food is so frou-frou! ooo, faberge egg salad."
60751,Marge,oh i'll come back all right. and i'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you.
64525,Marge,"ooo, a hundred and three! no school today."
56206,Marge,give me those...
59377,Marge,"homer, did you jimmy open mr. burns' liquor cabinet?"
57962,Marge,i just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the flanders'.
56536,Marge,"no, no honey, it's all right. really. i'm fine. i'm all right. mother always said ""don't complain. be good. behave, behave. be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
62318,Marge,think of the leg up you'd have!
55453,Marge,your father is... resting.
64724,Marge,"i'd like this bag, please!"
66648,Marge,go on. please.
56240,Marge,that's nice.
61154,Marge,wha...?!
63123,Marge,"lisa's sleeping over at janey's. apparently, her mom makes good mac and cheese."
64017,Marge,just go!
59924,Marge,they wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
61444,Marge,i know a little something about history. gather 'round.
56619,Marge,"homie, i think someone is saying hello."
56696,Marge,"homer, the guest should get the last pork chop."
57889,Marge,"good morning, agnes. how's your new son working out?"
62304,Marge,what language is this? gibby-gabby?
64256,Marge,screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
63754,Marge,and i realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.
57505,Marge,"ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
61279,Marge,englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
60203,Marge,how do we un-repress it?
60628,Marge,"chief wiggum, homer and i are innocent."
57770,Marge,well... okay. i will volunteer!
67612,Marge,"well, maybe lisa does have a point. i don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't bart have to tell the truth?"
65575,Marge,"all right, i remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. i mean, i don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. with this car, we're basically saying no more babies!"
64198,Marge,it's like drinking e. e. cummings!
61000,Marge,nutty fudgkins!
55334,Marge,"otto, you can't just sit there watching tv all day."
58605,Marge,it won't go any --
66697,Marge,"it is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
65448,Marge,homer!
57095,Marge,i didn't think you'd mind. i figured you were getting a little too old for this. but you can still make one. there's some snow left under the car.
60738,Marge,sometimes i worry you might think about other women.
55335,Marge,no.
57093,Marge,here's your hot chocolate.
61423,Marge,"homie, i finished my novel."
67188,Marge,"goodbye, bart. my special little guy."
61697,Marge,"now, on a different subject, kiss me hard."
64182,Marge,it is a sauna in here. must've been put in by a previous owner. this house is full of surprises. but this is the first good one.
63510,Marge,"maggie, what can i get you for breakfas-- oh. you did everything yourself."
63347,Marge,i wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
58453,Marge,"oh, this is so naughty. coming back to our old love nest..."
62811,Marge,an albatross! it can lead us to safety.
60620,Marge,fine. i'll go talk to her.
62261,Marge,"this fat camp can save bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. homer, maybe you could ask mr. burns for a raise."
67308,Marge,not to worry.
58673,Marge,"well, doctor hibbert said you have to build up your strength."
67418,Marge,"i'm sorry, dear. it will all be over soon."
60877,Marge,two...
61707,Marge,"yes... and then your father broke my heart. and if i'd known he was you, i never would have married you!"
64555,Marge,"""mom and dad, bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary!"""
67615,Marge,i don't know. maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
67609,Marge,oh!
58573,Marge,"well, we're leaving. and remember, no itchy and scratchy. i better take these batteries just to be sure."
66732,Marge,you don't know what a per diem is.
67442,Marge,i don't know.
56609,Marge,and then when i told him about lisa...
65256,Marge,"oh ralph, fred, archie, king of queens, i mean homer."
54846,Marge,"i don't know, i thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
58572,Marge,"oh, homer, you're not going as a hobo again?"
57651,Marge,so?
65100,Marge,i hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
56587,Marge,"homer, you promised. one night of family time a week. besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
59247,Marge,"these swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. i mean, a green table! i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams."
55189,Marge,uh... that's okay.
60767,Marge,"don't make a fuss over me, boys. just pour me a beer in a clean glass."
59400,Marge,hmm. should the simpsons get a horse?
58895,Marge,show biz is so fascinating.
67062,Marge,"i'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game."
55435,Marge,why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
64390,Marge,you two are going out? i thought i told you the flanderses were coming over to dinner.
63866,Marge,bart simpson's stolen cell phone -- can i help you?
58213,Marge,"homer, no!"
59905,Marge,why do you want bart? he's not much of a singer.
61181,Marge,"oh for god's sake, i can see why he left. now all of you, get cleaning."
65550,Marge,i was supposed to be with all of you.
67741,Marge,"so, what did you children learn about today?"
62950,Marge,"o-kay... tonight we're gonna discuss little ways to keep your romance alive. make time for each other -- an hour, an evening, a mini-vacation..."
60473,Marge,he used to be such an angel. maybe you should give him another chance.
59970,Marge,most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well.
61445,Marge,"henry the eighth had everything he could want, except a son to follow in his footsteps..."
57035,Marge,wait!! wait! my children are in there!
60533,Marge,i'll just get her this bracelet.
66901,Marge,but we don't need to come back. we saved the church.
66354,Marge,i don't have any diamonds.
65051,Marge,oh screw it.
60079,Marge,no.
56479,Marge,oooh... how'd they get there?
60925,Marge,what are you doing?
58339,Marge,"oh, let your brother do sports."
55425,Marge,it maght.
67090,Marge,"oh, bart. now where's your father?"
57556,Marge,edna.
56067,Marge,i'll walk.
54903,Marge,yes.
66327,Marge,yoink!
67803,Marge,"ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. i think you have the mumps. i'm calling doctor hibbert."
65549,Marge,"i'll tell you what i'm doing, i'm realizing that i married the wrong man. oh, you poor, sweet, simple homers."
63593,Marge,i told you not to mock me at picnics.
63386,Marge,he needs something with your father's scent.
61405,Marge,"""...mayor quimby, disco stu, and our fighting men and women overseas."" well, i finished the ""thank yous,"" time to go back to the novel."
67226,Marge,what is the meaning of this?
62775,Marge,homer do great!
67105,Marge,"um mmm. i know what those movies are like. killing innocent people, eating human flesh. you just get a lot of bad ideas."
55035,Marge,so you've ruined your life.
66048,Marge,"well, thanks for watching maggie. i just ordered homer's anniversary gift."
66016,Marge,"listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you."
57760,Marge,"lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
54806,Marge,"you're still angry, homer. why don't you sleep on it?"
64853,Marge,how can you say a thing like that?
57382,Marge,i just don't think it's a good idea.
57882,Marge,let's bake him a cake.
64008,Marge,i'm bart simpson's mother. you think you've got any tricks i haven't seen?
66373,Marge,maybe!
58628,Marge,"no, no one's ""going catholic."" three children is enough, thank you."
56877,Marge,isn't there anything we can do?
65637,Marge,lisa... would you like some shrimp?
66594,Marge,the wi-fi! the wi-fi! i've got to take out the wi-fi!
64088,Marge,keep going and i'll scat.
54610,Marge,well here's a question for you: why should i stay with a man who resents how i've flowered?
61565,Marge,have you ever walked on stilts? it's not that great.
67874,Marge,i don't think that will be a problem.
62186,Marge,"oh, homie..."
65859,Marge,your behavior at that game was unacceptable! you're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
56211,Marge,everybody get ready! here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
59597,Marge,"shut up, becky! there. i finally said it."
64296,Marge,"otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?"
67629,Marge,"well, we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
57133,Marge,"homie. as long as you keep the car full of gas, i'm happy."
64374,Marge,how 'bout a little marge madness?
59073,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open."
59724,Marge,"well, i sure don't feel like cooking."
62572,Marge,how cute. he tried to stay up but he just couldn't make it.
63015,Marge,don't you have any follow-through on anything?
66758,Marge,"well, with all that you folks have experienced, i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom."
61548,Marge,"stop it, seinfeld."
56249,Marge,i want this to end now!
54930,Marge,no.
59458,Marge,here she is. and look how big she's gotten.
65057,Marge,"hm, there must be some mistake."
67016,Marge,arrrgh!
64904,Marge,maybe we could get back together...
66578,Marge,maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
59452,Marge,"homer, you know i had a gambling problem."
54962,Marge,"lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
61897,Marge,"chloe, hi!"
60045,Marge,"are you okay, ned?"
57418,Marge,no. it's a house of ill fame... a house of loose ethics...
57078,Marge,"sure. we're gonna have a great day. ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right bart? bart?"
67088,Marge,"kids, we're late for church. get your butts down here right now."
61486,Marge,maggie doesn't talk yet.
64216,Marge,"ooh, i'm doing it!"
65064,Marge,i don't think this is a good idea at all. the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu. he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
59662,Marge,"geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
60278,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
60199,Marge,we'd better get him home.
57041,Marge,"goodnight, lisa."
60292,Marge,i never agreed to that rule!
66332,Marge,"ooo... so many choices, maggie."
58321,Marge,"oh, see, i knew you'd find something you liked about him."
56779,Marge,ok. who was george washington carver?
61086,Marge,i still think you should have left that at the motel.
60873,Marge,i do!
59974,Marge,who's muntu?
61968,Marge,you gave the money to moe? how's he gonna pay us back?
61557,Marge,"the best part is, i don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because i was there!"
62013,Marge,you'd better stop
63948,Marge,homie?
63432,Marge,what'd i miss?
56922,Marge,what are you doing with my children?!
61986,Marge,"moe? what's up, partner?"
56451,Marge,cheer up. so you're not good at sports. it's a very small part of life.
65196,Marge,why?
58266,Marge,oh good lord.
55331,Marge,that's not my voice!
60855,Marge,"bart, don't say it like that. you'll hurt her feelings-- jeez louise! how did you turn cinnamon applesauce into that?"
58759,Marge,"but i fell in love with homer simpson. i don't want to snuggle with ""max power."""
60359,Marge,"well, so much for new homer."
58768,Marge,"and there's ed begley, jr."
59143,Marge,bart? honey?
66439,Marge,we don't even get this many christmas cards.
64328,Marge,"really? oh, thank you."
62341,Marge,"well, i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too. how do you like those croutons?"
67697,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but i really don't have the time."
64678,Marge,humbler!
64720,Marge,"hm, i think i'll look for a new handbag..."
59312,Marge,"no, they're not. they're terrible, terrible ideas."
59890,Marge,did you make that awful effigy?
59556,Marge,"ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this saturday... to join otto and becky at... 742 evergreen terrace? that's our address!"
57165,Marge,queen of hearts. i believe all the rest are ours.
67433,Marge,"let's do it, homer!"
57241,Marge,selma... about you and troy. we're not sure he's... all he seems.
66805,Marge,"homie, i've missed you!"
59784,Marge,"sorry, homie, but you promised to take me to the apron expo today."
58616,Marge,"homer, excuse yourself."
55326,Marge,i meant a real guitar.
64221,Marge,i love tapas! it's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
62607,Marge,"oh, homie, isn't venice romantic? this gondola ride was a wonderful idea."
67443,Marge,would you like some fruit juice?
67333,Marge,i can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
63232,Marge,we let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
56453,Marge,"well, i think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. look at milhouse's teeth."
64113,Marge,like it was yesterday...
66778,Marge,homer!
58912,Marge,"beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
61815,Marge,"well... stuart, i'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog, but it isn't."
55417,Marge,it'll just take a sec.
67795,Marge,i hope we're not spoiling them.
63535,Marge,"goodbye, my love!"
60227,Marge,isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
64826,Marge,"lisa, honey, i insist. because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me."
67763,Marge,well if you have other plans...
63226,Marge,homer is so amazing! he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
63108,Marge,now i know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
56286,Marge,"uh... i meant, my number one girl."
58390,Marge,"oh, homie! you're alive!"
55112,Marge,"oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
57150,Marge,i did marry homer.
64434,Marge,maybe you're not really mad at grampa. maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
56562,Marge,daddy?
57554,Marge,"oh, i don't want to own my own business. i don't know why i came here in the first place."
60182,Marge,spill it...
64430,Marge,that's us!
66360,Marge,i don't know bart. this is one of those... arkham asylum-type hospitals.
64171,Marge,"homer simpson, you are a strong finisher."
63702,Marge,romeo and juliet? arthur and guinevere? brangelina?
65885,Marge,it's not a skirt. it's a kilt!
58018,Marge,poor barney.
56499,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
64643,Marge,this is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. you'll have a good time. i invited a friend for you.
67153,Marge,never.
67341,Marge,"yes, dear?"
61452,Marge,"come spring, they sought help from the native americans."
55584,Marge,that medicine's not for you.
55058,Marge,"""fourth notice""... ""90 days overdue""... ""we break thumbs""... homer, what are we going to do?"
64474,Marge,thank you.
59185,Marge,and eleven with robert urich.
58533,Marge,"nelson?! i explicitly forbade bart from playing with that little monster. ooo, bart is in deep, deep trouble."
66344,Marge,"oh i forgot to tell you, homie! i bumped into helen lovejoy today, and guess what?"
60259,Marge,yes! merry christmas to us all.
56685,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, and i have an idea."
64594,Marge,play with lisa.
66506,Marge,oh it's amazing how many cheerios maggie drops in the back seat.
55321,Marge,"hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
58415,Marge,"well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic."
66555,Marge,you're not mad anymore?
65946,Marge,"homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married."
66225,Marge,you know what? i think it's fine if homer spends a few hours now and then with... homer junior.
59711,Marge,really? like what?
66672,Marge,i also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
56575,Marge,everyone likes you. you're a wonderful person.
58995,Marge,"and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. by the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. they call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
65452,Marge,we sold it to pay for a family cruise!
55478,Marge,he sold his ride on the duff blimp.
61375,Marge,"they say ""yes no two forty-two"". and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out!"
59610,Marge,why you little...!
59328,Marge,i think that's an arm rest.
58093,Marge,"ooo, i remember. mrs. astor was very lucky."
61095,Marge,"lisa, you don't know what you'll want in the future. i didn't marry the first boy i... well, i did. but you shouldn't!"
59838,Marge,not until you finish your sundae.
64028,Marge,oh my god. he's talking to me.
66475,Marge,homie! you look like an n.b.a. coach!
56450,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning. i really hope you try harder."
58097,Marge,"the first house i have to show you is, uhm, a handyman's dream."
63759,Marge,are you calling me fat?
62270,Marge,"lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!"
56761,Marge,"homer! for the love of god, no."
63496,Marge,"all right, i'll make you another bottle."
67156,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
64096,Marge,maybe i'm just being selfish. i don't know.
62605,Marge,"we're in a foreign city, with no car, being stalked by a killer. i feel like i'm the bourne identity!"
59296,Marge,and the first step is an eye-catching resumé.
58691,Marge,nah!
61878,Marge,i didn't give your son charity. i gave him self-respect.
65743,Marge,"""in this exciting strategy game, you amass resources -- timber, salt fish, and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice."
67259,Marge,the life jacket is under the seat.
60766,Marge,maybe i'll just keep these.
65408,Marge,sounds like a plan!
65029,Marge,you can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
64765,Marge,poor man. you've been through so much.
55725,Marge,homer!
59587,Marge,it is?
66513,Marge,marge simpson. congratulations on little king george.
56185,Marge,"homer, say something."
54595,Marge,"i'm sorry, i'm not ready to do that yet. i want to wait until i'm married, or at least really drunk."
64924,Marge,"i love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, i need something for myself!"
56553,Marge,"no, i didn't."
63106,Marge,"no, homer. it's you. my sweet, perfectly imperfect you."
63518,Marge,i'm starting to worry about your father.
66750,Marge,you can't smoke!
67524,Marge,"oh now, homer, they're nothing special. the extra ingredient is care."
65434,Marge,i don't think so.
59959,Marge,how are you supposed to dial?
65944,Marge,homer! you're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!
64278,Marge,bad baby!
58044,Marge,"hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
61183,Marge,then i guess this means war.
67780,Marge,"homer, my sister is not going out with barney gumbel."
64387,Marge,i can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
56456,Marge,"absolutely, honey. by blocking the net i really think you helped your team."
62908,Marge,"oh, i always liked that guy!"
56457,Marge,"bart, i can spend some time with you."
64403,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, kids. we lost the batteries for that."
63779,Marge,"yes! it's time for you to take control of your own destiny. you're not a doormat, you're a door prize!"
66890,Marge,this is all my fault.
66238,Marge,"they are, huh?"
67410,Marge,what!
56472,Marge,i've never been so proud of them.
55129,Marge,"well, i just don't know."
58536,Marge,not you. bart.
66754,Marge,i've gotta call homer.
62807,Marge,perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
58714,Marge,"homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?"
62006,Marge,"moe, i need to tell you something."
62056,Marge,but veronica's a girl's name. did you know that?
67474,Marge,"no, no, no, the other shelf."
57969,Marge,"homer, i don't want guns in my house! don't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns?"
59003,Marge,"well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love. you truly are an artist."
57827,Marge,ghost? what ghost?
63530,Marge,deal.
60138,Marge,but first we gotta break out of these stocks.
56728,Marge,here.
58113,Marge,"i'm glad you're not mad, but i lied to you! and i won't feel right until i return your deposit."
58708,Marge,"that's right. like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. to the bitter end."
57623,Marge,"well, i'd like to hear your suggestions."
59421,Marge,"now if there's anything, anything at all i can do to help out..."
56649,Marge,c... o...
56417,Marge,we're just gonna have to wait and see.
65768,Marge,i think i hear a slight accent.
66600,Marge,"i'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches."
61638,Marge,it's got wright-patterson airforce base and a zipper museum! they have a zipper from every james bond!
64832,Marge,stop burning!
57344,Marge,"even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
58388,Marge,"don't worry, kids. your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those sherpas."
63295,Marge,earthland realms?
57363,Marge,but you'll get killed!
65966,Marge,"moe, i know things haven't been easy for you. but you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities."
59942,Marge,not on my watch!
59402,Marge,"at least you don't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair. well, except the mop."
67908,Marge,no.
55501,Marge,"don't worry, homie. i'll take care of you."
59560,Marge,"oh, becky, you look beautiful. i thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. it's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. all ""don'ts."""
60626,Marge,she's got a set of lungs on her.
63792,Marge,trust me.
59653,Marge,"what?! oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"
58974,Marge,and you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
65164,Marge,what if... we roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
64616,Marge,"homie, can i talk to you for a second?"
67465,Marge,homer?!
62272,Marge,"sweetie, tonight you were perfect..."
56523,Marge,i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth yet.
62616,Marge,"i've never noticed that sign before, and i'm a very good noticer."
64143,Marge,and... release the groom.
60864,Marge,"okay marge, you can do this. you've done it a thousand times before."
63972,Marge,it might be a fun way to kill a couple hours.
58833,Marge,"i don't know... i, i hate to change lanes once i get going... that's really for race car drivers."
65403,Marge,"that's jennifer aniston's hair on ""friends."""
60671,Marge,"yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot mr. burns."
57018,Marge,i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. you could get hurt again.
64299,Marge,uh-huh...
65156,Marge,"aren't you gonna come to bed, homie?"
55681,Marge,"ohhh... kids, you can come in now."
55969,Marge,it's almost nine-thirty!
63482,Marge,"that's a great idea! to celebrate, i'll go whip us up some chex mix pie."
56374,Marge,even worse was our trip to sandy beach.
58443,Marge,big enough for two...
64305,Marge,"we need to take this into the belly of the beast. mr. scalper, give me a ticket."
57900,Marge,michael jackson still was black...
54994,Marge,"i moe, i moe."
63906,Marge,"okay, then videogames."
66702,Marge,i didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.
65319,Marge,it's a beautiful afternoon. no tv.
54971,Marge,i don't know.
59489,Marge,aww. he can crawl up through my toilet any day.
58315,Marge,"oh, you mean like the ""a"" students?"
66047,Marge,"okay, i've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!"
63559,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
63863,Marge,whose phone is this?
62790,Marge,you're just a sweet guy from springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
65358,Marge,"please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. we just wanna live out our lives in peace."
59605,Marge,i'm not insane!
65869,Marge,i never made that noise in my life!
56749,Marge,"oh, homie, aren't they adorable?"
62219,Marge,it's after six -- he's not coming back. he's a lousy roofer and a flake!
65338,Marge,"usually when i say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. i'm gonna say goodnight before it does."
63758,Marge,get in!
66740,Marge,bart! hold the ladder still!
65226,Marge,"welcome home, handsome!"
57290,Marge,"good. i'm glad. and that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
58086,Marge,"oh. well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?"
64935,Marge,"moe, do these guys think you're one of them?"
55061,Marge,homer ?!
66407,Marge,our boat painting!
65905,Marge,i'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
55601,Marge,are you sure...?
63499,Marge,"if you're so smart, you do it!"
61745,Marge,"homeland noodles with uncle sam balls? apu, aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism?"
65062,Marge,we're throwing the brunch!
58535,Marge,"young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
65650,Marge,homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
62907,Marge,"wow, she still works here?"
64524,Marge,"i'm french, not you."
55648,Marge,"bart, get out!"
55476,Marge,you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
65067,Marge,"these people are always grinding against each other, and i think they're all related. i wish we'd never come."
66496,Marge,"after thirty-five years of wifely obedience, i'm married to a face on a screen."
67506,Marge,"well, lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. we could go to both."
63318,Marge,"don't worry, honey. i'll hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one."
64444,Marge,let's call the whole thing off...icially onnnnn!
63396,Marge,i promised them a cake!
66121,Marge,hello! where's homer?
66894,Marge,"god's plan?! god isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! god isn't sky police. god didn't do this. i lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! we did this."
67086,Marge,"cheer up, homer. at least they let you go."
55600,Marge,"homer, bart's at a very curious age. as his father, i think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
66749,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm tired of being a pushover."
58180,Marge,get to work!
55524,Marge,now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about. our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
60716,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie. it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock."
67678,Marge,"lisa, i'd rather tell you a different story. how your father and i first met and fell in love."
59677,Marge,"well, like all americans, fast."
61997,Marge,"moe, did you see something troubling on the tarmac?"
57013,Marge,"uh, excuse me, sir, i think there's been a mistake."
59901,Marge,"after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner."
55400,Marge,"hi, ned. i didn't know you were an actor."
66971,Marge,what?
60923,Marge,mm-hmm.
66730,Marge,i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.
56958,Marge,see? it was a good idea to come here after all.
65015,Marge,what are you talking about?
64614,Marge,"homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
67174,Marge,it's a very challenging hobby.
55539,Marge,"homer, we'd like to talk to you."
63114,Marge,now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.
56857,Marge,freeze!
59492,Marge,take 'em off the glass! take 'em off the glass!
54730,Marge,do we have enough glasses?
64271,Marge,maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. and i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm her mother.
66424,Marge,but the van houtens are our friends!
64922,Marge,"yes, you may."
59513,Marge,we'd be much better rock breakers if we weren't all chained together.
62948,Marge,maybe we should stop here.
57132,Marge,you didn't vote for anybody.
58128,Marge,bart's absolutely right. this is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
66467,Marge,"right, right, right, right. according to judy kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
66560,Marge,lisa! bath time!
57930,Marge,"please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help lisa."
67366,Marge,what's wrong?
61524,Marge,no you didn't.
66256,Marge,"first in freeways... ""the 'yuh-huh' state""... ""jewel of the fracking belt""... ""still a british colony at heart""... ""land of many water snakes""..."
56540,Marge,but i...
59204,Marge,looks like you were saved by a christmas tree.
65551,Marge,"even you, caveman homer."
60106,Marge,"mmm... good morning, pierce. where's homer?"
58604,Marge,how's he doing?
61920,Marge,"yeah, i guess."
55717,Marge,the funeral's in little neck falls. looks like we'll have to go to duff gardens another time.
59825,Marge,"oh, my goodness!"
55351,Marge,how cute.
58878,Marge,"thanks for asking. well, i was watching dateline and stone philips said s.u.v.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat."
60234,Marge,"oh honey, i'm worried about your soul. i want at least one person from this family to go to heaven."
66896,Marge,"i don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
66704,Marge,"well, if he's gonna get a haircut, bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it."
64810,Marge,stupid pan.
65521,Marge,homer!
62433,Marge,"oh, sugar-booger!"
56099,Marge,well...
62595,Marge,"bart, bob is a family man now. you can't be a bad person if you have a family."
58279,Marge,"homer, did you really steal a car?"
63105,Marge,"homer, you wanted a sign that i still love you, so here it is."
56329,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
64964,Marge,p?! the a.a.r.p.?! well that tears it. i don't want this milk and i'm not gonna take it back.
57692,Marge,"bart, no!"
60195,Marge,barney? w-w-where's chad--
64518,Marge,"""pork butt in cream,"" ""snout-fried neck,"" ""frog haunch,"" ""hooves au jus,"" ""possum pouch pie..."""
62488,Marge,"homie, no! it's not street legal!"
56886,Marge,he's causing us all to yell!
60673,Marge,"maude flanders, we the living beseech you to appear."
55364,Marge,i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel.
55126,Marge,homer!
56891,Marge,i guess it's never the most likely suspect.
62940,Marge,"homie, i don't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others."
56937,Marge,"well, look at the other side."
61005,Marge,we've already been to room 915. we've already filled out form 1790.
67745,Marge,what? whadda ya mean?
64934,Marge,"what do you mean, wig?"
63011,Marge,someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy.
62109,Marge,homie!
67912,Marge,"yo! i'm the coolest puppet in sockville, and i love strained spinach!"
61501,Marge,you were purposely teaching her the wrong word!
56996,Marge,"homer, we need to have a serious talk."
61664,Marge,"oh, you know, typical boring dayton weather!"
66548,Marge,i wouldn't say i paid someone to be your friend. i just gave her money for records and ice cream.
66276,Marge,my uncle died in your bed. merry christmas.
59588,Marge,be right back.
67599,Marge,"um, i don't know. i guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't."
65227,Marge,to the victor go the spoils.
63502,Marge,"okay, i'll sign up."
66953,Marge,"bart, this is a big day for you. why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?"
57956,Marge,and this is for pushing me off the cliff.
66147,Marge,"never give up hope, my friends."
65383,Marge,"wait, wait, wait. he's just a boy! do you have to put him in jail?"
66944,Marge,"all right... hmmm... how about ""he""?"
63156,Marge,gil?!
59101,Marge,it's not boring. he's passionate about government.
66852,Marge,yes.
58796,Marge,"oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! if anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home!"
56524,Marge,"i don't know, homer. we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season."
57804,Marge,donny's discount gas!
63348,Marge,you really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
59460,Marge,oh!
66349,Marge,it got sold.
57413,Marge,get out of my town!
63304,Marge,hm... needs more goat soul.
64412,Marge,oh what a lovely evening.
67822,Marge,i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
59471,Marge,gimme that!
58758,Marge,and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
66141,Marge,"just rest on the sofa, i'll be home by ten."
58956,Marge,but he said it was forbidden.
64371,Marge,and every month is me! i don't remember doing this! i certainly don't remember doing august!
62884,Marge,a mixer? i don't know -- i am still technically married...
67537,Marge,this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?
67717,Marge,"no, artie, artie. the best argument is that i've known and respected you for eight years, and i would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
61721,Marge,"homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant."
59632,Marge,"you don't have the guts, little man!"
63173,Marge,"it's the famous barnacle bay fog! there's even a poem about it! ""oh cotton candy in gossamer light / thy soft gray kiss upon my cheek"" it smells like heinie!"
67602,Marge,"really, why?"
57847,Marge,no! no drugs. bart just needs a little discipline.
57280,Marge,"well, good. try to include bart and lisa."
64777,Marge,dear god. we just killed a man.
59736,Marge,"oh, please. i didn't say that for clapping."
64655,Marge,water feature...
59552,Marge,sure. it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
59786,Marge,"they're unveiling a combination apron/smock. it's called a ""smapron."""
60656,Marge,"if you like protecting people, you could make that your job. you know, start a security company."
64139,Marge,a pimple! not on my day you don't!
59557,Marge,"you should have asked first, bart. weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars."
57430,Marge,"so, twiggy, i hear you and your husband woody just had a baby. what did you name him?"
61092,Marge,"shucks, lisa. you sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
66824,Marge,that's not a healthy way to lose weight.
57318,Marge,"no! now park your keister, meester!"
59944,Marge,"i'm not racing! it's me, marge simpson!"
60629,Marge,no!
64701,Marge,maybe we're not going home right away.
64704,Marge,did you really think i'd forget? now have a great time!
64995,Marge,see?
55563,Marge,i'll just be a minute. i have to finish this paperwork.
57888,Marge,i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day. i'd rather have candy.
58666,Marge,that's a keeper!
59575,Marge,stop kicking my baby!
62658,Marge,that was your last pair! how did it happen?
55844,Marge,bart. get dressed for school. i expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.
59342,Marge,"leg? oh, oh, that. it's pretty great. how are things at home?"
55107,Marge,"i was thinking that while your father and lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
64213,Marge,you just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. you can come home when the heat's off.
60615,Marge,in the tree.
61859,Marge,they grow up so fast.
58053,Marge,we have to make the most of the time we have.
64001,Marge,"now remember, juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior."
56827,Marge,"look, why don't you two settle down. i'm sure you can get another pillow."
61433,Marge,dr. marvin monroe?! i haven't seen you in years.
63998,Marge,woo-hoo!
55651,Marge,"according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her."
66738,Marge,"stop feeling sorry for yourself. your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent."
62764,Marge,"there, there. god, i miss homer."
67182,Marge,i don't think so.
59436,Marge,"oh, yes. the whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. ned flanders is green with envy."
61281,Marge,"""kitchen carnival?"" i love it! thank you, homie."
66950,Marge,"hello again, principal skinner."
64882,Marge,but i was gonna-- oooh!
56436,Marge,"you just answered your own question with that commode mouth. besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
59871,Marge,you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today. i found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
60254,Marge,lisa?
60058,Marge,i contributed by not objecting too much.
62760,Marge,that song was very nice. how'd you think up so many rhyming words?
61588,Marge,"well, that's no promise at all!"
66324,Marge,i heard that!
61814,Marge,"why thank you, billy."
59189,Marge,"oh, all right."
64484,Marge,"so we'd just thrown a biter, and homer said to kick harder off the hack. so i did... and i almost fouled the hog line!"
56581,Marge,"aw, homie. you know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
63749,Marge,of course -- you're lisa. lisa the dancing marge girl.
63089,Marge,"noooo! i mean, yes!"
60129,Marge,don't be mad at homer. i was the one who cut the rope.
56852,Marge,"i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer. but what i did was right. someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
56903,Marge,"here's your toast, maggie. i melba-fied it myself."
62514,Marge,stop the showcase!
65700,Marge,and he didn't pee on the floor!
61220,Marge,"well, i've only read it in books."
57794,Marge,"now, ned, troubled boys need rules and discipline. they crave it! you just lay down the law."
61584,Marge,"well, i love my husband and i'm glad i do. my name is marge s. and i'm a homer-holic!"
56438,Marge,"oh that's sweet, homer. our son is growing up, isn't he?"
62447,Marge,fine... no!
64730,Marge,"don't worry, homer -- i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
59958,Marge,i'm the one who told you that.
67389,Marge,don't talk to her like that.
57308,Marge,"ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. it has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
56265,Marge,"i must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
63886,Marge,are we ever going to find him?
63279,Marge,experts disagree on location of heaven?!
55703,Marge,nothing incriminating.
60401,Marge,what?
62612,Marge,i've still gotta bake my christmas pie!
65495,Marge,this is my third favorite wedding supply store!
63152,Marge,don't you defend him! i want that mooch out of my house right now!
64837,Marge,what's all that noise?
61297,Marge,you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
65896,Marge,"that usually works, but not today."
61676,Marge,"sure, we lied. we lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!"
62345,Marge,my hive! my trademark hive!
62279,Marge,a kids' barbershop? but they don't have my templates.
58677,Marge,"ohh, anything, sweetheart."
57427,Marge,don't make up your mind until you hear both songs! morals and ethics and carnal forbearance...
58035,Marge,i don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
61111,Marge,people do crazy things in ads... like eat at arby's.
67594,Marge,"hmmm, but that's michelangelo's david. it's a masterpiece!"
55481,Marge,i know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
67054,Marge,"lisa, you'll be late for band practice. let's go."
56794,Marge,he looks and acts just like the dealer. i think they're related or at least in cahoots.
67115,Marge,"no, homer. it's mine."
54792,Marge,a mother knows everything about her family.
67940,Marge,"why milhouse, don't you look pretty."
66802,Marge,"before you fix him... can you change one little thing? i'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and i'd rather..."
55226,Marge,"oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. but deep down, you know you love the saxophone. i think you should stay in the band."
55185,Marge,"no, you're not. when my father got out of the navy, he used to curse a blue streak. it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. so, my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen. every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. what do you think?"
67481,Marge,"homer, shouldn't you go pick up grampa?"
57764,Marge,"hey, calm down. you're wrinkling your church clothes!"
66941,Marge,"yes, something to share our love --"
56449,Marge,"uh, i think you all owe my son an apology."
55363,Marge,"homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
63841,Marge,me? a professional baker's employee? imagine how different my life would be!
58961,Marge,"adam, say something."
60812,Marge,that's my homie!
64595,Marge,"you remember dylan. you were in ""toddle tots"" together."
62416,Marge,"frankly, no. lisa kind of took care of herself. our oldest, bart, was such a handful."
66135,Marge,"i know, he's changed."
59616,Marge,"oh, i've got too much to do to take a nap right now. lisa, get maggie out of that cage. and homer, since you're dressed for it, i got some s & m for ya: scrubbing and mopping."
58106,Marge,but it was!
58957,Marge,please stop eating that. god's gonna furious.
61902,Marge,well... oh. we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day. turns out he had an impacted anal gland.
60862,Marge,"look, this really made me feel vulnerable. i want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
67835,Marge,"homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?"
62189,Marge,oooh. smile!
56065,Marge,"now you stay put, young lady."
63453,Marge,there's only one man who could help us now.
63359,Marge,where's your father with those pacifiers?
62395,Marge,instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
63272,Marge,this is a celebrity scandal! we could sell that photo to a tabloid.
57077,Marge,okay.
62020,Marge,bart! how do you know these things?
55821,Marge,"mr. burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
56289,Marge,"believe me, honey. she's more scared of you than you are of her."
67588,Marge,aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
62444,Marge,"oh boy, am i beat! if you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
59042,Marge,"mmm-mm. oh, i can feel the pounds just melting off."
65585,Marge,what do you mean?
57334,Marge,move us?
57617,Marge,pleased to meet you.
61580,Marge,i am so cheesed off. i need a drink!
62509,Marge,no.
66303,Marge,"homie, do you really think you should be--"
56797,Marge,somebody stop him!
63186,Marge,my husband meant no harm. there must be some way he can pay for what he did. he's good at opening jars.
62329,Marge,i guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
60891,Marge,i got all the way out to the tree before i realized i'd left the house.
65028,Marge,what?
55245,Marge,you are not going to perform that operation yourself.
61463,Marge,"bart honey, it's a nice day. why don't you play outside?"
55631,Marge,"guess what, homie... there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now."
54333,Ned Flanders,"no atheist blood, please."
53474,Ned Flanders,it is! it's a bemusement park!
54226,Ned Flanders,"actually, it's kind of cute. you look like posh spice."
53430,Ned Flanders,"oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? i-i'm trying to preserve maude's indentation."
54335,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, now we'll have an open marriage!"
53109,Ned Flanders,"so long, simpsons!"
53222,Ned Flanders,i suppose i do take maude for granted.
54059,Ned Flanders,i noticed.
54147,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
54093,Ned Flanders,"hey, cool your jets! we're trying to get to sleep!"
53322,Ned Flanders,"that's nice of you homer, but i think i'll just go to bed."
52991,Ned Flanders,"aw, what happened now? did the rubble burn down?"
53691,Ned Flanders,"i said ""man,"" not ""man-god."" keep your pants on."
53316,Ned Flanders,no foot-longs!
54526,Ned Flanders,"uh, knock what off, simpson?"
52880,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't know if the allegations are true / but you got us, and baby, we got you."
53792,Ned Flanders,"oh-uh-uh... sorry maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. it's one of my humble figurines."
52717,Ned Flanders,"oh warren, i know your dad is in prison, but don't you fret. a special celebrity dad has been arranged for ya."
53450,Ned Flanders,"well, what the heck. who's ready to build an amusement park?"
53962,Ned Flanders,anger!
52994,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. ooh, looks like a loose nail."
54205,Ned Flanders,knock-a-doodle-you!
54055,Ned Flanders,don't you think i've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
53959,Ned Flanders,"please, lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
54317,Ned Flanders,bedbugs? just why is there a bed in city hall?
53028,Ned Flanders,"oh, i admit it! it's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! i just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
52822,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos."
53666,Ned Flanders,"well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
53457,Ned Flanders,darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
53915,Ned Flanders,"will you shut your yap, ya big monkey-faced gorilla!!!"
54334,Ned Flanders,s'okay... she's my wife.
53906,Ned Flanders,"um, that was god disguised as a stork."
53375,Ned Flanders,did i hear my name? my ears are burnin'.
52791,Ned Flanders,"well, gettin' closer."
53949,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!
53543,Ned Flanders,"oh, those are not the words!"
53653,Ned Flanders,you know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
53650,Ned Flanders,i'm sorry.
54233,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm a truthful kinda guy."
53520,Ned Flanders,"come on, boys."
52676,Ned Flanders,april fool's!
53030,Ned Flanders,"sure, buddy, i'd be happy to..."
53312,Ned Flanders,"hey, need any help, homer?"
54489,Ned Flanders,never claimed to be.
54540,Ned Flanders,"say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?"
54409,Ned Flanders,no -- not surf and murph!
54460,Ned Flanders,"i said a fit, not a fervor!"
52838,Ned Flanders,"que sera, sera / whatever will be, will be / the future's not ours to see..."
54357,Ned Flanders,my moustache / is bristly / my letters / are epistly / and i don't wanna / mislead you / i like to hug and kissly--
53072,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
53338,Ned Flanders,"homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? it just feels way too soon."
52851,Ned Flanders,"all right, i'd like to call this meeting of the pta to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? mrs. krabappel, why don't you begin?"
52861,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i am putting up the halloweenie decorations a little early. criticism accepted."
54570,Ned Flanders,"shhh. it's coming up, son, it's coming up."
53098,Ned Flanders,"hm. wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
52636,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
54413,Ned Flanders,homer. homer! i found the answer!
52692,Ned Flanders,... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should.
53150,Ned Flanders,"hey, here come the simpsons. n-now be careful, homer. there's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
52890,Ned Flanders,"well, guess! book of revelations... fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... who else is it gonna be?!"
53026,Ned Flanders,"and if you really tick me off, i'm gonna run you down with my car!"
52712,Ned Flanders,"oop, sorry, bart, that's a neddy no-no. you're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
52757,Ned Flanders,"ooo, i guess it's time for me to duck again."
52613,Ned Flanders,"ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
53261,Ned Flanders,dang! i should've brought the camera.
54434,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, can i get back my..."
53623,Ned Flanders,ned flanders in tinseltown?
53904,Ned Flanders,my most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
54321,Ned Flanders,"hidilly-ho, dream team!"
54103,Ned Flanders,diddily...
53327,Ned Flanders,"no, homer! i just need to talk."
53307,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm. that's the one! they've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. ooh, cost us a bundle, too. i guess we'll have an ""imagination christmas"" this year."
52741,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighboreenos."
53970,Ned Flanders,"well then, my work is done."
54152,Ned Flanders,"lord, i think i may have finally reached him..."
53892,Ned Flanders,"rod... you can do it, boy! with god on your side, you can't fail!"
53966,Ned Flanders,lust!
53851,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho! there's ""no bot"" like a robot!"
54098,Ned Flanders,you just made my moustache tingle!
53841,Ned Flanders,"back off, you servants of the holy see!"
53558,Ned Flanders,"hate to be a needy neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
52537,Ned Flanders,"why homer, you silly goose! the weed whacker's just for the edges! you're gonna be out here all day!"
52815,Ned Flanders,it's time to put you away.
53881,Ned Flanders,i just can't. they're all i've got since that sad day when maude found eternal happiness.
53654,Ned Flanders,why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
53113,Ned Flanders,"we appreciate the offer, marge, but i think we're going to be very happy here."
52925,Ned Flanders,"howdily-doodily there, president bush--or should i say president neighbor! i'm ned flanders, and this is maude, rod and todd."
54442,Ned Flanders,yes.
52783,Ned Flanders,i think we should leave.
54137,Ned Flanders,"oh reverend, i've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
54039,Ned Flanders,"as the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!"
53769,Ned Flanders,"reverend, thanks for turnin' the church into a he-without-cineplex."
54003,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. and also, thank you for my partner homer, who..."
54045,Ned Flanders,"well, when the sun goes down it means god's gone to china to watch over those good folks. time for some shuteye."
53242,Ned Flanders,"and after i created my fingers to the bone for you i... my unicorn! oh, what have they done to you, gary?"
52731,Ned Flanders,"come back! come back! oh, we're done for! we're done for! we're done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
53206,Ned Flanders,"homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?"
52792,Ned Flanders,"well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! as chairman of the pta, i am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and i think i can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
53670,Ned Flanders,scared of what? all the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? we'll be safe inside our fortress when they come / we'll be safe from creeps and killers when they come / unless they have a blowtorch / or a poison gas injector / then i don't know what'll happen when they come!
53547,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure didn't."
54032,Ned Flanders,"i like you too, but you broke the law. so i've got to bring you in."
53283,Ned Flanders,they can be a handful... of joy.
53467,Ned Flanders,"nope, they're all the same. plain."
54511,Ned Flanders,"simple, simpson. credit."
52574,Ned Flanders,"listen to that singing... those poor fools. homer, i'm ruined."
53829,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's really touching. but my boys and i are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
53226,Ned Flanders,"leapin' lazarus! is this what passes for eternal rest these days? rod, go get daddy his buryin' shovel."
53854,Ned Flanders,i don't want flowers. i am a flower!
53898,Ned Flanders,"hi-dilly ho, simpsons!"
52682,Ned Flanders,uh oh.
54406,Ned Flanders,better not take a full dose.
53036,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can honestly say that was the best episode of impy and chimpy i've ever seen."
53420,Ned Flanders,it says i have cooties.
52701,Ned Flanders,it's some sort of hideous monster.
53404,Ned Flanders,i really hate to be a snitch.
54081,Ned Flanders,"uh, say, ""jesus,"" what was the name of the son of zachariah?"
53248,Ned Flanders,"maude, it's a miracle! the lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"

53813,Ned Flanders,"homer, is this true?"
52737,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! that's a dilly of a pickle. hey, let's conference you with marge, huh?"
53454,Ned Flanders,"if you could do that, i'd make this place a shining beacon for the lord."
54394,Ned Flanders,six miles and i'm all smiles!
53231,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho-ho, please. you're gonna give me a swelled head. i just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
54359,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!

52912,Ned Flanders,"you have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. i'm sorry. i'm just nervous, i didn't mean any disrespect."
53727,Ned Flanders,"don't worry, sweetie. i am not going to kill your father."
54502,Ned Flanders,"just hold your horses, son. hey, hey, simpson."
53806,Ned Flanders,that's odd.
52749,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighbor. wanna go to the game with me? i got two tic..."

54026,Ned Flanders,"i'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me."
54008,Ned Flanders,bible salesman!
53144,Ned Flanders,bingo.
52927,Ned Flanders,thankily-dankily! greatalicious!
53977,Ned Flanders,"they're outlaws?! i've been played like a pair of spoons! well, who am i to judge -- it's the depression, money's tight..."
52535,Ned Flanders,well...
52865,Ned Flanders,it won't start! something's draining the battery?!
53530,Ned Flanders,"well, luckily, i've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
53971,Ned Flanders,"that concludes our halloween show for this year. i just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to hell. and that includes fx, fox sports and our newest devil's portal, the wall street journal! welcome to the club!"
53826,Ned Flanders,homer? what are you doing here?
53609,Ned Flanders,huh.
53241,Ned Flanders,"so! this is how you repay me, adam!"
54459,Ned Flanders,a brief one.
53071,Ned Flanders,"well, that's super-duper, lisa! in fact, we already have four girls on the team."
53791,Ned Flanders,"yeah, so i can't see my own shrinky dink."
54269,Ned Flanders,oh i was just wondering how many boxes of staples i should order for the store. does ten sound like a lot to you? twenty? fifty? what does sound like a lot to you?
53370,Ned Flanders,"well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
52556,Ned Flanders,n-not yet. but one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
53712,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank god. you're finally fighting your demons."
54109,Ned Flanders,what's the next task on the old i-dinnerary?
54577,Ned Flanders,"mmm mm, sounds terriff!"
53620,Ned Flanders,exact-a-tically-tacally!
54515,Ned Flanders,"well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there."

53837,Ned Flanders,it sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. mind if i waggle my finger a little bit?
53500,Ned Flanders,all right officer.
54468,Ned Flanders,not this month! edna signed us up for a tango class. it was the only way i could avert wine tasting.
53347,Ned Flanders,"well, diane, i've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
54214,Ned Flanders,"indeedily-doodily i do, and i love him just as much as you! it's a flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
52932,Ned Flanders,"well, hey, it's homer! good to see ya, neighb--"
54471,Ned Flanders,okay.
54399,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. now, do you mind if i pray at your bedside?"
52730,Ned Flanders,here's our chance! dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
53883,Ned Flanders,"i'm not ned, i'm a friendly dog. oh, i'm not a good liar. i did come here to check on the... where's rod?"
54215,Ned Flanders,"bart, call me walter matthau, 'cause i'm a bad-news bearer. i'm resigning as manager of your little league team."
53801,Ned Flanders,"well, i do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... now, do you have any pets?"
53127,Ned Flanders,"no-ho-ho, it's true! maude and i sell religious hook rugs over the internet."
53329,Ned Flanders,"if i'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here."
54424,Ned Flanders,now you're rhyming?!
52575,Ned Flanders,"you know at times like these, i-i used to turn to the bible and find solace. but even the good book can't help me now."
53669,Ned Flanders,the house is slightly askew! to the panic room!
54571,Ned Flanders,my son... my son.
54545,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpson."
53489,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer!"
54180,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, that's your salad fork!... that wi-fi's for hotel guests only!... what's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""happy birthday?"""
52778,Ned Flanders,we're not going anywhere.
53631,Ned Flanders,"well, what seems to be the problem, officer?"
53912,Ned Flanders,as sure as i am that jesus hates hip hop!
53275,Ned Flanders,"you can't kill the undead, silly."
53648,Ned Flanders,uh hmm. that's right. i'm like baskin robbins. you get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
53416,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
52948,Ned Flanders,"well, if it'll seal the deal, i'll take a look at your septic tank. see if i can get her hummin' again."
53341,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm having second thoughts. this feels so disloyal to maude."
54466,Ned Flanders,does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
52846,Ned Flanders,"flanders to god, flanders to god! get off your cloud and save my todd."
53856,Ned Flanders,you want me to deliver the christmas sermon? i feel like i'm born again again!
52961,Ned Flanders,"uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
52601,Ned Flanders,"he's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
53059,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, thank the lord! he's truly watching over--"
52539,Ned Flanders,fee fi fo fum! i smell the potatoes au gratin of marge simp-son! mmmm- mmm!
53774,Ned Flanders,"oh, i-i guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal european wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of miss ashley judd!"
54264,Ned Flanders,you all know edna?
54200,Ned Flanders,but neighbor... why did you have to do this? i've tattled this town into a paradise!
53187,Ned Flanders,"no, homer, no! i wanna do something exciting, but i can't just go from zero to thirty like that! i-i could be killed."
54532,Ned Flanders,"hey, there's homer simpson! oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
53075,Ned Flanders,who are we going to beat?
53124,Ned Flanders,"you know, i pride myself on being a good host, so i'm obliged to offer you a beer. but i'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
53210,Ned Flanders,"ooh, nuts."
54051,Ned Flanders,"aw, maude. your dead grandmother's pajamas. you know what that does to me."
52773,Ned Flanders,there's homer. there's homer too. that's also homer. that's homer.
53153,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please make tonight's production better than ""othello"" with peter marshall."
54303,Ned Flanders,"thank you. now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth sunday after easter. we'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment i wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
53926,Ned Flanders,"oh i don't mean to cause gil ill will, but still..."
54445,Ned Flanders,we've lost him.
54078,Ned Flanders,it's not funny! that's how i swear!
54056,Ned Flanders,"red dog, this is mustache one. we have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
52928,Ned Flanders,"now, todd, don't scare the president."
54179,Ned Flanders,i've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
53440,Ned Flanders,always do.
54181,Ned Flanders,"isn't this great, marge? we're like jiminy cricket for the whole ding-dang town. a half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. um-hm."
52835,Ned Flanders,"no, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
54559,Ned Flanders,"no, you will."
53148,Ned Flanders,"well, something's in there all right."
52598,Ned Flanders,where in the bible?
54441,Ned Flanders,he's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.
53280,Ned Flanders,i resisted these for thirty-five years! why did i wear them today?
53362,Ned Flanders,"maybe we can. my name's ned flanders, and i'm here every week. rain or shine."
53733,Ned Flanders,"homer, stay away from the nuclear plant."
53679,Ned Flanders,that was led zeppelin.
52931,Ned Flanders,"aw, they're just family heirlooms. that shouldn't stand in the way of homer takin' my job and--"
54432,Ned Flanders,i'm glad the only beef between us is this burger!
52929,Ned Flanders,who? maude and me?
54429,Ned Flanders,now you can shatter my orbital bone! that'll knock the wax off my candle!
52718,Ned Flanders,"sorry, but i'm afraid ernest borgnine has already been confirmed."
52742,Ned Flanders,you folks got robbed too? the burglar took my shroud of turin beach towels.
54204,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, we've got some work to do."
53096,Ned Flanders,"well, nothing's perfect, i sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
52557,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, oh, i expect things to start picking up soon. i think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
54208,Ned Flanders,flantastic times two! how are connie and bonnie?
53137,Ned Flanders,oooooh!
53678,Ned Flanders,"gee, looks like this town has a good sam log-jam."
52794,Ned Flanders,but i thought it might break the ice if we had a little q and a.
52882,Ned Flanders,"well, children, it's saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play bombardment..."
54536,Ned Flanders,dear neighbor...
53795,Ned Flanders,how could this have... oh.
54249,Ned Flanders,"well, a little nibble won't hurt your appetite."
52806,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, what a pleasant..."
54368,Ned Flanders,"diddily, diddily, diddily, diddily!"
54508,Ned Flanders,you bet.
54390,Ned Flanders,"homer, you know my parents, capri and nedward."
54002,Ned Flanders,"my friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
53408,Ned Flanders,ow! now what was that for?
53380,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you know... magic, fortune telling, oriental cooking..."
53995,Ned Flanders,"well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
53626,Ned Flanders,noooo!
53910,Ned Flanders,we want you to teach alternative theories to darwinian evolution.
53560,Ned Flanders,"oh, you'd win that bet. seems like i'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. or as i like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
54122,Ned Flanders,"you know marge, maude and i had a fight right before she died..."
54041,Ned Flanders,really? not married? and you were bicycling two abreast?
53412,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
53496,Ned Flanders,so you are running a day care center?
54286,Ned Flanders,"patty and selma?! sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
53021,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe a few of them do. back east."
53095,Ned Flanders,"well, shall we sing a hymn? uh, ""nearer my god to thee"", maybe? or, or, or ""amazing grace""?"
54345,Ned Flanders,you pulled the boys out of school?!
54075,Ned Flanders,let's see what else is on.
54114,Ned Flanders,my wife? and my worst friend? could it be?
53272,Ned Flanders,"hear that, maude? homer's a critic."
53832,Ned Flanders,"so you see mr. roberts, i really would like my house back."
53509,Ned Flanders,maybe never.
53605,Ned Flanders,"no, it's sara sloane. i have a date with her tonight."
53494,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. anyway, thanks again."
54277,Ned Flanders,we just wanted to give you all a big thank you from team nedna.
52897,Ned Flanders,today we write a new page in the flanders family bible.
54064,Ned Flanders,"well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, i appreciate the sediment."
53614,Ned Flanders,"sir, there's no reason sara needs to do this scene in the altogether."
53687,Ned Flanders,that homer just burns my waffles!
53864,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, i don't i don't really want a computer. you know all those complete strangers googling each other. makes my flesh crawl."
53108,Ned Flanders,"oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
53468,Ned Flanders,how 'bout a maude mask?
53556,Ned Flanders,"okay, here's my amex."
53723,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can foretell people's deaths!"
52658,Ned Flanders,"so, kids, what do you want to play?"
53305,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
53464,Ned Flanders,you can stop satan with your faith.
53817,Ned Flanders,i wish we lived in a place more like the america of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us republicans.
54110,Ned Flanders,saved by the bell from eternity in hell!
52734,Ned Flanders,"you know, homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
52911,Ned Flanders,yeah. a crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
54161,Ned Flanders,delete! delete! delete!
54388,Ned Flanders,why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
54156,Ned Flanders,"homer, this is the most sacred spot in christendom, not your backyard hammock."
53451,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been closed for so long... and-and i thought i could turn it into a christian theme park."
53707,Ned Flanders,huh?
53339,Ned Flanders,"well, with triple word score, that's ninety! ha-ha, i guess my luck is starting to even out."
53086,Ned Flanders,you mean like... an angel?!!
53766,Ned Flanders,"there's nothing but filth on tv. but with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
53702,Ned Flanders,"they were two for one at krusty home depot, so i got an extra one for you guys!"
52769,Ned Flanders,"eh, well sir. my entire family is very touched and--"

53744,Ned Flanders,i just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
53463,Ned Flanders,"well, maude, your dream has finally come true."
52638,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, may your loving hand guide homer to the mattress square and true."
52850,Ned Flanders,"oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the flanderosa."
54524,Ned Flanders,"oh, you know how that embarrasses me."
53012,Ned Flanders,i can't believe i was such a terror.
54487,Ned Flanders,"right next to mount fu-gee, i'm glad to see ya!"

52662,Ned Flanders,"and since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my tv tr..."
52767,Ned Flanders,"sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
54244,Ned Flanders,any chance i could see you again?
53217,Ned Flanders,"uh, do i have to be gang-probed?"

53709,Ned Flanders,"oh, and another thing..."
52802,Ned Flanders,"well, cockily-doodily-doo, little buddies. let's thank the lord for another beautiful school day."

54084,Ned Flanders,my ballpoint is all clicked-up for you.
54337,Ned Flanders,'cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
53533,Ned Flanders,"well, i know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
52610,Ned Flanders,"ah, i tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
53262,Ned Flanders,ho-ho! what a great pot party.
52870,Ned Flanders,mmm-hmm. all we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
53068,Ned Flanders,"oof! okay, nelson's our quarterback."

53120,Ned Flanders,"hey, i made some rice krispy squares for our hungry deprogramerinos!"
53857,Ned Flanders,"don't be nervous, ned. you've practiced this so many times in the shower."
53610,Ned Flanders,heaven's gate! i'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week.
53236,Ned Flanders,what the dickens?!
53567,Ned Flanders,"well, aren't you a super-duper recouper."
53456,Ned Flanders,"ah, gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene."
52789,Ned Flanders,okilly-dokilly.

54236,Ned Flanders,"homer? yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... i guess. so, what say we have lunch?"
54348,Ned Flanders,what if we were raptured right now?
53685,Ned Flanders,wha?
53954,Ned Flanders,i've got something that will scare the h-e-double sippy straws out of them.
52576,Ned Flanders,i sold it to you for seven cents.
53478,Ned Flanders,"oh, there's no explaining god's will, roddy. that's like explaining how an airplane flies."
53393,Ned Flanders,homer! wake up! the car's filling with...
53268,Ned Flanders,it's not working! it just spreads the flame!
53346,Ned Flanders,"mmm. dinner was delicious, edna, but i can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get principal skinner jealous."
53470,Ned Flanders,bye bye.
52905,Ned Flanders,and this is lord thistlewick flanders...
54175,Ned Flanders,"homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
53635,Ned Flanders,"sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
53132,Ned Flanders,"hmmm. let's see, cash-register ink. well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? mmm... but then i do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
52809,Ned Flanders,ohmygod! what have i done? i've killed her!
54314,Ned Flanders,"i thought i smelled death-a-diddly. what is that, an eight-pointer?"
54260,Ned Flanders,"yeah, let me guess. you're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' edna."
54552,Ned Flanders,"you know, simpson, you're starting to annoy me."
53569,Ned Flanders,you betcha. it's a nice break from the male sports i usually watch.
54150,Ned Flanders,"y'know, homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. please, neighbor?"
52765,Ned Flanders,oh... well... that sounds super duper.
52571,Ned Flanders,"well, there's no house to put it in, homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
52727,Ned Flanders,"paddle harder, homer. we gotta fight the current."
54343,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry honey, but i'm stuck in this meeting of the springfield l.g.b.t. the left-gifted, bidextrous, and transhanded community. we're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""left is right"" parade."
54383,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
53413,Ned Flanders,...and harry potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
53564,Ned Flanders,"shop o' the mornin', homer! just call me ""mall"" flanders."
53438,Ned Flanders,"i sure appreciate you folks offering to go through maude's things. if it were up to me, i wouldn't throw anything away."
54023,Ned Flanders,"forget it! i am turning in my... well, i don't really have anything to turn in. so that's that! i suggest you call homer simpson."
53156,Ned Flanders,"well, i did, but--"
52980,Ned Flanders,it's all gone. everything... gone-diddily-on.
52902,Ned Flanders,"rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh."
54408,Ned Flanders,was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? that's what i wanna know.
53016,Ned Flanders,"ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
54112,Ned Flanders,i never thought otherwise.
54297,Ned Flanders,"oh, for cryin' out loud!"
52804,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily.
54012,Ned Flanders,kindly deeds / and they're done for free / kindly deeds / and they're done for free
54166,Ned Flanders,not. worth. saving.
53770,Ned Flanders,"boys, i just talked to god. he's vacuuming heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. and he'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
53655,Ned Flanders,and it wouldn't hurt you to put up some curtains.
52969,Ned Flanders,howdilly-doodilly.
52900,Ned Flanders,"wait, homer. what did you just say?"
53424,Ned Flanders,"well, my wife's passing was rough, but i think i'm finally ready to move on."
53258,Ned Flanders,he taught us how to live a burt reynolds lifestyle on a mac davis income. we've already got tickets for his next seminar.
54255,Ned Flanders,actually... she sort of does.
53574,Ned Flanders,the steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
53846,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, why the sour puss? didja chugalug a skunky snapple?"
53866,Ned Flanders,woo hoo!

54501,Ned Flanders,"see marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
53616,Ned Flanders,"well, that's uh, very interesting..."
54261,Ned Flanders,"homer, listen to me. for a long time now i've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with marge. then i remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."

53499,Ned Flanders,"yeah, b-but my hands are up."
53876,Ned Flanders,"well, well. look at my dull-eyed angels."
53807,Ned Flanders,i coulda sworn i just heard someone shriek my name.
54042,Ned Flanders,"wordplay: never cared for it. but it's never too soon for you two to join the ""i do"" crew. now i'm not sayin' it's all jell-o with cool whip. she'll nag ya. she'll try to change ya. you'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
54239,Ned Flanders,"besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... the leftorium. we've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
53458,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been a tad harder than i thought, but i'm not complaining 'cause i work for a sweet, sweet, boss. you're our foreman, maude."
53762,Ned Flanders,"here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off."
52926,Ned Flanders,tip-top-notch!
52597,Ned Flanders,"no reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
52921,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. well, i... uh, i guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
52847,Ned Flanders,"thanks, god."
52616,Ned Flanders,"well, if you ever want to spend the night, maude and i can sleep on card tables."
54275,Ned Flanders,"hey simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
53888,Ned Flanders,"well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
53162,Ned Flanders,"oh, can you believe it? it almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady neddy."
53105,Ned Flanders,purple drapes! all my life i've wanted purple drapes!
53428,Ned Flanders,"now wait just a maude-gone minute, here. i'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
53505,Ned Flanders,"playing a prankeroo, eh?"
52653,Ned Flanders,"if you need anything, just give a whistle."
52777,Ned Flanders,"no, i-i mean just the flanders family."
52631,Ned Flanders,stella! stellla! can't you hear me yell-a? / you're puttin' me through hell-a / stella! stella!
53077,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."
53169,Ned Flanders,"here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, homer. but i, i was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
54052,Ned Flanders,so... i'm sure you missed marge last night.
53079,Ned Flanders,what?
53447,Ned Flanders,"maude designed a christian amusement park. oh, it must have been her final dream."
53326,Ned Flanders,"aw, homer. you don't have to..."
52700,Ned Flanders,"oh, dear lord!"
53303,Ned Flanders,"oh, those poor souls. what's the christian thing to do?"
53919,Ned Flanders,what say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?
52594,Ned Flanders,"all right, that's it, young man. no bible stories for you tonight."
53810,Ned Flanders,you soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. and sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
53710,Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. it doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
53418,Ned Flanders,"no, i'm not!"
53591,Ned Flanders,"form of business? sole proprietorship. ""owner's marital status?"" happily married... to a dead woman."
53265,Ned Flanders,check it out! mad dog's on fire!
53406,Ned Flanders,"look, if you want me to turn, just point. that w..."
52798,Ned Flanders,"anyhoo, bart, you're gonna have to be punished. this isn't just some sort of club house."
52546,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i'm opening a one-stop store for southpaws. everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. i'm gonna call it the leftorium."
52818,Ned Flanders,murdered?
54440,Ned Flanders,"i don't understand that on any level, but yes."
53843,Ned Flanders,my pleasure.
54362,Ned Flanders,"yes, but jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. darnit, the bible said the devil would be attractive!"
53313,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!"
53612,Ned Flanders,"oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least i can do."
53507,Ned Flanders,"it's kind of you to offer, mr. burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
52531,Ned Flanders,"hey, anybody mind if i serve as bartender? you know, i have a ph.d in mixology."
53993,Ned Flanders,"yep, i'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
53199,Ned Flanders,"look at this place! we must have really painted the town last night. i have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and i don't remember a thing!"
54481,Ned Flanders,say no more.
53320,Ned Flanders,what are you saying?
53973,Ned Flanders,"i can't say for sure, but as a christian, i assume the worst."
52678,Ned Flanders,"knock that off, you two. it's time for church!"
53639,Ned Flanders,"se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly..."
54407,Ned Flanders,see you in eight hours!
52603,Ned Flanders,i'm afraid i have a bone to pick with you.
53168,Ned Flanders,"never a dull moment, huh, homer?"
53364,Ned Flanders,"ah yeah, i never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. it was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
54313,Ned Flanders,isn't she pretty?
53163,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. and some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. i'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. maybe with a--"
52904,Ned Flanders,"oh, gosh, homer, this is strictly a flanders affair. i've got family here from around the globe! here's josé flanders..."
53123,Ned Flanders,"uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? anyone like a draft beer?"
53686,Ned Flanders,"oh, for the love of puppies."
52907,Ned Flanders,"congratulations, homer. your q is a huge success. a toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
53938,Ned Flanders,"fetch daddy's thinner, boy."
54140,Ned Flanders,"yep. i also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
53895,Ned Flanders,"only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? well i'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! tell you what, i'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
52895,Ned Flanders,looks like i'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
54266,Ned Flanders,wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
53497,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure would. it would give the boys a place to go after school."
53173,Ned Flanders,so what about all this meat?
52942,Ned Flanders,"ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. just promise you'll have a good time."
53501,Ned Flanders,what the...?!
54316,Ned Flanders,that's just fine as long as you're not a mormon!
53328,Ned Flanders,"i just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. i can't believe my last words to maude were ""no foot-longs."""
52726,Ned Flanders,"matthew, mark, luke-and-john!"
52857,Ned Flanders,"bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... oh my lord!! something horrible has happened!"
53239,Ned Flanders,you heard me.
53495,Ned Flanders,"oh, roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center."
53490,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, i need to ask ya a favor. my baby sitter canceled and i got tickets to a christian rock concert."
53913,Ned Flanders,as a matter... homer...
53658,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i think you want your house, next door."
53151,Ned Flanders,"homer, is that my muffler?"
52872,Ned Flanders,"oh, bart. i know you're still getting adjusted here. tell you what. we'll do whatever you want to do."
53366,Ned Flanders,yeah. just answer me this: are you holding your mooching sack?
52886,Ned Flanders,okay. for one gold star: what persian king exempted the levites from taxation?
54238,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'm afraid my maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now."
53714,Ned Flanders,"huh, credit card bill seems a little chunky this month."

53042,Ned Flanders,"lisa, ned flanders. you available tonight?"
54574,Ned Flanders,"okey-dokel. hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?"

53754,Ned Flanders,but the infinite beauty-- / but the bible says--
53529,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, of course he could... but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
52623,Ned Flanders,all i want is one embrace.
54157,Ned Flanders,unknown? this is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
53141,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please take mr. bunny up to heaven."
52540,Ned Flanders,"heya, homer!"
53482,Ned Flanders,"hello, gas company? how poisonous is your gas?... wow. but-- eh, but i'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... how could that be worse?... okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... i see."
54491,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, our good lord, and my boys are all i've really got. all edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which i'm still working my way through."
53437,Ned Flanders,"oh, who am i kidding? i'm not over maude at all."
53879,Ned Flanders,"well, i think it's about time you boys get to bed."
53027,Ned Flanders,um-hm.

54426,Ned Flanders,never get into heaven... took harp lessons for nothing...
53480,Ned Flanders,"oh, no! this isn't a devine miracle. everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
54170,Ned Flanders,"homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, i think you came closest to the truth."
54187,Ned Flanders,less radical... less radical!
54221,Ned Flanders,"hey-diddily-hi, homer."
54587,Ned Flanders,"whoops, my heart rate's dropping. better skedaddley-do."
53342,Ned Flanders,you think she would?

54519,Ned Flanders,"there's my little popcorn ball. kissy, kissy."
54066,Ned Flanders,"well, actually... as your landlord, repairs are my responsibility. i'll just get my tools..."
52645,Ned Flanders,"why, sue dokes, you rascal! i thought you were dead and--"
54009,Ned Flanders,"homer, i don't think we have the same musical tastes."
52532,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! care to try some of my flanders planters punch?"
53025,Ned Flanders,"thanks, everyone. i'm all better now. no more storing up the anger 'til i explode. if any of you does something i don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"

53455,Ned Flanders,"oh, bless you, sir."
53855,Ned Flanders,"christ is born, who's on my horn?"
52779,Ned Flanders,"i can't, it's a geo!"
54210,Ned Flanders,"actually, god made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
54130,Ned Flanders,duly noted. but we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
53592,Ned Flanders,"mm hmm! open as a tomb on easter. now, what can i ding dong diddily do for ya?"
53093,Ned Flanders,"we've come for the angel, homer. it's not safe with the unbeliever."

53024,Ned Flanders,"no, that's not true. i... i... i don't like the service at the post office. y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. then, they've got those machines in the lobby. they're even faster. no help there. you might even say i hate the post office. that, and my parents. lousy beatniks! hey, that felt good!"
53106,Ned Flanders,"well, neighborinos, i guess this is goodbye... i better make this quick or i'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."

53003,Ned Flanders,"oh yeah, the clown. the only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. and as for you -- i don't know you, but i'm sure you're a jerk."

54308,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the ""cross"" games, simpsons! a christian fellowship expo!"
53785,Ned Flanders,"gee, i thought my vision was perfect. and here i was, worshiping false eyeballs."
53444,Ned Flanders,here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
53516,Ned Flanders,"whoops. watch the swears, honey bear. we don't use the ""i"" word in this house."
53130,Ned Flanders,"it says ""show me your tie."" it's cute. c'mon, let's go."
53619,Ned Flanders,i'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!
53410,Ned Flanders,"hey, you got a tennis court."

53314,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't care for the speed, but i can't get enough of that safety gear. helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
52553,Ned Flanders,"oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
52608,Ned Flanders,"okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. i'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
54148,Ned Flanders,homer...
54391,Ned Flanders,"dad, don't encourage him."
54001,Ned Flanders,we have to do everything by the book.
53634,Ned Flanders,"hop to it, honey! if we get to the pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
53227,Ned Flanders,not so deep the lord can't find him... and judge him.
53598,Ned Flanders,"well, it looks good... and it sounds pretty too."
53549,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely.
53335,Ned Flanders,so that's why you maced me.
52964,Ned Flanders,"well, we all changed our minds."
53176,Ned Flanders,all right.

54234,Ned Flanders,"so, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""flanders arms."""
54118,Ned Flanders,we'll let the authorities sort that out.
53290,Ned Flanders,n-no... you see...
54113,Ned Flanders,"well, see ya 'round the mailbox, marge."
52632,Ned Flanders,the door's frozen shut... and it's the only way out!
53796,Ned Flanders,"boys, enough of your shenanigans. it's bedtime."
53167,Ned Flanders,would a silly billy sit like this?
52735,Ned Flanders,"godspeed, li'l doodle."
54340,Ned Flanders,"homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?"
53435,Ned Flanders,"mm. well, goodnight, maude. i mean, maude. i mean, rachel. i mean, maude."

53916,Ned Flanders,"you win, lisa."
52862,Ned Flanders,"okay, okay folks, look. i called the police captain in shelbyville. he says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
54338,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please bless our blended family..."
53392,Ned Flanders,"hm, sounds like a plan."
54310,Ned Flanders,sports stands for strict parental oversight rather than sports!
52856,Ned Flanders,"let's see. ""replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
52830,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly doodilly neighbors. shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
53360,Ned Flanders,"no, i hear what you're saying. it's always hard to replace someone."
54034,Ned Flanders,"""...lest i come and strike the earth with a curse."" thus ends the book of malachi. i guess i did know the whole old testament by heart. out with the old... in with the new. testament, that is. matthew one. ""the book of the genealogy of jesus christ, the son of david, the son of abraham..."""
53582,Ned Flanders,"no, no, you're lying! you're lying! what makes you lie?"
53600,Ned Flanders,what the...? that's a pseu-diddily-eudonym.
53378,Ned Flanders,"oh, my goodness!"
54578,Ned Flanders,that is the most dishonest thing i've ever heard.
54351,Ned Flanders,"fine, i guess. thanks for loaning me your pajamas, homer. and marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
53351,Ned Flanders,"eh, you boys can go with the simpsons. i'm not going to church today."
53344,Ned Flanders,"okay, here goes nothin'."
52560,Ned Flanders,"come on, homer. tell him about the store. i'm dyin' out here."
53266,Ned Flanders,"ha! ha! ha! that's for clydes, baby. a little fire can't hurt you."
52667,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""sweatin' to the oldies,"" volumes one, two and four."
52750,Ned Flanders,"well, get out the crayolas and color me tickled pink! oh, what's with the lead pipe? were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
52579,Ned Flanders,"no! you tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... i didn't listen. homer, you were a true friend."
53717,Ned Flanders,concussion... diddily... hemorrhage... doodily... injury... bodily...
54043,Ned Flanders,i think i'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
54058,Ned Flanders,"as the worm said to the plate of spaghetti, ""i... i..."
52646,Ned Flanders,"howdy-do, neighbor! good pipe weather. thought i'd fire up the briar."
53820,Ned Flanders,"boys, we're home!"
53692,Ned Flanders,"here you go, principal skinner, mrs. skinner."
54259,Ned Flanders,oh my.
53315,Ned Flanders,"abso-not-ly, hot roddy. we're up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers' cussing."
53649,Ned Flanders,"i love you, too. and i always will. but unlike the bible, i guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
53689,Ned Flanders,"why, i'll give you a jump, i'll rotate your tires, i'll even fold up that map for you. i know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
54105,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
52728,Ned Flanders,"again? homer, we have to ration the water carefully. it's our only hope."
54125,Ned Flanders,what about sodom and gomorrah?
52649,Ned Flanders,"ah, homer, why don't you plow it again?"
52755,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, stanster."
54253,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?"
53212,Ned Flanders,drederick tatum!
54136,Ned Flanders,"i sense a ""but"" coming, reverend..."
53250,Ned Flanders,"well, hi-diddly..."
53964,Ned Flanders,sloth!
53622,Ned Flanders,"so anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. i guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. if you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
53409,Ned Flanders,ow! ow!
52766,Ned Flanders,"homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at moe's tonight."
52972,Ned Flanders,dang!
54551,Ned Flanders,"no, i just --"
54186,Ned Flanders,don't use that dog as a ramp...
54107,Ned Flanders,then i give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go!
52917,Ned Flanders,it's me... ned.
53526,Ned Flanders,"heaven and earth... where were we? oh, now i'm lost."
52695,Ned Flanders,toodledy-doo!
54006,Ned Flanders,our first bail jumper!
53159,Ned Flanders,"l-listen, folks, there's no magic formula. i just follow the three c's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church."
53118,Ned Flanders,i don't think that's gonna do it.
53367,Ned Flanders,"bart, you're never gonna to grow up if i keep bailing you out."
53974,Ned Flanders,what're we gonna do? we can't not vote. nobody does that!
53397,Ned Flanders,we're gonna crash!
53800,Ned Flanders,"wait, this is my license!"
54134,Ned Flanders,...man i ever met!
53886,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the jungle gym / i'll make it safe again / when playtime is a safe time, everybody wins..."
52799,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, were you drinking slice or yoo-hoo?"
54169,Ned Flanders,i did it! i reached him!
54479,Ned Flanders,the therapy bears! look out for the therapy bears!
52770,Ned Flanders,we're headin' back. todd's got zesty italian in his eye.
54493,Ned Flanders,sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. are you just buying this to be nice?
53839,Ned Flanders,bart and homer can't go catholic! the romans have been separate from us since the schism of lourdes in 1573. and that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. which we've since abolished.
53288,Ned Flanders,my rumpus room with the new bumper pool table.
53599,Ned Flanders,"a woman askin' a man out? well, well why not. and maybe i'll eat my steak with a spoon."
53665,Ned Flanders,"i got your letter, jesus and i'm coming as fast as i can."
53798,Ned Flanders,"well, it might be fun to be a landlord. landfella -- there's only one lord!"
52625,Ned Flanders,"there, there's the ol' face-shredder!"
54568,Ned Flanders,"y'know, simpson, i feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
54116,Ned Flanders,just as i feared: her buddhism has led directly to witchcraft.
54036,Ned Flanders,perez became the father of hezron. hezron became the father of ram.
52706,Ned Flanders,"ooh, careful there, marge! almost nicked me!"
53183,Ned Flanders,"oh, the lights, the noise, the letter x -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. i'm overstimulated! i gotta get out of this town!"
54401,Ned Flanders,neither canonical nor comical.
54007,Ned Flanders,"homer, take the taser out of your pants."
53178,Ned Flanders,"okay, homer. i'm ready to learn. what's the first lesson? just give me the topic sentence."
54198,Ned Flanders,de-meat those feet!
54433,Ned Flanders,"how long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
53859,Ned Flanders,"my lp of ""dreamcoat!"""
54566,Ned Flanders,what are you talking about? neither boy lost.
53032,Ned Flanders,"uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
53987,Ned Flanders,zippin' it up!
53237,Ned Flanders,"eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit?"
54411,Ned Flanders,nope... not that... not to my taste... flag that for later... finally!
52670,Ned Flanders,"if you think i'm cuddly / and you want my company / come on wifey let me know... ugh, ugh, ugh... oooh..."
52868,Ned Flanders,"uh, i'd like to hear from sideshow mel."
54172,Ned Flanders,you'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
53147,Ned Flanders,"hm, maybe there is something in there."
54315,Ned Flanders,"hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way i write."
53128,Ned Flanders,"yes indeedy. makin' some good scratch, too."
52699,Ned Flanders,"well, that can be arranged."
52876,Ned Flanders,peek-a-boo! i see you!
53758,Ned Flanders,anyone want some coffee for the ride back?
54282,Ned Flanders,"are you sure, lord?"
54332,Ned Flanders,diddily... doodily...
53545,Ned Flanders,"here's a preview. god said to noah / build yourself an ark-y ark-y / animals came on by ones and twosies, twosies / elephants and kangaroosies - roosies..."
53674,Ned Flanders,ahhhh...
53135,Ned Flanders,get your taxes out of the way?
54547,Ned Flanders,"now, just a minute, simpson. i think my son has a very good chance."
53343,Ned Flanders,sherlock holmes is a character.
52951,Ned Flanders,oh... uh...
54416,Ned Flanders,"i want you to punch me in the eye. if you do, then we're even, according to exodus, leviticus and matthew."
52680,Ned Flanders,"i wish he were, rod, i pray for the day, but i'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
53142,Ned Flanders,heh. sports on a sunday? hm. i'd better check with reverend--
54197,Ned Flanders,"i see you now. rod, you and todd stay in the house."
53621,Ned Flanders,no way! i won't even eat vegetables over two inches long.
52541,Ned Flanders,"okay, thanks for comin'!"
53240,Ned Flanders,vamoose!
54262,Ned Flanders,someone to hold the other end of the sheet when i fold it up. someone to put in my prayers.
53233,Ned Flanders,there you go.
52852,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
54047,Ned Flanders,that's just your trouser devil talking!
53094,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
54304,Ned Flanders,peace be with you.
52725,Ned Flanders,uh-oh... no time.
53513,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, i know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. but, uh, i know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so i will."
53352,Ned Flanders,that's right. and i may not go to church tomorrow.
53972,Ned Flanders,"i had to -- i heard a hubbub, bub."
54193,Ned Flanders,"sour ball, take me away!"
53205,Ned Flanders,ginger's my wife.
53894,Ned Flanders,"lord, with you watching over me i shall feel no pain."
53563,Ned Flanders,"well boys, good thing we brought the eye soap."
54531,Ned Flanders,"hello, reverend lovejoy."
53145,Ned Flanders,hmm. that's odd. it didn't come out the rear end.
54306,Ned Flanders,and i haven't. not until now.
53788,Ned Flanders,"howdy, homer. you here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
54497,Ned Flanders,my best friend is a great runner!
52756,Ned Flanders,"stan, tell you what -- homer simpson here is just about the biggest atom fan that's ever graced god's green earth. i bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
53194,Ned Flanders,oh no. i-i mean common sense.
53256,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. they were evidence in a murder trial!"
53921,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!"
53371,Ned Flanders,six months ago. you were at the funeral. you fell into the grave.
53425,Ned Flanders,"i can hear her, homer."
52787,Ned Flanders,just try and stop me.
54030,Ned Flanders,for the last few weeks. but most of the time i've known you you've treated me like dirt!
53230,Ned Flanders,"oh adam, you're too kind."
52568,Ned Flanders,twenty dollars.
53492,Ned Flanders,would you mind watching the kids? i'm kinda in a pickle here.
53963,Ned Flanders,pride!
52759,Ned Flanders,"uh, be careful there, homer. that is sort of a new table."
54550,Ned Flanders,"all right, how's this for a wager? a batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
53596,Ned Flanders,"i sure do. you're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
54242,Ned Flanders,"well thank you for taking me to that pinkberry place. it's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
54219,Ned Flanders,"oh, don't be scared, boys. that's just the angels bowling."
54539,Ned Flanders,"ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the todd-meister."
53154,Ned Flanders,"howdy, homer."
53726,Ned Flanders,'cause i had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
53630,Ned Flanders,"forgive my language, but i am one happy camper!"
52739,Ned Flanders,okilly dokilly.
53459,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
54158,Ned Flanders,"porky pig's not a man, he's a pig! and he's not even a real pig!"
53944,Ned Flanders,to: online christian soldiers... subject: televised super swear...
54096,Ned Flanders,the parson?! he's coming here?
53536,Ned Flanders,the camptown ladies sing this song...
54083,Ned Flanders,"you two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, christian but not baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
54455,Ned Flanders,that's not a prayer!
54289,Ned Flanders,homer simpson!
52640,Ned Flanders,"heck, you'd have done the same for me."
52910,Ned Flanders,no.
52797,Ned Flanders,"bart, i've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. and now that i have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
52800,Ned Flanders,"well, i may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when i was a boy."
54546,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, may the best man win."
53317,Ned Flanders,maude?
54191,Ned Flanders,boy cheeks!... fanny!... derriere!... hiney!... backside!... ...cover up that coin slot!
53292,Ned Flanders,i've got a motorhome i never use. maybe we should raffle it off.
54496,Ned Flanders,this is a whole new relationship for us! we'll be friends! in this life and the next!
53254,Ned Flanders,"now, homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
52894,Ned Flanders,reverend... emergency... i... you... simpson kids... eedily... baptism... oodily... doodily-doodily...
54128,Ned Flanders,"today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of matthew twenty-three."
52858,Ned Flanders,oh.
53067,Ned Flanders,"little higher, wendell... a lot higher, martin... ah, ralph, that's a basketball."
54004,Ned Flanders,did you just taser my coffee?
54528,Ned Flanders,i feel terrible.
53597,Ned Flanders,i'm as real as the nose on your face.
54163,Ned Flanders,banned for life?
53048,Ned Flanders,"uh, i'm in some hot soup here, marge. uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. i... i think they could start slacking at any moment."
53624,Ned Flanders,can i call you jim?
52805,Ned Flanders,we might as well make it official.
53219,Ned Flanders,"i don't want to be a panicky pete, but it's sunday and i haven't been to church yet."
53391,Ned Flanders,we're trapped!
54145,Ned Flanders,"lord, please help homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
52602,Ned Flanders,homer?
53870,Ned Flanders,do you have one for a mailman?
54339,Ned Flanders,"boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with."
54050,Ned Flanders,"oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
54431,Ned Flanders,"you know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? well, sir, i want you to rid of lisa's bully teacher."
54499,Ned Flanders,"why, i bet the lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. our mission is one hundred percent pure."
53031,Ned Flanders,...help out. what can i do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey?
53617,Ned Flanders,mm-hmm. i haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
52935,Ned Flanders,marge simpson -- still making juice the old-fashioned way?
54520,Ned Flanders,"ain't she wonderful, simpson?"
53200,Ned Flanders,"oh, i did it! i conquered my fears and i made up for a lot of lost livin'. and i owe it all to the homer simpson program."
53101,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm just gonna spill my guts: i love it to death! i'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
52775,Ned Flanders,oh! almost. boy that was close.
53116,Ned Flanders,there goes christmas dinner.
54544,Ned Flanders,"hey, i like that confidence!... but i hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. my todd's awfully good."
52801,Ned Flanders,woopsy-doodle.
53170,Ned Flanders,"yeah, i, i guess i do."
53286,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! can i join?"
54503,Ned Flanders,do you think this looks okay?
54295,Ned Flanders,"but, but..."
53185,Ned Flanders,"if he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp."
53865,Ned Flanders,"well sir, we could do a little quid pro for the kay-pro. the left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of springfield's largest southpaw shop, i just gotta be there. could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
53389,Ned Flanders,"sure you did -- ""mr. plow."" you're wearin' the jacket right now!"
53777,Ned Flanders,wait a minute -- you've got a medium and i've got a message. maybe god brought us together for a reason.
53129,Ned Flanders,yep.
52825,Ned Flanders,"just relax, let the hooks do their work."
52968,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o! it's good for keeping down the urges."
53399,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. this one's fine and dandy, roddy. it's approved by a council of presbylutheran ministers."
54021,Ned Flanders,"you know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
53761,Ned Flanders,"careful, it's hotter than a fox news weather skank."
53868,Ned Flanders,"here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with rod and todd's blood type."
54294,Ned Flanders,"wake up, flanders! there is no hell, and there is no god. if there were, would he let me do this?"
53249,Ned Flanders,looks like heaven's easier to get into than arizona state.
53932,Ned Flanders,"only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
54307,Ned Flanders,"oh that's nice, but i don't approve of--"
53572,Ned Flanders,"well, hot dog!"
52899,Ned Flanders,"do you reject satan, and all his empty promises?"
53586,Ned Flanders,speaking in tongues. what great kids.
53699,Ned Flanders,that is one bitchin' bike!
53157,Ned Flanders,"well, yes."
52751,Ned Flanders,what?
52885,Ned Flanders,vulgate it is.
53104,Ned Flanders,that's good enough for me.
54188,Ned Flanders,stop gleaming that cube!
53214,Ned Flanders,will you shut up?
53504,Ned Flanders,wow.
54583,Ned Flanders,"well, howdaly-do, simpson? gettin' a little exercise, eh? good for you, pal. oh, look at this old rascal! he's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? isn't he? you're just a water monster."
52720,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? want me to zinc your sniffer?"
53324,Ned Flanders,"hey, that's my sprinkler."
53725,Ned Flanders,country parmesan.
52651,Ned Flanders,you'll be history!
52698,Ned Flanders,howdy gents. what can i diddily do you for?
52724,Ned Flanders,"oh, quick, homer! which way do we turn--?"
52570,Ned Flanders,homer! over here!
53041,Ned Flanders,"oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! oh, and todd's as dry as a bone! lisa, you're a wonder! i'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
53782,Ned Flanders,yes... but my mower can't get much lower!
52863,Ned Flanders,"well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the..."
54291,Ned Flanders,i'm gonna kill you!
53646,Ned Flanders,that's what maude used to say.
53523,Ned Flanders,well... i don't have one from you!
53905,Ned Flanders,no one was ever a monkey! everything is what it was and always will be! god put us here and that's that!
52635,Ned Flanders,"i see him, son."
54443,Ned Flanders,"reverend, we want you to come back."
52833,Ned Flanders,"i may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
52694,Ned Flanders,hiedilly-hey!
52558,Ned Flanders,"oh, right as rain. or, as we say around here, left as rain."
54142,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's not why we're here. we can see the stations of the cross!"
53608,Ned Flanders,"... rod says ""marco,"" and darn it if todd doesn't say ""polo"" right back! oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. you're probably bored silly."
52999,Ned Flanders,"well, my family and i can't live in good intentions, marge! oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
53815,Ned Flanders,"don't say it, homer. this is not the time."
53386,Ned Flanders,but it's my car.
53941,Ned Flanders,"sixty minutes -- morley safer has questionable pants fold -- ""the l word"" -- used the ""l"" word."
53642,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm not sure i want to do it. i mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" you know, the cow being me."
52827,Ned Flanders,you just be ready with that garbage bag.
53245,Ned Flanders,i said homer!
53942,Ned Flanders,and now to peruse the local news!
53431,Ned Flanders,"ohh, no problem. a little starch will fix her right up."
52988,Ned Flanders,son of a gun-diddily-un! those gilded edges smart!
53522,Ned Flanders,i'll say. i'd really like to go out and get the mail.
52637,Ned Flanders,nooo!
53730,Ned Flanders,you leave me no choice!
52723,Ned Flanders,"whoa, nelly!"
52719,Ned Flanders,"okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. two dads to a raft."
54347,Ned Flanders,"well, that's just great, boys. now, come over here so mrs. simpson can take a photo."
53537,Ned Flanders,"doo-da, doo-da..."
54220,Ned Flanders,homer! gimme back my tree!
54149,Ned Flanders,bleh.
52950,Ned Flanders,"uh... homer... ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the tv trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in cypress creek?"
53149,Ned Flanders,it was people. people soiled our green!
53525,Ned Flanders,"now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of trojans."
54363,Ned Flanders,"unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
53139,Ned Flanders,"rod, get off of there!"
53165,Ned Flanders,look at that! everyone's living it up except ned.
54482,Ned Flanders,"well, we pulled more plugs than a dutch doctor. now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
52958,Ned Flanders,"...adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. and, of course, in canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
54225,Ned Flanders,"i didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat!"
53484,Ned Flanders,nooo!!!
54138,Ned Flanders,homer? homer?
53294,Ned Flanders,that shy little imp?
52771,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't know..."
53115,Ned Flanders,"hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
53748,Ned Flanders,"let's see... ""get bent."" well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. we'll take the whole box. get bent, everyone!"
54243,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i guess i better refenestrate ya."
54283,Ned Flanders,and so white-bread ned became the avenging sword of the lord.
54352,Ned Flanders,"i just felt so ashamed i just couldn't go home. today, i gave in to the one thing i vowed i would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
53503,Ned Flanders,"gee, i always like to help you, homer, but i don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. and it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
53355,Ned Flanders,"electric guitars in church? oh, my gosh. some dropouts must have overpowered the reverend!"
53281,Ned Flanders,"oooh, yes indeedy, homer. looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
54365,Ned Flanders,"lord, you're testin' me, aren't ya?"
52549,Ned Flanders,"oh, no. the springfield mall."
52746,Ned Flanders,hidilly ho!
52686,Ned Flanders,i'll never have that problem again.
52599,Ned Flanders,but reverend...
53033,Ned Flanders,hi-dilly-ho shary bobbins!
53302,Ned Flanders,"well, that's no..."
54106,Ned Flanders,"okily-dokily. but i'm warning you, you're gonna see america's number-one dishwashing crew!"
53008,Ned Flanders,noooooooooooo!
53481,Ned Flanders,"ah, ah, folks, i've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. you see..."
53759,Ned Flanders,"not that convenience store crap, is it? because i don't feed that to my dogs."
52963,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm convinced. the house stays!"
53518,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's not you talkin'. that's the honey-mustard dressing!"
54311,Ned Flanders,coggily-doggily.
53809,Ned Flanders,"well, mel, they're swell."
54582,Ned Flanders,"you know, that's exactly what i --"
54370,Ned Flanders,"edna, i'm not one for costumes, but i sure do like that feather in your hair."
52753,Ned Flanders,"relax, homer, i keep tellin' ya, you're my guest."
53017,Ned Flanders,"oh, well, i'll just have to try harder! oops, thanks for dropping by."
54492,Ned Flanders,"ah, just snowflakes on my mustache."
53661,Ned Flanders,"there's a stranger in the manger and his name is love take it, homer!"
52966,Ned Flanders,"y'know, i like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
53588,Ned Flanders,"okay, i've got two of every animal. but only males -- i don't want any hanky-panky. hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
53716,Ned Flanders,"well this is one dilly of a daily, lisa. can't wait for tomorrow's!"
52983,Ned Flanders,"y'know, it's kinda funny. the only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. they're all we have left."
53472,Ned Flanders,whoa! where's everyone going? what's wrong?
54241,Ned Flanders,"oh boy, that laugh is infectious. ha!... ha!... that's fun!"
54298,Ned Flanders,"well, looks like it's time for another ""'end of the walk' talk with homer and ned."" tonight's topic: ""the niceness of the evening."""
53224,Ned Flanders,"you know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
53780,Ned Flanders,"well, we could use a new h.q. for the springfield philharmonic. they're playing gustav mahler in abject squalor."
53975,Ned Flanders,"hey, can i give you folks a lift?"
53893,Ned Flanders,evolution?!
54516,Ned Flanders,"well, you may be right!"
54273,Ned Flanders,"you've been with a lot of men, but i forgive you!"
52705,Ned Flanders,hello? hello? hellodilly-odilly?
53682,Ned Flanders,here come sandwiches / here come sandwiches / right down boozy bum lane...
52620,Ned Flanders,roger-dodger.
54565,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? by working together, we can both be winners. thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. put 'er there, pal."
52892,Ned Flanders,"no, that ain't gonna do it."
52788,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
53719,Ned Flanders,"just wriggle loose. i'll catch ya, li'l critter!"
53247,Ned Flanders,what the flood?!
53436,Ned Flanders,"no, n-n-no i know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
52660,Ned Flanders,"oh bart, you met grandma flanders. hope she didn't scare ya."
53330,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're right. i've just got to work through the grief. there's not gonna be an easy answer."
52567,Ned Flanders,"all right, homer."
53037,Ned Flanders,"homer, i've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. y'know, maude and her mother were visiting tyre and sidon, the twin cities of the holy land. they must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
54523,Ned Flanders,"my pleasure, study buddy."
52611,Ned Flanders,... so recycling is our way of giving mother earth a great big hug.
52687,Ned Flanders,"well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
53396,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's not how it..."
53577,Ned Flanders,okely dokely.
54373,Ned Flanders,"no, it's still where you buried it."
54513,Ned Flanders,"doing a little yard work, huh?"
53636,Ned Flanders,"well, siegfried and roy create a lot of illusions, but i doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
54386,Ned Flanders,sure!
54085,Ned Flanders,"lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
53967,Ned Flanders,greed!
53940,Ned Flanders,"okay, ""smallville""... super dog licks himself. that definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
53955,Ned Flanders,welcome to heck house! you're about to discover what a life of sin will get you!
54280,Ned Flanders,no more distractions. i have work to do.
52982,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, everyone's alive. guess that's something to be thankful for."
53645,Ned Flanders,it says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. and that's good enough for me.
53848,Ned Flanders,"au contraire, man with no hair! you see, rod and todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
53259,Ned Flanders,i think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
53051,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge, i... i appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... well, they... they're a lot worse."
53122,Ned Flanders,"oh ho, i'm afraid i played a dirty part in this little charade."
54177,Ned Flanders,i've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of noah's ark!
53273,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that looks scrum-diddly-doodly-duddly --"
53350,Ned Flanders,"lord, i never question you... but i've been wondering if your decision to take maude was, well, wrong... unless this is part of your divine plan... could you just give me some kinda sign? anything? and after all that church chocolate i bought. which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. well, i've had it."
53065,Ned Flanders,"ex... ex... excuse me, sir? i think you've got my tv. sir?"
53465,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, i think you're beautiful."
53585,Ned Flanders,"lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the flanderses. wherever we are, you'll have your church. are you with me, boys?"
54530,Ned Flanders,and then i turn into a snarling beast. talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
54422,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to..."
52675,Ned Flanders,"hi-ho pagans! new years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
52906,Ned Flanders,can i come?
52573,Ned Flanders,"say, todd, i want to talk to your uncle homer. you're head of the car till i get back."
53002,Ned Flanders,"what do we have here? the long, flabby arm of the law. the last case you got to the bottom of was a case of mallomars."
53282,Ned Flanders,"we-ell, morning, apu. how are the little blessings?"
53356,Ned Flanders,ohhhhh.
53861,Ned Flanders,...and lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve / and cream and crimson and silver and rose / and azure and lemon and russet and grey...
53134,Ned Flanders,8:45?! here i am yappin' away like it's 8:35. don't forget the mints.
54250,Ned Flanders,you have the energy for one more?
52589,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! this little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. now that i've saved the earth, maybe i oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
54274,Ned Flanders,i guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
54586,Ned Flanders,"well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. but sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
54230,Ned Flanders,did a volcano erupt in candyland? 'cause i just caught me a flyin' red hot!
54160,Ned Flanders,you come all the way to jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
53083,Ned Flanders,do you have a problem with the way i'm coaching?
52903,Ned Flanders,"well, i expect that type of language at denny's, but not here."
52709,Ned Flanders,"now, just breathe into him every three seconds. make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
53493,Ned Flanders,"so, did you boys have a good time?"
54454,Ned Flanders,"pray for a miracle, boy! god can hear you better from up there!"
53765,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just call you friend. here's your tape... friend."
53365,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi bart. how much this time?"
53146,Ned Flanders,"oh, now roddy, it's just a stuck ball. i'll get it."
53257,Ned Flanders,we got that tip at the chuck garabedian mega-savings seminar.
54421,Ned Flanders,no! you can't! if i'm not as good as you... then i'm horrible!
53808,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's better."
54580,Ned Flanders,"hey, you easy. now, get off my property! off!"
53069,Ned Flanders,"ralph, you'll be on special teams."
53751,Ned Flanders,i don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...
54456,Ned Flanders,"can i help you, stranger?"
53387,Ned Flanders,"hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow business?"
52654,Ned Flanders,"well, gee, i..."
53184,Ned Flanders,"no, i got it."
53853,Ned Flanders,please change me back! this bumble bee has developed an unhealthy obsession with me.
53951,Ned Flanders,so it is! i'm just here to pay the fine for the sunday school bus. you towed it with the kids still in it!
53539,Ned Flanders,"oh, let's just take it from the top."
52943,Ned Flanders,maude? boys? come on up! we're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
53332,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but i feel like i've turned a corner."
52533,Ned Flanders,"au contraire, simpson! it has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
52624,Ned Flanders,"here, marge, let me. hate to be an armchair blanche, but i always gave it one of these..."
53377,Ned Flanders,"""they're controlling our minds with flu shots?!"" i knew it. well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
53852,Ned Flanders,ow! my flander-doodles!
54046,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer, i'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds."
53519,Ned Flanders,this is going right to the orphanage.
52947,Ned Flanders,"now they're trying it as a maritime offense. so anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? free of charge."
53089,Ned Flanders,"hey-hey there, marge. just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
53213,Ned Flanders,"for the last time, no!"
53771,Ned Flanders,"now i must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
53984,Ned Flanders,okily dokily!
52915,Ned Flanders,into death.
53426,Ned Flanders,"i'd love to get together, but tomorrow i've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
54005,Ned Flanders,"homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
54119,Ned Flanders,"top of the mornin', homer."
53833,Ned Flanders,"now coach, i've tried to be christian and respectful, but i guess i'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. legally, i still own this house."
54581,Ned Flanders,"ohhh. i wanted to subscribe to that new arts and crafts channel. well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? he offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
53053,Ned Flanders,boys... there's a call here for you...
53050,Ned Flanders,"uh, excuse me, fellas... i... i couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. if possible."
53466,Ned Flanders,"ohh, what can i get you, little christian? how 'bout a noah's ark of jellies?"
54195,Ned Flanders,blind spot?! mecca?!
53299,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, i..."
53652,Ned Flanders,i bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
53107,Ned Flanders,"uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
53097,Ned Flanders,i guess it is sorta cute...
53945,Ned Flanders,imploring people i never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. that's what i'm doing!
53933,Ned Flanders,why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
54182,Ned Flanders,ahem!
53738,Ned Flanders,press... destruct... button.
53606,Ned Flanders,yep. why would that twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
54436,Ned Flanders,"well, the good news is it forced us all to church."
53908,Ned Flanders,stop praying to that stork!
53006,Ned Flanders,i attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. i'd like to commit myself.
53830,Ned Flanders,"that tears it! boys, put on your goody two-shoes. we're moving back to springfield!"
54240,Ned Flanders,"and you're a former mrs. so, uh... where's your husband buried?"
52587,Ned Flanders,"ohh, would ya look at that?"
53421,Ned Flanders,"uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, rachel. w-well what do you know? we both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
52583,Ned Flanders,"yes, sir!"
54164,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you know why i'm a christian?"
54344,Ned Flanders,this could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. can you handle rod and todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
54356,Ned Flanders,"hey, the simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. what do you say, sweetie?"
53594,Ned Flanders,do i! no i don't. but i can have 'em here by tuesday.
53359,Ned Flanders,i-i recently lost my wife.
52747,Ned Flanders,ned flanders...
53056,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're leaving! the ordeal is over!"
53794,Ned Flanders,"you like 'em, huh? come on, i'll show you the other three hundred."
53981,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, shoot! shoot!"
53729,Ned Flanders,quit whackin' my barrel!
54506,Ned Flanders,this one's mine. and this one's mine. this one's mine... and this--
54478,Ned Flanders,"i learned that left is called ""port""!"
54485,Ned Flanders,homer! this is my freezerino.
54089,Ned Flanders,"well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. but i love 'em. and, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. hope you don't mind."
53889,Ned Flanders,the 'n' word!
52604,Ned Flanders,"no, i-i came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
52633,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, i heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
53836,Ned Flanders,"well, you've gotta take it back!"
53297,Ned Flanders,feels like i'm wearing nothin' at all!
52760,Ned Flanders,"now, boys, mr. simpson is the guest. he gets to decide what to watch."
54371,Ned Flanders,homer! homer! it's a miracle!
54398,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! this is a clip-on!"
53891,Ned Flanders,"roddy, get down! you're gonna fall!"
53947,Ned Flanders,hey homer!
53308,Ned Flanders,"ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor..."
54033,Ned Flanders,"thanks, but... what are you holding on to?"
53271,Ned Flanders,"""discotheques,"" ""frat houses,"" ""malibu."" nothing about satellite fires!"
54070,Ned Flanders,"when i was putting new insulation in your attic, i slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
52984,Ned Flanders,"lookin' good, rod. lookin' good."
53763,Ned Flanders,one hundred dollars and fifty cents!
53276,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish. you see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
53253,Ned Flanders,"evening, neighbor. low on funds again?"
53607,Ned Flanders,"well sir, that's very encouraging but i can't date a movie star. i'm no arthur miller or lyle lovett."
53112,Ned Flanders,"ahh, of course! this must be where he dropped the dagger. and this is the butler's pantry where mrs. astor concealed herself. and right here's where they found the torso heap! in front of our very own fireplace!"
53684,Ned Flanders,where the h-e-c-k is everybody?
53046,Ned Flanders,"...well, i... i think i may be coveting my own wife..."
52866,Ned Flanders,yes. eat all of our shirts.
53911,Ned Flanders,as familiar as it's proper to be.
53732,Ned Flanders,what have i done? i've changed the future for the worse.
52939,Ned Flanders,you ever operated a power boat?
52656,Ned Flanders,"sure, you can borrow it for a little while."
53802,Ned Flanders,"you poor thing! i've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. girls, welcome to your very own ned and breakfast."
54488,Ned Flanders,"well, i felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
53985,Ned Flanders,"ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- i don't think so."
53640,Ned Flanders,this is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. i better talk this over with the big man.
52816,Ned Flanders,put you away for good.
52875,Ned Flanders,"no, son. no sirree, bob."
52722,Ned Flanders,now what happened to that gosh darn map i brought?
54379,Ned Flanders,"i just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""the feud network"" to ""comity central."""
54354,Ned Flanders,pause the assembly! i have to talk to my wife!
53663,Ned Flanders,"why thank you, homer. it's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
53683,Ned Flanders,brother ned's got cheese on bread / and a side order of shame...
54174,Ned Flanders,hot cocoa?
54444,Ned Flanders,"reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
52819,Ned Flanders,"all right. it's true. i am a murderer. i over-watered maude's favorite ficus plant, i panicked, and then i buried the remains. i was hoping to replace it before you got home."
53628,Ned Flanders,noooo!
54139,Ned Flanders,"y'know, our bible study group is going to the holy land next month. i'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
52807,Ned Flanders,but you rang my...
53656,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. but it looks like you're missin' a piece."
53743,Ned Flanders,"oh, you stupid son-of-a..."
53546,Ned Flanders,"well, nice work, inspector find-it. did you catch the thief?"
53890,Ned Flanders,"uno?! that's a gateway game to pinochle. all diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
54108,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. i found out rod watched a commercial for ""grey's anatomy,"" and todd took a full day to tell me."
52605,Ned Flanders,"look homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. so, i don't want to be hard on you... but i just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
54121,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, it looks like your dad is a quotable notable."
53781,Ned Flanders,hey homer!
52702,Ned Flanders,"aww, isn't that cute? he's trying to claw my eyes out."
54473,Ned Flanders,"well, look who's back."
53637,Ned Flanders,"sara, i hate to say it, but your top's upstaging the pops!"
52824,Ned Flanders,"okay, everybody. let's see some big smiles."
52967,Ned Flanders,"oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
53111,Ned Flanders,this is the murder house?!
53058,Ned Flanders,tell maude i want a fancy funeral. big coffin. lotsa jewels.
54217,Ned Flanders,"excuse me! with all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
54319,Ned Flanders,"now, i like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but i do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
53460,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, i'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
53013,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll be darn-diddly-arned."
52821,Ned Flanders,"hey, why that sounds like gabriel's trumpet. you know what that means, kids?"
53969,Ned Flanders,and this is where sinners spend all of eternity!
54178,Ned Flanders,maybe. but i feel a little like i'm the tom voyeur to these huckleberry sinners.
52831,Ned Flanders,"well sorry, the shelter's kinda full."
54031,Ned Flanders,i forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
54477,Ned Flanders,should we do something?
53121,Ned Flanders,"well, this is my rumpus room."
52891,Ned Flanders,jes... ? jes... ? don't you kids know anything? the serpent of rehaboam? the well of zohassadar? the bridal feast of beth chadruharazzeb?
53698,Ned Flanders,"it'd be my pleasure, homer!"
53638,Ned Flanders,"sara, i love ya, but i get the feeling you're just... not a ned-head tonight. is something wrong?"
53943,Ned Flanders,"god's least favorite word, uttered on the public airwaves!"
54015,Ned Flanders,not bad.
53524,Ned Flanders,bring it in!
53512,Ned Flanders,"well, ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
52832,Ned Flanders,wait!
54490,Ned Flanders,christmas is my busy season. sold three pairs of scissors this month! two came back.
52642,Ned Flanders,"homer, god didn't set your house on fire."
54202,Ned Flanders,"i never wanted to turn into big brother. i just wanted to be little sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
54572,Ned Flanders,"simpson, what a pleasant surprise. we were just pulling taffy."
52986,Ned Flanders,"but reverend, i need to know. is god punishing me?"
53570,Ned Flanders,"oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
54143,Ned Flanders,"okay, let's just put it to a vote."
53711,Ned Flanders,"now now, remember why we're here: to celebrate jasper's birthday."
52995,Ned Flanders,"was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
53659,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, writing a new christmas carol?"
53110,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi, marge. heh-heh. guess we gave you quite a start. we were painting todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. must've dozed off."
53922,Ned Flanders,"i... uh... i got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... i'll just pay it."
53814,Ned Flanders,"the bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" but all i got was a bunch of soggy bread."
53274,Ned Flanders,"a rude frenchman? well, i never!"
53510,Ned Flanders,"well, christmas is coming, huh?"
52864,Ned Flanders,"well, a friendly springfield hello there, neighbors. i, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
53369,Ned Flanders,"actually, homer, you and i worship the same god, so..."
54509,Ned Flanders,"how do you like my new wheels, simpson?"
53559,Ned Flanders,"boy, that's jim dandy roof candy! i'd love to come over some time and watch that church channel."
53877,Ned Flanders,what's this?
53936,Ned Flanders,"now bart, stay humble! your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head."
53601,Ned Flanders,well i've got a date with a girl with no name / it sure feels good to be back in the game / at dessert maybe i can ask her her name / 'cause i can't pray for her without the right name...
53202,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm, i'm workin' on that."
53647,Ned Flanders,"well, and you will. right after the wedding."
52953,Ned Flanders,'bye-diddly-i.
52606,Ned Flanders,what's wrong with my moustache?
54504,Ned Flanders,"ow. oh, simpson, it's you."
54048,Ned Flanders,"goodnight, marge."
54153,Ned Flanders,bleh! bleh! bleh!
54080,Ned Flanders,wha? who's that?
53957,Ned Flanders,welcome to eternal darnation!
54203,Ned Flanders,that's the worst sin of all for some reason! what can i do to make things right?
53014,Ned Flanders,it sure did-diddly-id.
54267,Ned Flanders,"well homer, you really put one over on old stupid flanders, here. thanks a lot, neighbor."
52578,Ned Flanders,no it's not.
54302,Ned Flanders,what the? i've been using that around the boys!
53368,Ned Flanders,"oh, all right. but only because you haven't outed rod and todd."
52622,Ned Flanders,you're a dame and i'm a fella.
54395,Ned Flanders,funyuns?! little debbies?!
54324,Ned Flanders,"name's ned flanders, credits include jesus in the passion play last year, jesus in the passion play the year before that, jesus, jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be -- you guessed it, st. peter..."
54087,Ned Flanders,folks...
54563,Ned Flanders,"mercy is for the weak, todd."
54117,Ned Flanders,and she's teleconferencing the devil using that computer from hell!
54082,Ned Flanders,because your father lives with me now.
53867,Ned Flanders,"i'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, marge. our last babysitter let 'em watch ""comedy central"", now rod makes me check the closet every night for rita rudner."
52837,Ned Flanders,okay.
54428,Ned Flanders,"you wanna hit me. well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
52985,Ned Flanders,"reverend lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- uh, i... i kinda feel like job."
53885,Ned Flanders,i don't want you watching my boys ever again!
54293,Ned Flanders,hell! damn! backside! nothing matters anymore! i'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
53084,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. half a brain, huh? well, you know what? it sounds like you just volunteered!"
54183,Ned Flanders,"i spy, with my electronic eye, illegal wagering!"
53907,Ned Flanders,there's no such thing as storks! it's all god!
54527,Ned Flanders,"simpson, i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to leave. i hope you understand."
53822,Ned Flanders,can i start yesterday?
54102,Ned Flanders,one cran-bran for the flan-man.
54305,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, she went crazy. crazier than sleeping in on a sunday."
54288,Ned Flanders,really?
54553,Ned Flanders,"all right, and if todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! and do a decent job of it, for a change!"
54414,Ned Flanders,"""life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
53749,Ned Flanders,"i can't run, i'm wearing flip-flops!"
54381,Ned Flanders,"hey, neighbor, your welcome mat's lookin' a little dusty."
52685,Ned Flanders,"no, ned flanders."
54435,Ned Flanders,noooo!
53575,Ned Flanders,"well, whatever i've got i owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. plus a little prayer now and then."
54548,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, i'm not a betting man."
54378,Ned Flanders,"to be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief."
52956,Ned Flanders,"pays for itself after the 16th visit. you know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. but i do. now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
53402,Ned Flanders,can't let this little doozy get out.
54111,Ned Flanders,"marge, that dinner was a winner! what's for dessert?"
52618,Ned Flanders,"oh, indeedily-doodily. i've even been in ""streetcar"" once before. i played blanche dubois! hmmm huh. just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
54296,Ned Flanders,could this get any worse?
53422,Ned Flanders,"so, uh, uh, where's your band?"
54446,Ned Flanders,none taken.
53824,Ned Flanders,i'll see what i can do.
54374,Ned Flanders,here it is. the holy ooze.
52946,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. i was all set to go off on vacation, when i get called up for jury duty. oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
54151,Ned Flanders,"yes, but it means more to you."
53161,Ned Flanders,"no, no, and double-no! i haven't done any of those things, folks. you name it, i haven't done it!"
53672,Ned Flanders,oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. the only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. what these boys need is adult supervision.
54074,Ned Flanders,the rent check is late.
53983,Ned Flanders,"as the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. i spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these hardy boys books."
53541,Ned Flanders,"doo-da, doo-da..."
52944,Ned Flanders,"open the door, maude! i don't have time for the secret knock!"
53379,Ned Flanders,"oh, no! i could never support the black arts."
53779,Ned Flanders,"well now roddy, the lord wouldn't let us die this way."
53747,Ned Flanders,"well, my roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
54228,Ned Flanders,"it wasn't me, boys! it was the train!"
53309,Ned Flanders,"ah, yeah, i, i couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
53561,Ned Flanders,and bless your humble home.
52693,Ned Flanders,"maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
54495,Ned Flanders,"well that curled my lashes, but good for you."
52684,Ned Flanders,"now, marge, don't you worry. we've all had our brushes with the law."
53278,Ned Flanders,"ooo, better pick up the pace."
53394,Ned Flanders,just like the one that saved ezekiel!
53321,Ned Flanders,you monster!
54449,Ned Flanders,i'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
53757,Ned Flanders,they warned me satan would be attractive. let's go.
54309,Ned Flanders,"oh no, ""games"" stands for gathering of american messengers for evangelical sports!"
52781,Ned Flanders,"i told you, officer. i'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
52933,Ned Flanders,"howdy, reverend lovejoy. nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog."
54252,Ned Flanders,"that's right, i'm down to my wife-blesser."
53201,Ned Flanders,here comes that vomit again.
52762,Ned Flanders,wait a second. you're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
53918,Ned Flanders,"well, i wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, lisa."
54329,Ned Flanders,"lord, forgive me for my pride. all-wise, as always, you have rightly raised homer above me."
53102,Ned Flanders,unless you can give me a reason not to?
53812,Ned Flanders,the whole town is laughing at me behind my back. i guess you're the only real friend i have.
52748,Ned Flanders,"oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so i can report it on my income tax?"
53775,Ned Flanders,"yeah. i made a great film, but i'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. i'm like michael moore, except i'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and god loves me. i just wish i could find some way to spread my message."
54579,Ned Flanders,"i should box your ears you, you, you... you sneaky pete!"
52716,Ned Flanders,"okilly dokilly. now, our annual father-son rafting trip is next weekend."
54133,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! you are the most infuriating, netflix-d.v.d.-burgling, barbecue-not-putting-out..."
52609,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, ya know, i owe you one, buddy. no sooner had i shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
52732,Ned Flanders,"thank you, homer, i dunno what got--"
54569,Ned Flanders,"oh my, lisa was wonderful. she certainly's come a long way with her fingering."
54284,Ned Flanders,"peter, andrew, james the greater, james the lesser, john, philip, thaddeus!"
53388,Ned Flanders,i never had a snowplow business.
52768,Ned Flanders,"how are my boys doin', homer?"
54290,Ned Flanders,you made a killer out of me!
54385,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, the lord wouldn't have placed his meter there if he didn't want me to park."
53871,Ned Flanders,"um, one box?"
54184,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
53990,Ned Flanders,"look homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our lord, who came back as bread. that's it."
54556,Ned Flanders,there you go.
54237,Ned Flanders,"...y'know, i wouldn't mind homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
54403,Ned Flanders,that's the plug for the light!
52629,Ned Flanders,aren't you being a little hard on old homie?
53193,Ned Flanders,"how do you do it, homer? how do you silence that little voice that says, ""think""?"
54246,Ned Flanders,"edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but i'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
54141,Ned Flanders,the old city. where b.c. turned into a.d.! let's go!
52938,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
53244,Ned Flanders,homer!
53797,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't take money from a neighbor. although, business at the leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
54425,Ned Flanders,"come on, people! you're safe as sunday with me. i wouldn't hurt a fly!"
53821,Ned Flanders,this town is sweeter than a cake made of pie. even the dogs curb themselves.
54505,Ned Flanders,"oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
53845,Ned Flanders,"okily-dokily, here's some french roast, now i'll go make toast."

54268,Ned Flanders,no. just plain neighbor.
53697,Ned Flanders,"""and the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, i bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
54028,Ned Flanders,i figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at lisa's recital.
53998,Ned Flanders,what the?
53713,Ned Flanders,"well, that's good too, i guess."
53576,Ned Flanders,"homer, please don't sue the church. i'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
52648,Ned Flanders,"thank you, plow king-a-lee-ding."
53358,Ned Flanders,"uh, that was a lovely song. it really got to me."

53840,Ned Flanders,"oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. like the jews with their snippity-snip."
53566,Ned Flanders,"now rainier, i really don't think it's right to sell these playdude centerfolds."

52965,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
53724,Ned Flanders,"uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
54534,Ned Flanders,love thy neighbor.
52721,Ned Flanders,"i guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
53671,Ned Flanders,of course i am. they were bigger than jesus! but your boy went yoko and broke up my collection.
53267,Ned Flanders,"sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
52934,Ned Flanders,"better get the ol' snow shovel back from homer, huh?"
52860,Ned Flanders,that's a good one.

53114,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge? still got that deposit check?"
53348,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, maybe i'll call you again."
54525,Ned Flanders,"ah, kids can be a trial sometimes."
52634,Ned Flanders,"homer, christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. hey, dig this."
54035,Ned Flanders,...abraham became the father of isaac. isaac became the father of jacob. jacob became the father of judah and his brothers. judah became the father of perez and zerah by tamar.
52820,Ned Flanders,"huh? well, now that i can't explain."
52918,Ned Flanders,"so if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the hibbert table. pronto."

54251,Ned Flanders,"oh, what the heck. i know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a ken burns documentary, but you're that special."
52849,Ned Flanders,"""'zounds"" is a renaissance english word, short for ""god's wounds."" but uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure flanders!"
54387,Ned Flanders,goes with the sugar!
54412,Ned Flanders,i know what i must do.
54159,Ned Flanders,that's it. i'm losin' it. i'm losin' it!
53900,Ned Flanders,"oh, fine. take the cut."

53595,Ned Flanders,"why, you are gorgeous."
53189,Ned Flanders,"aw, leave me out of this, homer. games of chance are strictly forbidden by deuteronomy seven--"
52764,Ned Flanders,"homer, i-i'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night i do my charity work."
53417,Ned Flanders,"i didn't have a ""crush"" on her."
54162,Ned Flanders,"please, you've gotta let me back in. i sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
53755,Ned Flanders,why don't you just call out for hawk man?
54541,Ned Flanders,"all right! this will be fun! oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
52896,Ned Flanders,"until this, i never thought homer and marge were bad parents. but now i know you kids need a less hellbound family."
52853,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is a dilly of a pickle."
53452,Ned Flanders,"now the thing is, i don't have a lot of money..."
54235,Ned Flanders,"bart simpson? why, he lives right next door to me! yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."

53296,Ned Flanders,"well, it allows for maximum mobility."
53750,Ned Flanders,"help me out, homer. my little roddy needs his insulin. breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."

53929,Ned Flanders,"start 'er up, boys!"
52992,Ned Flanders,it's a miracle!
52630,Ned Flanders,let's not and say we did.
52683,Ned Flanders,oh...the network slogan is true. watch fox and be damned for all eternity.
53061,Ned Flanders,amen.
54500,Ned Flanders,she's right. we thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. but we were scathed! those free ginger ales at the casino... i didn't declare them on my taxes!
54071,Ned Flanders,"so, unless you have anything else for me..."
52834,Ned Flanders,"well sir, sounds fair. toodle-oo, everybody. i'll, i'll scream when the comet gets here."

53264,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho! why bother, baby? one smoke detector's enough for mad dog. now let's hit the sack."
52997,Ned Flanders,"well, i've seen about enough."
54575,Ned Flanders,"oh, are you sure? we got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
53818,Ned Flanders,"""made in humbleton, pa."" i don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that i bought at a garage sale. but corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
54231,Ned Flanders,"you know, i don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. anyhoo, so i don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."

53860,Ned Flanders,how i love my coat of many colors / it was red and yellow and green and brown / and scarlet and black and ochre and peach / and ruby and olive and violet and fawn...
52785,Ned Flanders,"oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! he's annoying. he's very, very annoying!"
54312,Ned Flanders,"sure is! that's why after homer accidentally killed edna, i married maude's ghost!"
53511,Ned Flanders,homer!
54300,Ned Flanders,"y'know, i knew a backstabbin' buckeye named roz at bible camp. twice as tall as she should've been."
53228,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, reverend? it's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'."
53401,Ned Flanders,"we'll just see about that-- uh-oh. well, maybe he made a mistake-- nope. it's airtight."
52669,Ned Flanders,"hey homie, i can see your doodle!"
53099,Ned Flanders,"oooo, that's a dilly. how 'bout it, marge?"
53485,Ned Flanders,"hey, your hair's grown back real nice."
54498,Ned Flanders,am i hearing this right? is the church council truly considering... gambling?
54086,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... interesting."
53011,Ned Flanders,"oh, sure. i was a good little boy."
54322,Ned Flanders,"homer, when am i gettin' my power drill back?"
52657,Ned Flanders,"we'll take good care of your boy, simpson. enjoy the miracle of creation."
53009,Ned Flanders,"uh, actually, i'm a little chilly. could i have another straitjacket?"
53158,Ned Flanders,"i suppose, if you must know... i'm... well, i'm... i'm sixty."
53432,Ned Flanders,"cold, huh?"
52893,Ned Flanders,jeepers h. crackers! i'd better call the reverend!
52914,Ned Flanders,homer's passing...away.
54404,Ned Flanders,please don't use that word in bed.
53793,Ned Flanders,"he scampered out of parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
53138,Ned Flanders,"uh, listen homer, ah, hate to be a fussy freddy and all, but maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
53301,Ned Flanders,"you saw ""ben-hur"" without me?"
54517,Ned Flanders,"couldn't help overhearing, simpson. i've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
54057,Ned Flanders,lock onto his wiener.
54353,Ned Flanders,"so after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
53718,Ned Flanders,"come on, ned. just because you foresaw dr. hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. it was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
52843,Ned Flanders,lucky i always keep a bible close to my heart.
53538,Ned Flanders,"hey, hey, now hold on there. the nice people want to hear the real words."
52544,Ned Flanders,"no, i kid you not. here's the noose i had to wear for ten years."
52871,Ned Flanders,"hey, kids! nachos, flanders-style! that's cucumbers with cottage cheese."
54276,Ned Flanders,i started drinking orange juice with pulp! i asked the reverend and he said it was okay. then he hung right up on me. that man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
53722,Ned Flanders,well i didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
53534,Ned Flanders,"well, okay... i, i guess it would go something like this: all right, simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
54437,Ned Flanders,church!
53462,Ned Flanders,"morning, kent. our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. we're gonna show springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
53229,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers!"
53925,Ned Flanders,isn't this your posse on this glossy?
53660,Ned Flanders,"well, the bible says it's fun to do stuff together."
54053,Ned Flanders,"what a charming single entendre. now look, i know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
52740,Ned Flanders,"what do you think, reverend?"
53034,Ned Flanders,"they're not perfect, but the lord says love thy neighbor --"
52565,Ned Flanders,"twenty? homer, i paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
54543,Ned Flanders,"so, my little bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?"
53085,Ned Flanders,"good luck, homer. no hard feelin's."
53565,Ned Flanders,you betcha! this kiosk sells personalized movies. i had one made starring little rod.
52784,Ned Flanders,stop it! breathe through your damn mouth!
53088,Ned Flanders,"oh, we can work this out, friends. in the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
53208,Ned Flanders,"well, do something! this is all your fault. you and your stupid program."
53126,Ned Flanders,oops! that's for me. flancrest enterprises is my home business.
53319,Ned Flanders,"oh, wasn't she? thank you, moe. i appreciate that."
53172,Ned Flanders,stop that! will you help me or not?
54090,Ned Flanders,i think you should. the court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
53349,Ned Flanders,"well, i just can't relate to the women of today, homer. ah, it's probably me. i'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
54470,Ned Flanders,"i told you, the only dancing i like is ""square."""
53783,Ned Flanders,i was wrong!
53625,Ned Flanders,"well, i can't see the harm."
54278,Ned Flanders,"springfield. my home town. pretty little place. although, even the garden of eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
52842,Ned Flanders,is that so? well gee... maybe the old flandersmobile could use a...
53192,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o. one betting disk please."
53786,Ned Flanders,"uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
52543,Ned Flanders,"as of friday, i'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
53384,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just reimburse you right n-- wait a minute. this seems an awful lot like that movie, ""paper moon."""
53220,Ned Flanders,"well, not, not my cup of..."
53615,Ned Flanders,yep. now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of scrabble.
53593,Ned Flanders,"oh, i should say not. i gave up on l.a. when those tv people made that poor nun fly. all those puerto ricans lookin' up her dress. that's not right."
52845,Ned Flanders,"now, maude, in our movie, you lay baby moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. okay? lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- action jackson!"
53760,Ned Flanders,"no, no, it's home-brewed."
53935,Ned Flanders,"this is it, boys -- one more out and we go to the championship game. let's do it for groundskeeper willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
54457,Ned Flanders,that sounds salty but you seem sweet. i'm gonna call you kettle corn!
52836,Ned Flanders,"i might go mad with fear out there, so todd, i want you to shoot daddy if he tries to get back in."
53927,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've never seen you like this before."
53805,Ned Flanders,i got phi beta cappuccinos for ned's pre-meds!
52962,Ned Flanders,"that's dignity, all right."
53000,Ned Flanders,"oh, okay ""dude."" i wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""man."" here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
52859,Ned Flanders,yeah.
53186,Ned Flanders,"oh, when i wanna laugh, i'll take bob saget, thank you very much."
54189,Ned Flanders,buttocks!
53117,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho. no problem, marge. oh."
54367,Ned Flanders,"gambling, eh? satan's most potent recruiting tool!"
53080,Ned Flanders,what?! what is it?!
54287,Ned Flanders,"yes, lord."
53573,Ned Flanders,that cuts the mustard with me.
53057,Ned Flanders,help! what do i do?!
54076,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is good."
53198,Ned Flanders,"oh my goodness, homer. wake up!"
53703,Ned Flanders,"well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. if so, then i guess i'm just a cave man. if they existed, which they didn't!"
53589,Ned Flanders,"well, sea captain, looks like you and i are sailin' solo tonight."
54017,Ned Flanders,"lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
53211,Ned Flanders,oh no!
54418,Ned Flanders,"homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause i'm on the level. punch me."
52854,Ned Flanders,"no, no. the pta has not disbanded."
52826,Ned Flanders,"now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. a nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
52566,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer, be reasonable."
54533,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i'm sorry to bother you at this hour but i threw a man out of my house today. i feel like i've violated matthew 19:19."
54402,Ned Flanders,not praying to superman!
54088,Ned Flanders,i'm afraid you can't live here.
53735,Ned Flanders,i gotta find homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
54132,Ned Flanders,i'll handle this.
54522,Ned Flanders,"heh, heh. this is a tasty little lager that came all the way from holland."
54564,Ned Flanders,"it's okay, son. you can recover."
52733,Ned Flanders,diddily.
52945,Ned Flanders,"well, now realistically, homer, i've lived here some 30-odd years. this is the first and only bear i've ever seen."
53177,Ned Flanders,"so, what happens next?"
53819,Ned Flanders,the flanders family has pulled up stakes. you have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
52561,Ned Flanders,are you sure you're not interested? two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
53285,Ned Flanders,... can't put a price on a miracle...
52817,Ned Flanders,"what the gumdrops is going on, here?"
53838,Ned Flanders,"marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council. to stuckey's!"
52758,Ned Flanders,"heydilly ho, window buddy. just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
54272,Ned Flanders,"edna, i had a long walk with homer simpson yesterday, and as i was carrying him back home, i had a lot of time to think."
53946,Ned Flanders,first things first!
54068,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i'd better be..."
54256,Ned Flanders,language.
53469,Ned Flanders,i'm maude. god is super!
53442,Ned Flanders,"yeah, just a little shocked. what's that? some kinda sorting machine?"
53849,Ned Flanders,"you betcha! in fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
52668,Ned Flanders,monorail.
53776,Ned Flanders,are you even listening to me?!
54557,Ned Flanders,"good gravy, what have i done?"
53078,Ned Flanders,"yeah. thanks for the tip, homer..."

52588,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens."
53548,Ned Flanders,nobody.
53578,Ned Flanders,why do i always give in to him?
53937,Ned Flanders,"a damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! oil-based!"
53483,Ned Flanders,i've gotta close praiseland down. someone could get hurt.
54065,Ned Flanders,"say homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
53803,Ned Flanders,"here's your room, ladies. you can catch some z's while you earn those degrees."
54209,Ned Flanders,"glad to hear it, thank the holy spirit!"
53188,Ned Flanders,"god homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. rumba! yea, i was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
53789,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, but i promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
54518,Ned Flanders,"say, that's right. this is your first visit to the flanders homestead."
52987,Ned Flanders,"even in my darkest hour, i can turn to the good book for..."
54323,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i'm afraid this is the part of god's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
52548,Ned Flanders,"well, i know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
54417,Ned Flanders,"jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!"
53816,Ned Flanders,"well, toddy, you know how i said our friends are like the canaanites? today i realized they're more like the midianites."
53968,Ned Flanders,and envy!
52936,Ned Flanders,why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? works for me when i get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
52772,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please give me the strength to endure homer simpson's friendship."
52641,Ned Flanders,help! help!
53251,Ned Flanders,"well, this goes right into the old poor box."
53668,Ned Flanders,sin of regret.

54254,Ned Flanders,"pretty funny, homer."
52593,Ned Flanders,"fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. well sir, i gave him three quarters by mistake. took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
52617,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy-do neighbor."
54585,Ned Flanders,"oh, you betcha! you know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
53381,Ned Flanders,"oh, no, homer, remember? maudie got called up to heaven."
53544,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, i've been singing your praises all day. marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
54331,Ned Flanders,/
53934,Ned Flanders,"homer, you've met my parents."
53694,Ned Flanders,"well, actually, i picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
53773,Ned Flanders,but who'd know the difference?
53903,Ned Flanders,excuse me. how can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the bible?
52949,Ned Flanders,"hello, ""mr. brown ground"", whatcha got for me?"
53361,Ned Flanders,"well, that, that sounds real nice, rachel, but a... i'm a... i'm not quite..."
53928,Ned Flanders,"tonight's g-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! and while you enjoy this quiet riot, i'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
