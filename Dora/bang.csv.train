,Speaker,Line
3512,Bernadette,is this more comedy that i don’t understand?
5091,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that."
4099,Bernadette,why didn’t you tell me
4542,Bernadette,"hurry, sheldon and penny were right behind us in the bowling alley."
4649,Bernadette,"like i don’t do enough around here. now i need to pack your lunch? and by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? you’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em."
5038,Bernadette,"i’m not joking, howie. you heard what he said about his parents. it was the little things they kept bottled up. i don’t want that to happen to us."
5648,Bernadette,"okay, i guess i should eat the hell prawn."
5273,Bernadette,"howard, do something."
5533,Bernadette,kind of on sheldon’s bed.
4907,Bernadette,just throw the ball. let’s see what we’re working with.
3535,Bernadette,who are all those people?
5763,Bernadette,"good. call him. wait, i’m not sure i want to know."
5068,Bernadette,just want you to know i didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
4569,Bernadette,"that’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. "
5938,Bernadette,i’m not sad. i just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
5603,Bernadette,you saw him carrying that.
5604,Bernadette,"and, of course, howie and i both want you to be a part of all this."
5189,Bernadette,"sweetie, we have a lot to do. we don’t need to decide this right now."
5622,Bernadette,you all right?
4922,Bernadette,i’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
4609,Bernadette,"oh, you brought beer for everybody."
3819,Bernadette,"come on, howard, i’m going to be your wife. you can share anything with me."
5560,Bernadette,"so, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
5504,Bernadette,"oh, terrific."
4268,Bernadette,i know this wasn’t easy. you doing okay?
4808,Bernadette,where are you going?
3954,Bernadette,"worst part was, it was too big."
5760,Bernadette,"this is ridiculous. the doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, raj knows, his grey’s anatomy online fan group probably knows. is it weird we don’t?"
4018,Bernadette,i don’t know if i want to stay.
5634,Bernadette,yeah.
4858,Bernadette,please. i’m desperate.
4446,Bernadette,that’s more like it.
4414,Bernadette,"thanks. and, sheldon, i know tonight’s the night you eat thai food, so i went to the asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch."
5605,Bernadette,"raj, raj, wait."
4022,Bernadette,you mean my special day?
5879,Bernadette,i couldn’t explain it if i tried.
4816,Bernadette,"well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. and howie doesn’t think i take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while."
4210,Bernadette,"now, kiss me. "
3477,Bernadette,"speaking of underwear, i have some interesting news."
4348,Bernadette,"i don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!"
4103,Bernadette,"i heard. your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls."
5027,Bernadette,he said that to her?
4220,Bernadette,"howie, i know you went to space. i’m incredibly proud of you. but you might want to try and not bring it up every minute."
5382,Bernadette,i know you would.
4607,Bernadette,i’d save that for the second date.
4814,Bernadette,"i gotta go. penny ratted me out. fyi, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet."
6056,Bernadette,is it i’m going to die alone?
4849,Bernadette,"i know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. i don’t think the service is gonna send any more people."
4549,Bernadette,maybe the spot’s the clue.
5236,Bernadette,don’t forget your wallet.
4080,Bernadette,"oh, my god, that’s terrible."
5183,Bernadette,"oh, that’s fine."
4224,Bernadette,i love you.
4946,Bernadette,i’m proud of her. this is a great opportunity. it’s nice to see her take it seriously.
4226,Bernadette,"uh-oh, is someone a little blue? come on, howie, that’s like the funniest thing i’ve ever said in my life. what do you say? you ready to go?"
5387,Bernadette,"oh, nice."
4965,Bernadette,oh. what’s going on?
4281,Bernadette,what’s that supposed to mean?
5932,Bernadette,"i’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer."
4962,Bernadette,would you please close the drapes?
5120,Bernadette,we got embarrassed tonight. come on.
6071,Bernadette,"sorry, you’re not a dork.  look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
4287,Bernadette,he’s not here. what’s wrong?
5049,Bernadette,"and yet, i still love when you hold a door for me."
5486,Bernadette,you’re right. it could totally happen.
5507,Bernadette,"howie, this is just your hypochondria."
4085,Bernadette,"oh, damn. i’m sorry, i can’t make it, but sheldon’s going to go with you! and that’s the last thing you do to him."
4555,Bernadette,"here’s what’s gonna happen. i’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes."
5059,Bernadette,"what? i’m, like, the sweetest person i know. look at me. i should be in a tree baking cookies."
3592,Bernadette,i know. i work here.
3617,Bernadette,"oh, you never were?"
5954,Bernadette,that’s a great idea.
4355,Bernadette,"hold on, who decides who’s worthy? does the hammer decide?"
5078,Bernadette,"oh, my god. i thought everybody liked me, but i’m just a monster."
3626,Bernadette,yeah.
5444,Bernadette,"yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin."
6037,Bernadette,"yeah, eventually. she’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
3740,Bernadette,i would take that deal all day long.
4740,Bernadette,"i think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you."
3636,Bernadette,"oh, i was working with penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and i was just trying to remember if i washed my hands."
6151,Bernadette,howard!
4562,Bernadette,"you mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? no, that would be unethical."
6147,Bernadette,earthquake.
5518,Bernadette,"so, i’m glad you guys are here. there’s something i want to share with you. howie and i are going to…"
3810,Bernadette,you guys ready to order?
4694,Bernadette,hey.
4175,Bernadette,"no, what are they doing?"
5443,Bernadette,do you think sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
4754,Bernadette,i said to stop insulting each other. i didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
4715,Bernadette,"well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. to be honest, i bet howie 200"
3573,Bernadette,i’m going to count to three. one…
4206,Bernadette,it’s just allergies.
4805,Bernadette,"howie, we moved on a long time ago."
4517,Bernadette,this is really strong oestrogen cream. please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
6051,Bernadette,"yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
5277,Bernadette,amy.
5004,Bernadette,right here.
4655,Bernadette,"good idea, i’ll take a picture."
5550,Bernadette,that’s nice.
4742,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s fun up here."
4567,Bernadette,what exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
5965,Bernadette,"if you don’t know how to make lasagna, google does."
5479,Bernadette,i’m sure it was harmless. people flirt. no big deal.
5350,Bernadette,"hey, i thought you were gonna be out late?"
3934,Bernadette,i am the bride.
5158,Bernadette,a two hundred dollar r2-d2 is a business expense?
4170,Bernadette,i had no idea you were unhappy.
4016,Bernadette,who’s siri? is he dating somebody new?
5815,Bernadette,one sec. why did you tell leonard i told you penny was hiding his things?
6134,Bernadette,you don’t know his life.
5861,Bernadette,we showed up too early. we’ll keep you posted.
6070,Bernadette,tammy jo st. cloud.
5107,Bernadette,don’t you think you should make him stop all this?
6006,Bernadette,"yeah, i mean, i’ll miss halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
5116,Bernadette,"okay, i learned my lesson. making fun of people is wrong."
5425,Bernadette,who’s trent?
3772,Bernadette,some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
4225,Bernadette,how do i look?
5336,Bernadette,"you mean, not a scientist?"
3882,Bernadette,"well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
4496,Bernadette,be cool.
5193,Bernadette,how is that fair? you grew up with a table.
4654,Bernadette,what is wrong with you?
5344,Bernadette,he’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
5161,Bernadette,"well, maybe this is what you get for snooping."
6074,Bernadette,so what happens next?
5697,Bernadette,hey. what brings you by?
5102,Bernadette,"you know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens."
6106,Bernadette,we didn’t want you to worry.
5152,Bernadette,what?
4841,Bernadette,"so what? after two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
6015,Bernadette,sounds great.
4493,Bernadette,i was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
4597,Bernadette,why? what are you gonna say?
5743,Bernadette,i don’t know.
4373,Bernadette,"yeah, fill her up. i’ll tell you when to stop."
4598,Bernadette,you because you just called him your indian friend.
3699,Bernadette,nothing. just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
3520,Bernadette,are you kidding? that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
4578,Bernadette,great news. a raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
4257,Bernadette,50 cents sounds right. let’s go.
3637,Bernadette,"it won’t help. once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
5037,Bernadette,what?
4238,Bernadette,plain old howard wolowitz is the best guy i know.
5644,Bernadette,"oh, i haven’t had a drink in months."
3595,Bernadette,"well, whose fault was that?"
4831,Bernadette,i would do it for my mother.
5315,Bernadette,of course.
4346,Bernadette,we were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
4189,Bernadette,"hey, i wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. everything okay?"
4871,Bernadette,"i never thought i’d say this, but penny got a job today."
4291,Bernadette,because i’m the one who had it towed.
4213,Bernadette,"nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going."
4318,Bernadette,saturday night? but i’ve been working late all week. that was gonna be our night.
4587,Bernadette,"howie, stop. come on, look at what i’m making."
4112,Bernadette,what happened? i thought they cancelled your mission.
5238,Bernadette,i have the tool you wanted.
3517,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
4696,Bernadette,"not from you. let’s go, stuart."
3746,Bernadette,i took howard to the beach once. he almost burst into flames like a vampire.
5255,Bernadette,i don’t know.
4307,Bernadette,"hey, dad, maybe you could take howard fishing sometime. give you guys a chance to get to know each other better."
6089,Bernadette,"oh, great."
4756,Bernadette,you excited for texas?
4439,Bernadette,what are you looking at?
5889,Bernadette,not funny.
4618,Bernadette,i do crap for you all the time. get out there.
3949,Bernadette,we should play limbo next. no one beats me at limbo.
3969,Bernadette,did it work?
4942,Bernadette,that sucks.
5650,Bernadette,"thank you for this. you know, ever since people found out i’m having a baby, i feel like i became pregnant bernadette. it was nice to take a little break tonight."
4059,Bernadette,"well, is there anything i could do to help?"
5645,Bernadette,"i storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
6086,Bernadette,"you’re excited about this opportunity, right?"
5669,Bernadette,"oh, stop. you know what’s really happening? all the movies you’ve watched, the tv shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. no one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you."
4830,Bernadette,taking care of your own mother? how can you say that?
4532,Bernadette,"hey, romeo. repair your relationship on your own time."
4391,Bernadette,"why don’t you take her to disneyland? you go on space mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you."
3801,Bernadette,are you concerned your parents might not approve of leonard?
6043,Bernadette,"stop, you’re gonna make me cry."
4212,Bernadette,like my husband?
4836,Bernadette,"come on. the constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. we’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own."
4460,Bernadette,where’d she go?
6126,Bernadette,"it’s okay, i serve soup to poor people!"
5957,Bernadette,"you want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
5302,Bernadette,this party’s weird.
5794,Bernadette,"howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
5713,Bernadette,apple slices? what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald’s and gets fruit?
4367,Bernadette,i make plenty of money. you make peanuts.
3710,Bernadette,what?
4418,Bernadette,show him the closet.
3927,Bernadette,"amy, we’re really sorry."
5613,Bernadette,i’m not hearing anything.
5999,Bernadette,"you’re entitled to feel how you feel. if you don’t like it, you should just talk to her."
3866,Bernadette,i just told him that!
4402,Bernadette,"and i’m dr. rostenkowski wolowitz, and i’m a microbiologist."
5587,Bernadette,should we invite raj?
4956,Bernadette,then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
4467,Bernadette,it turns you on when i sound like raj?
4770,Bernadette,so i guess you two are making it work long distance.
4118,Bernadette,i’ll talk to him. he won’t say no to his little girl.
5694,Bernadette,"from all the dove bars i ate. i’m pregnant. try to keep up. i’m sorry, i have to go find out if my boss knows."
5266,Bernadette,"so, we need to talk."
4540,Bernadette,if you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. unless you got some in yours. big willow.
6080,Bernadette,you might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
6158,Bernadette,"oh, big daddy, i don’t think so. you marry miss bernie, you marry me. we all family now."
4897,Bernadette,i’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
5052,Bernadette,"i love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought."
6137,Bernadette,"howie, stop. i can’t talk like that. amy’s right here."
4293,Bernadette,are you okay?!
5681,Bernadette,howard.
4550,Bernadette,"stop her, leonard, stop her."
4510,Bernadette,your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like howard.
4757,Bernadette,i did. his talk at nasa went great.
3488,Bernadette,a puppy once bit my face.
5162,Bernadette,she sounds really mad.
4660,Bernadette,"hey, penny, can i take that table?"
6159,Bernadette,"don’t be that way. if you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. ooh."
5065,Bernadette,i think i’d rather go.
5339,Bernadette,walk.
5754,Bernadette,what if it’s a girl?
4082,Bernadette,"if you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. i have one, they’re great."
4329,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, raj."
4835,Bernadette,"you know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. this is exactly what it’s gonna be like."
4178,Bernadette,"i don’t know. say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice."
6118,Bernadette,my desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
3759,Bernadette,i will. i will!
5006,Bernadette,slutty.
5977,Bernadette,keep it. consider it a gift.
5663,Bernadette,who’s erno rubik?
6105,Bernadette,which he only did once.
5438,Bernadette,so where do you want to go?
3822,Bernadette,howard’s mother had a heart attack because i have sex with him and she can’t.
6156,Bernadette,busy like i’ll be with the baby if you go to san diego?
6144,Bernadette,"bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. so hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause santa claus is coming tonight. why’d you turn it off?"
4378,Bernadette,and i told you to bite me.
4013,Bernadette,what about me and howard?
3614,Bernadette,"penny, your nails look great."
4536,Bernadette,who cares? focus on the game.
5126,Bernadette,because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
4134,Bernadette,"howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day."
5399,Bernadette,why’d you bring him?
5125,Bernadette,"oh, amelia."
4914,Bernadette,go get ’em.
5095,Bernadette,i think the nicest gifts i’ve got from howie show how well he knows me.
5819,Bernadette,i’m running out of ways to act excited.
5332,Bernadette,"oh, you get used to it. some guys you have to turn down over and over."
4908,Bernadette,throw the damn ball!
4822,Bernadette,how did that get you into science?
5380,Bernadette,"okay, i’ll think about it."
4230,Bernadette,"yeah, well, now you’re a smurf. keep walking."
3776,Bernadette,"well, what makes me the weakest member?"
4580,Bernadette,"oh, calm down. if i had it, i’d be dead already."
5296,Bernadette,good for you.
3947,Bernadette,what are you going to do? doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
5217,Bernadette,keep dreaming.
4615,Bernadette,i’ll help raj in here. why don’t you go keep my dad company?
5276,Bernadette,"no, we totally won."
4704,Bernadette,i can’t believe the waiter thought i was your daughter.
4530,Bernadette,"yeah, i know. its, it’s probably because i grew up with five brothers and sisters so i had to fight for every… oh, my god, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?"
5431,Bernadette,come in.
3715,Bernadette,wrong answer.
4294,Bernadette,don’t move. i’ll get some ice.
4950,Bernadette,what?
4114,Bernadette,what? we’re getting married that sunday.
5642,Bernadette,oh. i like the idea of being tall.
5870,Bernadette,let’s keep thinking.
4994,Bernadette,what? how?
5327,Bernadette,sure. so how can we help?
4076,Bernadette,we believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
4699,Bernadette,"well, that sounds even better."
3497,Bernadette,i’d love some.
4336,Bernadette,"sheldon, you need to talk to alex right away."
6013,Bernadette,meatloaf.
4884,Bernadette,"it’s driving me crazy. just this afternoon, i saw on instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
5624,Bernadette,of course.
5784,Bernadette,is someone else here?
5570,Bernadette,how would you enforce it?
6068,Bernadette,"okay, it’s not like i wanted to be a ventriloquist. i was in beauty pageants and i needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
3624,Bernadette,why are you still hanging out with leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
4785,Bernadette,am i a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
5198,Bernadette,"well, if you can switch champions, so can i. i want raj."
4640,Bernadette,thank you.
4716,Bernadette,see? it’s not just sheldon. they’re all idiots.
6157,Bernadette,how’s she doing?
3767,Bernadette,"oh, i totally want to see sheldon dance. i bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
4174,Bernadette,howard.
4390,Bernadette,we could go to red lobster and talk about it. we’re all thinking it. i just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
5194,Bernadette,"yes, penny plays for me."
6115,Bernadette,let me just put that on vibrate.
5118,Bernadette,"yeah, well, amy writes little house on the prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the internet."
5846,Bernadette,you have a batsuit.
5871,Bernadette,i know.
4690,Bernadette,"oh, that’s terrible. what’s the address?"
4918,Bernadette,"you know, penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. maybe she can practice on you some time."
5211,Bernadette,"okay, okay. when he’s at comic-con, i’m bringing in a wrecking ball."
4564,Bernadette,he said what?
6119,Bernadette,my universe!
4902,Bernadette,i’ll let you know.
5527,Bernadette,doctor said i can’t go in the hot tub.
4949,Bernadette,you’re embarrassing me.
5896,Bernadette,down here.
3677,Bernadette,"wait a minute, a girl like me? what’s that mean?"
4368,Bernadette,"no, here’s how love works. you’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. oh, my god! are you actually thinking about it?"
4272,Bernadette,"aw, crap. let’s go."
4083,Bernadette,it’s not the same thing. sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
5268,Bernadette,yeah.
4958,Bernadette,"come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an australian man’s g-string like a baby kangaroo?"
5115,Bernadette,"no, give me the remote."
5689,Bernadette,no one at the office did. did you tell anyone?
4941,Bernadette,"well, what do you want to do?"
5852,Bernadette,"hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
5817,Bernadette,"still, i can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
3761,Bernadette,yeah. last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
6082,Bernadette,really? he doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
5311,Bernadette,"okay, amy, your turn."
4803,Bernadette,"so, emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?"
3787,Bernadette,"you’ve met lots of astronauts, and i’ve never grilled you about that. i’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
4269,Bernadette,"aw, she’ll be okay. she’s a grown woman."
5759,Bernadette,we don’t want you to know.
5684,Bernadette,okay. i now pronounce you husband and wife. and weird other husband who came with the apartment.
5130,Bernadette,not now!
5394,Bernadette,no. stalkers are creepy. i’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
4853,Bernadette,"howie, i love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, i want a divorce."
3990,Bernadette,"well, seeing as how i make way more money than you anyway, what if i work and you stay home with the kids?"
4887,Bernadette,"hey, amy."
5074,Bernadette,what else don’t i know about?
3723,Bernadette,i can’t believe we’re finally living together.
4033,Bernadette,"and just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up jimmy carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, sean penn, vatican ii, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re jewish."
4360,Bernadette,"oh, my god. that’s so cute. i didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you."
5995,Bernadette,"look, raj just gets along with women. "
4774,Bernadette,i liked the time travel element.
5571,Bernadette,"25% of profits due to sheldon cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of howard and bernadette wolowitz. sheldon, that’s so nice."
5777,Bernadette,that’s not helpful.
3536,Bernadette,hi.
4480,Bernadette,"long story short, she’s on the no fly list and we might have been followed here by a drone."
5849,Bernadette,"do something, batman."
5599,Bernadette,leave it alone. he means well.
3987,Bernadette,where?
3727,Bernadette,no.
3998,Bernadette,yes.
3492,Bernadette,"okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?"
5668,Bernadette,are you done with this nonsense?
3524,Bernadette,he can’t sit somewhere else?
4067,Bernadette,i can’t help it. my howie wowie has an owie.
4929,Bernadette,"well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas."
3572,Bernadette,"right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
5878,Bernadette,really? so you can control it?
3826,Bernadette,you’re a putz. you know what that means?
4656,Bernadette,hi.
4403,Bernadette,that’s true. every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
6149,Bernadette,"i changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
4472,Bernadette,"so you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?"
5070,Bernadette,"no, she’s right, and i just want you to know that from now on, i’m gonna be much more sensitive. i don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me."
4762,Bernadette,"all right, if i’m doing this, i’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed stuart?"
3676,Bernadette,"howard, stop it."
4515,Bernadette,why can’t she do it?
5781,Bernadette,should we say something to him?
5717,Bernadette,"for what it’s worth, you’re a great liar."
4317,Bernadette,"i don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
3994,Bernadette,ooh!
5032,Bernadette,"well, of course. i would be devastated if my parents split up."
6114,Bernadette,excuse me.
4201,Bernadette,"no, i mean, he… never mind. there he is! howie!"
3623,Bernadette,"okay, my turn. penny, truth or dare?"
5827,Bernadette,last question. what is wrong with you?
6088,Bernadette,"i’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
4044,Bernadette,"good night, real penny."
4753,Bernadette,this is gonna be a long weekend for you.
4270,Bernadette,that’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
4993,Bernadette,"i guess. it’s really not that important. hey, up here."
3638,Bernadette,"oh, right. did you get your hair cut?"
4698,Bernadette,"no, i don’t want a latte. i want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. "
5656,Bernadette,some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
4345,Bernadette,why are they staring?
5574,Bernadette,sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. it’s like a beer commercial.
5278,Bernadette,"i know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better."
5502,Bernadette,"oh. well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
4705,Bernadette,that’s cute.
4284,Bernadette,"gosh, amy. i’m sensing a little hostility. is it maybe because, like sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?"
5535,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another."
4680,Bernadette,so am i.
4061,Bernadette,"i’m here to help you get through this. you can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
4960,Bernadette,see? isn’t this better than a hotel room?
5801,Bernadette,you bought a minivan?
4332,Bernadette,sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
5555,Bernadette,damn. all i got for valentine’s day was a postcard saying my vermont teddy bear was back-ordered.
4635,Bernadette,he’s bringing cinnamon?
3579,Bernadette,what’s george takei doing here?
6087,Bernadette,you have to go.
4883,Bernadette,"so it’s not just me. you see it, too."
4334,Bernadette,i’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. leonard would never cheat on you.
3953,Bernadette,"i don’t think i can meet the girl who was always mean to me. tammy bodnick. one time while i was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
5688,Bernadette,this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
4859,Bernadette,i’ll pay you anything you want.
4179,Bernadette,do you want me to call somebody at nasa?
4605,Bernadette,sure.
3688,Bernadette,"well, that shouldn’t be too hard. he’s such a cutie."
3861,Bernadette,it’s me.
3565,Bernadette,"oh, my god, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
5865,Bernadette,raj.
5245,Bernadette,stuart.
5406,Bernadette,"and raj and i are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
3786,Bernadette,"leonard lives here. priya’s from india. people meet, howard. god!"
5594,Bernadette,i don’t think so. he just wants to be part of the experience.
3753,Bernadette,yeah.
5188,Bernadette,i think you just answered your own question.
5429,Bernadette,maybe i should marry trent.
4396,Bernadette,what did you tell your boss?
5749,Bernadette,"something’s wrong. i don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. honestly, i’m not even sure i like babies."
5216,Bernadette,"howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
5405,Bernadette,"hi, ames, what are you doing here?"
4586,Bernadette,"howie, that was amazing. look, i’m shaking."
4745,Bernadette,look at amy down there. should we go?
5196,Bernadette,"hey, raj. if howard can’t keep the tardis, how great would it look at your place?"
4097,Bernadette,"when i first met howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
3686,Bernadette,"um, penny, that’s glenn. glenn, that’s penny."
5274,Bernadette,"sheldon, shh. the wedding’s starting."
6130,Bernadette,ew. excuse me.
5710,Bernadette,"i’ve worked so hard to get where i am, and i don’t want to get sent back to square one because i’m pregnant."
3481,Bernadette,"i know, i’m studying it."
5638,Bernadette,dungeons & dragons? that sounds about right.
3841,Bernadette,what?!
3897,Bernadette,what?
5119,Bernadette,"sorry, i had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
5472,Bernadette,"forgiven, forgiven."
5176,Bernadette,thanks.
5830,Bernadette,"fine, then do it."
6050,Bernadette,"let me just say good-bye. halley. look at mommy. over here, honey. say good-bye to mommy. look at me. look at your mother. all right, we can go."
5707,Bernadette,did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
5440,Bernadette,"we don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that sheldon said he’s ready to be physical."
5042,Bernadette,"oh. howie, be serious."
4561,Bernadette,"if they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes."
4801,Bernadette,please don’t say it.
5836,Bernadette,a foot massage?
5848,Bernadette,thank you again for cooking. it’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
5685,Bernadette,"i’m worried about howard. ever since that guy from the air force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck."
4093,Bernadette,"you lied to me. you said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or raj!"
3809,Bernadette,i know. but if she orders something low-fat i’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
4479,Bernadette,that’s an excellent question. amy?
4071,Bernadette,are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
4639,Bernadette,"okay, um, well, first, i was late to a meeting ’cause i was stuck in traffic."
3493,Bernadette,no. that’s the sad part.
4675,Bernadette,that’s interesting.
4548,Bernadette,wish i had a man like her on my team.
5309,Bernadette,bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
3540,Bernadette,"really? oh, that’d be great. how exciting is that?"
4709,Bernadette,yeah. or you’d be the oldest one here.
3751,Bernadette,"oh, hey, raj, what are you doing here?"
3782,Bernadette,she’s also dating an astronaut.
3877,Bernadette,"just stop talking, howard."
3531,Bernadette,"oh, i find it fascinating. if i hadn’t gone into microbiology, i probably would have gone into physics. or ice dancing."
5631,Bernadette,yeah.
5856,Bernadette,i think i’m in labour.
4401,Bernadette,"well, it’s simple. this was my idea. i’m driving. i’m cinderella. you bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now."
5978,Bernadette,what’s the difference?
3608,Bernadette,knock-knock.
5337,Bernadette,are you attracted to him?
5831,Bernadette,"while you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
4255,Bernadette,you ready to go?
3860,Bernadette,"good morning, handsome."
3557,Bernadette,"raj, you should’ve seen leonard’s experiment. the interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
5955,Bernadette,okay.
4554,Bernadette,"yeah, i bet it sucked. i’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
4427,Bernadette,"i get that. so, what do you want to do with it?"
6108,Bernadette,"that’s ridiculous. as far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
3518,Bernadette,"oh, now what?"
3985,Bernadette,"right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and i’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
5103,Bernadette,we were talking about penny’s job.
3749,Bernadette,i don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
6016,Bernadette,"hmm, guess it should be me."
3970,Bernadette,ooh. i like the fabric. where’d she get it?
4151,Bernadette,good for you. i just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
3667,Bernadette,yeah?
3615,Bernadette,or we could just stay here.
5235,Bernadette,how about now?
5322,Bernadette,"well, sheldon’s looking for a roommate."
5417,Bernadette,happy thanks… yikes.
5680,Bernadette,"love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off."
5328,Bernadette,you are.
4006,Bernadette,i’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and penny.
5920,Bernadette,"let’s see. you’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us."
5519,Bernadette,i’m pregnant.
5520,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s all real exciting."
4473,Bernadette,"don’t well me, mister. we’ve been worried sick. she could have been dead for all we knew. you should be ashamed of yourself."
5253,Bernadette,"well, then i guess bring a blanket. the grass gets damp at night."
4062,Bernadette,"oh, i love you."
4056,Bernadette,you’re so brave. i’m proud of you.
3982,Bernadette,"the thing is, my mother worked full-time. i had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
5171,Bernadette,"well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?"
5937,Bernadette,what’s going on with you?
3516,Bernadette,wow. 
3966,Bernadette,i don’t feel good about this.
4383,Bernadette,"love you, too."
5873,Bernadette,"i didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a milky way or a snickers girl?"
5753,Bernadette,"let me see the sonogram again. oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
3495,Bernadette,not on a bicycle. in a camry.
5523,Bernadette,"you’re probably right. after we talked about it, he started to calm down."
5899,Bernadette,i think i live here now. it’s fine.
3741,Bernadette,what’s that?
6061,Bernadette,and i’d like to think howie wouldn’t take a job i was uncomfortable with.
5456,Bernadette,goodbye.
5145,Bernadette,"oh, my god, howie."
5181,Bernadette,"yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before."
3675,Bernadette,you can’t think that way.
3494,Bernadette,that’s nothing. i couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid i’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
5088,Bernadette,she’s just excited about the holidays.
5241,Bernadette,i call tech support all the time.
5137,Bernadette,howie.
5821,Bernadette,are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
5372,Bernadette,seriously? you brought raj over to take your side?
3758,Bernadette,"yes, i will marry you."
5868,Bernadette,we could name her after your mom.
5612,Bernadette,of course.
5987,Bernadette,"it’s fine. it’s just raj. you can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine."
3613,Bernadette,you are?
4311,Bernadette,"oh, that thing. no, i cancelled that thing."
3519,Bernadette,"no, that’s okay."
3952,Bernadette,"oh, they all went with leonard to confront his childhood bully."
3695,Bernadette,they wouldn’t let me in. oh my howie.
4442,Bernadette,got a little surprise for you. come on.
4879,Bernadette,but imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
5303,Bernadette,"amy, i noticed your status still says in a relationship on facebook."
4259,Bernadette,"do you? you said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here."
4055,Bernadette,poor baby.
3911,Bernadette,hurry! we’re running out of time!
5618,Bernadette,you guys have fun. i’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
5354,Bernadette,"yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?"
4539,Bernadette,how do i put this? she’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. or a cat. or a willow.
5800,Bernadette,fine.
3964,Bernadette,donated.
5617,Bernadette,good. a little tired.
4242,Bernadette,"so, i was taking a shower this morning, and when i got out, i started to dry off with what i thought was a towel but turned out to be howard’s mom’s underwear. i had to take another shower. it wasn’t enough. nothing will ever be enough."
4852,Bernadette,"i wanted to go to hawaii, not hell."
5619,Bernadette,he’s gonna be okay.
4657,Bernadette,"hey, i brought over it’s a wonderful life if you guys want to watch it later."
5904,Bernadette,"yeah, thanks."
4313,Bernadette,"okay, amy, i brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. this is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts."
4388,Bernadette,"oh, you poor baby."
3870,Bernadette,"yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group."
4645,Bernadette,"raj, this dinner was amazing. if you’re here much longer, i’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
5708,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. my boss wants to meet with me, and i’m stressing."
6069,Bernadette,no. and the little lady has a name.
4248,Bernadette,i just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him.
3475,Bernadette,"oh, raj, you’re our guest."
5072,Bernadette,what?
4911,Bernadette,i think so.
5885,Bernadette,that was so fast.
5593,Bernadette,raj found all these childbirth videos online. this one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
4673,Bernadette,what happened?
5973,Bernadette,kinda. 
3926,Bernadette,we can go down to the korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
4156,Bernadette,"listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing i said i was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself."
4777,Bernadette,can i get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
4800,Bernadette,"yeah, what happened?"
4521,Bernadette,"it’s okay. you still look great to me. in fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and i’ll prove it to you?"
5318,Bernadette,how can i help you?
3820,Bernadette,you told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
4731,Bernadette,he hated that entire experience. does it make me an awful wife if i don’t think he should do it again?
4456,Bernadette,"yeah, you two were so cute playing together."
3760,Bernadette,"oh, i love you, too."
5014,Bernadette,"because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. and why can’t he take your mom? you took her to your prom."
4509,Bernadette,"oh, good, ’cause i liked the tall thin one. he seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like i’d have to teach him a thing or two."
3529,Bernadette,"me neither, but he just lights up when i laugh."
3936,Bernadette,"oh, amy! looking sexy!"
3594,Bernadette,had sex?
5729,Bernadette,i don’t think you are.
5790,Bernadette,what do you do in there?
4476,Bernadette,"no husbands, no boyfriends, no rules."
5565,Bernadette,i just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.
4489,Bernadette,are you referring to the time we got stuck on the small world ride at disneyland?
4471,Bernadette,"hang on, you’ve had her for hours?"
5489,Bernadette,don’t make it too hot.
4953,Bernadette,was it working?
4793,Bernadette,"the one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. so, you know, silver linings."
5750,Bernadette,but i thought i’d be more excited.
5392,Bernadette,right here.
4693,Bernadette,"no, thanks."
4533,Bernadette,"i knew it, we’re gonna lose."
5915,Bernadette,i like the first one.
4931,Bernadette,i know.
5360,Bernadette,we need to talk about redecorating this place.
4069,Bernadette,i’ll miss you.
3780,Bernadette,i don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
3730,Bernadette,wait a minute. are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
5376,Bernadette,i told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because i didn’t want to disappoint him.
5033,Bernadette,"well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off."
4833,Bernadette,you’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? that’s so cruel.
5061,Bernadette,"i’m not a bully. i mean, maybe i come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody."
4342,Bernadette,i’ve never even read a comic book. you guys?
5814,Bernadette,hey.
4246,Bernadette,that’s great. i didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.
4250,Bernadette,got it.
3580,Bernadette,she’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
4349,Bernadette,"so, what’d you guys think?"
4408,Bernadette,you can’t just throw everything in the closet.
4309,Bernadette,terrific. my two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
3794,Bernadette,they said something about going there this summer.
5468,Bernadette,maybe he uses kryptonite.
4491,Bernadette,"the hotel’s nice. there’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. "
5562,Bernadette,"well, i should hope so. the whole thing was your idea."
5813,Bernadette,"well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling sheldon they’re behind schedule."
5926,Bernadette,that sounds really nice.
6072,Bernadette,"don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years.  yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
3838,Bernadette,what the hell is wrong with you?
3701,Bernadette,that’s how i take it.
3664,Bernadette,"oh, good for you. uh, glenn, this is my boyfriend howard."
4590,Bernadette,"oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it."
4761,Bernadette,i didn’t know his last name was bloom.
5601,Bernadette,he’s just trying to be supportive.
4315,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5410,Bernadette,hi. we’d like to volunteer.
3586,Bernadette,no.
3731,Bernadette,i can’t believe this.
3799,Bernadette,let me help you.
4445,Bernadette,"sheldon, don’t you dare."
4260,Bernadette,thank you.
4327,Bernadette,"oh, here he comes."
6107,Bernadette,"yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months."
3894,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m going to do. i don’t want to break up over this.
4985,Bernadette,oh.
3791,Bernadette,in the bathroom.
5333,Bernadette,"oh. look at you, two guys in one day."
4339,Bernadette,it’s cute how excited they are. you should have seen howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
5098,Bernadette,you okay?
4737,Bernadette,"hi, honey."
3945,Bernadette,"amy, really? twister?"
5101,Bernadette,"all i have is our new urine flow drug. won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack."
4921,Bernadette,you guys just met. why would she feel that way?
4075,Bernadette,"raj, howie told me what’s going on with you and lakshmi."
5757,Bernadette,you looked in our folder?!
4937,Bernadette,"oh, baby. that story’s made up, isn’t it?"
4732,Bernadette,so you’ll talk to him?
5353,Bernadette,and i’d love to take you out again”?
3505,Bernadette,"look, howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
5320,Bernadette,hey. you know who would be the perfect roomie?
4926,Bernadette,and i’m sure you can turn it around.
5113,Bernadette,"well, maybe it turned out better than you think."
4196,Bernadette,"howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety."
4009,Bernadette,with access to weaponised smallpox.
5923,Bernadette,sorry. howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.
4519,Bernadette,that’s ’cause i’m a woman. i’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
5000,Bernadette,"please don’t go. up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong."
3545,Bernadette,it unhooks in the front.
4552,Bernadette,you suck so hard.
4404,Bernadette,come at me. see what happens.
5526,Bernadette,doctor said i can’t have sushi.
3965,Bernadette,penny.
3685,Bernadette,"oh, come on, howard, be realistic."
4804,Bernadette,"you’re kidding, right?"
4058,Bernadette,"howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. it won’t change how i feel about you."
5630,Bernadette,there’s more than one?
3884,Bernadette,no.
4781,Bernadette,"so on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “hey, vivian. you deserve this. and at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”"
4581,Bernadette,"well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. "
4738,Bernadette,maybe you should have a seat.
4282,Bernadette,"you’re right. and i’m sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science."
5724,Bernadette,"oh, i appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me."
4643,Bernadette,"aw, you didn’t have to do that."
3807,Bernadette,you mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
5041,Bernadette,"just tell me one thing that bothers you, and i promise i won’t get mad."
5312,Bernadette,what did we do?
4988,Bernadette,"he was being funny. i’m pretty sure. anyway, i was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in california. isn’t that cool?"
3960,Bernadette,you’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
4376,Bernadette,"i’ve been working late every night. all i asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. but did he do it? no. he just kept on playing that stupid game. you like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine."
5461,Bernadette,"i don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. the teddy bear stuart won the night we took him to the fair."
4952,Bernadette,it was us the whole time.
6005,Bernadette,trying to catch up on office e-mails before i go back.
6132,Bernadette,"no, it’s not!"
5180,Bernadette,"okay. well, i’ll keep it together if you can."
4899,Bernadette,"great. and while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
4523,Bernadette,maybe we can do it next week.
6145,Bernadette,"hi. i’m bernadette maryann rostenkowski from yorba linda, california."
3935,Bernadette,i love it!
4369,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
4049,Bernadette,you threw up?
3610,Bernadette,"oh, no. that movie has melting faces. it reminds me too much of the time i dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the rhesus monkey lab. besides, penny and i are having a girls’ night tonight."
5069,Bernadette,"no, it’s not. penny told me that everyone’s scared of me."
5053,Bernadette,"oh, how is she?"
4084,Bernadette,"no, you have to stop now."
4763,Bernadette,"what is that, like, the indian sherlock holmes?"
5421,Bernadette,oh. that’s a big step.
5135,Bernadette,"well, normal’s a strong word, but sure."
5948,Bernadette,"yeah, maybe your dad’s right."
5862,Bernadette,do you really need to record this?
4392,Bernadette,weekends are too crowded.
6091,Bernadette,it’s too late for me. save yourself.
3874,Bernadette,fine. just a little tired.
4880,Bernadette,couldn’t hurt.
6029,Bernadette,i guess.
5732,Bernadette,sorry. i should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
4286,Bernadette,"what can i tell ya? she’s a big girl. wherever you look, there she is. more coffee?"
5851,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
5024,Bernadette,"howie, get off of him."
4137,Bernadette,"no, isn’t that kind of tacky?"
6034,Bernadette,"when i go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. we don’t know anything about them."
5993,Bernadette,"well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
5251,Bernadette,you mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
4266,Bernadette,"howie, you promised you’d move."
5166,Bernadette,"well, it’ll be good that you’re there. howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go."
3812,Bernadette,"all right. here you go. two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for priya."
3976,Bernadette,"well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?"
3550,Bernadette,are you saying i need to ask your permission to hang out with leonard?
5805,Bernadette,it’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
5511,Bernadette,what could it be? we are groot? we are the champions? we are family? i got all my sisters with me?
5086,Bernadette,"okay, new subject. let’s talk about presents. what did you get amy?"
5532,Bernadette,"well, sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and i went out…"
4089,Bernadette,"howard already took care of it. plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. do you know, for a while in poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
3856,Bernadette,"oh, god."
4668,Bernadette,you actually got him to do it.
4431,Bernadette,"me, too, but i guess now we’ll never know."
4834,Bernadette,you are a putz.
5079,Bernadette,"no, i’m the worst. i’m a terrible person."
5772,Bernadette,that feels great.
4157,Bernadette,"aw, that’s such good news, howie. thank you for telling her."
4413,Bernadette,"he’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet."
4462,Bernadette,"no, i wasn’t."
4669,Bernadette,"raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch penny’s thing tonight, i didn’t think you meant stuart."
3656,Bernadette,"yeah, it sounds fun. super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"
3930,Bernadette,which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
6027,Bernadette,it was?
4149,Bernadette,i love that man.
3560,Bernadette,"how’s your work going, penny? any acting jobs?"
5828,Bernadette,"howie, it’s in poor taste."
3651,Bernadette,yes.
3956,Bernadette,"oh, my god, that’s awful."
4277,Bernadette,really? only five?
4020,Bernadette,"howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
6078,Bernadette,you doing okay?
4856,Bernadette,"it doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. the question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? hit me again."
5909,Bernadette,i have one. what if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
3789,Bernadette,he’s a consultant.
4700,Bernadette,those tickets were pretty expensive. i had to give howie an advance on his allowance. now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
4385,Bernadette,"geez, how close were you guys before we got married?"
3867,Bernadette,"if you want butter, i’ll get you butter."
3657,Bernadette,really? and miss the keynote?
6155,Bernadette,"howie, can you get that?"
4328,Bernadette,jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
6048,Bernadette,you realize they called when you took her.
4733,Bernadette,"well, i’m his wife, i don’t want to ruin it for him."
4636,Bernadette,"hey, guys. sorry i’m so late. did you already have dinner?"
4162,Bernadette,"in the event of a divorce, please return to sheldon cooper."
3980,Bernadette,not him.
5054,Bernadette,"hey, what are you talking about?"
5559,Bernadette,what is it?
4325,Bernadette,"bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?"
5653,Bernadette,"amy’s with sheldon who she loves like a son. you’re with her son, who she doesn’t."
3612,Bernadette,"oh. well, maybe you can join us. i’ll ask penny."
4477,Bernadette,"fine. no husbands, no boyfriends, some rules."
4939,Bernadette,"hell, yeah."
4319,Bernadette,you’re an idiot.
5419,Bernadette,but he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves sheldon.
5640,Bernadette,all right.
4557,Bernadette,"god, what is going on with you? "
5538,Bernadette,how is that a drunk text?
4997,Bernadette,"no, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity."
6039,Bernadette,it would be nice to raise halley to be a little more independent than you were.
5020,Bernadette,what?
5702,Bernadette,it had to be barbara. i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
4606,Bernadette,"maybe, if she asks."
4798,Bernadette,hi.
4826,Bernadette,almost there. you’re doing great.
4074,Bernadette,hello.
6143,Bernadette,"here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus, right down santa claus lane. vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins."
3854,Bernadette,"yeah. yeah, i guess. does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
4321,Bernadette,no!
3486,Bernadette,not really.
3574,Bernadette,i know how to deal with stubborn children. my mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
4619,Bernadette,what?
4625,Bernadette,"sorry. i really want to hear how sad you are. i’ll be back in like five, ten minutes."
4264,Bernadette,what’s your excuse this time?
5246,Bernadette,"we talked about this. i don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. and rule number one is pants."
4999,Bernadette,"and i think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. oh, amy, i’m so sorry. that was over the line."
5675,Bernadette,"yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house."
4626,Bernadette,"hey. howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. now, both of you apologize right now."
4453,Bernadette,"well, sure. i’m pretty passionate about science. i remember the first time i looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. it was like a whole other universe. if i wanted to, i could wipe it out with my thumb like a god."
5905,Bernadette,things going well with you and sheldon living together?
5475,Bernadette,this is so cool.
4890,Bernadette,"well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal."
5480,Bernadette,"not you. i own your ass. the real question is, where are you with emily?"
3596,Bernadette,"well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move."
4338,Bernadette,he’s not exhausting at all.
4648,Bernadette,"oh, really?"
4432,Bernadette,i can’t do that. what kind of wife would i be if i didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
5366,Bernadette,let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
4663,Bernadette,"you know, i was thinking. without sheldon, most of us would have never met, but penny would still live across from him. "
5411,Bernadette,oh. okay. wipe that smug smile off your face.
5826,Bernadette,why would you buy it?
5023,Bernadette,"yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. this is his turf."
6022,Bernadette,something on your mind?
4441,Bernadette,think you could take a break?
3891,Bernadette,okay. i just forgot to brush my teeth. i’ll be right back. 
4052,Bernadette,"howie, what happened to you?"
4832,Bernadette,"look, i’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
5013,Bernadette,"look, even stuart’s bringing a date. i wonder who it is."
4173,Bernadette,what’s wrong?
4079,Bernadette,"every time i spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im."
4923,Bernadette,really?
4910,Bernadette,okay.
5500,Bernadette,it is valentine’s day. how about valentino?
4086,Bernadette,"um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. this is a map of pasadena. this is a list of local restaurants. and then, for howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
5319,Bernadette,"well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? you had other roommates before leonard. maybe this is a chance to find someone new."
4101,Bernadette,"no, leave me alone."
4065,Bernadette,"ooh, look at this pretty purple robe i just got. you should put on yours and then we’ll match."
5666,Bernadette,"you do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?"
3546,Bernadette,i guess i should go.
6036,Bernadette,it’s not just the sloth. polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. the orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. and what do i do? i choose my career over my child.
5347,Bernadette,"oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?"
4015,Bernadette,"oh, smells amazing in here."
5931,Bernadette,"raj, what’s going on?"
5798,Bernadette,you bought a crib without me?
4108,Bernadette,you’re kidding.
4641,Bernadette,aw! raj did the dishes.
5127,Bernadette,i was just kidding. i’m sorry. and the story’s really good.
3783,Bernadette,"yeah. but leonard’s impressive, too."
4375,Bernadette,"maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, i’d tell you."
4970,Bernadette,like what? your incomplete set of star trek collector plates?
4514,Bernadette,"fine, forget i asked. how was dinner at your mom’s?"
4279,Bernadette,howard was so angry i had to mash up benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
5085,Bernadette,maybe you’d like it more if you thought of santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
4746,Bernadette,"come on, raj, it’s not the same without you."
5874,Bernadette,"i remember thinking this is stupid, and i was right."
5810,Bernadette,soon.
4563,Bernadette,"he’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
4109,Bernadette,"oh, you’re in a good mood."
5731,Bernadette,"oh, i was gonna start at the end. thank god you’re here."
4977,Bernadette,"well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance."
5912,Bernadette,"you know, i just read that a team at mit. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
4844,Bernadette,"last night was a little rough, but i think we’re gonna get through this."
3869,Bernadette,"you know, i met a really cute girl at work. she’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
4881,Bernadette,not much. you want to get a drink later? just the two of us?
4186,Bernadette,i got to get back to work. i love you.
4682,Bernadette,sorry. did i startle you?
5916,Bernadette,is that emily your ex-girlfriend?
4148,Bernadette,"oh, my god, it’s happening."
4096,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m going to do. i’m supposed to marry howard in a couple of weeks and i’m not sure i even know who the man is any more.
4928,Bernadette,"yeah. but instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling penny. it’s cute."
4190,Bernadette,what’s wrong?
4326,Bernadette,looks like he’s doing pretty good.
5231,Bernadette,there’s my big boss man.
4014,Bernadette,where are you guys going to eat?
4081,Bernadette,why are you doing that? you’re being mean to him.
4354,Bernadette,you want some tea?
3995,Bernadette,ooh!
4500,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m saying.
5261,Bernadette,all right. tonight’s the night.
4423,Bernadette,"told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. i know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it."
4184,Bernadette,"hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?"
3743,Bernadette,leonard’s really one of a kind.
5157,Bernadette,okay. but you got a lot of receipts for the lego store in here.
3661,Bernadette,"don’t worry, penny. this is a better car anyway."
4357,Bernadette,"well, what if the hulk picked up thor while thor is holding the hammer?"
5693,Bernadette,i had a plan. i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
4021,Bernadette,turn it over. i’m hoping my relatives think it’s hebrew.
3993,Bernadette,"you know, i don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
4825,Bernadette,son of a bitch.
4457,Bernadette,and you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
5459,Bernadette,why can’t it be a woman cave?
3989,Bernadette,"look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and i think i came up with a solution."
5050,Bernadette,"uh-huh. and i love that i work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that."
6133,Bernadette,then red hulk must be worthy.
3892,Bernadette,i’m ready.
3914,Bernadette,really?
6121,Bernadette,i think they’re on to me. the story’s starting to fall apart.
6033,Bernadette,what if she likes the people who work there more than us?
4525,Bernadette,"faster, faster, faster! do you not know that word? it means more fast!"
5964,Bernadette,see where i’m going with this?
5021,Bernadette,that’s jeanie?
5951,Bernadette,"when you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. how’d you get by?"
3844,Bernadette,"what are you going to get at the train store, sheldon?"
4316,Bernadette,so you’ve just been lying to him?
5373,Bernadette,he’s not on my side. he’s doing all the work for free.
6113,Bernadette,to do what? shake a can of nickels at them?
6131,Bernadette,i don’t sound like that.
5051,Bernadette,"i love that you take pride in your looks, even when i have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair."
4775,Bernadette,"well, i hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends."
4444,Bernadette,"inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. on the back he wrote howard, my son, my greatest gift. you okay?"
5988,Bernadette,don’t do that. we’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
4739,Bernadette,daddy.
6018,Bernadette,"no, i’m fine."
5540,Bernadette,"it’s okay to be nervous. i am, too."
5080,Bernadette,it’s not okay. how can i even work here anymore?
4364,Bernadette,"$5,000 for a couple of dolls? are you out of your mind?"
5364,Bernadette,whatcha doing?
3768,Bernadette,"well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
6021,Bernadette,"okay, you won. can i finish what i’m doing?"
3649,Bernadette,hi.
5007,Bernadette,how was your prom? did you go?
4527,Bernadette,"come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store."
5764,Bernadette,"well, now i don’t know if i want to know!"
5048,Bernadette,"okay, um, i love that you make me laugh."
3814,Bernadette,yeah. we’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
3858,Bernadette,"no. i need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
5415,Bernadette,what difference does it make?
5705,Bernadette,get out.
5597,Bernadette,yeah.
5416,Bernadette,i’ll do it.
5676,Bernadette,"howard, please just call the man, see what he wants."
3680,Bernadette,can i stay here tonight?
3872,Bernadette,hang on a second. nasa doesn’t have a shuttle any more. how are you going to get up there?
3978,Bernadette,you got wax in your ears? the man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. howdini.
4143,Bernadette,"not now, dad."
4794,Bernadette,yes.
3868,Bernadette,we went cake-tasting yesterday. raj came along. he cried and ate half the samples.
4449,Bernadette,i’m gonna make some coffee.
3571,Bernadette,which leads to…?
3603,Bernadette,"oh, i take pacts very seriously. one time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. that day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed ebola with the common cold."
4647,Bernadette,"maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend raj."
3979,Bernadette,that’s it. no cake for you. anyone else want to join the no cake club?
5773,Bernadette,can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? was that the front door?
4788,Bernadette,i like the wii.
5423,Bernadette,you sure? you’ve never really been with a man. do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
3925,Bernadette,hello.
4302,Bernadette,‘cause i did it!
4261,Bernadette,or in the closet. we can decide later.
3912,Bernadette,just do it!
5257,Bernadette,did you eat all my yoghurt?
4231,Bernadette,"thanks, so do you. slutty cop?"
6023,Bernadette,"nope, all good."
4628,Bernadette,thanks again for cooking.
3915,Bernadette,that’s horrible.
4582,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s just a precaution. if there was a problem, i’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. sorry i messed up our date."
4959,Bernadette,aren’t you gonna chase her?
5221,Bernadette,i think i’ll have a beer.
3513,Bernadette,"so, this isn’t a joke?"
5503,Bernadette,he’s so little. i’m sure it’s fine.
5012,Bernadette,"ooh, every single person rsvp’d yes. this is so exciting. isn’t this exciting?"
6063,Bernadette,"hey, i didn’t know you were home. where you been?"
5980,Bernadette,what’s so funny?
5464,Bernadette,hmm. maybe he’s busy.
3988,Bernadette,"i guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
5167,Bernadette,is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
3671,Bernadette,six-seven.
4113,Bernadette,when?
4983,Bernadette,"no, it’s not okay. i want us to be partners, equals. adults in a mature relationship."
5334,Bernadette,what did he say?
5450,Bernadette,great. i can finally show you where the laundry room is.
4768,Bernadette,for a cup of coffee. but it’s dated 20 years from now.
5483,Bernadette,"no, you didn’t."
3792,Bernadette,they’re just asking me all sorts of questions i can’t answer.
6125,Bernadette,hi. it’s stuart. we met at the comic book store. i was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. it’s okay if you say no. it might be the kick in the pants i need to start taking zoloft.
4288,Bernadette,"oh, no. where was it parked?"
5728,Bernadette,"oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing."
5285,Bernadette,"i mean, if penny finds out i’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think i’m a terrible friend. i wish you never told me."
5832,Bernadette,i can’t imagine you being violent.
4125,Bernadette,this is the most amazing gift i’ve ever gotten.
5686,Bernadette,he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone.
5583,Bernadette,"okay. okay, how about this? they don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. when they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out."
4543,Bernadette,"great, climb back up. come on."
5620,Bernadette,why are you dressed like that?
4010,Bernadette,howard.
3576,Bernadette,"hi, guys."
3587,Bernadette,"no, it’s fine."
5434,Bernadette,how about something a little more realistic?
3628,Bernadette,"ooh, like what?"
4981,Bernadette,i’ll be right back. i’m gonna go check on him.
5197,Bernadette,"i don’t know much about doctor who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the tardis, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the tardis is bigger than the outside. but then again, i don’t know much about<i> doctor who."
5363,Bernadette,is it about how i can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
4735,Bernadette,"no, i think it’s stupid."
5696,Bernadette,i forgot my coat.
6000,Bernadette,"oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her."
4227,Bernadette,what are you talking about? it’ll be fun. all your friends’ll be there.
4903,Bernadette,"okay, stop."
3530,Bernadette,"so, leonard, howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
4045,Bernadette,"good night, transvestite penny."
4057,Bernadette,are you crying?
3578,Bernadette,"clearly you are. otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now."
4159,Bernadette,thanks for fixing it. i love you.
5131,Bernadette,your mom having fun in florida?
4495,Bernadette,"this is fun, we never really get to talk shop with penny around. we usually just end up talking about boys."
5025,Bernadette,not anymore.
4007,Bernadette,"boy, i don’t know if i could be friends with howie if we broke up."
3627,Bernadette,she’s been in there a long time.
5553,Bernadette,what is that?
4384,Bernadette,where you’d never look.
4621,Bernadette,how’s it going out there?
4725,Bernadette,hey.
6112,Bernadette,"i threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
5748,Bernadette,"what? why? who are you calling? you’re gonna rat me out to howard, aren’t you? you’re such a snitch, no wonder i don’t like you."
6122,Bernadette,it was an architect!
4111,Bernadette,"oh, howie, that’s wonderful!"
5156,Bernadette,"oh, no. that thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom."
5897,Bernadette,i didn’t know what else to do. it worked.
3873,Bernadette,are those russian rockets safe?
3541,Bernadette,do they have that?
4505,Bernadette,thanks.
5665,Bernadette,"come on, howard, you’re overreacting."
5342,Bernadette,"hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? stuart."
5305,Bernadette,what?
6100,Bernadette,no.
5136,Bernadette,"stuart, this place looks amazing."
5834,Bernadette,i think he looks cute.
5279,Bernadette,that’s true.
3752,Bernadette,"uh-huh. so, uh, howard’s not here?"
4251,Bernadette,"uh, but we got you a b-minus on purpose to make it believable."
4878,Bernadette,"i don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. it seems like you could use this time to get a head start."
5992,Bernadette,"well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
3849,Bernadette,"i’m not gonna live with your mother. not now, not ever."
3905,Bernadette,you’re my soul mate. this is where you kiss me.
5485,Bernadette,made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
4896,Bernadette,but they throw an actual ball. you were throwing air at a tv.
5361,Bernadette,"look, i get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but i want this to feel like my house, too."
4504,Bernadette,come on. i apologize. can we please just let it go?
5647,Bernadette,i stab it in the middle eye.
5990,Bernadette,"just not in our bedroom, you dumbass. "
3526,Bernadette,where’d you get them?
3679,Bernadette,i’m too hot to go out with a guy like glenn?
4790,Bernadette,were you seeing other women when we started dating?
4140,Bernadette,"oh, i like that."
5307,Bernadette,"yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?"
4951,Bernadette,housekeeping.
5853,Bernadette,"howie, they’ve been doing everything for you."
5005,Bernadette,"wow, you still have it? i just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
3647,Bernadette,"well, this was fun."
5783,Bernadette,"is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
5720,Bernadette,do you know what? it’s just a research project. the most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. it’s all i need to give my life meaning.
5762,Bernadette,everyone said i could do better.
5961,Bernadette,so i’ll say maybe.
4766,Bernadette,i didn’t know you were fat.
6001,Bernadette,hey.
5138,Bernadette,why don’t we leave so you can cool off?
3833,Bernadette,"well, you’ll be really be proud of this. i was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. they’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
5089,Bernadette,how?
4387,Bernadette,it smells pretty ripe in here. you kind feel it in your eyes.
3754,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
5401,Bernadette,right here.
5974,Bernadette,howie?
4870,Bernadette,"oh, i understand. you want to do something you’re already good at. i know. why don’t i get you a job at the sitting around all day wearing yoga pants factory?"
5301,Bernadette,we’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
3669,Bernadette,"then we went out for a year. come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap."
5513,Bernadette,"pretty positive. that’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…"
6047,Bernadette,"love you, too. bye."
4972,Bernadette,"how much, howie?"
5090,Bernadette,what?
5797,Bernadette,"hey, where you been?"
5802,Bernadette,i don’t want to drive that. it’s such a mom car.
3585,Bernadette,i’m okay.
5981,Bernadette,"don’t post that, be supportive."
5407,Bernadette,you said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
4042,Bernadette,"mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting."
5608,Bernadette,yeah.
5908,Bernadette,"it’s okay, howie never has on pants. the domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now."
5149,Bernadette,"so, where is it?"
4966,Bernadette,maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
4289,Bernadette,that doesn’t make sense. sheldon doesn’t have a spot. was it maybe in howard’s spot?
5397,Bernadette,nothing. not important.
3588,Bernadette,"what about you, have you been seeing anybody?"
3900,Bernadette,all right. i just wanted to tell you i’m sorry i said something to your mother.
6007,Bernadette,"yeah, i mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine."
4024,Bernadette,"my dad. because i make a lot more money than howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
5168,Bernadette,what happened?
5108,Bernadette,"okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?"
3835,Bernadette,"i wanted to. come on, open it."
4415,Bernadette,"oh, it’s my pleasure."
5864,Bernadette,how could you?
3818,Bernadette,what?
4136,Bernadette,i can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
5214,Bernadette,"oh, how nice. i loved finding nemo."
5265,Bernadette,don’t let that sway you.
5580,Bernadette,what’s going on?
3983,Bernadette,"ugh, it was horrible. with their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. i don’t want to get dressed. joey keeps spitting in my mouth. this isn’t the way mom makes waffles. well, okay, put your hand in here. let’s see how you like this waffle!"
5249,Bernadette,"yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
4051,Bernadette,"sure, why?"
4573,Bernadette,i may have overreacted.
5780,Bernadette,who is it?
4865,Bernadette,"this job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the fda finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
4160,Bernadette,"good night, rocket man."
5292,Bernadette,"oh, look, jewish and gentile."
5269,Bernadette,"so, anyway, what i’m trying to say is… "
5477,Bernadette,"okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her."
5936,Bernadette,"yeah, we’re all dressed up. why go home?"
5178,Bernadette,you okay?
4374,Bernadette,"oh, bite me."
4110,Bernadette,what’s so great?
3487,Bernadette,i use them. i don’t like them.
5793,Bernadette,which mit did you go to?
4764,Bernadette,what do you care? you’re dead.
5726,Bernadette,i get enough of that when i take howard to my grandmother’s for christmas.
5348,Bernadette,"yeah, stuart got two dates with it."
4799,Bernadette,"emily, what do you do?"
4526,Bernadette,"hey, you’ll know when i’m yelling at you."
4440,Bernadette,that’s nice.
3501,Bernadette,can i ask you a question?
4199,Bernadette,waiting for my husband.
4603,Bernadette,"if this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
4863,Bernadette,yep.
4478,Bernadette,"i got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, jack."
3506,Bernadette,sex.
4241,Bernadette,"hey, what you watching?"
5959,Bernadette,what is it?
3510,Bernadette,"hello, howard."
5087,Bernadette,"come on, sheldon, you have to get her something."
4691,Bernadette,"oh, thanks, but i don’twant you to close up. i mean, won’t you lose business? sorry. that was mean."
4322,Bernadette,"hey, let’s help raj meet a girl tonight."
5493,Bernadette,i don’t know how to turn off the jets.
6128,Bernadette,"all right, just hurry!"
5230,Bernadette,"you better not change, because i love who you are. now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?"
4191,Bernadette,uh-huh.
4909,Bernadette,think he’s getting any better?
5892,Bernadette,now you hate me too.
5840,Bernadette,i guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
5388,Bernadette,"hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?"
4894,Bernadette,"nah, you got this. let’s go for a drink. i’ll call amy."
5357,Bernadette,and how many guys have you gone out with?
6148,Bernadette,"hey, penny. what are you talking about? oh, that was you? long story. why don’t you go ahead and eat. we’re gonna be a while."
5529,Bernadette,"well, we didn’t exactly decide. we were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless."
4237,Bernadette,just what?
5682,Bernadette,anybody have anything snarky to say about that? didn’t think so.
5184,Bernadette,"hey. sheldon, leonard, living room, right now!"
6129,Bernadette,howie? howie?
4748,Bernadette,now i feel a little gross.
6120,Bernadette,my universe!
3940,Bernadette,"oh, he’s a sweetie."
4906,Bernadette,"okay, it’s not that hard. you just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it."
5982,Bernadette,we’re smart. i’m sure we can think of something.
4538,Bernadette,because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. 
5174,Bernadette,howie.
3690,Bernadette,yeah. you’re a hottie.
4613,Bernadette,"oh, well, that’s a great idea."
4443,Bernadette,"sit down, honey."
4819,Bernadette,"not me. i got into science ’cause i was always the smallest kid in school, so i thought if i became a scientist, i could invent a formula that made me taller."
3691,Bernadette,i have to stay here for school.
6110,Bernadette,"fine, hundreds."
3806,Bernadette,i can’t do this anymore! i’m a good girl! i went to catholic school! 
3803,Bernadette,not engaged. very interesting. i have to tinkle.
4197,Bernadette,"hey, howie, how you feeling?"
4974,Bernadette,was it more or less than falconry school?
4546,Bernadette,"no, she doesn’t. i just made that up."
3500,Bernadette,i don’t really get it.
5506,Bernadette,"oh, cut off his head? that’s where his little nose is."
4784,Bernadette,am i a terrible person?
5969,Bernadette,there she goes.
4426,Bernadette,why don’t you read it? maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
5356,Bernadette,"i, i thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people."
5558,Bernadette,"i’m a little tired, howie. you ready to go?"
5484,Bernadette,"well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause i love how things worked out."
4117,Bernadette,we’ll call them. although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
4048,Bernadette,cool. how do they do that?
5195,Bernadette,"leonard makes you watch that, too?"
5386,Bernadette,tea and basketball?
3975,Bernadette,after you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
5933,Bernadette,"stuart, don’t you drink my milk."
4041,Bernadette,nuh-uh. what if she gets me one? i already have a picture of me and howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in venice beach. i’ve suffered enough.
4685,Bernadette,do you have this one?
5427,Bernadette,you mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
5598,Bernadette,"it’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up."
3577,Bernadette,i believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
5811,Bernadette,fine. i’ll buy the stupid van.
5659,Bernadette,"um, you should probably talk to penny, too."
5343,Bernadette,"i thought so, too."
3593,Bernadette,"howard, you did have a real woman. i was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out."
5530,Bernadette,"no, i’m embarrassed."
4936,Bernadette,"oh. howie, i had no idea."
5143,Bernadette,you helped him?
4304,Bernadette,i just put it in. it’s gonna be a while.
4001,Bernadette,maybe.
4558,Bernadette,and i’m not buying it. try again.
4789,Bernadette,"what do you mean, yes?"
5700,Bernadette,i’m furious.
4280,Bernadette,i’m really sorry they took sheldon’s spot away. he shouldn’t have to suffer just because howard’s such a big deal now.
3929,Bernadette,"we know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right."
5282,Bernadette,hands off. i’m mad at you.
5727,Bernadette,isn’t it a little early for that?
3607,Bernadette,i’ll go with you.
4511,Bernadette,"hi, honey."
5845,Bernadette,"there’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess."
3642,Bernadette,"well, live and learn. so, raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
3632,Bernadette,so where’s the telescope?
4350,Bernadette,"it’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist."
5991,Bernadette,good. nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
4314,Bernadette,this is a really good expectorant. although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
4341,Bernadette,"i don’t mind it. i think howie’s just in touch with his inner child. although when he comes to bed in his batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like i’m touching his inner child."
5881,Bernadette,sure.
5690,Bernadette,"i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus. she might have heard me throwing up one morning. every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
4616,Bernadette,"don’t be silly, he loves you."
4672,Bernadette,or just keep dating the possum.
3476,Bernadette,"yeah, exciting. can i ask you something?"
3645,Bernadette,"oh, you poor, poor thing. raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. there are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you."
3774,Bernadette,did i tell you priya invited me and howard to have dinner with her and leonard?
4734,Bernadette,since when am i the buzzkill?
5581,Bernadette,son of a bitch.
3478,Bernadette,to the toilet! is that okay with you?
5646,Bernadette,does it have eyes?
5674,Bernadette,it didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
3959,Bernadette,"penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. you’re a good person now."
5573,Bernadette,can we really help?
4692,Bernadette,wow.
5122,Bernadette,why? why did it feel different?
5067,Bernadette,"dan, could i talk to you for a minute?"
3635,Bernadette,"hold on. wait. no, it’s okay, go ahead."
6026,Bernadette,"no. i didn’t want to tell you, but i’m having a really tough time about going back to work."
4778,Bernadette,"okay, well, i did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
3880,Bernadette,"yeah, i get it. i just wish you included me in the decision. we’re supposed to be partners. we’re supposed to be a team."
5272,Bernadette,"for god’s sake, sheldon, what are you doing?"
6095,Bernadette,"oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. stop. i love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
4395,Bernadette,let’s think.
5607,Bernadette,yeah.
3755,Bernadette,"oh, god. what’s happening?"
5929,Bernadette,call me. don’t call howard.
5723,Bernadette,you shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
3762,Bernadette,"ooh, the priya bashing’s starting early. yay! okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?"
5109,Bernadette,search for it.
4031,Bernadette,"really? oh, that’d be so great."
5428,Bernadette,are you stalking him? that’s creepy.
3922,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
3681,Bernadette,howard’s a complete and total ass.
4945,Bernadette,"i think after this, i’ll be dead."
4192,Bernadette,"come on, howard. no one’s leaving you up there."
3808,Bernadette,do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
5838,Bernadette,"stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby."
5509,Bernadette,morning.
4718,Bernadette,"oh, sure you did. who’s mama’s big space man?"
5643,Bernadette,this is getting fun. what’s next?
4783,Bernadette,“p.s. good luck wherever you wind up.”
5745,Bernadette,"it’s my baby. i, i should care about nurseries and colours, and i don’t. what’s wrong with me?"
5547,Bernadette,"i can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, sheldon."
4944,Bernadette,we’re not seeing fairly manilow.
4433,Bernadette,"yeah, try doing it in heels."
4646,Bernadette,"aw. howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
5151,Bernadette,"all right, we’ll wait."
4047,Bernadette,"i miss you, too. so tell me all about your first day."
4938,Bernadette,"okay, let’s get down to business. howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, i have a few questions."
4126,Bernadette,"howard, i don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married."
5422,Bernadette,yeah. you’re inviting him into your home. it’s intimate. it’s where your underpants live.
4750,Bernadette,can i ask you something? why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
5683,Bernadette,"thank you. all right, let’s continue."
4019,Bernadette,he’s gonna learn to poop in space.
5447,Bernadette,"so, when are you thinking of moving?"
5736,Bernadette,not every girl dreams about being a mom. sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
3778,Bernadette,i don’t understand. i thought i was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
6142,Bernadette,why are you being a baby?
4188,Bernadette,"really, you’re serious? okay. "
4298,Bernadette,you were parked in howard’s spot.
5789,Bernadette,"yeah, he deserves to be alone."
4265,Bernadette,that might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
4614,Bernadette,thanks for saving the day.
3972,Bernadette,"you know, i-it’s just that i’m not that comfortable with little kids."
4353,Bernadette,let’s read it again.
4961,Bernadette,have you ever seen a body so fine?
3697,Bernadette,that’s how i heard it.
5782,Bernadette,"i meant like, what are you doing here?"
4068,Bernadette,"i’m gonna go, too."
5225,Bernadette,trying to hurt raj’s feelings.
3910,Bernadette,"you are. i’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot."
4507,Bernadette,"yeah, that felt nice."
5623,Bernadette,"it’s okay, you should go."
5766,Bernadette,wait.
5258,Bernadette,you know which yoghurt i mean.
3913,Bernadette,"well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
5242,Bernadette,four hours of our lives gone? check.
4575,Bernadette,"it’s not? you spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. last week, you two got a couples massage. so, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
6059,Bernadette,i would never let howard work with an ex.
5140,Bernadette,"howie, if the store succeeds, stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
5569,Bernadette,are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?
4430,Bernadette,"yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. and he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. i don’t know why he was upset. they were bigger on him than me."
4729,Bernadette,"well, it’s just, after last time, i didn’t think you’d ever want to go back."
5294,Bernadette,you guys still aren’t living together?
5734,Bernadette,"this was the husband and this was the wife. they’d go out on adventures together. cruises, skiing, horseback riding. that was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
5358,Bernadette,hey. you got a minute?
3974,Bernadette,"oh, ah, right.  and now, the great howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
5823,Bernadette,mine has a fully developed immune system.
5869,Bernadette,did she have a middle name?
5807,Bernadette,do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? they’re just gonna give you ice and advil like last time.
5170,Bernadette,it’s okay. it’s just food.
5499,Bernadette,he’s pretty cute.
4584,Bernadette,howie.
5658,Bernadette,do i think he’d be interested? sometimes i hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
5917,Bernadette,"why would you do that, raj?"
4202,Bernadette,i missed you so much.
4688,Bernadette,"you know, i do work at a pharmaceutical company. if you can make this happen today, i can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. "
5651,Bernadette,"well, thanks again."
3712,Bernadette,sure.
6058,Bernadette,"we’re talking about the same leonard, right?"
4267,Bernadette,i’m starting to think you’re right.
4155,Bernadette,do i look like i feel better?
4596,Bernadette,i think that reason’s called racism.
4601,Bernadette,"so, how are you gonna tell raj abut what you did?"
4482,Bernadette,"come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
5875,Bernadette,"no. if one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, i’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
5385,Bernadette,did you kiss him yet?
4771,Bernadette,"speak for yourself. last month, my company both invented and cured restless eye syndrome. ka-ching, ya blinky chumps."
4205,Bernadette,"i am now that you’re back. come on, let’s go home so i can tear off those little pants."
5471,Bernadette,you’re gonna want to take these with food.
5404,Bernadette,he and his tiny bladder can take the bus. 
3842,Bernadette,of course you do. you’re a cutie pie. any girl would be lucky to have you.
4138,Bernadette,are any of them still married?
5234,Bernadette,"you’re welcome. hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner."
5222,Bernadette,why?
5142,Bernadette,can you please just let it go?
4524,Bernadette,should we just do couples?
5863,Bernadette,raj.
3480,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5785,Bernadette,what?
5212,Bernadette,"oh, let me do it, howard."
3831,Bernadette,the thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. i’m getting my phd.
4857,Bernadette,you’re not working. how would you like a job in home health care?
5179,Bernadette,should we tell everyone not to come?
6025,Bernadette,"howard, i’m sorry if i’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
6136,Bernadette,"cinnamon. where are you, my little lamb chop?"
3815,Bernadette,he hasn’t told her yet. he’s waiting for the right time.
3951,Bernadette,i love this dress. how come i never see you wear it?
5173,Bernadette,"there’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
3589,Bernadette,so you’ve been seeing other girls?
6081,Bernadette,really? that’s the importance you put on us having a baby?
3609,Bernadette,olive.
5786,Bernadette,i told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.
4275,Bernadette,no husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
6090,Bernadette,oh.
5017,Bernadette,"aw, that movie’s so cute."
3694,Bernadette,did you hear? isn’t it terrible?
3732,Bernadette,"all right, howard, let’s get something straight right now. i’m not going to be your mother."
4723,Bernadette,"guys, you’re being childish."
4872,Bernadette,"well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me."
5439,Bernadette,"great. and then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
5716,Bernadette,i just wanted to apologize. i know what you did was an accident.
4851,Bernadette,but we have jobs. we can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
3611,Bernadette,"oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk."
4679,Bernadette,how many times do i have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
4916,Bernadette,but he’s going to.
3896,Bernadette,"oh, god, you’re right. i took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. i need to apologize."
3653,Bernadette,it’s what i do with howard. i’m much smarter than he is. but it’s important to protect his manhood.
5996,Bernadette,jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
5264,Bernadette,"howard joel wolowitz, you get back here."
4377,Bernadette,"sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy."
4593,Bernadette,"penny, can we please get our drinks?"
4765,Bernadette,"so, what happens next?"
6052,Bernadette,ruin it for me and i’ll break this glass over your head.
5739,Bernadette,"well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so i guess the theme was bloody homicide photos."
4219,Bernadette,"okay, we need to talk."
4245,Bernadette,i got it. why do you have a history textbook?
3528,Bernadette,"don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
5338,Bernadette,yeah.
3561,Bernadette,i’m sliding into third.
4686,Bernadette,"ooh, i was kind of hoping to get it before howie comes home from work."
5240,Bernadette,what?
4087,Bernadette,"amy, please."
5226,Bernadette,you’re being childish.
5185,Bernadette,"good news, i found more tums."
4850,Bernadette,that’s not helpful.
5263,Bernadette,right.
3660,Bernadette,"oh. thank you, raj."
4684,Bernadette,batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
4236,Bernadette,i’m always on your side.
4464,Bernadette,cinnamon!
3797,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s hysterical."
4358,Bernadette,"then by the transitive property of picking things up, hulk picked up the hammer."
4595,Bernadette,that’s lucy?
5803,Bernadette,"they thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
4463,Bernadette,"yeah, well, you throw like a girl."
6104,Bernadette,"nowitzki. i googled her, she’s pretty cute."
4037,Bernadette,and ugly.
5556,Bernadette,or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.
6073,Bernadette,"yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
4252,Bernadette,"no, no!"
3508,Bernadette,maybe you need to think about it a little.
5288,Bernadette,"oh, i don’t know. this is all so new to me. i’m still processing."
4553,Bernadette,you were really quiet during dinner. is everything okay?
5317,Bernadette,"so, i’m your seventh choice."
5699,Bernadette,fell asleep?
4303,Bernadette,"you know, i’m kind of glad this happened."
4239,Bernadette,"no, i’m not. i married him. on purpose. come here."
5228,Bernadette,"don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
5525,Bernadette,can’t drink.
4135,Bernadette,"oh, no."
4855,Bernadette,"thanks. little warning before you jump into this marriage business. you’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family."
3939,Bernadette,"come back in, sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. he looks friendly. i think he might be someone’s pet."
3491,Bernadette,"oh, yeah? does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?"
3737,Bernadette,we were hoping you’d know a place.
3707,Bernadette,go home.
4244,Bernadette,i got it.
4697,Bernadette,"yes, i am, there’s a few more things i want to say to you. stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, i’d like to buy it right now."
4451,Bernadette,"well, there was action, it was funny. i mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?"
3825,Bernadette,"okay, well, wish me luck."
4276,Bernadette,"we’re so proud of you, amy. your first bikini wax."
5548,Bernadette,a little. and it doesn’t help that i’ve got this heightened sense of smell.
4487,Bernadette,"hey, you don’t think i’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
5377,Bernadette,"turns out yeah, i didn’t think twice about it."
5476,Bernadette,"ooh, work that thing."
4874,Bernadette,"okay, calm down. you’re not his father, he’s not your father. nobody’s anybody’s father."
4002,Bernadette,do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
5722,Bernadette,it’s okay.
4295,Bernadette,here.
3736,Bernadette,sure.
4490,Bernadette,what’s going on?
6139,Bernadette,no!
3895,Bernadette,do you guys think it was a mistake? am i the bad guy in this?
4864,Bernadette,"don’t be. you are built for pharmaceutical sales. you’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
5610,Bernadette,and bring back the bear.
4727,Bernadette,what are you talking about?
5043,Bernadette,"okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea."
3839,Bernadette,i’m nice to everyone.
4301,Bernadette,the tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
4008,Bernadette,i’m a very vengeful person.
5935,Bernadette,yeah. i may have just left my infant daughter with patrick and spongebob.
5133,Bernadette,because you have a wife.
5254,Bernadette,"i think if raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it."
3967,Bernadette,"god, they’re cute. oh, why did they have to be cute?"
5160,Bernadette,aw. i’m gonna miss her.
5508,Bernadette,we’ll find another time to tell him i’m pregnant.
4866,Bernadette,"maybe. but like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. anyway, i talked you up to dan. he’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you."
5544,Bernadette,"no, no, no. come on in."
5293,Bernadette,i hope the boys don’t get too crazy in mexico.
5934,Bernadette,you guys got this? do you need me to come home?
4194,Bernadette,"how you doing, howie? you feeling a little better?"
5812,Bernadette,"actually, it’s been ready for weeks."
5913,Bernadette,"it’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
4193,Bernadette,you’re going to be fine. you survived that weight watchers cruise with your mom. and they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
3779,Bernadette,i don’t know. i’m not a very good liar. they kind of whup that out of you in catholic school.
3597,Bernadette,"howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move."
4604,Bernadette,"well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
3525,Bernadette,"ooh, i love your shoes."
3744,Bernadette,that’s kind of creepy.
3821,Bernadette,you mean sexual intercourse?
3703,Bernadette,oh! already? why don’t you stay over?
5470,Bernadette,i brought you a little care package from work. it’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
3738,Bernadette,"but you could if you wanted to, right?"
4130,Bernadette,that wasn’t going to be our processional music.
3702,Bernadette,me too.
4347,Bernadette,what kind of comics do the guys like?
3745,Bernadette,"i feel like i’m supposed to say that bitch, but i don’t have enough information."
4274,Bernadette,"well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story."
4105,Bernadette,is there anything else about your past i should know?
4253,Bernadette,"yeah, doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us."
4331,Bernadette,think harder.
5442,Bernadette,"no, they’re not."
5942,Bernadette,"and leonard loves you so much, he married you twice. "
3764,Bernadette,i do. amy and sheldon sitting in a tree. k-i-s-s-s-s-i-n-g.
3705,Bernadette,"it’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap."
4438,Bernadette,i’m sorry. i should have left it alone.
3721,Bernadette,"well, i don’t really have much of anything in the house."
5233,Bernadette,"properly, at all. it’s just words i’ve never heard."
6041,Bernadette,you have everything she needs for day care?
5549,Bernadette,"yeah. the other day i sniffed out where howie hid the girl scout cookies. no more tagalongs, my ass."
4594,Bernadette,"cool. at my lab, i performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
4131,Bernadette,"so, what do you say, amy?"
3564,Bernadette,really uncomfortable.
5943,Bernadette,careful. the sound of crying can make me lactate.
5083,Bernadette,you’re right. now where did we land on my bathroom?
4161,Bernadette,and the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
5918,Bernadette,"you’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
3515,Bernadette,"howard, we’ve only been on three dates. we haven’t even had sex yet."
5799,Bernadette,sounds expensive.
5842,Bernadette,"i did that, too."
4422,Bernadette,"howie, you okay?"
3549,Bernadette,"you’re not jealous of leonard, are you?"
4320,Bernadette,"sorry, raj, it’s girls’ night out."
3622,Bernadette,i thought it was pretty spicy. especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
4659,Bernadette,well…
5985,Bernadette,that sounds awful.
4787,Bernadette,are you gonna take it?
4290,Bernadette,"well, that doesn’t make sense, either."
4362,Bernadette,were they expensive?
5262,Bernadette,"ooh, i like when you take charge."
6030,Bernadette,i’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
4167,Bernadette,it doesn’t sound like it.
5751,Bernadette,thank you. i feel better now.
3714,Bernadette,"no, it’s not great. you need to make a choice. me or your mother."
4498,Bernadette,it’s fine. i thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
4980,Bernadette,"well, sure. there’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. so even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him."
4652,Bernadette,"yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
5577,Bernadette,since when do you work on weekends?
5148,Bernadette,"um, well, it’s, uh, black. there’s a red ribbon tied to the handle."
4503,Bernadette,sorry. i have no point. that was a stupid thing to say. can we please just go back to having a nice time?
6127,Bernadette,why can’t she drive herself?
3674,Bernadette,"howard, it’s not a contest. i love you. i want to be with you."
4158,Bernadette,was she upset?
4518,Bernadette,"howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. that’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. "
4845,Bernadette,"me, too."
5362,Bernadette,"all right. let’s start over. i’m redecorating. the furniture, the carpeting, the walls. i’m changing everything that depresses me when i look at it. try not to be one of those things."
4728,Bernadette,"wow. well, what did you say?"
4299,Bernadette,sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
5531,Bernadette,"fine. we were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
5420,Bernadette,okay. so where’s he taking you?
3886,Bernadette,"oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!"
5706,Bernadette,"oh, thanks. you know, i just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
5972,Bernadette,"if he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
5082,Bernadette,i guess that would be all right.
4713,Bernadette,excuse me. you are at valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. now get back over there and be with her.
3482,Bernadette,are you sure?
3523,Bernadette,why not?
5660,Bernadette,but we did get to see a live stream of it on the internet.
3733,Bernadette,hi.
5730,Bernadette,i don’t even know where to begin.
5374,Bernadette,aftershock.
5711,Bernadette,thank you.
3937,Bernadette,thank you.
4658,Bernadette,but then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.
5400,Bernadette,"ugh, i hear that."
4420,Bernadette,"oh, my god, it’s beautiful. look, he found the juggling pins i hid."
4448,Bernadette,i think that’s enough wine for now.
3729,Bernadette,i have to take you?
3904,Bernadette,"i just did what i did because i love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than i can handle."
4229,Bernadette,"hey, i just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. i’m gonna be washing paint out of my smurf for a month."
4263,Bernadette,"so, is there anything i can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
4469,Bernadette,it’s fine. where’d you get that picture of her?
3569,Bernadette,"sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
3823,Bernadette,how can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
3828,Bernadette,"no, because i’m engaged to a putz. you let me believe i was the reason she had a heart attack."
5747,Bernadette,"once, i was supposed to babysit my brothers. our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
5589,Bernadette,"uh, raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store."
4078,Bernadette,metrosexual my ass.
3928,Bernadette,"amy, you’re not a tumour. penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. . "
5369,Bernadette,fine. then the dining room.
5725,Bernadette,not really.
3598,Bernadette,really.
3938,Bernadette,"i specialize in microorganisms, and amy studies brains."
4752,Bernadette,what are you doing?
4129,Bernadette,"so anyway, we decided to go down to city hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when howard gets back."
6098,Bernadette,bring it in.
4424,Bernadette,did you read it?
5239,Bernadette,why don’t you just call tech support?
5906,Bernadette,"i’ve been seeing him for years, i’m still not convinced he’s real."
4661,Bernadette,the one in the turtleneck is cute.
5128,Bernadette,please?
5003,Bernadette,we brought snacks for movie night.
3742,Bernadette,"oh, god, that is so romantic."
4436,Bernadette,i made him tell us.
4759,Bernadette,"hi, stuart."
5804,Bernadette,"i’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?"
5451,Bernadette,nobody thought that.
5139,Bernadette,"i understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. and it’s just furniture."
5010,Bernadette,"ooh, i have an idea. maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over."
5514,Bernadette,"i know, it’s crazy."
4933,Bernadette,nope.
4217,Bernadette,he’s an experimental physicist.
4234,Bernadette,"you, out! you are being very rude."
4450,Bernadette,walk.
3944,Bernadette,i didn’t have any.
4146,Bernadette,sheldon! i told you no klingon.
4492,Bernadette,"aw, i love you, too. if i don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, i’ll meet you in dreamland."
5679,Bernadette,"not just leonard and penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
5893,Bernadette,"thank you, sheldon, i’m feeling better now."
5492,Bernadette,"uh, wish we had a skimmer."
4409,Bernadette,what if someone looks in there?
4989,Bernadette,why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
4204,Bernadette,"no, i told them they could have you tomorrow night. tonight, you belong to me.  "
5564,Bernadette,sure.
5478,Bernadette,"oh. well, i guess that’s not so bad."
5591,Bernadette,"i didn’t, but raj volunteered."
4602,Bernadette,then you made her cry and leave.
3888,Bernadette,"no, i’ve just been thinking. it doesn’t matter if i’m afraid for your safety. i don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
6054,Bernadette,so you wanted to learn something physical and you came to howard wolowitz?
4406,Bernadette,"well, hello, prince charming."
4306,Bernadette,"so, dad, have you done any fishing lately?"
5159,Bernadette,what’s happening?
4063,Bernadette,get that guy! get that guy! pew! pew! pew! pew!
4810,Bernadette,"i’d tell you what i do with howard, but i don’t think dressing up like a catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with sheldon."
4046,Bernadette,"hi, sweetie."
4818,Bernadette,"no. my dad controlled the tv, so unless someone was a texas ranger, jake or the fatman, we didn’t see it."
5280,Bernadette,what happened? they just got married.
5496,Bernadette,"um, i don’t know, look it up on your phone. i’m gonna wrap it in a towel."
5248,Bernadette,"okay, i don’t know when i became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. you guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom."
5093,Bernadette,so your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
3924,Bernadette,"yes, absolutely fine."
5454,Bernadette,"sure he does. well, let us know when you’re all settled in."
3881,Bernadette,okay.
4570,Bernadette,like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
4711,Bernadette,are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to napa? you could probably still get a room.
3851,Bernadette,take me home now.
3605,Bernadette,"joy, this is leonard. leonard, this is joy."
5629,Bernadette,so what do you want to do tonight?
4862,Bernadette,"yeah. i don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
5169,Bernadette,"howie, what’s wrong?"
4943,Bernadette,you sure?
5568,Bernadette,you’ve tried to work with him before. it hasn’t gone well. why is this time gonna be any different?
4461,Bernadette,"well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
3932,Bernadette,so is that a yes?
4948,Bernadette,amy.
5458,Bernadette,"howie, i don’t want to play lego, toenail or pill anymore. so, what do you think we should do with this room?"
3957,Bernadette,kind of sounds like you were. and maybe a felon.
4947,Bernadette,we are.
4200,Bernadette,he’s coming back from outer space.
5341,Bernadette,why does your fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
3933,Bernadette,"we’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
5709,Bernadette,"are you kidding? i’ve always been treated differently. look at me. listen to me. i mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s i wonder if her mommy"
4522,Bernadette,"oh, that happened right after you left."
4824,Bernadette,"and even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun."
4769,Bernadette,so one of us went back in time to kill stuart?
4773,Bernadette,"penny did it, i win. suck it, jackasses."
4389,Bernadette,"guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in."
3883,Bernadette,no.
5876,Bernadette,hi.
5073,Bernadette,who’s been paying for my coffee?
5365,Bernadette,"okay, listen, i’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
3683,Bernadette,"sure. i think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. it’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. as a microbiologist, i can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
5940,Bernadette,"you think that stuff is fun? being a parent is terrifying. i’m constantly worried, i’m always tired, and in a few minutes i’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
4579,Bernadette,"in the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
4627,Bernadette,it’s okay.
4807,Bernadette,how’s your soup?
5345,Bernadette,"i don’t know. stuart, can you come in here? he tried to explain it to me. it shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game."
4591,Bernadette,maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
5062,Bernadette,"i did say that, didn’t i?"
4780,Bernadette,but no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what i was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
4030,Bernadette,"i don’t know. my dad’s pretty insistent on it, though."
3634,Bernadette,here we go.
4053,Bernadette,survival training? is that like camping?
4703,Bernadette,"la-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
3687,Bernadette,are you guys doing okay?
5970,Bernadette,i appreciate it.
5304,Bernadette,did you change yours to married yet?
5488,Bernadette,are you gonna tell emily?
4400,Bernadette,we can’t all be cinderella.
5867,Bernadette,i’m so thirsty. give me more ice chips.
5077,Bernadette,i feel so bad.
5260,Bernadette,"i know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick."
5066,Bernadette,thank you.
5958,Bernadette,"oh, dear god, you’re cheating on me with raj. "
4576,Bernadette,why tomorrow?
5578,Bernadette,not with lightning mcqueen here.
6123,Bernadette,he didn’t try them yet!
4912,Bernadette,he’s so nice.
5829,Bernadette,"okay, call him and show him. i dare you."
4254,Bernadette,"every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes."
5769,Bernadette,"keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
5968,Bernadette,thank you.
6141,Bernadette,hey.
5316,Bernadette,aw. i’m honoured.
5687,Bernadette,i don’t believe this.
3532,Bernadette,that’s amazing.
6064,Bernadette,"seriously, where were you?"
5632,Bernadette,yeah.
5029,Bernadette,hi.
5383,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy."
4815,Bernadette,"me, too. although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a death star cake."
4919,Bernadette,last night was fun. what did you think of emily?
5381,Bernadette,it’s an actual i’ll think about it.
5989,Bernadette,"you know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
3602,Bernadette,"be patient, we’ll get there."
4802,Bernadette,howie.
4474,Bernadette,sorry’s not good enough. maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
4351,Bernadette,"i don’t think it’s heavy. it’s some sort of magic, so only thor can lift it."
4868,Bernadette,"penny, i wouldn’t have put you up for this job if i didn’t think you could handle it."
5566,Bernadette,"howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with sheldon cooper."
5371,Bernadette,"hey, raj. dad and i were just talking about taking down this wall."
5207,Bernadette,"if this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will."
4535,Bernadette,"don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. he can fix things."
4758,Bernadette,"no, in fact, he was so well-behaved, howie bought him a buzz aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream."
4749,Bernadette,serial ape-ist? i thought you died in that.
5384,Bernadette,"ooh, tall. finally some details about this mystery man."
4710,Bernadette,"well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
4488,Bernadette,"so, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
5524,Bernadette,where?
5649,Bernadette,"wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than i thought."
5321,Bernadette,stuart. he’s been living with us for a while now. i’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.
5715,Bernadette,got a minute?
5966,Bernadette,no.
4629,Bernadette,want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
6065,Bernadette,why?
4811,Bernadette,of course.
3713,Bernadette,"that’s it? that’s your big solution to all of our problems? if your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?"
5976,Bernadette,and you live here for free.
5939,Bernadette,you’re upset i had a baby?
3739,Bernadette,"pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?"
6035,Bernadette,"well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. i’m going back to work after only four months, so i’ve learned i hate myself, i hate sloths, and i hate you for bringing me here."
3747,Bernadette,oh. that bitch!
5818,Bernadette,"look at that, put them in a tiny flash t-shirt and it’s you."
5516,Bernadette,"i don’t know, howie."
4674,Bernadette,hey.
5040,Bernadette,so there are things you don’t like.
3625,Bernadette,yeah.
3735,Bernadette,"we just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing."
3650,Bernadette,he’s really cute. how do you know him?
3551,Bernadette,"hey, leonard. am i too late to see the experiment? oh, hi."
5100,Bernadette,what’s he talking about?
5950,Bernadette,"oh, my god, you really are spoiled."
5744,Bernadette,"raj, why don’t i care about anything?"
4611,Bernadette,i guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
4501,Bernadette,"boy, these drinks are strong. hoo, mama, i’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight."
3898,Bernadette,"i do, with all my heart."
5997,Bernadette,"yeah, i wish i had that with howard."
3711,Bernadette,great.
4370,Bernadette,those chinese acrobats in cirque du soleil made it look so easy.
5284,Bernadette,"i’m mad at you for blabbing to me what leonard did on the north sea, and i’m mad that i’ve had to hide this from penny for two years."
5310,Bernadette,it’s understandable. amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon.
3485,Bernadette,no.
3931,Bernadette,"no. i, i want you to be the maid of honour."
4622,Bernadette,what are they doing?
4028,Bernadette,are you mad at me?
4256,Bernadette,i don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
4195,Bernadette,okay.
4925,Bernadette,"come on, look how pretty you are. i’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you."
5501,Bernadette,are you okay?
4308,Bernadette,"howie, i think you’d have fun."
4589,Bernadette,hi.
5403,Bernadette,we got to get out of here.
3793,Bernadette,i suppose i could get them back to talking about leonard going to india to meet priya’s parents.
5290,Bernadette,"oh, me neither, not until just now."
5522,Bernadette,"easy for you to say, skinny bitch. sorry, hormones."
4600,Bernadette,"we did, you never brought it."
3700,Bernadette,it’s cute. you sound a little like a drunken monkey. ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
4967,Bernadette,i told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
5229,Bernadette,i was kidding. of course you are.
4363,Bernadette,how?
3554,Bernadette,"no, leonard, you should hear this."
4211,Bernadette,i thought you liked halloween.
4106,Bernadette,okay.
4393,Bernadette,joke?
5816,Bernadette,"amy, i’m sorry, i shouldn’t have said anything."
3601,Bernadette,"oh, not now. we’re starting a new relationship. i need to get to know you again."
4064,Bernadette,pew!
5662,Bernadette,who’s going to officiate?
5778,Bernadette,"let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny."
4017,Bernadette,oh. is that cute or creepy?
3724,Bernadette,what?
4040,Bernadette,what will you tell amy?
4877,Bernadette,great. when?
5825,Bernadette,where did you get that?
5409,Bernadette,"we are, and i believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh."
5270,Bernadette,our pleasure. you feeling okay?
4990,Bernadette,"i was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad."
3555,Bernadette,"what do you think, leonard? should i give him another chance?"
4623,Bernadette,so why don’t you do that with them?
3527,Bernadette,i’ve been meaning to go over there.
5175,Bernadette,i love that.
4398,Bernadette,"i don’t know about you guys, but i’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover."
4098,Bernadette,wait a minute. you set me up with howard. did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
4380,Bernadette,they do look happy.
5215,Bernadette,why don’t you help with the coffee?
4365,Bernadette,"at any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?"
3599,Bernadette,"me, too."
3734,Bernadette,we’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
3654,Bernadette,what’s the matter?
4228,Bernadette,"no, if i’m there alone, people might think i’m just a really short person from avatar."
5146,Bernadette,eight sixteen.
5635,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, i have to ask."
3875,Bernadette,i always catch your drift.
5111,Bernadette,"well, now we have two reasons."
3590,Bernadette,does that mean slutty trolls?
3648,Bernadette,"oh, thanks. howard gave it to me. it’s the cutest thing. every time i have dinner with his mom, the next day i get jewellery."
5081,Bernadette,i can’t let you do that.
6004,Bernadette,already cleared the browser history.
3996,Bernadette,"this is so exciting. if leonard and penny get back together, howard and i can go on double dates with them."
3757,Bernadette,yes.
5661,Bernadette,howie? you doing okay? you’ve been in there a while.
3522,Bernadette,what?
4736,Bernadette,"you’re right, it’s great."
6076,Bernadette,"hey, that’s amazing."
5060,Bernadette,"oh, yeah? you one of those people?"
5891,Bernadette,how can she hate me? i make her food in my chest. it’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
5213,Bernadette,"so, josh, what do you do?"
5164,Bernadette,not a chance.
5767,Bernadette,next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
5561,Bernadette,"i know, but…"
3941,Bernadette,"look how sweet he is. come over and say hi. come on. you can do it. don’t be scared. come on. oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
4838,Bernadette,"howie, i’m back!"
5306,Bernadette,what about your sister’s wedding?
4991,Bernadette,"it was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
5602,Bernadette,no.
4873,Bernadette,howie?
3600,Bernadette,mm! what are you doing?
5432,Bernadette,just come in.
4545,Bernadette,they’re here first. this is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
6062,Bernadette,terrified.
3889,Bernadette,"really. if going into space means that much to you, i will never say another word about it."
4701,Bernadette,"well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
4168,Bernadette,do you tell him that?
5616,Bernadette,"hey, raj."
3591,Bernadette,thank you.
3567,Bernadette,when howard tried to do the splits…
4011,Bernadette,"oh, that’s nice."
4608,Bernadette,"hi, dad."
4102,Bernadette,howie?
5704,Bernadette,why did you do that?
4012,Bernadette,ooh!
6046,Bernadette,"thank you. okay, i’m gonna try and get some work done."
3473,Bernadette,that works.
5537,Bernadette,that sounds fun.
5497,Bernadette,anything else?
3955,Bernadette,what about you?
6116,Bernadette,"they say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow."
6097,Bernadette,i made us have a baby.
4797,Bernadette,how?
4344,Bernadette,the comic book store isn’t far from here.
4278,Bernadette,"okay. so, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?"
5866,Bernadette,"here comes another one. hey, squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right."
3790,Bernadette,"he can’t have a hobby? excuse me, i have to pee. or is that implausible, as well?"
3907,Bernadette,"oh, my god, howard! what did you do?"
3813,Bernadette,that’s what you ordered.
5907,Bernadette,"uh oh, what’s going on?"
3961,Bernadette,every other week i serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
5349,Bernadette,doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
4795,Bernadette,i’m excited to meet emily.
4437,Bernadette,i’m sorry.
4898,Bernadette,"okay. well, if you want, i could help you practice. i played a lot of softball growing up."
4633,Bernadette,no.
5914,Bernadette,wouldn’t that be nice.
4796,Bernadette,why would you say that?
5841,Bernadette,hmm. actually i just did that this morning.
4412,Bernadette,why?
6055,Bernadette,"yes, i’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
3885,Bernadette,"howard, my father was a police officer. we never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. it was horrible. and i don’t want to live that way with you."
4366,Bernadette,"i don’t believe you. howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this."
5112,Bernadette,"please, can we watch it?"
5637,Bernadette,"that’s lovely, sheldon."
5641,Bernadette,you bet.
4150,Bernadette,i can. how are you?
5528,Bernadette,i kind of already do that for howie.
4386,Bernadette,did something good happen?
4043,Bernadette,"i’ve got to go. i’ve got to get up early. my company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
5460,Bernadette,i’m being serious.
4215,Bernadette,i just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
5822,Bernadette,you do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
5123,Bernadette,"wow, even in your fantasies sheldon’s kind of exhausting."
4128,Bernadette,"we’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back."
4719,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
5505,Bernadette,"if you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested."
4687,Bernadette,"well, he’s always saying i should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
6028,Bernadette,"i just don’t know what the right thing to do is. if i go back to work, i’m abandoning halley. if i don’t go, i’m giving up everything i worked for. it’s like there’s no right choice."
6017,Bernadette,"of course, why?"
5515,Bernadette,"oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out."
5979,Bernadette,you just don’t want to go alone with sheldon.
3584,Bernadette,"well, to be honest, i…"
6111,Bernadette,can i just squeeze in here?
5275,Bernadette,"aw, that was beautiful."
5894,Bernadette,"yeah, eventually i figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
3946,Bernadette,"i’m too small for twister. and roller coasters. and sitting with my feet on the floor. hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, mom."
4029,Bernadette,"so, what are we gonna do?"
5621,Bernadette,that wasn’t nice.
4333,Bernadette,who’s involved?
5435,Bernadette,"hold on. it could be romantic. the two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy wisconsin."
3498,Bernadette,why?
5491,Bernadette,"ew, really? get it out."
4203,Bernadette,"oh, it’s just me."
3962,Bernadette,what about helping people?
4171,Bernadette,"oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. i’m basically married to a sexy buzz lightyear."
4092,Bernadette,"you ain’t goin’ anywhere, threeway."
4337,Bernadette,why?
5546,Bernadette,yeah.
4702,Bernadette,"oh, i know. there’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
5796,Bernadette,"i warned you, and i did it."
4724,Bernadette,have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
3511,Bernadette,"i can’t now, i’m working."
3845,Bernadette,that’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
3766,Bernadette,that doesn’t count. aren’t you even a little curious?
5639,Bernadette,"okay, but just for a little bit."
5667,Bernadette,"guys, come on. we’re meeting everyone for dinner."
3836,Bernadette,"oh, you let me worry about the money. i just want my baby to have pretty things."
4954,Bernadette,"oh, i’m so sorry."
5313,Bernadette,really? they didn’t eat him?
5205,Bernadette,six. seven. eight. nine. ten-ten.
6010,Bernadette,"it’s okay, i’m just being emotional about this. can you not tell howard?"
3963,Bernadette,i think mother teresa would have washed the clothes first.
4026,Bernadette,i just don’t know how i’m gonna break it to him.
5110,Bernadette,‘cause it would be fun to watch.
4352,Bernadette,no.
4574,Bernadette,it’s just sometimes i feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
5552,Bernadette,although i am getting a little machine oil. i think it’s metal.
3548,Bernadette,he says if i go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
4957,Bernadette,we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
4429,Bernadette,feel better?
3857,Bernadette,okay.
3958,Bernadette,you’re doing great.
6032,Bernadette,i’m on the day care’s website.
5563,Bernadette,"if you want to sign a contract that sheldon whipped up, go ahead."
4000,Bernadette,why do you think he asked you out again?
6008,Bernadette,and that day care is great.
5880,Bernadette,it’s like i was excited for a present and got socks.
4651,Bernadette,you’re not a lousy husband. you’re a great husband. i was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
3846,Bernadette,why would i keep clothes at your mother’s house?
5898,Bernadette,don’t make me laugh.
5609,Bernadette,i can’t tell anymore.
6011,Bernadette,"don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
6146,Bernadette,"i don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. we’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. look at me when i’m talking to you. and don’t think…"
5256,Bernadette,that’s not true. we were just laughing right in your face.
4164,Bernadette,"what about you, penny?"
3830,Bernadette,"guys, sorry i’m late. i have amazing news."
3852,Bernadette,hey. i don’t want to fight. i was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
4419,Bernadette,that’s the takeout that sheldon brought.
4992,Bernadette,i don’t know. they just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
3562,Bernadette,"so, what should we talk about?"
5952,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, raj. we really just don’t have the space."
5534,Bernadette,"i was headed to the bathroom, and i passed howie on his way out. usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here."
5190,Bernadette,of course.
4485,Bernadette,"okay, i cast a love spell on sheldon and amy."
3542,Bernadette,"oh. you got me again. this isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. excuse me."
4714,Bernadette,great. now there’s two of ’em.
4900,Bernadette,"all right, the pitcher’s mound in major league baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate."
6092,Bernadette,"come here, let’s talk."
3521,Bernadette,i don’t think i can. i don’t have howard’s street cred.
4233,Bernadette,"whoa, drinky smurf. can i talk to you for a second?"
4934,Bernadette,"howard, you know we’re saving up for a house."
4565,Bernadette,"excuse me, i need to have a chat with my husband."
5022,Bernadette,"so, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
5614,Bernadette,"wait, that’s it."
5250,Bernadette,look at that. you cleaned it up all by yourself.
5928,Bernadette,call if there’s any problems.
5946,Bernadette,that’s so sweet of you.
4343,Bernadette,"i mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. maybe we should try reading some."
5820,Bernadette,"great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
5481,Bernadette,absolutely.
3484,Bernadette,like in the bedroom or like dungeons and dragons?
6049,Bernadette,see? this is the right thing for her. let’s all just go to work.
3719,Bernadette,what did she say when you told her?
3728,Bernadette,wait a second. i’m doing your laundry?
5678,Bernadette,we’re here today to celebrate love.
5714,Bernadette,and a chocolate shake.
3684,Bernadette,i think mr. wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. but he should know that i am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
5323,Bernadette,he’ll think about it.
4516,Bernadette,let me see. how long have you been putting this on her?
4249,Bernadette,good.
5740,Bernadette,are you just gonna name all the colours?
4382,Bernadette,thank you.
5325,Bernadette,"hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, i’ll give you a thousand dollars to take stuart."
4073,Bernadette,"so, arranged marriages. the parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
5984,Bernadette,where would he stay? we already have stuart.
4978,Bernadette,sorry you guys had to see that.
3890,Bernadette,i love you.
4407,Bernadette,what you doing?
5075,Bernadette,yeah?
4755,Bernadette,hi.
3871,Bernadette,"howie, that’s wonderful! congratulations!"
3558,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, i’m starved. when you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
5975,Bernadette,it’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of halley you’ve done.
5695,Bernadette,thanks. you guys are the best.
4792,Bernadette,"poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. she’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition."
5223,Bernadette,is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
5809,Bernadette,i was hoping it’d be quieter.
5391,Bernadette,"across the street, in the left window."
4435,Bernadette,i know what was in your dad’s letter.
5331,Bernadette,stuart took that rejection like a pro.
3616,Bernadette,"gee, i don’t know if i should drink more. i have to drive home, and i’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is."
3917,Bernadette,"oh, me."
4379,Bernadette,uh-oh.
6038,Bernadette,"no, i’ll be fine. "
5670,Bernadette,you’re being ridiculous.
5542,Bernadette,"i appreciate this, but you really…"
5837,Bernadette,how come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
5592,Bernadette,"yeah, ever since you told him i was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me."
5806,Bernadette,"oh, is it your back?"
3847,Bernadette,is she moving out?
5191,Bernadette,it’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
4751,Bernadette,that was ten years ago.
5446,Bernadette,"no, it’s okay."
5259,Bernadette,maybe raj is right. maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
3771,Bernadette,"amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before."
5963,Bernadette,"you said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
4163,Bernadette,"so, you actually see you and sheldon getting married someday?"
4036,Bernadette,that is big.
3827,Bernadette,your mother just taught it to me. she thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure i was okay.
4987,Bernadette,what would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
5901,Bernadette,"don’t make me cry, either."
3862,Bernadette,your mom and i made you breakfast.
4497,Bernadette,you’re right. thank you.
5008,Bernadette,"my prom was pretty terrible, too. i was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. he spent the whole night talking about her."
5924,Bernadette,"sure. open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. wash it or burn in, your choice. ugh, be right back."
3670,Bernadette,do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
4243,Bernadette,there’s a book under here.
4998,Bernadette,"that’s for me to decide, not you."
5495,Bernadette,"no. no, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. we need to save it."
3773,Bernadette,we’re really not that close.
4843,Bernadette,i’m glad i got that mocha. and you know what else i’m glad about? i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car.
4054,Bernadette,do you sleep in tents?
5584,Bernadette,go hide.
4809,Bernadette,we kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
4747,Bernadette,"raj, your tag’s sticking out."
3696,Bernadette,sexually.
4115,Bernadette,wait. i don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
4566,Bernadette,well?
6014,Bernadette,stuart made it.
4214,Bernadette,leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.
4397,Bernadette,"penny, what did you say?"
5462,Bernadette,"yeah. you know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
3893,Bernadette,i had no choice. i had to tell his mother. he can’t go to space. he’s like a baby bird. do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
4599,Bernadette,"no, but we knew that."
6066,Bernadette,oh. what’d she say?
4901,Bernadette,keep going.
5919,Bernadette,i finally got halley to sleep.
5187,Bernadette,"you know, you can leave one side up and play against it."
5755,Bernadette,are we being silly not finding out the sex?
4885,Bernadette,i know.
4361,Bernadette,"oh, howie, i love these."
4529,Bernadette,i’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. the slowest bullet in the world.
4839,Bernadette,sorry.
3948,Bernadette,"well, yeah, i guess they’re not engaged like me and howie."
3863,Bernadette,"yeah, i guess. we’re very different people, howard, so communication’s a little tricky."
5953,Bernadette,what if you stop helping?
5299,Bernadette,your hair?
3918,Bernadette,that’s so sweet.
4312,Bernadette,how’s the poor thing?
5044,Bernadette,who were you in couples therapy with?
3725,Bernadette,"no. i, i might have some cheddar."
5281,Bernadette,think they’ll break up?
4032,Bernadette,"i should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. but don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. it’s more of a fashion statement."
4088,Bernadette,i’ve actually been thinking i’m going to hyphenate: bernadette mary-ann rostenkowski-wolowitz.
5412,Bernadette,that he’s an ass? he beat you to it.
3921,Bernadette,we thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. i feel terrible.
3916,Bernadette,i don’t know. dead people’s dresses?
3490,Bernadette,i know how you feel. my mother makes me crazy.
3631,Bernadette,knock-knock.
4512,Bernadette,i made some brownies. you want one?
3942,Bernadette,"oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. and after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
4218,Bernadette,"yeah, you mentioned it once or twice."
5884,Bernadette,it took me two hours to get her down.
4004,Bernadette,relax. you know leonard’s always been crazy about you. it’s gonna be great.
3543,Bernadette,sure.
4631,Bernadette,howie. 
5308,Bernadette,"that’s a joke, right?"
5389,Bernadette,"i’ll just call the restaurant, pretend i’m amy and check the reservation."
5028,Bernadette,they’re yours in the divorce.
5314,Bernadette,the breakfast meat family?
5719,Bernadette,"hey, i learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch."
5835,Bernadette,"stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift."
3909,Bernadette,"this is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
4285,Bernadette,"i don’t have to take this. i’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. maybe i’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. which sounds dirty, but i didn’t mean it that way,"
5393,Bernadette,"kinda. before i met howie, i liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends."
5390,Bernadette,"yeah, but i’m little, so it’s adorable."
4812,Bernadette,"between penny’s gorilla movie and howard’s gorilla mother, i had no choice."
4428,Bernadette,really? are you sure?
4572,Bernadette,hi.
4452,Bernadette,why does this bother you so much?
3692,Bernadette,"most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
4708,Bernadette,"honestly, i thought when i got married i would, but i still kind of feel like i’m pretending. it doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from gap kids."
3726,Bernadette,okay.
4888,Bernadette,"that sounds fun, but i promised penny i’d come by and help her study."
5776,Bernadette,"wait, i have my ipad."
3788,Bernadette,"maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?"
4846,Bernadette,you were right.
3640,Bernadette,"right. help, i’m a prisoner in a chinese fortune cookie factory."
4447,Bernadette,glad you’re feeling better.
4986,Bernadette,"so, what are you working on these days?"
3770,Bernadette,"oh, i’m sorry, i’m engaged."
6075,Bernadette,so you’re gonna be roommates with bert?
3693,Bernadette,what do you say?
5232,Bernadette,"well, i’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
5633,Bernadette,yeah.
3720,Bernadette,"this is so great. i love you, howard."
5967,Bernadette,i really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
6024,Bernadette,"no, what is wrong with you?"
5015,Bernadette,i saw a picture of you two dancing together.
4541,Bernadette,can you reach the clue?
5636,Bernadette,what is it about trains that you like so much?
4180,Bernadette,"oh, sure, you had no choice."
4165,Bernadette,do you think you and leonard might ever get married?
4247,Bernadette,why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
5326,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. i just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
5134,Bernadette,"i know you don’t like stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, i’m sure he’ll get back on his feet."
4481,Bernadette,i say we attack the big one.
5774,Bernadette,"lock the door, lock the door."
5824,Bernadette,who is it?
3641,Bernadette,"howard, help me out of the tub! i’m stuck again!"
6124,Bernadette,who is it?
4502,Bernadette,"i just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, sheldon."
5498,Bernadette,he’s eating. that’s a good sign.
5859,Bernadette,i’m sorry. it’s our first time.
5335,Bernadette,what can it hurt?
3556,Bernadette,"come here, tushy face."
4459,Bernadette,"yeah. i never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, i felt like maybe someday we could do it."
5626,Bernadette,"gee, sheldon, i don’t know."
4695,Bernadette,i don’t think i like the way you’re treating my friend.
5625,Bernadette,me? how? why?
4559,Bernadette,howard.
5510,Bernadette,i don’t know. maybe it says something on the back.
3802,Bernadette,"well, i wouldn’t worry about it. it’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
5482,Bernadette,"howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this."
3514,Bernadette,then you’re insane.
5244,Bernadette,maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.
4172,Bernadette,there’s my hubby. how’s everything going up there?
4706,Bernadette,should we leave?
5064,Bernadette,"okay, sorry. can we just go? i feel like everybody hates me."
4090,Bernadette,funny. you boys have a nice time?
4153,Bernadette,"you said you told her, but you never did!"
5163,Bernadette,"yeah, we should."
3474,Bernadette,strike two.
3568,Bernadette,with marbles?
3606,Bernadette,isn’t she a pip?
4176,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
3878,Bernadette,what did you think was going to happen?
4823,Bernadette,happy star wars day.
5983,Bernadette,"oh, we’re smarter than that."
3678,Bernadette,are you saying you don’t think i’m hot enough to go out with a guy like glenn?
4861,Bernadette,"so, she’s not too much for you?"
3775,Bernadette,you think?
3659,Bernadette,"hang on. it’s leonard. hi, leonard."
4932,Bernadette,fine. what is it?
5200,Bernadette,"except, raj is gonna win. isn’t that right, raj?"
4840,Bernadette,they only had regular yoghurt. i had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
5252,Bernadette,"the only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, i guess i don’t see the harm in it."
5045,Bernadette,was it your mom?
3756,Bernadette,"howard, let me just stop you right here."
5063,Bernadette,where? to babies r us?
6012,Bernadette,"stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner."
5202,Bernadette,hey.
5941,Bernadette,"you may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great."
5615,Bernadette,isn’t that the best?
4964,Bernadette,"speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, sheldon?"
6019,Bernadette,fine.
4470,Bernadette,"oh, thank god she’s okay."
6084,Bernadette,"well, distance might be nice. the last time a big project ended for howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. he even went with me to get a mammogram."
4335,Bernadette,"well, alex is your employee. if she’s doing something that’s making leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her."
5541,Bernadette,"me, too."
3919,Bernadette,i told you that would happen.
4310,Bernadette,what thing?
3534,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, show me. in microbiology, the most exciting thing i get to work with is yeast."
3566,Bernadette,"i don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
4372,Bernadette,should we go back and rescue him?
5752,Bernadette,it would help if you stopped telling me i have a textbook cervix.
5888,Bernadette,"no they’re not, you bozo. how come stuart can get her to stop crying, but i can’t?"
3901,Bernadette,i know. i’m sorry. i got scared.
3533,Bernadette,are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
5177,Bernadette,did she throw anything away?
5398,Bernadette,i took a video. i forgot how much fun this is.
6002,Bernadette,no problem.
5408,Bernadette,"the soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours."
4630,Bernadette,"come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here."
5586,Bernadette,it’s okay. they apologized.
4455,Bernadette,absolutely. all we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.
4913,Bernadette,"howie, i am so proud of you."
5843,Bernadette,howard just did that.
3879,Bernadette,howard.
4544,Bernadette,let’s go.
4506,Bernadette,good night.
3479,Bernadette,microbiology.
4721,Bernadette,"oh, that sounds so romantic."
5960,Bernadette,it’s so hard to say no to you.
6153,Bernadette,"oh, it’s raj. everything okay?"
6152,Bernadette,"okay. thanks, daddy. he said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
4924,Bernadette,"when you go to emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. it’s fine."
5295,Bernadette,"speaking of sheldon, how’s single life treating you?"
5359,Bernadette,"pause the game, howard."
5465,Bernadette,"no, that’s not what this feeling is. is it?"
5106,Bernadette,what happened?
4995,Bernadette,"amy, what did you say?"
3903,Bernadette,really? you got seasick on pirates of the caribbean.
5652,Bernadette,i might just take you up on that.
4662,Bernadette,never mind.
5046,Bernadette,it was your mom.
4116,Bernadette,"no. that’s not how i want to start our marriage, killing your dream. we’ll have the wedding when you get back."
5611,Bernadette,i hear that.
4119,Bernadette,"but, howie, my dad can be a bully. he’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
5035,Bernadette,"it’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. but sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. you get it, right?"
5922,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t. i also skipped a birthing class to see zootopia so back off."
5414,Bernadette,i can’t.
5324,Bernadette,i can’t believe sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
5346,Bernadette,can you show us that dating app?
4848,Bernadette,you guys propose all the time. this never happens.
4650,Bernadette,this is stupid. why are we fighting?
4123,Bernadette,"oh, howie. a little star, it’s beautiful. put it on me."
3496,Bernadette,oh!
6031,Bernadette,i don’t like when you imitate me.
5655,Bernadette,"well, we don’t exactly. i’m a microbiologist for the research team."
4091,Bernadette,that’s nice.
5692,Bernadette,"i know they would, they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant."
5297,Bernadette,good for you.
3973,Bernadette,"mmm, yeah, sure."
4895,Bernadette,i can’t believe you’re sore.
4034,Bernadette,"so the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
5543,Bernadette,what kind of cake do you like?
3899,Bernadette,can we talk?
3621,Bernadette,um.
159,Amy,as am i. 
704,Amy,"i think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. it’s like a vacation for your teeth."
200,Amy,"well, then prepare to be terrified. if your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department."
2260,Amy,hello.
2584,Amy,all right.
305,Amy,"you’re being too literal. my point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
2604,Amy,"so, no one else knows about this?"
373,Amy,"ninety-nine, one hundred. it’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. my turn."
2890,Amy,are you saying you’d like to live with me?
3244,Amy,"sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, i’ll tell you the first ground rule. i make the ground rules."
492,Amy,"i’m just saying, second base is right there."
1050,Amy,"oh, and, uh, check this out. i took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us."
568,Amy,how about donating some of your clothes?
1784,Amy,but they play barry manilow.
250,Amy,"well, well, well. look who it is."
3149,Amy,"oh, no. are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?"
416,Amy,"if it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
419,Amy,glad to hear it. i need someone to accompany me to the wedding of dr. moranelli and dr. gustufson this friday. they’re kind of the brad and angelina of the primatology department.
2078,Amy,"i guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple."
2378,Amy,"no, it, it, it’s okay. keep going?"
476,Amy,"i don’t know, four or five years."
661,Amy,"oh, what a great movie."
3017,Amy,good. then you’re used to this.
1419,Amy,it’s true. none of you would know me. you wouldn’t know bernadette. you wouldn’t be dating penny.
1487,Amy,"well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?"
1614,Amy,included?
2416,Amy,"okay, i’m glad you’re not here?"
573,Amy,"i was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. i don’t know about bernadette."
2765,Amy,"oh, my, this is a big step."
1926,Amy,"no, i love it."
800,Amy,"sheldon, that was beautiful."
2143,Amy,pg. some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
1970,Amy,"sheldon. sheldon, i’m worried about you. you’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell."
2904,Amy,hi.
1048,Amy,"yes. i did good, right?"
252,Amy,"four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?"
932,Amy,in sheldon’s spot.
426,Amy,"when you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
988,Amy,the two of them? i don’t understand.
3298,Amy,i thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
1267,Amy,it was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
501,Amy,"hey, cuddles."
957,Amy,maybe we should start with that.
1517,Amy,"what do you think, sheldon?"
1396,Amy,sheldon.
1686,Amy,they just don’t appreciate you.
3137,Amy,"hey, sheldon, i found a great restaurant for date night."
469,Amy,"uh, i was hoping you wouldn’t notice. irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
916,Amy,i feel like i’m five pounds lighter.
1673,Amy,that’s cute.
3025,Amy,"that’s not a real thing, he’s just joking."
2027,Amy,no.
2386,Amy,i heard that new mexican place on green street is good.
1357,Amy,"wow, penny, good job."
831,Amy,"hmm, that’s weird."
549,Amy,how did you get into my apartment?
2611,Amy,"well, i feel closer to you now."
3218,Amy,"come on, sheldon. maybe we should just eat at our place."
3407,Amy,"that’s what you said to me when i started dating him. and then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
2010,Amy,"sheldon, we’re all scientists. i helped out a fellow colleague. you’re being petty."
678,Amy,no. damage is done.
3187,Amy,"wait, wait, wait, what’s leonard lying about?"
575,Amy,how was your day?
3013,Amy,"wait, what just happened?"
1358,Amy,what are you working on?
120,Amy,i’m often flummoxed by current slang. does went out mean had intercourse?
1367,Amy,not even close.
1724,Amy,i’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
2568,Amy,do what?
2186,Amy,i said i needed time to think.
3239,Amy,"you know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
2534,Amy,"oh, do you need a minute?"
2042,Amy,"well, if i don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. and if i’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. the answer’s son."
2975,Amy,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again.
1380,Amy,"sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. you can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave."
2339,Amy,"it’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill."
1031,Amy,"sheldon, i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better. may i offer you a consoling hug?"
3154,Amy,"okay, literally any other topic."
2050,Amy,"for halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone."
2715,Amy,who’s ready for a wedding?
377,Amy,a guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? i wish i could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
881,Amy,why wouldn’t you tell leonard?
1520,Amy,see if you guys can guess this one. bang. splat. thud.
2601,Amy,"it’s okay, sheldon. you know, i’ve saved a lot of weird things, too."
104,Amy,"remember, you have to answer honestly."
321,Amy,of course. how does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? by going after its weakest member.
2087,Amy,no.
19,Amy,remarkable. did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
2450,Amy,thank you.
2164,Amy,"oh, sure, i’d love to."
2657,Amy,but you always say that you want to win a nobel prize.
1618,Amy,this is a nightmare. how will you ever make a decision?
824,Amy,"oh, yeah. i’m a man-eater now."
815,Amy,she’s not sure how she feels.
1335,Amy,poor bernadette.
3338,Amy,where are you moving?
1703,Amy,how could you let him go?
745,Amy,"oh, thank god. i’m still a maid of honour. "
1363,Amy,"they’re gonna have sex before sheldon and i do, i know it."
1741,Amy,"close enough. um, i was just calling to see what you were up tonight. thought maybe we could hit up color me mine, maybe sneak in some pinot greej. whatevs."
2481,Amy,your friend is hurting.
847,Amy,"uh, gift? uh, present!"
2811,Amy,good.
1416,Amy,"oh, i love that movie."
2891,Amy,whatever.
858,Amy,yes.
1206,Amy,and why would no one blame me?
1127,Amy,"well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense."
1886,Amy,fine. it’s sweet that you care about him so much.
181,Amy,not necessary. penny and i are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
3123,Amy,"renaissance choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?"
818,Amy,hello?
1883,Amy,fifty six.
3115,Amy,wow. he finally used it. what’d you do?
939,Amy,are you okay?
1478,Amy,"listen, um, bert, before you say anything else, i, i have a boyfriend."
926,Amy,freaking pigs.
1214,Amy,maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
1309,Amy,you know what? i don’t have time for this. find another way home.
1902,Amy,"and, yes, even shed a tear or two."
46,Amy,i’m stating it outright. babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarke-maxwell.
1085,Amy,"sadly, i’m no longer associated with that project."
597,Amy,how do you know? are you a doctor?
57,Amy,i do. i find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
59,Amy,next!
2587,Amy,i’m driving the car. i need to know.
3090,Amy,and also a little sad.
611,Amy,you okay?
2707,Amy,hi.
552,Amy,"section 5: hand-holding. hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. a: either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. b: either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a nobel prize. c: moral support during flu shots. seems a bit restrictive."
3227,Amy,i don’t know. i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.
182,Amy,"of course, we’re best friends."
1720,Amy,just give me a minute. i’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. i just need to turn it off.
290,Amy,"how come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?"
2865,Amy,it’s almost dinner time. you in the mood for anything?
2263,Amy,how’d that go?
2840,Amy,i’m sorry i mentioned it.
2560,Amy,"the video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
759,Amy,"oh, i know. i think it will go nicely with what i have prepared for dinner."
3097,Amy,yes. i’m looking at a picture of my grandma.
173,Amy,are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
1080,Amy,"because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. i’m sure she’d like to hear it."
2101,Amy,"ooh, please do, rajesh."
277,Amy,i wonder what changed her mind.
3432,Amy,"this is maid of honour amy farrah fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
2848,Amy,"there’s nothing to be afraid of, sheldon."
1042,Amy,tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
113,Amy,"well, i’m not sure how this is scored, but i believe we may have won."
3321,Amy,"all right, well, have fun."
7,Amy,"noted. now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
2457,Amy,when did you get an engagement ring?
1713,Amy,"sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect."
1679,Amy,should we do something for her?
1019,Amy,"it says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of thor."
624,Amy,"you know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. in fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. for example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. i could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  you would fetch a unicorn."
649,Amy,i want a real apology.
1232,Amy,"hello, sailor."
675,Amy,i bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. there’s a number.
899,Amy,"you’ll have to forgive me. this is my first time directing, i just want it to be good."
1746,Amy,"oh. great. i’m happy for you guys. you know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position."
907,Amy,fine. then maybe i should go.
3175,Amy,"so when i got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, i didn’t have to?"
2750,Amy,no.
538,Amy,"i don’t know. he’s nice. he’s funny. he has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. that’s kind of hot."
2676,Amy,"so, claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you."
2823,Amy,that’s true.
2277,Amy,"well, i don’t have much experience dating, so i decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
1293,Amy,sheldon. i already signed the contract. i cashed a cheque. 
2188,Amy,"you know what, sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. you’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. i don’t need any more time to think. we’re broken up."
339,Amy,i wish. a clique requires friends. i didn’t have any.
2178,Amy,there’s no guy.
1651,Amy,and you don’t feel guilty about it?
778,Amy,"this is so exciting. soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend."
16,Amy,that’s an amusing factoid.
392,Amy,will you listen to me play my harp now?
1482,Amy,don’t say that. 
1712,Amy,you were worried about that?
2066,Amy,please don’t.
2380,Amy,"i love you, too."
1708,Amy,have you not noticed that i’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
1661,Amy,"well, i was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, i wanted to make it up to you."
3064,Amy,"that was fun, thank you."
1549,Amy,you’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
154,Amy,there’s zack.
1378,Amy,they’re real.
3373,Amy,does this mean you’re okay with me going?
1492,Amy,"why can’t they do something sensible like sheldon and start their own comic book convention? also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
1908,Amy,"wow, that flag is a lifesaver."
1073,Amy,and you picked me.
3225,Amy,is that bothering you?
2069,Amy,i think i’m gonna go home.
1342,Amy,"can’t talk, in the zone."
878,Amy,"i’m raggedy ann, and he’s raggedy c-3po."
1083,Amy,"sheldon, that’s very rude. she helped you with your show. the right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play."
2009,Amy,"i did. you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
3297,Amy,"ooh, ooh. all right. we have our next caller."
2487,Amy,now?
667,Amy,you hate it.
384,Amy,how about the theme song to the classic television show diff’rent strokes? now the world don’t move to the beat…
958,Amy,"oh, i’m counting on it."
451,Amy,"who’s shocked? i’m not. so, bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? and i’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. pick me! pick me!"
1330,Amy,so you just got lucky?
132,Amy,"i was sitting in a restaurant with penny and bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. penny’s friend zack stopped by and said hello and i said hoo."
2732,Amy,i can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
484,Amy,penny and bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
2068,Amy,can’t you just tell me?
827,Amy,"oh, hello. who are you?"
271,Amy,"slow down, sheldon. i’m not quite there yet."
1960,Amy,"and if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?"
3313,Amy,to denial.
2565,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly."
1635,Amy,could have given it back to me. that was a choice.
526,Amy,"sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
1296,Amy,"yes. before all things, i’m a scientist. i’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
1404,Amy,okay.
1115,Amy,use me as a human shield!
1676,Amy,"oh, i went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
600,Amy,"me, too. out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship."
737,Amy,keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
411,Amy,"well, most recently my gynaecologist."
626,Amy,"come on, sheldon. we can be like marie curie and her husband, pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. screw beauty and the beast, that’s the love story disney should tell."
1702,Amy,actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
3419,Amy,amy farrah fowler.
1996,Amy,"he’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. it’s called good writing. and wishful thinking."
2501,Amy,i wouldn’t make too much out of howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
1099,Amy,"oh, i want to be cinderella, too."
719,Amy,like that?
1603,Amy,okay.
40,Amy,really? i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently.
148,Amy,what are you doing?
3270,Amy,"well, sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
2524,Amy,can you please just tell me why?
2756,Amy,i think we’re good.
546,Amy,yes.
1835,Amy,isn’t she lucky?
1898,Amy,"and he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
539,Amy,"no, i’m having a nice time."
500,Amy,"oh, look. it’s sheldon and little leonard. hi, little leonard."
1550,Amy,"damn it, i got cocky."
360,Amy,don’t flatter yourself. your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. i could just as easily have paralyzed you.
97,Amy,"well, that’s disappointing. i’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party."
3042,Amy,he’s been in there a long time. should i go talk to him?
2007,Amy,"well, that’s fascinating. i can’t wait to read it."
1444,Amy,"this is nice, that we all get to eat together."
2593,Amy,all of it?
2935,Amy,"wow. i, i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
564,Amy,"i think your mistake is doing it over the phone. if they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
805,Amy,not just someday. in exactly four years. but don’t tell sheldon. he’s still a flight risk.
566,Amy,i never doubted you.
133,Amy,zack.
712,Amy,"oh, that’s good."
2549,Amy,these things go for five hundred dollars and up.
412,Amy,"i’m glad to hear you say that, because i’m having a wonderful time. hmm, i said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
1578,Amy,"no. we just ended up having a lot in common. we went to harvard, we like chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting."
3006,Amy,hold on. i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
218,Amy,"so, you feeling better?"
306,Amy,"yes, dirty. dirty, dirty, dirty. which brings me to our next order of business. "
3331,Amy,what are you reading?
1285,Amy,"so, you’re okay with this?"
2013,Amy,"sheldon, open the door."
2939,Amy,"well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything."
3455,Amy,how dare you go on the internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia?
2913,Amy,a two.
146,Amy,no.
2908,Amy,"well, i wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant."
2282,Amy,do you have any heels higher than this? he’s pretty tall.
0,Amy,"o’er the land of the free, and the home of the… next."
531,Amy,"i’m sorry, sheldon."
1630,Amy,you know what? how about i buy it for you? how about i buy you both?
1938,Amy,there’s a craft and folk art museum on wilshire.
2774,Amy,"that’s me. listen, you and i are gonna be sharing a bed. you know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. how are you feeling about that?"
2561,Amy,"the video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
514,Amy,yay!
2744,Amy,"well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. i don’t know why i called it a party, sorry."
2285,Amy,"fine. um, he’s british. all right, that is a juicy one."
1705,Amy,are you okay?
2734,Amy,i spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
1061,Amy,"i concur, but you changed the subject. what are we doing for valentine’s day?"
2093,Amy,but leonard’s idea was good.
1084,Amy,that better be tootsie rolls you’re throwing at me!
2335,Amy,you’re just upset ’cause they ran out of pilgrim hats.
100,Amy,my nails have never looked so pretty before. get it off.
1632,Amy,"how about this? i’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome."
2822,Amy,i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into.
2763,Amy,you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
3236,Amy,"you know, i like harp lessons, but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. what are you working on?"
1665,Amy,are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
1566,Amy,wow.
3195,Amy,"oh, my god, stop talking."
2634,Amy,you know the rules. drink.
3278,Amy,you need sleep.
1769,Amy,we have led different lives.
2806,Amy,"what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? i mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. and you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
2951,Amy,"you know, sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning."
2468,Amy,"okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
640,Amy,maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
259,Amy,fascinating work. i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
211,Amy,"so, how you holding up?"
582,Amy,"well, i don’t want to talk to him. and i’m pretty disappointed in you, too. although we both know that won’t last."
3273,Amy,but you said you were working with me.
714,Amy,"not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. i mean, think about it. i’m dating sheldon cooper."
1681,Amy,good for you.
1633,Amy,"so, heads it’s ps4, tails it’s xbox one."
490,Amy,"how about this? french kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
3082,Amy,"sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?"
1252,Amy,"beatles, boring. eminem, scary. weird al? how old are you? neil diamond?"
1216,Amy,"not my guy. i caught him staring at my rack. it’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. fyi, it’s another cardigan."
3173,Amy,please?
676,Amy,"if you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. the painting set me back three grand."
933,Amy,"don’t play dumb with me, sister. you tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars."
8,Amy,"tepid water, please."
1162,Amy,"‘cause last time i saw him, i threw new ones and it got me nothing."
2526,Amy,you realize none of those things would happen now?
3152,Amy,"sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
1212,Amy,your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
2977,Amy,and you.
1890,Amy,who told you to keep going around?
2298,Amy,what was the rest of your question?
1627,Amy,how old were you then?
1259,Amy,today!
3096,Amy,okay. what does it say i’m feeling?
2851,Amy,"hi, stuart."
2503,Amy,are you hungry? how about that sushi place you love?
413,Amy,how was your shower?
1420,Amy,"which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without sheldon. same goes with you guys. if leonard wasn’t with penny, she never would have set you up."
854,Amy,we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla and play real-life operation.
530,Amy,"if you’re keeping him, i’ve got a cage you can borrow. one of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. it was both tragic and hysterical."
1644,Amy,how does that happen?
1289,Amy,i’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
627,Amy,"oh, i’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
718,Amy,i don’t think i want to play a game.
207,Amy,oh. then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. arguably much more suitable than you.
1277,Amy,you’re trying to get back at me for what i said about raiders of the lost ark.
1234,Amy,"well, he’s mad at you, too. he says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray."
1767,Amy,"so, howard, is stuart still living with your mom?"
470,Amy,who didn’t? your skin is like alabaster. do you even have pores?
178,Amy,sometimes i think it might be nice to have one.
213,Amy,i’m regretting my earlier cattiness. she is an absolute delight.
1227,Amy,is it penny?
2650,Amy,who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
1909,Amy,action.
2221,Amy,"actually, i was thinking of making one small change."
2271,Amy,"oh, um, give me that."
461,Amy,are you getting sick?
2480,Amy,"rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
1262,Amy,there’s a neil diamond concert next month.
1969,Amy,fine. how was your day?
1305,Amy,"oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. sorry, uh, better?"
1053,Amy,beep.
1694,Amy,"hi, is sheldon here?"
3204,Amy,hi.
1049,Amy,no.
2616,Amy,"you know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?"
1585,Amy,"yeah, it’s bloom."
1210,Amy,"we could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and i remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
1808,Amy,"you know when you bend over, i can see down your shirt?"
1315,Amy,what do you want?
1849,Amy,"no, but i was on clean-up crew."
1459,Amy,he’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
3348,Amy,got to go. morning.
520,Amy,you do.
1839,Amy,i can’t take these.
1148,Amy,i’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.
1147,Amy,"all i’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…"
1225,Amy,poor leonard.
2541,Amy,"so, have you been having any morning sickness?"
1474,Amy,i’m sorry. who are you dating?
3447,Amy,"hey, girl."
2730,Amy,"oh, but you did it so well. that’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
3065,Amy,"penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?"
2082,Amy,it only refers to dr. cooper and his team. did you even talk about him?
3263,Amy,"how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey, wait a second. wait. delta t could equal alpha sub-zero."
1648,Amy,but none of that means we don’t love you.
1844,Amy,sure.
2334,Amy,good. i want you to be happy.
2758,Amy,"and there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
1690,Amy,see? maybe you’ll love living alone.
2053,Amy,"let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. oh, how about this one up on the log?"
592,Amy,maybe he’s dying. that would be so romantic.
1836,Amy,what’s that?
3130,Amy,you make more than i do.
1805,Amy,"okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. here, here, i’m gonna quiz you. i’m gonna quiz you. i got your notes. i got your notes. i got your notes. if you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club."
706,Amy,thank you. that means a lot to me.
2105,Amy,i don’t hear it.
1152,Amy,"come on, you can do this."
2345,Amy,i miss this.
2581,Amy,okay. how ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
3387,Amy,got it.
722,Amy,what?
744,Amy,"hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. i’m just trying to clean up your mess."
1981,Amy,please?
2862,Amy,we’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
3015,Amy,ooh. happy birthday to me.
2688,Amy,three minutes. and he used a kitchen timer. i felt like a soft-boiled egg.
183,Amy,"word of warning, though. i’m prone to night terrors, so if i wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. just pin me down and stroke my hair, and i’ll be fine."
2517,Amy,hi. how are you doing?
2020,Amy,"well, except barnabas, but he was on adderall."
1640,Amy,"yeah, it’s cute. that’s the problem. i don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick."
3001,Amy,i’m sorry.
3324,Amy,"oh. well, bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. what happened to learning the unicycle?"
2484,Amy,"well, i, i wouldn’t say right away."
298,Amy,a little. the real danger is him biting my face off while i’m sleeping.
1417,Amy,it’s great. it’s christmastime and jimmy stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
1450,Amy,just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
1336,Amy,"sheldon, get over here."
164,Amy,don’t you read my blog?
3151,Amy,fine with me.
2798,Amy,i’m so sore. i don’t think i slept two minutes last night.
1957,Amy,"look, i know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. i need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. and you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana."
1072,Amy,"in case of emergency, please contact… amy farrah fowler. and there’s my phone number. this is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me."
681,Amy,come on.
417,Amy,"dear amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. love, mom."
237,Amy,"that should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant."
2504,Amy,"maybe you should get a new doctor. what, he said you can’t laugh either?"
1556,Amy,thanks for walking me to my car.
1657,Amy,"can i confess something? once in a while, i get a little jealous of how close penny and sheldon are."
1787,Amy,what if we don’t want to vomit?
1612,Amy,no way.
2252,Amy,"suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense."
1834,Amy,nice flowers.
1625,Amy,"oh, crap."
1688,Amy,"you know, this might work out for the best. i mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate leonard is. like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there."
3237,Amy,"wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
2803,Amy,"sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
3322,Amy,"well, what do you want me to do?"
1847,Amy,"i meant why are they folded? but whatever. ooh, what’s this?"
2719,Amy,it’s happening.
2706,Amy,sorry.
2063,Amy,"and who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite."
1596,Amy,i’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
3229,Amy,"i want to say aw, but i’m gonna say ew."
2414,Amy,"okay, well, i should unpack."
2467,Amy,"so if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"
1100,Amy,then how do we decide?
282,Amy,why did you bring him? he’s harshing my buzz.
410,Amy,should i go? i’ve been told sometimes i overstay my welcome.
1257,Amy,they’re coming to america. 
3205,Amy,"well, sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland."
2391,Amy,you shut your damn mouth. you actually heard him say this?
2973,Amy,"well, i’m sure she misses this one. i mean, it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody."
578,Amy,"sheldon, i’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
1116,Amy,told you.
466,Amy,"girlfriends, i have the answer to our dress problems."
1730,Amy,"hey, what’s going on?"
3386,Amy,i won’t.
1831,Amy,but it was bad publicity.
2337,Amy,sure. what is it?
1986,Amy,i haven’t learned my lesson. play it. play it.
3414,Amy,she’s what?
795,Amy,dessert is served.
3443,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
776,Amy,"all right, that’s enough from the both of you."
2413,Amy,what makes a best best buy the best best buy?
1863,Amy,you did?
1063,Amy,happy valentine’s day.
2648,Amy,"well, i just took your side ’cause sometimes i get annoyed at how close sheldon and penny are."
3066,Amy,but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? i get that.
3396,Amy,what are you gonna do about it?
765,Amy,"no, no, no, this is not the wedding i wanted! i want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays the way you look tonight."
3071,Amy,i will bring them home so you can show me how godzilla takes a shower. 
10,Amy,but the light indicates…
3132,Amy,"i’m not even engaged once. i don’t even know if sheldon thinks about marriage. i’m not getting any younger. honestly, i kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
583,Amy,we both know that’s your koala face.
2162,Amy,"i didn’t kill anything. you did, talking about your stupid tv show."
1567,Amy,"no. you’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy."
3003,Amy,what’s wrong?
2700,Amy,"my pleasure, mrs. cooper."
3294,Amy,almost 200. many of them on purpose.
786,Amy,i don’t understand. what’s he doing here?
3305,Amy,what are you looking at?
921,Amy,"well, i mean, howard’s never gonna go to space again, but sheldon will always be a genius."
2956,Amy,"you know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. it has to stop."
2476,Amy,"since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions."
2151,Amy,"leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
3189,Amy,"no, you’re not gonna tell them anything. you’re gonna stay out of it."
15,Amy,no.
1253,Amy,i love neil diamond.
3196,Amy,the place looks great. did you guys get a maid?
3390,Amy,pretty well. princeton has a beautiful campus.
3291,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
2405,Amy,hi.
1217,Amy,your brainy virgin kind of sounds like sheldon.
184,Amy,are we talking about women wanting penises? because i’d like to weigh in.
2259,Amy,"oh, i don’t have to imagine it."
2962,Amy,i can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
2721,Amy,"sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. you need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
1006,Amy,"who cares? just soak it in. hello, boys."
2077,Amy,"think about it. if we had a family there, our kids would be martians."
2096,Amy,"hey, look at that pretty bird."
3004,Amy,"okay, that makes sense. i mean, the mood’s a little different now. we, we don’t have to rush."
239,Amy,"you know, if being on your own is new to you, i’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies i’ve perfected over the years. for example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
2903,Amy,what is happening?
963,Amy,see the stuff in my nose? rubber cement.
2425,Amy,"sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. that’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended."
60,Amy,next!
3024,Amy,how’s bernadette?
2155,Amy,"sure, his mom gets roses. when i want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals."
3451,Amy,"darn it. there’s something in my eye, and i need to sort these coins by size. can you help?"
1856,Amy,what’s that?
1558,Amy,whatever happened with your online dating?
1521,Amy,why do i even try?
1738,Amy,"because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. i love them both, but i’m in the centre now, and i love that even more."
2837,Amy,i would love to.
3144,Amy,"hi, bert."
3179,Amy,my aunt’s funeral?
2021,Amy,how can i make this up to you?
1798,Amy,"oh, don’t be embarrassed. i’ll show you the divot in my spine."
45,Amy,"i’m sorry, was i being too subtle? i meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word i’m looking for? hmm, cute."
559,Amy,"that’s nothing. in ninth grade, the girls put rogaine in my hand lotion. within six months, the nicknames began to fly. i think the one that hurt the most was gorilla fingers fowler."
2907,Amy,of course. jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
3,Amy,"okay, sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. oops, missed one. now your wish can’t come true."
1726,Amy,"no, i just, i feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face."
1483,Amy,"no, bert, come on. i’d love to go to the mineral show with you."
1387,Amy,"uh, sure."
1949,Amy,basket weaving at the craft museum.
1311,Amy,get out.
2331,Amy,let’s see. i have been on six dates with three different people. it was either for coffee or dinner. one i met at a bookstore and two i met online. i haven’t slept with anyone. the aquarium is 40 minutes away. and there’s a baggie of cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
3378,Amy,"okay, the car is waiting. do you want to walk me downstairs?"
1310,Amy,really? what tipped you off?
2344,Amy,"isn’t that gross? i mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
2340,Amy,let’s just play.
2403,Amy,"sheldon, i know your present is for us to be intimate tonight."
2762,Amy,really?
2875,Amy,"well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…"
3310,Amy,"so welcome to tonight’s episode, "
387,Amy,"for general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
2062,Amy,i would at least mention it before filling out the application.
1790,Amy,can you start in the morning?
238,Amy,what’s that like?
748,Amy,"well, dinner’s almost ready."
1184,Amy,keep rolling.
591,Amy,"you just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
798,Amy,you do?
1656,Amy,because she has sex with you.
1002,Amy,i don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
256,Amy,"what if he’s right? and by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?"
2801,Amy,miserable and exhausted.
2808,Amy,can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
1776,Amy,shh. amy’s here now.
572,Amy,"what is it, the fuzz?"
823,Amy,it’s so cute when she tries.
2617,Amy,we could all go for the weekend. it’ll be fun.
1351,Amy,doesn’t matter.
3105,Amy,i’m sorry leonard and penny hurt your feelings.
1198,Amy,"good night. no, i will not consider sleeping in my garment bag."
331,Amy,thank you. did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
1457,Amy,"sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
68,Amy,i’d like you to meet my mother.
1040,Amy,me. aren’t i your perfect roommate?
615,Amy,what’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. hair too golden? laugh too musical? world too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
359,Amy,obviously. now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
1331,Amy,"you and me both, brother. it doesn’t matter. the element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
96,Amy,"oh, good, a slumber party! we’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!"
3207,Amy,"but you are, aren’t you?"
482,Amy,"sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
2286,Amy,to that new italian place on walnut.
388,Amy,"yes, i am."
1012,Amy,what a waste of time.
2697,Amy,"huh. but if i were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?"
2250,Amy,do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
3073,Amy,bye.
2293,Amy,"um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. but let’s not discuss sheldon. let’s get back to you."
2571,Amy,yes.
1064,Amy,"hang on. as you know, i had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts."
495,Amy,"that’s not necessary, it’s like sesame street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
1666,Amy,and watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?
2839,Amy,you know what i meant.
1631,Amy,then i’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
2855,Amy,"stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people."
1439,Amy,i missed you.
1867,Amy,you said it.
841,Amy,"really? i don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting leonard. were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. by the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out."
87,Amy,"yes. in fact, our menses are synchronized. penny. bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night."
168,Amy,that does seem to be a valid principle.
1498,Amy,"aw. drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
465,Amy,"actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  sure you’re not coming down with a cold?"
830,Amy,he knows my last name. i’m his girlfriend. we have a contract and everything. i’ll send you a pdf.
2228,Amy,who?
2315,Amy,"sheldon, i can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
1723,Amy,"well, i think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
2685,Amy,i called him babe once. he asked me to get a drug test.
199,Amy,"and consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh."
2825,Amy,"he put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without amy’s hair on the soap."
1860,Amy,you’re making me worry. what’s going on?
75,Amy,don’t be absurd. i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
228,Amy,so needy.
990,Amy,"so at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too."
2341,Amy,"hmm. well, i wouldn’t fight the eel, because i know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. so i’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days i feel bloated."
888,Amy,sorry.
2530,Amy,"well, i’m, i’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. have to say, you, you do look good in that suit."
1529,Amy,leave.
3060,Amy,do you need help?
842,Amy,"so says your prefrontal cortex. but meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to leonard, it must be because he’s desirable."
2950,Amy,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
3182,Amy,comic-con’s five days.
1209,Amy,and your husband is extremely howard. what’s your point?
30,Amy,is he always like this when he loses?
1347,Amy,"come on, he’s a retired kids show host."
813,Amy,so?
1895,Amy,don’t be like that. you two need to talk this out.
1574,Amy,"i told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. she thought it made you seem too shy and passive."
2844,Amy,that’s an odd mix of people.
3046,Amy,i don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
1495,Amy,there sure are a lot of little kids here.
954,Amy,of course i do. there have been many studies proving its validity.
513,Amy,really?
2677,Amy,"uh, mostly penny’s heard them."
560,Amy,"come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
2714,Amy,"hear, hear."
1551,Amy,rajesh?
721,Amy,that’d be my boyfriend. happier playing his dopey star trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
2740,Amy,"uh, actually, i got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant."
1106,Amy,i can’t believe he set it on fire.
1987,Amy,play it again. play it again.
2982,Amy,"i don’t think you do, but all right."
217,Amy,"now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours."
230,Amy,"parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully."
488,Amy,"at this moment, i find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
3087,Amy,"right, right. got it."
2974,Amy,it may have appreciated in value. the artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
979,Amy,"oh, great! i’ve always wanted to play dungeons and dragons."
2297,Amy,yes. yep. we were on a date. very much like this one.
3080,Amy,hmm. then this is probably too many clothes.
346,Amy,"calm down. everything’s going to be okay.  we may have to kill her. bernadette, i’m putting you on speakerphone. where are you now?"
2877,Amy,"well, he started to question it, but then i fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. please don’t say anything, i feel terrible about this."
319,Amy,and i’ll be right by your side.
817,Amy,"yes, please, penny will kill me."
429,Amy,"why shouldn’t they be? they have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. in some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
222,Amy,"fine. from this angle, i can see up your nose."
1059,Amy,you’re a coward.
716,Amy,yeah.
1905,Amy,"say, betsy ross, what you working on?"
2100,Amy,"sheldon, the view is a daytime talk show hosted by women."
2449,Amy,"look, i, i get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. maybe i understand what he needs better than you do."
3156,Amy,you-you know about that?
1782,Amy,"i’ll check my underpants. i’m so excited, i think i peed."
354,Amy,have you considered massage?
1668,Amy,"no, it combines two of sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
2658,Amy,"well, it sounds like a nice night. we should go."
41,Amy,"you’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat."
3426,Amy,"i kissed a girl and i liked it, i hope my boyfriend don’t mind it."
2992,Amy,"you hate scotch tape, but you love scotch plaid. you are a mystery."
2494,Amy,i’m just gonna push all the buttons.
3005,Amy,and the mood continues to change.
1649,Amy,i feel so bad about lying to sheldon. how am i gonna make it up to him?
3098,Amy,yes.
3397,Amy,vigorously?
283,Amy,i need some context.
3444,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
3452,Amy,"penny? i really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
922,Amy,if and when?
2910,Amy,"although, in aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
987,Amy,that is some low-hanging fruit.
2225,Amy,really? you have a piercing gun?
2727,Amy,where did you get empty dove bar wrappers?
2520,Amy,"okay, great, i mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. i was just, where’d he go?"
1071,Amy,"sheldon cooper, caltech university employee information?"
1092,Amy,"me, too."
3068,Amy,well sheldon always has his pants on. i don’t think i could pick his knees out of a line-up.
1273,Amy,that sounds lovely. why are you rubbing your hands together?
385,Amy,"well, that’s every song i know. what’s up?"
512,Amy,"i feel like crying. of course, i could just be hormonal. oh, wait. maybe our menses are finally syncing up. bernadette? no? penny?"
2169,Amy,not really. can you come over?
2404,Amy,yes.
1816,Amy,"sheldon, is everything okay?"
80,Amy,"thank you, sheldon, that went very well."
409,Amy,"i was. now i’m thinking about what i read. you all right, leonard? you seem very uncomfortable."
3389,Amy,thank you. that means a lot.
2702,Amy,it sure was.
1740,Amy,"you better watch that attitude, buddy. you’re dating the popular girl now."
1255,Amy,"oh, oh, that’s good. then this would be "
2869,Amy,"thanks, but you don’t have to."
2660,Amy,and i shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
2000,Amy,"fine. as cooper prepared to depart, tears filled amelia’s eyes. he took her hand in his and said, “i can’t stay, but i will never forget you.” he brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “please don’t go,” she whispered. but it was too late. the engine hummed to life."
254,Amy,"say, i heard an interesting tidbit about howard and bernadette."
2628,Amy,what’s the game?
1571,Amy,no. what’s up?
547,Amy,"yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
3061,Amy,like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet.
760,Amy,just like your mommy used to make.
295,Amy,"oh, that’s just ricky."
1183,Amy,i remove your armour. what do you do?
612,Amy,"hang on, dr. cooper. what’s vexillology?"
2955,Amy,what happened?
2242,Amy,i don’t think that was the point of the movie.
3365,Amy,i don’t know. sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.
758,Amy,not even strawberry quik?
294,Amy,make yourself comfortable.
2609,Amy,you did it. do you feel okay?
1818,Amy,do you really need me to transcribe this?
299,Amy,yeah. he’s kind of an ass.
1440,Amy,did you miss me?
1977,Amy,"your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety."
3398,Amy,sounds like a big night.
2556,Amy,sheldon.
1605,Amy,"no. no, it was a mistake."
632,Amy,"all right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. i need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
2376,Amy,"sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time."
1191,Amy,"maybe next week, we could all get together."
525,Amy,sorry.
408,Amy,"oh, sure."
875,Amy,you know salt makes me retain water and my cousin william was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. how about raggedy ann and andy? i loved them growing up.
438,Amy,the hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
2787,Amy,"sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
245,Amy,"ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure mother warned me about. i was starting to think it was never going to happen. yes, please."
3369,Amy,"all right, so you know."
3284,Amy,you really can’t remember anything?
344,Amy,i’m gonna say 3-d. that’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
2057,Amy,"you applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?"
244,Amy,i think you’re on.
2889,Amy,i guess it’s okay. i’m sorry that i lied about my apartment.
2251,Amy,"stuart, believe it or not, i understand. you know, before i met sheldon, i was alone for a really long time. i was so desperate for people to like me, when i met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity."
1306,Amy,determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
977,Amy,then maybe you should spank me harder.
102,Amy,"hang on. i’m familiarizing myself with the rules. seems fairly straightforward. bernadette, truth or dare?"
441,Amy,"and again, you’re welcome."
2304,Amy,thank you.
1120,Amy,"if you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time."
599,Amy,guess it’ll just be sheldon and me going on a double date with howard and bernadette.
577,Amy,"that’s nice. anyway, i’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
323,Amy,"oh, no. you have to go."
1271,Amy,so what can i do for you?
2846,Amy,"well, thank you, sheldon. this is a fun surprise."
3153,Amy,so the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?
1990,Amy,but it’s personal.
2249,Amy,you can say it.
2210,Amy,that’s because you made him more confident.
3211,Amy,"well, this isn’t an easy time for him. he’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
3269,Amy,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?
278,Amy,as good an explanation as any.
2357,Amy,great.
1105,Amy,his quirks just make you love him more. someone please agree with me.
162,Amy,that’s too bad. i was hoping you could be my plus-one at the institute of interdisciplinary studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
2319,Amy,hi. ready for the aquarium?
2420,Amy,all of them?
3352,Amy,"no occasion, i just wanted to do something nice for you."
66,Amy,agreed. and we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
934,Amy,why not?
925,Amy,this is so exciting. i’m feeling all tingly. although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
2268,Amy,i’m not sure how i feel about this.
390,Amy,kiss me where i’ve never been kissed before.
3040,Amy,"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
3109,Amy,it’s true. pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
1204,Amy,so what happened? how’d it go?
53,Amy,excellent point.
783,Amy,"oh, boo-hoo. if sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go."
930,Amy,"oh, looks like someone’s on team bernadette. where’s howard?"
2929,Amy,"sheldon, that’s enough."
2184,Amy,"sheldon, you being here might not be making things better."
2590,Amy,how long have you had it?
3415,Amy,hi.
865,Amy,then what’s your job?
1308,Amy,"you embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. image number five, kitten in a teacup."
2045,Amy,we have some exciting news.
1356,Amy,"actually, i’d kind of like to try that."
343,Amy,got it. is it going to be in 3-d?
2626,Amy,so what do we do now?
3104,Amy,what’s going on?
1607,Amy,you’ll get offered something soon.
1288,Amy,yes.
1518,Amy,i’m so glad you like it.
3467,Amy,my first love broke my heart for the first time.
3377,Amy,what if we don’t fold our clothes at all?
587,Amy,ooh!
2880,Amy,food’s here.
1138,Amy,"you’re all wasting your time. sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. seriously, is that tape? like, how are they staying up like that?"
3010,Amy,"one second. all right, you can open your eyes. i thought i’d let harry potter make things hotter."
2176,Amy,we’re not back together.
766,Amy,"well, it was going to be mine."
2899,Amy,sorry.
2281,Amy,"well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
2523,Amy,but it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
910,Amy,"i’m not hungry. your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything."
3012,Amy,i did. am i in trouble?
1294,Amy,"no, we’re not good here. i am working on this project."
13,Amy,hmm. would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
773,Amy,"oh, my gosh. i can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on google earth."
2095,Amy,not your fault.
1900,Amy,you said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
3406,Amy,should i worry?
2493,Amy,"no, hold on, rajesh. you know, you’re not being very sympathetic. you know first hand that breakups are hard."
1319,Amy,"sheldon, too. if i see him at work, i’m just going to ignore him."
3240,Amy,"well, that would make me feel better."
92,Amy,"so anyway, to make a long story short, turns out i have an unusually firm cervix."
2312,Amy,"okay, get out."
229,Amy,"yo, p-dog."
803,Amy,when i get married i’m going to register at the ucla cadaver lab.
2355,Amy,"yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. i took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was leonard nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend."
272,Amy,bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. the meme has reached full penetration.
1301,Amy,"where are we going with this, dr. cooper?"
2597,Amy,"so, why do you feel you need to save these things?"
3328,Amy,"his mother warned me. everybody warned me. actually, he warned me."
1037,Amy,like a dog-boy.
2248,Amy,have you thought about advertising directly to females?
2190,Amy,thank you.
770,Amy,"look at all these people in love. it kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?"
1934,Amy,i will literally race you to the car.
680,Amy,you have such a good heart.
2115,Amy,"rajesh eight, penny four."
1752,Amy,you are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
1888,Amy,"come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery."
1919,Amy,"okay, let’s get this victorian party started. i’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play."
2723,Amy,does that help?
1149,Amy,yep. your turn.
1958,Amy,my mother said that’s how good girls do it.
3306,Amy,"oh. you know, good for you."
2328,Amy,"no. it’s okay. if we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
1339,Amy,me? what did i do?
2529,Amy,"well, i think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
3275,Amy,"incredible. sheldon, i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but i, i was wrong."
2459,Amy,"who said i even want to be engaged to him? and if i do, i, i don’t need your hand-me-downs."
3276,Amy,"sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed."
2174,Amy,"sheldon, when i’m ready to talk, i’ll let you know."
1276,Amy,i love little house. it made me want to live on a farm so much i tried to milk my cat. that tangy bowl of cheerios was not worth the stitches.
2574,Amy,whatch me.
243,Amy,"outstanding. and if we fail, we can always stop at cvs and pick you out a nice toothbrush. i call mine gerard."
2489,Amy,"i have an idea. maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting rajesh. ladies, i can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…"
3083,Amy,uh-huh.
1872,Amy,"how about this, he’s a poor man’s sheldon cooper."
2229,Amy,why?
110,Amy,i don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
1021,Amy,"yeah, but, it can’t make decisions."
2036,Amy,did he say anything about the funeral?
2624,Amy,"on the other hand, safety first."
3354,Amy,"sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly."
3301,Amy,go.
1604,Amy,"oh, my gosh."
314,Amy,"until i met you and bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. now they have a delightful social aspect."
1174,Amy,"sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?"
3363,Amy,i don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.
784,Amy,"sheldon, this place is so romantic. "
1641,Amy,"sheldon, your food’s getting cold. what are you doing?"
2670,Amy,are you gonna say hi to him?
3049,Amy,"you know, i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. but, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone."
2076,Amy,"you know, we could also be the first people to procreate on mars."
437,Amy,"there we go, last floor."
2310,Amy,there you go.
2968,Amy,way ahead of you.
2072,Amy,what i want is for us to be planning our future together.
301,Amy,and you want me to kill her? done.
1941,Amy,because you always pick what we do and i just go along with it.
1390,Amy,i can’t believe penny’s married to zack.
389,Amy,"sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean i have to participate."
668,Amy,i feel like an idiot.
1868,Amy,okay.
2753,Amy,and you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
2332,Amy,i mixed them.
808,Amy,"can’t help ya, kid. whenever i’m around sheldon, i feel like my loins are on fire. in the good way. not the urinary tract infection way."
1519,Amy,"uh, i think we’re gonna need a minute."
3459,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s up?"
2693,Amy,"well, he’s come a long way. or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way."
1654,Amy,is she still mad?
1859,Amy,why not?
3382,Amy,we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
14,Amy,"no, thank you."
2651,Amy,okay. and did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
2656,Amy,that was scary.
2694,Amy,"oh, sure. i’ll, i’ll talk to sheldon about it. you know, bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut."
3026,Amy,kind of hard to see the names.
3143,Amy,"sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
2166,Amy,"okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because i love you, but i need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation."
2399,Amy,"so, what’d you have in mind for tonight?"
405,Amy,"not really, no."
84,Amy,girls’ night? what does that entail?
2785,Amy,"well, sheldon, i really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
2387,Amy,why would i get a bikini wax for my birthday?
868,Amy,he takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
1223,Amy,i don’t think penny would cheat on leonard.
2206,Amy,it’s penny’s.
165,Amy,do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in big sur?
1332,Amy,"you know, sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
2438,Amy,how was your trip?
2348,Amy,"i did. um, listen, i really enjoyed spending this morning with you."
740,Amy,"i’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
1431,Amy,"well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew."
3072,Amy,"uh-huh. bye, sheldon."
1845,Amy,hi.
1359,Amy,that’s sweet.
2766,Amy,what do you think?
1828,Amy,i sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
1060,Amy,you know what would show them? i should move in here with you.
2687,Amy,do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
73,Amy,in what way are you screwed? all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that i’m in a relationship.
439,Amy,you’re welcome.
2060,Amy,"i’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get."
796,Amy,you know what? i’m done with this.
3145,Amy,"oh, we’re having date night."
1055,Amy,"well, what is it, then? i did everything just the way you like it."
2086,Amy,so you see what i’m getting at?
2118,Amy,that’s not nice.
1477,Amy,"hello, bert."
914,Amy,"cut. yikes, this guy is worse than wil wheaton."
3472,Amy,"my goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
3317,Amy,"well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
788,Amy,you found a loophole?
134,Amy,ask what?
2928,Amy,"good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
2442,Amy,"s, s, si, size me up?"
1295,Amy,"sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. i’ll be in a different building. and we don’t even have to have lunch together."
2817,Amy,what?
1701,Amy,right.
816,Amy,"regardless, don’t say anything to leonard."
1108,Amy,"well, you said sheldon read it. why not ask him?"
153,Amy,i’m sure it’ll wash off.
781,Amy,"once in high school, but i dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face."
537,Amy,i think a boy likes me.
2431,Amy,who else’s side could you have been on?
2689,Amy,"bernadette, i’ll give you five dollars to slam the door."
3375,Amy,i wasn’t thinking that.
2034,Amy,"oh, then i choose a janitor, ’cause i’m about to throw up."
2497,Amy,and a lovely valentine’s day.
2600,Amy,why?
394,Amy,everything except bra and panties. and they’re a leopard-spotted secret i share with victoria.
349,Amy,what astronaut story?
1008,Amy,"ooh, i do love a bad boy."
431,Amy,"i have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
2136,Amy,what are we doing? this is a fort. let’s sit on the floor.
423,Amy,perhaps you’re right. my cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
659,Amy,"so, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
2308,Amy,"um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but i just, i don’t think this is working out."
1408,Amy,"a little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
1452,Amy,"sheldon, you scared me. that wasn’t funny."
558,Amy,"when leonard gets back, i’d love to check his serotonin levels. do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
2599,Amy,i don’t.
123,Amy,"i’m suddenly feeling flushed. my heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. in addition, i keep involuntarily saying hoo."
185,Amy,"hi, bestie."
3423,Amy,"what up, bestie? good news. thanks to you, i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
2920,Amy,"if you’d give me a minute, i’ll tell you."
1046,Amy,yes.
2061,Amy,"sheldon, i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever."
822,Amy,"well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog."
1695,Amy,"he was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone."
304,Amy,what do you think ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
474,Amy,"it’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
996,Amy,"i do. and don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too."
1621,Amy,"uh, it’s date night. aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?"
691,Amy,what about supercuts?
1157,Amy,"i’m proud of you, sheldon. "
194,Amy,"fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. in the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage."
883,Amy,"i can, but she’s sitting right there."
1199,Amy,"oh, brain lesions are fascinating. unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag."
276,Amy,"not important. i described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective."
1052,Amy,"‘cause we out dropping science, son."
2819,Amy,you wanna see other people? go see other people.
2116,Amy,eight-five.
161,Amy,"penny, a moment? do you have plans this weekend?"
2557,Amy,i didn’t understand your e-mail.
2546,Amy,you don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
3081,Amy,"nice to see you, too."
2237,Amy,"oh, maybe later. your pig dying made me sad. and a little hungry."
3075,Amy,i’ll miss you.
613,Amy,it’s ferdinand t. flag. i thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
1297,Amy,more and more sure.
2408,Amy,"i’m just, um, really nervous."
3379,Amy,is it?
340,Amy,i used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. it was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. hang on. it’s the wildebeest. priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
1403,Amy,"uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so… "
128,Amy,"no, i experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so i’m checking my vital signs every hour."
2594,Amy,"okay. well, i would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. so i’m gonna need a minute."
177,Amy,do you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy?
3304,Amy,"i’m sorry, bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?"
428,Amy,"you’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
1662,Amy,watching your old friend?
1930,Amy,"merry christmas, sheldon."
579,Amy,give me a minute. i’m gonna go wash up.
2948,Amy,"for god’s sake, you’re ridiculous."
1161,Amy,i got some old underwear i’m gonna throw on stage at the garth brooks concert.
2767,Amy,"sheldon, i understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
2726,Amy,why don’t you want anyone to know?
2735,Amy,"well, i came to see how you were feeling, but i’m guessing still angry?"
541,Amy,"i’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, i can put myself in any repellent situation i want."
2937,Amy,i’m not playing anything. we’re not making a baby today.
67,Amy,wait. i have a request.
2668,Amy,but yes.
1823,Amy,"maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science."
241,Amy,it appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
2506,Amy,"oh, and i just found a new travel cup for sheldon. it only lets out three at a time. so, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?"
69,Amy,certainly. good night.
2417,Amy,"good-bye, sheldon."
2659,Amy,"well, i’m going. you couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now."
542,Amy,anything else?
545,Amy,"hi, stuart."
2475,Amy,"consider tonight’s episode a valentine’s day gift for you, our viewers."
1269,Amy,"no, i do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. let me close that for ya."
415,Amy,"mm-hmm. dear leonard, you’re really good at science. maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork."
2591,Amy,do you want me to hold that computer?
2023,Amy,"she did that to me, too."
999,Amy,"she’s right. but say the word, i got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. one of them could end up in the backseat of her car. or her shower."
407,Amy,yo.
596,Amy,"assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. you know, like a spear wound to the head."
3027,Amy,they all look the same to me.
1891,Amy,"penny has a good point. this is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself."
739,Amy,"no, it’s not. i’ll explain it to you later."
799,Amy,"sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and i are done."
2978,Amy,to give to you.
3464,Amy,"hi, sheldon."
3265,Amy,"no, you bonehead."
1208,Amy,"no, tell me, i want to know what you meant by that."
3434,Amy,what?
180,Amy,we have time now. think about it.
1522,Amy,it’s feeling like it never will.
1034,Amy,children’s toy.
877,Amy,"sheldon, get in here."
639,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right."
924,Amy,"yeah, well, at least when we do make love, sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. and yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb."
2241,Amy,"i don’t know how to help you. you know, feelings are a part of life."
970,Amy,i suppose that’s fair. what do you suggest?
2795,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. we’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. if you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall."
2701,Amy,"okay, mary."
1101,Amy,"it’s our pleasure. i’m dr. fowler, and i’m a neuroscientist."
1814,Amy,"okay, just checking."
1375,Amy,"sheldon, that was diabolical."
3395,Amy,did i? are you gonna teach me a lesson?
3399,Amy,so you’re keeping busy? you’re not lonely?
1039,Amy,great. here i am!
1402,Amy,"sheldon, the point is wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things."
1894,Amy,are you okay?
1772,Amy,hmm-hmm.
233,Amy,you do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of mumbai.
3468,Amy,i didn’t understand your e-mail.
1933,Amy,"sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight."
2547,Amy,"ooh, let’s find out."
1088,Amy,our penny’s a star.
3374,Amy,i am.
855,Amy,"are you sure? i mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk."
2622,Amy,have you ever been off the grid before?
3371,Amy,"sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
617,Amy,und ich bin eine pretzel!
1778,Amy,"i’m feeling a little backed into a corner, sheldon."
2831,Amy,"that was actually koothrappali, but i did let him spit it out in my hand."
2454,Amy,what ring?
2205,Amy,whose bra is this?
1840,Amy,but what about the other girl?
2230,Amy,how long do you think you can keep it from him?
216,Amy,"it’s okay, it’s okay."
571,Amy,"check it out, bernadette, suede boots, your size."
2630,Amy,"no, it’s only if you’ve done it."
1065,Amy,"and i appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, i decided i was being selfish. so, i cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate valentine’s day."
58,Amy,i would. i love cats. they’re the epitome of indifference.
356,Amy,"trust me. with your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
3446,Amy,"hey, girlfriend. can i get a what what?"
1383,Amy,"ding, ding, ding. we have a winner."
3258,Amy,that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.
2607,Amy,"baby steps, i guess."
399,Amy,it is?
1642,Amy,maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
2773,Amy,i don’t know. i didn’t count.
944,Amy,how do you know?
814,Amy,it’s complicated.
1921,Amy,you won.
3150,Amy,i’m so sorry.
255,Amy,"now, now. evolutionary biologist robin dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups."
1623,Amy,"i’m proud of you, sheldon."
1545,Amy,"i think you’d be smart enough to see that, too."
879,Amy,i once looked in sheldon’s underwear drawer. he yelled at me. but now i know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
2196,Amy,"sheldon, i am not doing fun with flags with you."
2528,Amy,"okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?"
3234,Amy,"yes, i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
3413,Amy,i was missing you again.
2402,Amy,of course.
747,Amy,"seven o’clock, right on time."
91,Amy,all right. i’ll have to go shopping.
326,Amy,don’t worry. i’ll teach you. i did two years of cub scouts before they found out i was a girl.
2799,Amy,it’s not what you think.
31,Amy,perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. we’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
2930,Amy,i’ve never seen results like this before.
1788,Amy,what?
1789,Amy,what does that mean?
3320,Amy,have you tried letting go of the rope?
1135,Amy,no.
3169,Amy,what’s that little dot in the middle?
2208,Amy,anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
1865,Amy,i’m always hoping. but tonight i just wanted to have a nice time with you. and maybe dance with someone who has arms.
403,Amy,"no, i have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
975,Amy,i don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
3037,Amy,"well, uh, howard and bernadette had their baby."
2661,Amy,and now you know why i needed the massage.
2491,Amy,"hello, kripke."
1709,Amy,"i’m mad at you. how could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call leonard for help instead of me?"
2858,Amy,cheers.
2109,Amy,can i be in charge of pricing? i’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. can you believe i got these pantyhose for a nickel?
3250,Amy,"whatever you want. so, shall we get to work?"
692,Amy,"well, this isn’t a crisis. why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
3439,Amy,"sheldon, stop. for the last time, i will not bring home bed bugs. "
2499,Amy,what?
2233,Amy,"well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. i mean, they love leonard."
2316,Amy,"well it is thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so i’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. but if you mean between us, i think it’ll be fine."
2770,Amy,seriously?
1646,Amy,that’s what i’m saying.
2509,Amy,"oh, that sounds juicy."
498,Amy,you don’t get it. look at this brain.
236,Amy,"yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh."
1433,Amy,i wish i could believe you. i also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in rice sheldon.
1238,Amy,"fyi, i had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
2428,Amy,"i said what’s new, but sure."
1968,Amy,maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
195,Amy,perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
2012,Amy,what are you talking about?
1479,Amy,weren’t you?
357,Amy,"now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so."
2215,Amy,thank you. the veins are gummy worms.
2647,Amy,"oh, i honestly couldn’t care less."
2123,Amy,is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
2888,Amy,and i’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
2394,Amy,come in.
1317,Amy,what’s your point?
1602,Amy,i’m sure it’s lovable.
1655,Amy,"a psychic? he considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
2812,Amy,do you want to go to our place and make out?
2016,Amy,"it’s not a big deal. i run tests like this on undergrads all the time. if you fill out some paperwork at the university, i can get you five dollars."
3209,Amy,"there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. for me, too. the first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
103,Amy,all right. to what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
2881,Amy,"oh, uh, they’re still working on it."
3303,Amy,i was wrong. you can come back in.
897,Amy,cut.
894,Amy,cut.
1258,Amy,they’re coming to america… ♪
1866,Amy,"of course i understand. sheldon, there’s something else i’ve been wanting to say, but before i do, i just, i want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. i know you’re not ready, and i don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…"
2474,Amy,and dr. amy farrah fowler present…
1066,Amy,"by doing none of it. no dinner, no romance, no gifts. we stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved star war trek things."
1811,Amy,save you first; come back for raj only if there’s time.
2949,Amy,that was a close one.
844,Amy,"and there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. if this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. if you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now."
3334,Amy,"well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
849,Amy,"penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?"
1218,Amy,"oh, and here’s a fun thing. i worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. janko is spelled with a silent ptang. sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
293,Amy,i have yoo-hoo.
787,Amy,"on our date? sheldon, that’s not okay."
2035,Amy,sounds good.
1388,Amy,did you guys know penny married zack three years ago?
1948,Amy,really?
3299,Amy,it wasn’t a time-out. let’s get some food.
688,Amy,"but if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
1937,Amy,"i actually can’t. my hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. i rode a very thin pony once. on the first bump, just popped right off."
2368,Amy,"uh, about five years. i’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that i don’t need to be so close to, well, you know."
625,Amy,i’m excited to work with my boyfriend. it’s gonna be romantic.
2401,Amy,you mean before you give it to me?
2227,Amy,"you’re right. i should probably let all of my facebook friends know. penny, i’m no longer in a relationship."
160,Amy,an experiment. nope. nothing. never mind.
2705,Amy,i think i can see my breath.
1749,Amy,it’s hard to argue with that. and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
3333,Amy,"that’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. the best years of your life are still ahead of you."
1581,Amy,should you really be sitting in sheldon’s spot?
2696,Amy,so there’s no maid of honour?
142,Amy,"sheldon, i am not going through menopause."
1141,Amy,should have taken my breasts out while i had the chance.
2156,Amy,"he’s right. roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years."
1401,Amy,"sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
2168,Amy,"bye, sheldon."
701,Amy,you use it to get your way.
248,Amy,"primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at priya is hard-wired into her dna."
1143,Amy,"okay. well, what i think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure."
923,Amy,that’s an impressive accomplishment. he’s now an inspiration to millions of americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
516,Amy,"i’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
1645,Amy,"come on, let’s get you to bed. you’ve had a lot to drink."
3215,Amy,no. i already asked.
1018,Amy,"we are. we’re just, uh, giving you a head start."
2349,Amy,"it was. uh, listen, i, i was thinking that, um, maybe i’m ready to be your girlfriend again."
2108,Amy,"yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?"
2592,Amy,"i’m sorry. what, what am i looking at?"
2873,Amy,"well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…"
2790,Amy,rising rapidly.
1261,Amy,and i’ll tell you some lies. 
2051,Amy,that’s what i said.
890,Amy,understood.
477,Amy,they’re out shopping right now?
1754,Amy,"after a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
1559,Amy,"before i met sheldon, i was ready to give up, too. once, i even dropped in on my obgyn just to get some human contact."
697,Amy,there’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
2663,Amy,yeah. cool.
2699,Amy,"wait, now i’m just some lousy maid of honour?"
2892,Amy,thank you for understanding.
348,Amy,just change the subject.
196,Amy,"sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race."
3302,Amy,and don’t you slam that door.
1588,Amy,"according to wikipedia, sherlock holmes came first."
1365,Amy,"oh, my gosh. that’s the girl that broke rajesh’s heart."
543,Amy,i’m listening.
699,Amy,she’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
1601,Amy,of course.
1211,Amy,sure.
1755,Amy,"there they go, fighting again. you’d never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc."
402,Amy,something in the chair’s biting my tushy. it’s not important. ow!
2153,Amy,with a beautiful girl on your arm.
3257,Amy,"you know, you’re exhausting. i knew working together was a bad idea."
3417,Amy,it’s not important.
2289,Amy,"oh, i’m, i’m so sorry."
2144,Amy,you got yourself a sleepover.
3370,Amy,hey. you going somewhere?
2998,Amy,uh.
2270,Amy,"okay, i’m starting to feel guilty. aren’t we being a little mean?"
2127,Amy,probably not. it’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
915,Amy,"a little sensitive, but not bad. does it always take that long?"
2463,Amy,really?
1486,Amy,"this isn’t funny. i’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if i didn’t have a boyfriend, i wouldn’t be interested in him."
2262,Amy,how have you been?
3043,Amy,are you going to?
689,Amy,sure.
3230,Amy,"yup, we’re killin’ it."
986,Amy,let’s get him laid!
2603,Amy,it’s not a contest.
3139,Amy,oh. immature.
2570,Amy,yes.
2906,Amy,i understand. i’ll leave you be.
2307,Amy,no problem. i’m really sorry about your car.
3168,Amy,"well, i do appreciate you working on this."
550,Amy,what’s that?
1345,Amy,"sheldon, come on."
3223,Amy,you okay?
1372,Amy,i’m gonna go with sad. so what’s the story with you and this dvd?
1924,Amy,you got me something?
42,Amy,i doubt you’d understand. sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
2132,Amy,more juvenile than this?
231,Amy,good. now put this pillowcase over your head.
1219,Amy,then what does tweepadock mean?
381,Amy,oh… you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
657,Amy,i wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
1316,Amy,"sheldon, you’re not a weirdo."
2432,Amy,"sheldon, i understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but i don’t know why we’re even talking about this. just apologize to them."
2879,Amy,let it go.
2580,Amy,but why wouldn’t…
753,Amy,"human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. in your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. i’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
1577,Amy,"well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."
950,Amy,"never mind. good night, sheldon."
2655,Amy,how?
443,Amy,good night. 
1307,Amy,"i can’t leave now, sheldon. i’m very busy. besides, why would i want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? image number four, boa constrictor. "
2466,Amy,i think what sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. isn’t that right?
2498,Amy,"interesting, and when would you use the singular?"
1266,Amy,"i enjoyed it. when you told me i was going to be losing my virginity, i didn’t think you meant showing me raiders of the lost ark for the first time."
155,Amy,"it’s not what i want to do, it’s what i have to do."
2841,Amy,what’s going on here?
3113,Amy,good luck. people have been saying that for 600 years.
64,Amy,that was rude.
912,Amy,what?
1852,Amy,my date would’ve had to clean that up.
2005,Amy,is that really true?
2620,Amy,yes.
372,Amy,"no, you’re not. you’re gonna pop a cop kop a bop a gop."
85,Amy,i’m a girl.
1249,Amy,such as?
1850,Amy,"no, it was okay. the dj let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. whenever i see a bucket of dirty water, i still hear lady in red."
2435,Amy,glad i could help.
873,Amy,"sheldon, when i said couples costume, i meant like romeo and juliet or cinderella and prince charming, not two robots from some silly movie i don’t even like."
1685,Amy,"well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
729,Amy,"and if you don’t start treating me better, i’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named armin."
2507,Amy,"yeah, tell us."
1035,Amy,"so, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?"
3380,Amy,do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
1027,Amy,did that ever happen?
2025,Amy,and then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
1854,Amy,you went to seven proms?
2788,Amy,great. that’s your side.
2863,Amy,"so, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. such as the flag of st. kitts and nevis."
589,Amy,how come you never invite sheldon and me on a double date?
660,Amy,no problem.
1020,Amy,no! it can’t decide. it’s a hammer.
1290,Amy,i’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
2352,Amy,okay. sure.
504,Amy,"oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
993,Amy,"you think that’s bad? in college, i passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on."
3019,Amy,"i understand, but this is a special day for them. can you just try and let it go?"
2876,Amy,"i was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go."
2821,Amy,i prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
1598,Amy,excuse me?
1792,Amy,okay.
544,Amy,interesting. now try it without the quadruple negative.
376,Amy,"for the first time ever, i have a thriving social life. and no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
2538,Amy,"if i may, i, i’d like to propose a toast. um, thank you all for coming tonight. i know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but i feel like i got the greatest gift the day he was born."
1515,Amy,"well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic."
141,Amy,my blood work shows thyroid function normal. cortisol levels normal.
777,Amy,"well, i’m ending it. bernadette, i want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. i also want you to know, that i will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out."
2314,Amy,oh. okay. thank you.
2075,Amy,okay. i suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
637,Amy,really? is that what you think?
2200,Amy,what are you doing here?
982,Amy,maybe another time.
2265,Amy,i said no.
1243,Amy,maybe we pick names out of a hat.
2632,Amy,i’m surprised you would do that.
2199,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. i know it’s hard. it’s hard for me, too. but i’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
3214,Amy,"well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
1858,Amy,"sheldon, can i come in?"
2842,Amy,"well, that’s so nice. who’s coming?"
279,Amy,"yes, not important. just stopped by to let you know i’m getting orthotics. also, i’m carrying sheldon’s baby. mum’s the word."
1240,Amy,"scavenger hunts at harvard were really tough. i always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. i guess that story’s more sad than funny."
6,Amy,"i don’t object to the concept of a deity, but i’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
1591,Amy,what’s it for?
1350,Amy,"from what i saw the other day, i could understand why he and some people might find you…"
670,Amy,i’m just glad i didn’t go for the sculpture.
2654,Amy,sheldon.
1090,Amy,i haven’t been to disneyland since i was a kid. we should definitely go one weekend.
2775,Amy,"well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
524,Amy,"– sorry, sorry. "
2643,Amy,sorry.
1563,Amy,"oh, she’s cute. and smart. phi beta kappa."
2172,Amy,oh. what are you doing here?
2104,Amy,and girls.
414,Amy,"oh, i’m up all night. i’m like a possum. boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
1386,Amy,you need any help?
2006,Amy,what’s this for?
3420,Amy,still nothing. remind me to try again in an hour.
2327,Amy,"man, i walked right into that one."
2070,Amy,"you know, sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day. but a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. and silly as it sounds, i thought that meant something."
1424,Amy,"here’s another one. penny, if it weren’t for sheldon you never would have met comic book legend stan lee."
3410,Amy,"yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde olympic swimmer."
1303,Amy,"test subject d7, aka betsy, fear response study. image number one, frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. no visible reaction. image number two, sousaphone. still no reaction. okay. let’s kick things up a notch. image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. okay, now we’re talking."
1653,Amy,"oh, no. i mean, this is weird right now."
418,Amy,"well, i had a delightful evening, leonard. we should do this again sometime."
908,Amy,you sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend wil wheaton?
3264,Amy,there’s only one clear choice.
3362,Amy,"are, are you sure?"
2254,Amy,barry kripke just asked me out.
1580,Amy,are we still going to go to that chaucer reading friday?
876,Amy,"no. there are certain things that say to the world, i have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. pick one."
3253,Amy,i don’t know where we went wrong.
1952,Amy,very nice.
2548,Amy,"oh, my."
267,Amy,we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
1355,Amy,i’m making a bracelet.
496,Amy,it’s okay. i’m glad this happened. i can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
2938,Amy,no. he was explicit. needlessly and freakishly explicit.
3248,Amy,are you listening?
3208,Amy,talk to me. tell me what’s going on.
506,Amy,"i know how you feel. i got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
444,Amy,great. until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me.
1991,Amy,no.
1855,Amy,"sheldon, you look so handsome."
2566,Amy,that lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
3116,Amy,"well, i’m really happy for you."
2794,Amy,"sheldon? i know we took coitus off the table, but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
291,Amy,my burps taste like cranberry juice.
1348,Amy,have you ever thought about why arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
929,Amy,what do you think?
3094,Amy,"okay, i’m looking at the first picture."
116,Amy,penny?
1998,Amy,"okay, that’s enough."
2680,Amy,hold on. he paid you to get out of spending time with me?
106,Amy,"and absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and nicholas is scalded in the towte. this tale is doon, and god save al the rowte.”"
3383,Amy,i will.
463,Amy,are you sure? the infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
1023,Amy,"you can’t pick something up in outer space. in space, there is no up."
351,Amy,architect. where would you have met an astronaut?
3178,Amy,"no, thanks. i already live in a place all the nerds come to."
2917,Amy,"okay. three, two, and we’re done."
1822,Amy,i just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
2667,Amy,"oh, thank god."
3076,Amy,i’ll miss you more. 
1004,Amy,no.
2492,Amy,it really can.
1443,Amy,and? how did it make you feel?
369,Amy,really? a best friend sleepover? yay.
138,Amy,i’m not saying hoo now. i said hoo last night.
364,Amy,don’t be so hard on yourself. do you know the story of catherine the great?
2346,Amy,i guess sometimes i’m silly.
1453,Amy,"okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. i mean, humour is a complex neurological…  okay, that’s pretty good."
1010,Amy,"and the story moved along at a brisk pace. it was, overall, what’s the word i’m looking for?"
2212,Amy,"i don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
2791,Amy,okay. what if we do this?
2125,Amy,"according to the codicil of the relationship agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night."
2255,Amy,"hi, how are you? i was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime."
614,Amy,"for someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, doctor who sure does have a thing for modern-day london."
1976,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
2329,Amy,"so, you had some questions about me seeing other people."
2362,Amy,it is?
2559,Amy,"sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? you know that one’s out-of-date."
2213,Amy,i only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
700,Amy,"no, hang on. i followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. i made a written record request 72 hours in advance. i checked the tyre pressure on the car. i even contacted the centres for disease control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to orange county. fyi, it’s none."
1827,Amy,"sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. so, look, i, i wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, i have a little confession. i’m the reason it was pulled."
2073,Amy,we’re on the same planet.
836,Amy,"i’m not suspicious. i just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  aha!"
1226,Amy,do you hear anything?
3360,Amy,"well, i haven’t accepted it yet. i wanted to talk to you first."
2383,Amy,obi-what?
1490,Amy,thank you.
2064,Amy,"you know what? go to mars, sheldon."
1421,Amy,listen to me. that is not the way they usually look.
2321,Amy,no. you?
1781,Amy,of course i do.
448,Amy,"oh, penny, much as i would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, leonard just doesn’t get my motor running."
1923,Amy,"oh, you heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good."
1967,Amy,sheldon.
2691,Amy,come in.
1704,Amy,"my pleasure. and i’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. i love that,"
750,Amy,"with our friends moving forward in their relationships, i’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
1674,Amy,"oh, i guess it must have been back when i was in the girl sprouts."
2582,Amy,"sheldon, just tell me."
1286,Amy,"well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. and there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
17,Amy,is this true?
1824,Amy,"so, how was work today?"
189,Amy,not even when i do this? 
3235,Amy,"you know, when i was six, i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night, gorilla. maybe i was onto something."
3170,Amy,interesting. you really have secrets you don’t tell me?
2797,Amy,hang on.
2754,Amy,"well, it’s not exactly like it. we’re all extremely smart."
1889,Amy,stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
1584,Amy,i’m leaving.
3312,Amy,"i’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check."
1801,Amy,why’d you tell her? it was working.
2448,Amy,"why not? you, you just said it’s okay for her to work."
2969,Amy,"if we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
2859,Amy,maybe i can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
2372,Amy,"no, i, i think it’s neat. oh."
2088,Amy,try again.
1205,Amy,so i can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
1230,Amy,"no, sheldon, don’t."
2033,Amy,what’s the first question?
727,Amy,i don’t think i’d be good at that.
3238,Amy,"sheldon, this is really interesting."
1543,Amy,of course i was.
3055,Amy,that’s right. 
1918,Amy,what’s going on?
378,Amy,i’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
379,Amy,"no problem. try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
1186,Amy,"hello, rajesh."
2681,Amy,we’re not going shopping together.
2991,Amy,is that okay?
1779,Amy,"interesting. can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?"
1920,Amy,"well, there’s a fun one called ball of wool. you take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off."
2737,Amy,i am really regretting that i got you a happy meal.
2827,Amy,but you did.
2214,Amy,"i know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, i made cookies in the shape of male genitals."
1454,Amy,i guess.
1906,Amy,"then who did sew it, hmm?"
603,Amy,"fine, we can double with you, too. so insecure."
1464,Amy,"that’s okay. uh, bert, this is howard and rajesh. guys, this is bert."
2716,Amy,are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
1592,Amy,but why?
1476,Amy,that’s nice.
2396,Amy,"that’s okay. come on in. thank you. um, i’ll, i’m gonna go put these in water."
2631,Amy,i can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
43,Amy,i’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
2464,Amy,"well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
2003,Amy,sure.
1426,Amy,"it’s hard to say, my life would be so different."
2866,Amy,"oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone."
2054,Amy,"well, he’s barely moving. he looks half dead."
2621,Amy,yay.
1570,Amy,"well, what would i say to her?"
2177,Amy,"if you must know, i’m going to howard and bernadette’s to watch the wedding."
1282,Amy,it’s actually steamier than it looks. sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in renaissance paintings.
768,Amy,"it’s all i have left. you’re going to take that from me, too?"
144,Amy,"let’s look at this logically. i have a stomach, i get hungry. i have genitals, i have the potential for sexual arousal."
1190,Amy,"so, after i started dating sheldon, i met leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me."
1611,Amy,"fine, sheldon. you have my undivided attention."
1885,Amy,"just go to work, he’ll be fine."
2004,Amy,how many?
1815,Amy,anything else?
945,Amy,"me, too. in some weird way, i kind of feel like it brought us closer."
586,Amy,"which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
3357,Amy,"that is true, i have said that."
485,Amy,yes.
1593,Amy,"hey, i won the nobel prize in physiology, then i used the money to buy stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so sheldon would pay attention to me. not the worst idea."
2209,Amy,"come on, you know leonard’s not like that."
1278,Amy,"sheldon, we’re in a relationship. when you get angry, just tell me. you don’t need to seek revenge."
3287,Amy,do you need anything else?
1320,Amy,"could be anything. last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. the time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. still can’t believe i didn’t make the cut."
1007,Amy,"all right, well, who’s the best superhero?"
1089,Amy,"well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so i recommend an unsafe environment. seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on skid row."
594,Amy,come on.
901,Amy,"yes. and so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. let’s try it again. everybody’s having fun. and action."
2671,Amy,i’m getting an earthy note.
961,Amy,"okay, okay, here’s the deal. i don’t need your medicine. i’m not sick."
1546,Amy,which you also figured out by yourself.
2748,Amy,i don’t know where everyone is.
1470,Amy,he’s not my boyfriend.
3381,Amy,i’ll love you no matter what.
3163,Amy,i’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.
169,Amy,i don’t believe there’s any such thing.
2692,Amy,fine.
3466,Amy,"we’re just friends, what are you sayin’?"
902,Amy,cut.
2163,Amy,"really? that’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
2872,Amy,"um, it was a drywall problem."
494,Amy,what are you doing here?
2236,Amy,easy for you to say. you never had to watch 60 minutes like this.
2134,Amy,can i come in?
3329,Amy,i made you tea.
2669,Amy,"hey, penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend zack?"
1017,Amy,good idea. i’ll help you.
280,Amy,wow. is there anything on there about orthotics?
702,Amy,you gave me your word. you’re coming with me.
806,Amy,you’re not answering the question. do you love him?
866,Amy,"that’s not always true. last night i gave sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated."
3031,Amy,it was not a great trip.
807,Amy,what does that mean?
1536,Amy,"hey, you were funny on purpose, good job."
2813,Amy,"i told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives."
2932,Amy,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
2531,Amy,"maybe later i’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
505,Amy,"whee! ooh, finally someone found second base."
2704,Amy,"you’ve met her, right?"
943,Amy,i’ll drive. you can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
2884,Amy,ubexcubellent. duboes shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
3242,Amy,"oh, good. what are they?"
1362,Amy,"rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"
281,Amy,"fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
3260,Amy,"hey, i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
1510,Amy,"one step ahead of you, bernadette and wolowitz are going with us."
3252,Amy,"so we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage."
981,Amy,by rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
317,Amy,"the reason i ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
2543,Amy,why wouldn’t you open it?
167,Amy,all right. i just want to establish boundaries.
2551,Amy,"well, to be fair, howard’s idea was based on sheldon’s math."
2366,Amy,"when you were married, did your wife cook?"
126,Amy,"very well. if you die and donate your body to science, i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon."
3368,Amy,"hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
292,Amy,would you like to come in for a nightcap?
1114,Amy,"me, too."
137,Amy,why do you keep saying zack?
3200,Amy,i’m not going with you to comic-con.
2371,Amy,that’s an interesting tie clip.
1586,Amy,i think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
679,Amy,"oh, my goodness, how could i have not seen that? the painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
2218,Amy,"so, penny, how’s married life?"
3213,Amy,what’s that?
761,Amy,"hello, leonard."
3077,Amy,"if you miss me x plus one, i’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…"
965,Amy,i’ll tell him tomorrow. mama needs a bath.
2374,Amy,"you know, i’m just being silly. i, i don’t know what i’m waiting for."
2961,Amy,yep.
2455,Amy,you have an engagement ring?
2167,Amy,i hope you understand.
1806,Amy,"we had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
1862,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly. i’m not missing another prom. i’m going upstairs now. good-bye."
1322,Amy,i don’t think the smithsonian’s gonna want your marker. 
3016,Amy,is this about the baby?
2804,Amy,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
2829,Amy,me.
518,Amy,"what are you, a nun? come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
2447,Amy,"i have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
1943,Amy,you guys comfy? this might take a while.
2679,Amy,what are you doing here? you’re not sheldon.
475,Amy,"the real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week."
1729,Amy,"measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. you like that, don’t you? that’s right, say my name."
2092,Amy,"well, that is an important part."
2900,Amy,what’s going on?
221,Amy,"hi, bestie."
1172,Amy,you don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.
1215,Amy,i think i would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
3345,Amy,"no, i’m waiting till he’s in a good mood."
1841,Amy,we all have a past.
2605,Amy,thank you for trusting me.
1609,Amy,"can you get the butter, please?"
1130,Amy,"of course it would. i’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, i can only raise your stock as a candidate."
1414,Amy,"yeah, kinda."
754,Amy,"we’ll see. let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
1221,Amy,what happened?
3376,Amy,that’s a risk i’m willing to take.
21,Amy,does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
984,Amy,"geez, who’s forever 63 now?"
3403,Amy,that’s terrific. i’ll call you right back.
464,Amy,"sheldon, we’re all animals. and granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
1739,Amy,but i’m just…
187,Amy,are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man i’ve ever seen in my life?
1951,Amy,"sheldon, that really is an excellent basket."
1899,Amy,after only 232 episodes.
2610,Amy,"well, i’m proud of you."
3315,Amy,what smells so good?
2784,Amy,doesn’t matter to me. your choice.
989,Amy,and you liked bernadette also?
38,Amy,"well, just recently, i learned that you refer to us as shamy, and i don’t like that."
2516,Amy,he used a period instead of a question mark. he’s so wasted.
2678,Amy,you just did.
1514,Amy,an alcoa fa-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 pullman first-class coaches.
646,Amy,what do you want?
1076,Amy,"fine. just hold on. mommy’s on the phone! sorry. we’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. those guys were mellow."
347,Amy,"oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. what’s the problem?"
1812,Amy,"sheldon, i’m really impressed you’re willing to try this."
3047,Amy,that’s exactly what she was saying.
1650,Amy,did you lie to howard about tonight?
330,Amy,"yeah, yeah. i’m just breaking in some new shoes."
1224,Amy,you’re being ridiculous.
763,Amy,"i love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. sheldon, what are the ingredients in pringles?"
510,Amy,"oh, my gosh. no one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. well, that’s not true. once, but then they all died."
273,Amy,no. happy accident.
3340,Amy,"i was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton."
147,Amy,are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
1719,Amy,yes.
556,Amy,what do you want me to do about it?
633,Amy,i’m sure it was.
1442,Amy,did you hold the baby?
690,Amy,"i’m a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride. i’m wanted… i’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
171,Amy,"no, we discussed it. we decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well."
1325,Amy,and what?
440,Amy,"i excel at spatial reasoning, and i had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
2407,Amy,hi.
931,Amy,he had my car towed. it cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
820,Amy,i know. she’s yelling at me right now.
1722,Amy,how come?
175,Amy,i missed you.
2836,Amy,oh. really?
127,Amy,"now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to take my temperature."
3212,Amy,you ready to go?
1279,Amy,"well, that’s not how we’re going to do it."
2717,Amy,"sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. i think it’s nice they’re hitting it off."
1747,Amy,"you mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? okay got it. bye. hey, boyfriend."
774,Amy,who is it?
2389,Amy,"okay, what is going on?"
1189,Amy,"a, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. and b, more importantly, i was the outsider to this group, and i know how frightening that can be. but you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like i was family."
1876,Amy,okay.
2273,Amy,"no, it, it’s not like that."
609,Amy,sweet!
3084,Amy,it’s there on purpose. it’s refreshing.
2589,Amy,why do you have a storage unit?
2793,Amy,comfy?
296,Amy,don’t be silly. he’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
628,Amy,"no, i just need those beakers washed. hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
2094,Amy,it’s not your fault.
1606,Amy,now i think you’re flirting with the line. good news?
896,Amy,"don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. and action."
1123,Amy,"or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family."
576,Amy,sounds like you hit the ground running. i have a bit of good news myself. my most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of neuron.
3127,Amy,what are you sad about?
1669,Amy,"okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating."
56,Amy,sixty-five.
1096,Amy,"so, what are we gonna do first?"
2802,Amy,"well, i didn’t, and it’s your fault."
1750,Amy,"sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?"
909,Amy,"i’m mad at you, sheldon."
2922,Amy,these cells come from both of us.
361,Amy,that doesn’t interest me. goodbye.
2217,Amy,"boy, that was a long night for me."
2274,Amy,"okay, it’s like that."
1228,Amy,"yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
638,Amy,"hey, i’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. you’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom."
398,Amy,"yes, he did. he absolutely did."
2377,Amy,what?
1807,Amy,okay.
2665,Amy,"so, sheldon and bernadette are hanging out."
2639,Amy,i brought my famous spinach dip.
2521,Amy,sheldon?
515,Amy,"maid of honour amy farrah fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
1195,Amy,"me, too."
1989,Amy,"no, please don’t."
1774,Amy,you’re right. cheers.
964,Amy,all right. i’ll tell him.
246,Amy,i’m drunk.
3166,Amy,what is this?
3226,Amy,"i mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
95,Amy,"yes, and continue to bond. i have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. or bff, if you prefer. which i don’t."
209,Amy,"this is a portable electroencephalogram. i’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. so when you start crying, i can see which region of the brain is activated. then i’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. cool, huh?"
1298,Amy,i didn’t ask for your permission.
2325,Amy,sheldon. we’ve known each other a long time. we are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the internet.
962,Amy,i got better two days ago. it’s just been so nice having sheldon take care of me.
2202,Amy,just give me the box.
1395,Amy,thank you.
1590,Amy,that is so sweet.
900,Amy,"great. so, this time let’s try more real boy, less pinocchio. and action."
2429,Amy,did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
1896,Amy,sheldon will move out eventually.
1647,Amy,"i’m sorry, i just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory."
1447,Amy,what’s the show?
2148,Amy,"okay, have a seat on the floor."
2441,Amy,"well, this is so nice. he’s so excited to have you here and…"
107,Amy,bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. the miller’s tale by chaucer is the dirtiest story i know. it would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
486,Amy,"it’s just, i thought they liked hanging out with me, but i guess i was fooling myself."
2495,Amy,really?
2011,Amy,"sheldon, it’s me."
1030,Amy,"sheldon, what’s going on?"
201,Amy,"or worse, it could go to the liberal arts."
52,Amy,"your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. as a neurobiologist, i was curious."
3319,Amy,where did you get it?
114,Amy,"clearly, losing truth or dare upset her. perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity."
1472,Amy,what do i do? i don’t want to hurt his feelings.
445,Amy,wine is one of the reasons i’m in this fix. that and this dang pelvis.
1025,Amy,yeah?
363,Amy,"well, i heard who you did."
2683,Amy,"you know, just when i think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. i mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?"
224,Amy,your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
1176,Amy,do you have any interest now?
2423,Amy,"why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, i’ll explain to you why you’re wrong."
1001,Amy,when did howard learn to sew?
1929,Amy,they’re your meemaw’s christmas cookies. i called and got the recipe.
1848,Amy,easy.
1569,Amy,i’m not gonna pretend to be you.
1884,Amy,"all right. don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now."
1793,Amy,"maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some manilow."
89,Amy,"yes, but they’re not girls. i’m a girl."
1927,Amy,"actually, i did get you something."
503,Amy,"didn’t you go to high school, leonard? parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
853,Amy,"all right, let’s keep it simple. how about darts?"
472,Amy,"sheldon, sometimes you forget, i’m a lady. and with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
1202,Amy,"oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
2500,Amy,this is so exciting.
2038,Amy,oh.
3274,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly. you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
3440,Amy,"hello, sheldon. is everything okay?"
37,Amy,oh. i don’t like that. don’t do that.
2638,Amy,"well, we all have a past."
1956,Amy,ready? begin. why’d you pop it?
375,Amy,"no, i can’t let you do that."
2257,Amy,"well, i was hoping the next person i dated would be a little less like sheldon."
3197,Amy,so you’re not going to comic-con?
2989,Amy,i love it. thank you.
826,Amy,"i’m going to video-chat sheldon. if my new look leads to phone sex, i’m going to have to ask you to leave the room."
2019,Amy,that’s not true.
1409,Amy,i’ll get the vodka.
2139,Amy,we both know this one’s gonna win.
1837,Amy,i guess that’s all anybody wants.
3133,Amy,i’m sorry. i can’t help it.
905,Amy,can i speak to you for a second?
1014,Amy,yes.
1916,Amy,you’re going.
607,Amy,cool. i think i just learned something.
1254,Amy,"yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. it’s a real game and i’m winning it."
666,Amy,why?
3259,Amy,"i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
459,Amy,it’s not for us to judge. we’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
2247,Amy,"well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. i mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog."
2159,Amy,that’s what you’re thinking about?
1526,Amy,"oh, give it a rest."
2294,Amy,i’m trying not to. do you know him?
2843,Amy,you mean the romanian lady on the second floor?
779,Amy,"oh, yes. according to the relationship agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy."
1435,Amy,"oh. wow. i had no idea. he is so into me. wait, wait, where’d i go?"
2856,Amy,"no, stuart, don’t."
2001,Amy,"she turned away, wiping her eyes. she couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. it was cooper."
1397,Amy,"yeah, everything was delicious."
621,Amy,"this is really happening. i’m gonna be a maid of honour. i’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, i will have my special day."
2682,Amy,can you understand why i might be annoyed right now?
3232,Amy,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on?
1693,Amy,it tastes the same.
332,Amy,look.
630,Amy,soap spots. wash ’em again.
895,Amy,"sorry, sheldon, you were brilliant as always. wil, that was a little wooden."
3441,Amy,"oh, it’s probably sheldon. hi, sheldon. everybody’s here, say hi."
1287,Amy,"sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
3198,Amy,sounds like everyone’s staying home. what do you say?
3120,Amy,"well, the bra under here ain’t beige."
2894,Amy,"i don’t know. it, it could be. "
2081,Amy,"sheldon, this article doesn’t mention leonard at all."
1244,Amy,"i did them all the time as a kid. as my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. she was full of fun lies like that."
2527,Amy,"well, you made my last birthday so memorable, i wanted to return the favour."
247,Amy,"this may be the alcohol talking, but i believe there is. are you familiar with the recent study of tanzanian chimpanzees by nishida and hosaka out of kyoto university?"
2280,Amy,okay. but i’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
717,Amy,do you ever worry about leonard doing that to you?
3000,Amy,"so, where were we?"
1109,Amy,you have something we want.
1734,Amy,that’s outrageous.
863,Amy,question. do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
483,Amy,it doesn’t matter. nothing matters.
1928,Amy,"well, you got me something. here."
1469,Amy,so? he does that every day. oh.
1875,Amy,"sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, i’ve heard you complain about his snoring."
2283,Amy,"well, i told you his name and that he’s tall. what more do you need?"
904,Amy,you gonna let him speak to me like that?
1074,Amy,"oh, sheldon."
574,Amy,"oh, yes. our relationship agreement specifies that the second thursday of every month, or the third thursday in a month with five thursdays, is date night."
1954,Amy,it also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
65,Amy,cornucopia. what a mellifluous word.
3471,Amy,sorry.
2695,Amy,i know how you feel. she didn’t invite any of us.
3035,Amy,"well, she likes me. you know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it."
1940,Amy,"ooh, the philharmonic is playing beethoven downtown."
261,Amy,by all means.
145,Amy,religion?
2024,Amy,i just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
1810,Amy,no. they forgot i was there. but it really opened up my pores.
1121,Amy,are rajesh and leonard competing for it as well?
1622,Amy,no.
1820,Amy,i think it’s awful.
804,Amy,‘cause i’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
1117,Amy,"you didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. and he cried because he was so proud of you."
3435,Amy,"look, right here. red hulk is picking up thor’s hammer ’cause thor’s touching it."
2760,Amy,"well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
2198,Amy,no one’s talking about sonny and cher.
422,Amy,"not without cutting his head open, no. how about making my eyes like cleopatra?"
2114,Amy,"if you still have that bra, i’ll give you a nickel for it."
859,Amy,"ready, set, wrestle.  one, two, three, pin."
111,Amy,"then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?"
125,Amy,"it’s too thin if i were making a foot-long brain sandwich at quiznos. for examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine."
109,Amy,"oh, that’s an excellent question. for two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company."
2946,Amy,it was like being hit on by rat pack pee-wee herman.
1826,Amy,"well, i’m really sorry, but i think it’s for the best. you want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine."
1182,Amy,i kiss you on the lips.
1777,Amy,of course.
3107,Amy,"yes, you are. there have definitely been days when i was sad and you could tell."
557,Amy,i should’ve gotten a lawyer.
302,Amy,i trained ricky how to smoke. i can train him to shoot a poison dart. no jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
186,Amy,"leonard, can i ask you a question?"
1579,Amy,"look, i admit that it’s odd that rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. as a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
2203,Amy,fine. my old scarf.
636,Amy,great.
870,Amy,"so, listen, sheldon, i was thinking, since this is gonna be our first halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, i thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume."
2641,Amy,"well, i get why he’s annoyed."
755,Amy,yes.
2783,Amy,"well, that’s it. for the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
1005,Amy,seriously?
2614,Amy,"and yet, you can’t."
580,Amy,hey.
262,Amy,i don’t understand. the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
3034,Amy,maybe there won’t be one.
1506,Amy,"we’ll come back to that one. this brings us to the final item in our annual state of the relationship summit. item 29, valentine’s day."
1465,Amy,this is so pretty. bert works for the geology department.
3051,Amy,"well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
2079,Amy,"i’d say i’m sorry i asked, except i didn’t."
2302,Amy,"that’s, um, terrific. listen, i’m, i’m kind of tired. can we call it a night?"
891,Amy,you’re smart.
2612,Amy,what did you have in mind?
1003,Amy,"it’s probably because they were bullied growing up. in a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment."
735,Amy,rain check.
2739,Amy,i wish there were some way i could make it better.
3344,Amy,"yeah, um, raj is moving out."
1761,Amy,i’m gonna let you count this as two dates. they’re a lot of work.
2415,Amy,i will. i wish you were here.
3048,Amy,"well, after that, sheldon and i got out of the house for a while."
2751,Amy,i’m sure it’s just ’cause i’m dating sheldon.
3222,Amy,this isn’t about me and sheldon. this is about rajesh moving in with leonard and penny.
3411,Amy,nice try.
1265,Amy,it was good.
1070,Amy,what’s this?
1425,Amy,"wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
2511,Amy,how could you do that?
456,Amy,a floppy disk?
1568,Amy,"just say something normal like, i saw your profile. looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”"
1914,Amy,"if you’re not up to hosting christmas dinner, i’m happy to do it. you can even bring your father."
570,Amy,"you were right, a whole new load."
834,Amy,it’s her i have to worry about.
1422,Amy,"and with leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean."
2306,Amy,no. pinch me.
955,Amy,"sheldon, this isn’t helping. why don’t you just let me get some rest."
845,Amy,"me, too. but we’ll see him tomorrow."
2253,Amy,i don’t have much experience turning men down. it wasn’t so much fun.
2488,Amy,"now? oh, looks like we just lost kripke."
3009,Amy,stop talking about trains.
2460,Amy,don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
2197,Amy,because we’re broken up.
212,Amy,"oh, who are you kidding? she’s breathtaking."
471,Amy,wait for moi.
2276,Amy,it’s going fine. it’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
3433,Amy,"you were right. i had nothing to worry about. that skank’s your problem, not mine."
3199,Amy,by yourself?
3367,Amy,"i know, but what if sheldon…"
3437,Amy,that’s right. they’re no good without the lighter.
2194,Amy,what baby?
2226,Amy,"oh, i don’t know."
2914,Amy,"sheldon, if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, i need to harvest them. now, i’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to."
79,Amy,"you wanted me to have a boyfriend, mother. well, here he is. have to sign off now. my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins."
2354,Amy,i’m fine. how are you?
1964,Amy,"if i were going to hawaii, i’d spend all my time at the keck observatory. did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the hubble?"
1102,Amy,"the world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds."
432,Amy,you have any evidence to support that statement?
401,Amy,"no, no, i’m sorry, i’m so sorry. i take it all back. look. i’m, uh, i’m sitting in your chair. there’s nothing wrong with it. it’s a great chair. please let me continue to be part of your world. ow!"
882,Amy,you guys have got to be the weirdest couple i know.
2379,Amy,"i really want that, too."
3014,Amy,"sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
3458,Amy,"huh. well, this is weird."
2056,Amy,what are you talking about?
732,Amy,before; now it’s you.
2871,Amy,"no. and on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
1796,Amy,"better than good. i mean, look at you. your body’s bangin’."
2861,Amy,"as you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band. "
156,Amy,"thank you, sheldon. you’re a good friend."
1972,Amy,"i’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night."
366,Amy,"she engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. i’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little indian boy."
1728,Amy,"i’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?"
2578,Amy,and rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
1589,Amy,"hey, i found something. it looks like a little man with a briefcase."
1341,Amy,"oh, sheldon."
535,Amy,or we play travel twister.
1460,Amy,"it’s exhausting. do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy?"
88,Amy,i’m a girl.
479,Amy,"that’s cool, that’s cool."
2149,Amy,i can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
3254,Amy,"well, don’t give up. maybe we can fix it."
3424,Amy,"sheldon, are you all right? when last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from raj’s, but according to facebook, you just checked in at the cheesecake factory."
3461,Amy,"it’s not the best best western i’ve been to, but i’d say it’s the third best best western i’ve been to."
2393,Amy,i do know what to say. let’s get me waxed.
886,Amy,it’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
967,Amy,oh?
2338,Amy,"so it’s like kiss, marry, kill."
1058,Amy,"yeah. hey, ames, nothing. i was all set to move in with sheldon, and now i hear i can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with leonard."
2008,Amy,"well, i’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and i thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal."
1366,Amy,we’re never getting our drinks.
2878,Amy,thanks.
2173,Amy,"well, it’s only been 11 hours."
1925,Amy,look at you on santa’s lap. that’s so sweet.
2510,Amy,what?
264,Amy,meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
665,Amy,thank you. wait. where’d the painting go?
780,Amy,how long does this stay on?
3158,Amy,because i’m mad at you.
1733,Amy,"i do, i see it."
2235,Amy,i’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. i don’t know what you’re talking about.
2384,Amy,"okay. good night. wait. um, sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?"
3355,Amy,"you know, what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new."
720,Amy,"spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. at a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
2615,Amy,here’s your tea.
1599,Amy,it actually was kind of fun.
837,Amy,hang on. 
1675,Amy,my mom made it up as an alternative to the girl scouts. she didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
2120,Amy,keep talking.
2216,Amy,i had extra dough.
1188,Amy,it should be me.
1041,Amy,"think about it, sheldon. i’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, i’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, i find cute as a button. what do you think?"
3185,Amy,penny says they’re ready to go.
2995,Amy,"well, first deliveries can be slow."
2980,Amy,thank you?
1735,Amy,"if she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
1207,Amy,"well, it sounds like you’re saying that i could do better than sheldon."
972,Amy,are you saying you want to spank me?
391,Amy,never mind. i’ll talk to penny.
2742,Amy,"well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
3448,Amy,you guys doing okay down there?
2918,Amy,"it didn’t hurt, did it?"
285,Amy,you smell like baby powder.
1503,Amy,"maybe the guys are right. i mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. i’m sure they’re having more fun than we are."
2986,Amy,what’s wrong?
3181,Amy,"look at you, going to comic-con, talking about ewoks. i really have become the cool one around here."
2926,Amy,"well, i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit."
1838,Amy,"well, i hope you get it."
2350,Amy,"we are. but i was hoping, maybe…"
3041,Amy,i’ll take over from here.
3008,Amy,it’s not about trains.
671,Amy,don’t bother.
1178,Amy,"i guess i know that. it’s just, part of me wants more."
338,Amy,bernadette is with priya and leonard. message received. commence operation “priya wouldn’t wanna be-ya.”
2244,Amy,i can’t believe he ran my credit.
696,Amy,there’s not a hair on my body i wouldn’t let this woman trim.
2479,Amy,"i, i think it starts with good communication."
50,Amy,seconded.
1418,Amy,"you make jokes about sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, i don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now."
352,Amy,"it’s indeed admirable. although, it is microbiology."
1370,Amy,"i must say, sheldon, you’re handling this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity."
493,Amy,"come on, tumour. come on, tumour, mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. yay, brain tumour! probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
3164,Amy,"that’s different. she’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
1318,Amy,"i like you, too."
1667,Amy,arthur passing away was harder on sheldon than he’s ready to admit. really hoping this will cheer him up.
1699,Amy,that’s nice.
2778,Amy,"i’ve never lived with someone, either. this is a lot for me, too."
782,Amy,"no, i had a cover story, i told everyone it was herpes. so, how’s everything going with you and leonard?"
198,Amy,"technically, faisal is my fiance. but i do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter."
569,Amy,"i don’t think mother teresa… oh, that is adorable."
2318,Amy,did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first thanksgiving?
730,Amy,armin… damn it.
1379,Amy,"no traffic, we’re sailing."
2649,Amy,who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
3201,Amy,"he can, but it’s still not changing my mind."
2629,Amy,she’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. this could take a while.
2810,Amy,fine.
1513,Amy,we’re going to have valentine’s day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
674,Amy,"yes, too much. because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. i clearly like you more than you like me."
3219,Amy,just keep walking.
1155,Amy,i’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
3247,Amy,"number two, disagreements can happen politely. there’s no need to call an idea stupid."
3470,Amy,"maybe it’s sheldon, here to say he’s sorry."
2979,Amy,so do you.
1817,Amy,11 minutes. that’s longer than i thought.
3277,Amy,"it’s okay, now i don’t need butter."
2550,Amy,are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?
2322,Amy,i might go visit my aunt next week.
1879,Amy,i’m sure he brought it.
1131,Amy,let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.
710,Amy,"i had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? is he real, or did you make him up like armin the miniature horse breeder?"
533,Amy,a comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
762,Amy,we’re playing doctor. star trek style.
1901,Amy,that was a good one.
809,Amy,"well, i like it."
1504,Amy,"item 28, your pet name for me. time’s running out on this. you need to make a decision."
1376,Amy,we do. and i expect you to be on your best behaviour.
397,Amy,"no, he didn’t."
3217,Amy,sheldon.
54,Amy,touche.
794,Amy,you know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? they devour their mate.
947,Amy,i think i’m too sick to go to the funeral.
3088,Amy,"sheldon, what did you do?"
151,Amy,"you reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
2868,Amy,"anyway, how about dinner?"
1128,Amy,it sounds like a long and tedious evening.
318,Amy,she always this crabby when she urinates?
1196,Amy,does he ever shut up?
819,Amy,"hang on, please. hello?"
2390,Amy,what surprises?
1751,Amy,"it’s better than hot, it’s binding."
1759,Amy,"they developed the relationship closeness inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour."
2482,Amy,"oh. uh, we-we have another caller. hi. you’re on fun with flags."
3314,Amy,hey.
2713,Amy,back to your phone.
101,Amy,"i’m not sure i grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. next on wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, truth or dare."
2300,Amy,i have a dvd of that lecture.
2223,Amy,"my mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies."
2133,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
2642,Amy,"well, i know how he feels. i never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
235,Amy,"if you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
3059,Amy,delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
424,Amy,i got you this to give to me.
442,Amy,"no, thanks. i’m gonna head home."
2180,Amy,maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
1950,Amy,are you crazy? you know he’s a flight risk.
2736,Amy,you really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
3300,Amy,get your food.
2098,Amy,"yes, so please behave yourselves."
2412,Amy,that works for me.
2540,Amy,we’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
3216,Amy,sheldon.
108,Amy,"you might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it."
1983,Amy,careful. she’ll bite your fingers off.
2579,Amy,"oh, but he said you can get store credit."
3308,Amy,relax. we’re the same blood type. he knew he could harvest an organ.
1499,Amy,"on the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. not gonna lie, it felt good."
18,Amy,"once a year. it’s a deal i made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her george foreman grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. how about you, penny? do you go on many dates?"
489,Amy,proposal. one wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
2065,Amy,no. forget it.
3438,Amy,we’re here.
2091,Amy,exactly.
3069,Amy,"uh, penny, i don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out. "
3453,Amy,hello.
1903,Amy,how many times do i have to say i’m sorry?
1489,Amy,really? you would do that?
862,Amy,ladies night at the cheesecake factory. does it get any better than this?
3262,Amy,i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.
192,Amy,"well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
2535,Amy,"well, don’t you think i’m the one who should go in?"
655,Amy,what’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
2361,Amy,"oh, he’s coming here. i’m actually making dinner."
311,Amy,okay. don’t really know where we go from here.
2567,Amy,"look, i’m, i’m sorry for your loss, but i think i have something that might make you feel better. i got you a new computer."
457,Amy,how did wil wheaton get on the list?
2154,Amy,it’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
2411,Amy,"me, too."
1163,Amy,"uh, well, when we were going through security, i got pulled out of line for a pat-down. the, uh, tsa agent got a little handsy. i may have broken her nose with my elbow."
1354,Amy,how do you not know how to use glue? did you ditch pre-school?
1078,Amy,"subtle, but powerful."
220,Amy,wise.
1094,Amy,i can’t believe i ditched work for disneyland.
2936,Amy,not right now.
2854,Amy,"uh, no. he, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
2385,Amy,thanks for taking me out.
3058,Amy,"you and i are in a relationship. i help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
976,Amy,"oh, my."
2301,Amy,"not as a valentine’s present, no."
3045,Amy,"we’re ignoring the fins, okay."
2746,Amy,bert’s a geologist. 
2712,Amy,i’d be lost without you.
393,Amy,i do appreciate a bargain. this entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
2375,Amy,that’s sheldon.
1314,Amy,no.
623,Amy,"parental pressure can be daunting. i remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. last year, i finally gave in and let her do it."
726,Amy,our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. he said it was a magical evening.
590,Amy,no.
2048,Amy,yes.
686,Amy,i’ll let you in on a little secret.
1524,Amy,i don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
645,Amy,"yeah, you’re a biologist."
1146,Amy,i’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
26,Amy,tuned bayonets.
810,Amy,just watch the movie.
2996,Amy,"well, should we, uh, head back up?"
1169,Amy,"sheldon, they’re talking about sex."
2161,Amy,what are you doing?
1993,Amy,no.
3283,Amy,"i can’t find it, either. how can he not remember a day?"
1462,Amy,"hey, what brings you guys here?"
2211,Amy,i’m gonna kill him.
2952,Amy,"honestly, i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy."
2182,Amy,"we were together for so long, i honestly don’t know what i’m feeling."
1448,Amy,he’s wrong.
1505,Amy,"i’m sorry, but gollum and flakey are not acceptable."
2923,Amy,no reason we can’t start right now.
3243,Amy,can i see that?
2426,Amy,"no, no, not just that. i mean, detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting."
1468,Amy,"what?! no, he doesn’t."
63,Amy,"that’s not true of all bars. juice bars, for example."
234,Amy,yes.
1410,Amy,"well, i have an extremely low centre of gravity. i’m like a pyramid."
1473,Amy,i guess it hasn’t come up.
2909,Amy,"you know, some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle."
1809,Amy,"most universities have them. when i was an undergrad, i spent three days in one pledging a sorority."
2874,Amy,"or damp wall, just as bad."
1156,Amy,and?
22,Amy,then 128.
3394,Amy,"in fact, that’s when i started to really miss you."
1353,Amy,this is fun. i’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications i’m allergic to.
1743,Amy,"okay, good luck. and call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. hey, girlfriend."
2967,Amy,how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant?
3174,Amy,what? why didn’t you say anything?
658,Amy,do you like it?
663,Amy,"i guess i should get going, too. good night, painting penny. good night, real penny."
3416,Amy,"uh-huh. hang on.  hello. a little late, leonard. sorry."
1664,Amy,why not?
2278,Amy,thank you.
1744,Amy,"tonight. you, me, color me mine. maybe we sneak in some pinot, make it color me wine."
838,Amy,isn’t it obvious? i’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
2193,Amy,what do you want?
3103,Amy,"sheldon, dinner’s ready. i made beef loaf, because i know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. sheldon? hey, are you okay?"
1542,Amy,"well, thankfully, i won’t have to see it, ’cause i won’t be your girlfriend anymore. amy farrah fowler. why, yes, i would like to take a survey."
3148,Amy,"sorry, i don’t have a list of defunct search engines that i miss."
2508,Amy,"me, me, me too. i’m a grown-up and i’ve done it."
2759,Amy,about five weeks.
2245,Amy,you really should’ve gone on the internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
1773,Amy,"what if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? i mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine."
2596,Amy,"okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?"
383,Amy,would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
2107,Amy,are you all set for your trip?
1988,Amy,why? what did i do?
1122,Amy,do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?
2532,Amy,oh. penny says everyone’s there. are you ready?
1715,Amy,but you still accomplished something.
274,Amy,i should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
3124,Amy,"hey, there’s another dance club nearby. i mean, i don’t know how you feel about latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
497,Amy,"don’t. i’ll be okay. you’re not the first girls i thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. it’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in norway all over again."
2059,Amy,no one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
286,Amy,"oh, i’m not confused at all. you’re like a sexy toddler."
3431,Amy,"sheldon cooper, i’ve got a bone to pick with you, and i’m about to do it in front of all your friends."
2309,Amy,"i’m, i’m really sorry."
2470,Amy,what do you mean?
1398,Amy,"i know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. that translates to funding."
2606,Amy,"that’s me, your emotional outhouse. you know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, i’m, i’m here for you."
2690,Amy,"oh, was it, uh, dr. jenofski? i just saw his ted talk."
772,Amy,"excuse me, i’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
2960,Amy,what’s up?
622,Amy,they’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
1200,Amy,and to the sick and dying who make it possible.
1658,Amy,"i mean, not in a romantic way. it’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him."
3418,Amy,may i offer an observation?
677,Amy,"i’m sorry, i’m just having trouble believing you right now."
2496,Amy,so do i.
3155,Amy,our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
1281,Amy,do you feel better?
2381,Amy,get back here.
2857,Amy,we’re so sorry.
2662,Amy,"oh, we’re the first ones here."
258,Amy,did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
1153,Amy,"yeah, sounds like a drag."
1672,Amy,"i never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that sheldon got interested in science."
1825,Amy,what happened?
1527,Amy,why are you still here?
2563,Amy,get a new computer.
1910,Amy,"take that, glass ceiling."
682,Amy,we’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
1432,Amy,"if that were true, i wouldn’t still be living alone. well, not exactly alone. i do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of sheldon’s t-shirts on it."
2291,Amy,"that’s a good question. after five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be."
1915,Amy,"i’ve always wanted to do a traditional victorian christmas. parlour games, goose and figgy pudding."
2945,Amy,"okay, i’ve had enough."
3188,Amy,really? because she doesn’t actually want to go. she’s just doing it to make him happy.
941,Amy,you had my car towed.
2985,Amy,"so, no one’s gonna tell me? okay."
20,Amy,"this is very interesting. cultural perceptions are subjective. penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
1119,Amy,okay.
335,Amy,"i heard it at the mall, when i was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. have a good night. try not to ogle my caboose as i walk away."
1145,Amy,you sure about that?
2175,Amy,sure.
2927,Amy,"so, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
3159,Amy,"sheldon, it’s humiliating. thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
94,Amy,a colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.
2074,Amy,are you asking me to go to mars with you?
1095,Amy,"oh, i was very clever, i did it in stages. at seven o’clock last night, i called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned i was going out for seafood. at nine thirty, i called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. at eleven thirty, i called and said i was throwing up like a fire hose. at twelve forty-five, i called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now i’m going to disneyland."
2585,Amy,"well, i signed one before we slept together. why not now?"
2147,Amy,"yes, they are."
2367,Amy,"so, a little silver lining."
2741,Amy,i’ll be right back.
2684,Amy,"i’m sorry, i’ve been going on and on."
3131,Amy,it’s bigger than mine.
724,Amy,how do i get him to treat me better?
2388,Amy,i think i’ll just stick to mexican.
240,Amy,you should get one.
2898,Amy,yes.
792,Amy,thank you.
1710,Amy,we’re in a moving car. what do you expect me to do? stick my fingers in my ears?
2,Amy,"that’s enough. sheldon, sheldon, give it!"
3142,Amy,because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
1471,Amy,should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
857,Amy,"long division, long division. go, go, go."
2640,Amy,what’s going on with him?
2055,Amy,"but that’s not your fault. like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. you’ll stay with me when he’s at comic-con or away for work."
1125,Amy,you don’t say.
2419,Amy,"oh. sheldon, thank you. that’s so romantic. but what about rajesh? he was okay with you choosing the name?"
2183,Amy,oh. what was her name?
1617,Amy,you’re kidding.
1864,Amy,"well, you can relax. just because you think i look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together."
793,Amy,have i ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis? 
1164,Amy,i’m sorry. i feel like such an idiot.
174,Amy,are you in the lanthanoid series?
851,Amy,"uh, hand. uh, nail, polish?"
2146,Amy,who says this is the only one i hid?
620,Amy,"i’m sorry, sheldon, i’m busy. i’m right in the middle of my addiction study. i’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to o’doul’s."
2138,Amy,and mcblanket over sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. oh. ten o’clock. date night’s over.
1771,Amy,"i’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones."
328,Amy,"come on, strawberries. take one for the team."
202,Amy,"millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies."
2326,Amy,i don’t know. just ask me whatever comes to mind.
1560,Amy,then i met sheldon and look at where we are now.
2462,Amy,really? you know what it’s like to have date night ruined because google changed their font?
1323,Amy,"sheldon, i’m so proud of you."
1857,Amy,where are you going?
1994,Amy,good luck finding it.
846,Amy,"uh, box? uh, window?"
608,Amy,i’ll say.
3342,Amy,you really believe that?
1087,Amy,"just so you know, this is not a stupid play. a streetcar named desire is an american classic."
1364,Amy,"at work today, i did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
835,Amy,"oh, really? look at this face  how can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?"
2089,Amy,"leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. he’s going to feel bad."
789,Amy,i can’t believe i bleached my moustache for this.
307,Amy,i hope you don’t take what i’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
2554,Amy,you should see the valentine’s day card he gave me.
2771,Amy,oh. this is so exciting.
2800,Amy,i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him.
2789,Amy,"okay, i’ll take that side."
1507,Amy,"before you get upset, i believe i’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
1113,Amy,hey.
1250,Amy,"uh, let’s see. i like harps, little house on the prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…"
1300,Amy,and this is dr. gunderson from stockholm.
1944,Amy,how’s it going in there?
1731,Amy,no penny?
2816,Amy,"okay. well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
3101,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go."
1587,Amy,"oh, ugh."
1851,Amy,"okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. stop bragging."
1979,Amy,whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
1813,Amy,i’m going to the vending machine. do you want anything?
1133,Amy,the fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. it makes us?
3023,Amy,we’ve all come a long way. there’s a lot to be proud of.
370,Amy,"we’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and i’ll teach you my secret language, op."
3412,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
3057,Amy,have you? how am i feeling right now?
3309,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
2395,Amy,"hi, sheldon."
610,Amy,i’m surrendering to fun.
634,Amy,"yeah, good for you. now, start counting."
852,Amy,why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
176,Amy,"so, girl talk?"
1337,Amy,sheldon.
1756,Amy,"it’s a good thing i’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire."
517,Amy,so no. and action.
756,Amy,fine. there’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. why don’t you have a seat.
62,Amy,i understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. have you tried a bar or tavern?
602,Amy,"if you and leonard get back together, sheldon and i will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
2963,Amy,what about me and sheldon?
1038,Amy,what if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
1449,Amy,why?
473,Amy,your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
5,Amy,"if that was slang, i’m unfamiliar with it. if it was literal, i share your aversion to soiled hosiery. in any case, i’m here because my mother and i have agreed that i will date at least once a year."
3402,Amy,"huge fan, you say?"
1068,Amy,"well, then, that’s what we’re going to do."
334,Amy,"so, are you off to dinner with priya, howard and bernadette?"
1187,Amy,and now he can talk. i want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
2490,Amy,"…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. well, that was quick. hi. you’re on fun with flags."
2135,Amy,amazing.
9,Amy,neurobiologist. your check engine light is on.
83,Amy,see? it’s working.
1247,Amy,i think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
1430,Amy,"come on, sheldon, you should go."
2461,Amy,"look, i know you think i’m not right for sheldon, but trust me, i’m his best shot. you have no idea how much i put up with."
1753,Amy,i then suggested a pub.
2443,Amy,"well, i, i’m, i’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me."
769,Amy,i know.
2518,Amy,"so sheldon, there’s something i’ve been wanting to talk about but i know it’s kind of a touchy subject."
1576,Amy,i’m meeting her for coffee.
3282,Amy,maybe it’s wherever your pants are.
2608,Amy,oh. okay.
2942,Amy,i don’t think so.
1597,Amy,"actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. fyi, we plan on selling out the human race hard."
3358,Amy,i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton.
2635,Amy,never have i ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
2576,Amy,or you could just look into my eyes.
2044,Amy,"well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
733,Amy,"ooh, science center. redeeming. let’s go."
1368,Amy,you want to say sorry.
3307,Amy,"you know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. yes, starting now."
2513,Amy,then why are we drinking?
2826,Amy,maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
1552,Amy,can i borrow it when you’re done?
47,Amy,"absolutely not. my colleagues and i are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. that means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours."
2569,Amy,"well, the guy at the store said this one is great."
2533,Amy,are you all right?
642,Amy,"you’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. hope your hands are steady. it’s the width of a single hair. but this is just biology, so i’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you."
3405,Amy,why didn’t you tell me?
736,Amy,"all right, pivoting to the big question. bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. what do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
1263,Amy,she got the way to groove me.
1999,Amy,you’re just making fun of me.
669,Amy,why? so you can just take it down when i leave? i don’t need your pity.
1129,Amy,"oh. well, in that case, perhaps i should come along."
511,Amy,"yes. yes. oh, my gosh, i, i have so much to do. there’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. what should we do for the bachelorette party? oh, i know, we’ll go to a native american sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on bernadette’s naked body. so that’s happening."
1016,Amy,yeah.
3353,Amy,"oh. that’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
249,Amy,"believe me, it’s there, we all have it. hit me with some more booze, and i’ll show you."
3422,Amy,"well, normally i respect your macho rebellious attitude toward the man, but, in this case, i think you’ve made a foolish mistake."
3346,Amy,"i don’t know, maybe i shouldn’t go."
382,Amy,"denial. denial, denial. come in."
752,Amy,i have devised an experiment that i believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
1400,Amy,no.
2421,Amy,"okay, i think i know what to say now."
1236,Amy,really?
3038,Amy,"they haven’t said. anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
3251,Amy,wow. look at that.
1194,Amy,"rajesh, i thought lucy was coming."
1907,Amy,i do.
1539,Amy,"oh, i’ve already moved on. besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me."
850,Amy,now?
2014,Amy,i just saw you.
1880,Amy,"he probably got a new one. finish your breakfast. look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it."
869,Amy,i think i’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
2984,Amy,"i think he might be right. also, who is that?"
1338,Amy,shh.
1553,Amy,i think we’re gonna go.
12,Amy,are you a homosexual?
1480,Amy,"that’s very nice of you, but i do have a boyfriend."
1877,Amy,don’t worry about that. i’m happy to take you to work.
1670,Amy,i wonder why that is.
2137,Amy,"i’d say, knox over ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold."
190,Amy,"well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
368,Amy,where are we going?
1491,Amy,"last week, you spent that on a little dress. "
3122,Amy,nothing says fun like being scolded.
1803,Amy,"hey, penny, hey, let’s go. we found a place that has australian male strippers."
2113,Amy,"ooh, you just chose champions. it’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient german practice of trial by combat."
105,Amy,oh. all right. what is the circumference of your areolas?
3089,Amy,i’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.
928,Amy,"before i park, come in the back seat. i want to show you something i had done today."
801,Amy,i’ll take it.
1326,Amy,what’s wrong?
163,Amy,"shame. since you’re my best friend, i thought it would be a good bonding opportunity."
3456,Amy,hi.
2745,Amy,"hi, bert. this is my friend, penny."
205,Amy,"you don’t have to be strong for me. now let’s talk about priya, that man-stealing bitch."
2160,Amy,are any of them me?
664,Amy,"you don’t have to say good night to painting amy, ’cause she’s never leaving."
2440,Amy,can i have a tissue?
2324,Amy,are we done discussing the weather?
874,Amy,"i make compromises for you all the time. just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?"
508,Amy,"when we first met, i made one and pretended you gave it to me. you can have it back if you want."
1124,Amy,"you know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision."
1638,Amy,"what-what do you want, like, thai food? a burger?"
480,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
2370,Amy,my fault. i brought him up.
2709,Amy,play with your phone.
2102,Amy,we won’t know if there’s equality until female thor has a baby and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
1995,Amy,"you know, there was a time when i was alone and had no friends. i’m starting to miss that."
927,Amy,"wait, i’m leaving my car here?"
629,Amy,"sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. you have no experience in the field of biology."
790,Amy,go home.
269,Amy,"sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse. in other news, i’m thinking of starting an herb garden. mum’s the word. gotta go."
738,Amy,"hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
1343,Amy,i’ve never seen him this happy before.
1530,Amy,it’s valentine’s day. we’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
2084,Amy,he might not be.
1313,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
2258,Amy,i don’t know.
481,Amy,i wanted to be alone.
3032,Amy,"i rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
3364,Amy,guys.
1484,Amy,"no, it’s not."
309,Amy,yes. i also found a korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. what happened last night?
499,Amy,"this is us. bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. and where’s amy? she’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
2279,Amy,three.
1509,Amy,"come on, sheldon. why not?"
2264,Amy,"well, actually, he, he already did."
2232,Amy,"actually, the joke was on her. i could still see the tv through the slats."
2219,Amy,"fine, i guess. i’ve been focusing on me. i was thinking about changing my wardrobe."
565,Amy,perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. which word’s tripping you up? assuage or altruism?
1111,Amy,this is really fun.
3126,Amy,"i’m not sad. i mean, hello."
2207,Amy,good-bye.
1716,Amy,but you did do it. so what if it didn’t all go your way? that’s what makes it an adventure.
2041,Amy,we used the coordinates to locate the cities.
210,Amy,"hi, bestie."
2099,Amy,all these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. feels like we could be an 18th century french salon.
1682,Amy,how many is that now?
2477,Amy,"no, i just blink a lot, it’s not morse code for rescue me. oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. hello, and welcome to fun with flags. what’s your question?"
32,Amy,"very good, leonard. but next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding."
828,Amy,i’d like to speak to sheldon.
994,Amy,"i do that, too. sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. and i let it."
1391,Amy,"broad shoulders, good hair."
1024,Amy,hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
2718,Amy,it was a lot hotter than it sounds.
25,Amy,correct. my turn.
2966,Amy,"you know what i mean. you were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
1166,Amy,okay.
3135,Amy,"me, too."
703,Amy,good morning.
2747,Amy,"oh, actually, we’re an hour late."
1463,Amy,"why? because sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think i have any other options? i’m just kidding. i’ll get my purse."
2959,Amy,really?
1393,Amy,zack’s here!
34,Amy,i must take responsibility. i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
555,Amy,that’s my boyfriend. it’s open!
952,Amy,"sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour."
3401,Amy,"oh. really? uh, when did you meet her?"
2653,Amy,because you were defending sheldon like you always do.
1413,Amy,can i give you a ride to the airport?
1159,Amy,so there are some rules.
1697,Amy,i also mentioned that he and i could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
728,Amy,"i’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
2644,Amy,"oh, sheldon, i never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."
3136,Amy,i can get us there in two.
1327,Amy,what are you talking about?
2483,Amy,"look, i know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship."
997,Amy,"thank you, rajesh. he wants me, i’m good. we can go now."
1533,Amy,that was nice.
1321,Amy,"oh, i love that."
2664,Amy,"oh, i do. it was three years ago."
1033,Amy,children’s toy.
49,Amy,we appear to have reached an impasse.
641,Amy,"okay, smart guy. i’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. have at it."
3050,Amy,what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
3436,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
3325,Amy,"you said juggling was dumb, too."
2953,Amy,sounds like the night we had coitus.
2397,Amy,do you like it?
3119,Amy,can i pee now?
2179,Amy,i’m not gonna be alone. i’ll be with my friends.
1714,Amy,sure.
2453,Amy,"the minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. i don’t need this."
1446,Amy,congratulations.
61,Amy,"from a neurobiological standpoint, leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation."
2940,Amy,"hey, you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. oh, man. "
3339,Amy,"well, good for you. i actually have a little news myself."
2201,Amy,and you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so i would open the door.
2652,Amy,who told you to stop making all those gandhi jokes about him?
468,Amy,"yes and no. all those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. so it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. check it out, still in the bags. the gowns, not the bridesmaids."
3427,Amy,i swear! can i tell my doctor? i’m probably gonna need shots!
1028,Amy,the strap is part of the hammer.
2847,Amy,"well, that’s not a surprise at all. i mean, if i knew you were good at surprises, i would have"
1742,Amy,"oh. oh, i hear you. try and get that nag off your back, right? i mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?"
1371,Amy,is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?
2290,Amy,"no. i mean, to be completely honest, i’ve, i’ve only been in one long-term relationship."
889,Amy,how’d it go with leonard?
2752,Amy,just the right idea at the right time.
2666,Amy,i don’t know. i really don’t know.
3162,Amy,so?
523,Amy,what is taking you so long? 
1389,Amy,ooh!
2189,Amy,yeah.
1077,Amy,"oh, that’s right. how’d it go with penny?"
911,Amy,"sheldon, i’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. that’s it. end of story. good night."
1913,Amy,"wait, she-hulk’s a lawyer?"
3056,Amy,"not your whole life. i mean, science, you got that. organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. but understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you."
2807,Amy,"oh, you heard me. your experimental bona fides are laughable."
872,Amy,yeah?
601,Amy,ooh!
1264,Amy,"she got the way to move me, honey."
1541,Amy,"all the time. and he knew that, as your girlfriend, i wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. i mean, a table? come on?"
1451,Amy,"well, that makes sense. the prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…"
136,Amy,hoo.
193,Amy,"all right. have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?"
223,Amy,"penny, i’m sorry you got dragged into this. i know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin."
2786,Amy,"well, i’m not refusing. i’m just trying to be considerate."
2469,Amy,"people who are fans of an internet show about flags? trust me, they’re around."
1870,Amy,"come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius."
225,Amy,"sheldon, look at me. i think it’s time to face the fact that leonard is the nucleus of your social group. where he goes, the group goes."
1829,Amy,"i simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress."
1467,Amy,he’s nice.
253,Amy,"i’m glad you talked me into this. we work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly."
420,Amy,"i would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. he behaved like a child the entire time."
3268,Amy,"thanks, babe. number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
44,Amy,"it’s very impressive, for theoretical work."
2311,Amy,sure. heh.
2542,Amy,see what?
1616,Amy,"whoa, whoa. wait a second. who’s they?"
1619,Amy,please pass the butter!
3171,Amy,can i hear one?
1009,Amy,"well, there was a lot of action."
2933,Amy,make a baby? what are you talking about?
425,Amy,"i never went to my prom. my mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
1904,Amy,"australia, mate."
3347,Amy,i guess. and he’ll have you and leonard right across the hall the whole time.
355,Amy,i was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
3361,Amy,so are you.
3063,Amy,sheldon.
2852,Amy,"oh, they’re pretty. thank you."
978,Amy,ooh!
51,Amy,"good day, sheldon cooper."
2029,Amy,"that’s what i said. before i knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart."
1583,Amy,i don’t know.
521,Amy,"not penny beautiful, but beautiful."
2883,Amy,"this is ridiculous. penny, do you remember when i taught you ubbi dubbi?"
2755,Amy,"thank you so much, bert. this was great."
1427,Amy,i don’t know.
2486,Amy,now?
2598,Amy,okay. i get it. i get it.
1179,Amy,come on. let’s go back out there.
906,Amy,"i don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. you need to ask him to leave."
2864,Amy,did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis…
2555,Amy,"sheldon, what did you do?"
2777,Amy,"look, i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it."
406,Amy,"leonard, please. i don’t need the running commentary."
270,Amy,agreed. it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
1692,Amy,"sheldon, it was just a thought."
1643,Amy,i hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
3100,Amy,stop enjoying their fight.
119,Amy,hoo.
350,Amy,i texted architect. that’s amusing. auto-correct must’ve changed it.
2698,Amy,then i graciously accept.
1721,Amy,then i have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than i am. is bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
1575,Amy,"look, i’ll see if i can change her mind tomorrow night."
1554,Amy,i think we’re gonna go.
2046,Amy,"after a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
2722,Amy,i will not have you be disrespectful to me.
1312,Amy,"image number six, woman giving birth."
2052,Amy,it’s okay. you made it. we’re fine.
648,Amy,that’s not an apology.
2458,Amy,"sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?"
2485,Amy,"oh, looks like we just lost kripke."
1475,Amy,penny really quit the cheesecake factory?
833,Amy,you’re right. i don’t have to worry about sheldon.
811,Amy,there might be a reason for that.
956,Amy,"you, you want to rub something on my chest?"
3193,Amy,"sure, happy to."
2988,Amy,i’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. what is this?
653,Amy,"you’re forgiven. now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. they’re still dirty from yesterday."
3326,Amy,"sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
3086,Amy,i remember signing our first relationship agreement.
1231,Amy,please leave me out of this.
124,Amy,it’s no mystery. i obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset tourette’s syndrome.
115,Amy,"well, the internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism."
2893,Amy,good night.
3327,Amy,"well, if you honestly…"
3053,Amy,"sheldon, i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were."
2769,Amy,"sheldon, what do you think?"
1626,Amy,you were just a little kid.
2738,Amy,i understand how you feel.
1770,Amy,you really went your entire life without anyone saying i hate you to your face?
3231,Amy,that’s great. how so?
949,Amy,"but our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
861,Amy,"one, two, three, eat."
2170,Amy,hold on. you’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
3121,Amy,"hey, did you hear anything back from the caltech preschool?"
2832,Amy,"you know, you’re right. i’m in this relationship, too. i need to stand up for myself."
1220,Amy,lucky guess.
333,Amy,"please, leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend."
1963,Amy,that would be so romantic for you and leonard.
1242,Amy,stop that. penny is not a liability.
76,Amy,i trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
991,Amy,"it’s fine. i’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. i didn’t have my first kiss till i was 22, and the guy only did it so i’d give him back his insulin."
1762,Amy,"no, we’re sorry. we never should have been comparing relationships in the first place."
3279,Amy,"well, i don’t want your germs around me."
3391,Amy,"actually, i want to hear about you. how are things at home?"
362,Amy,keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
2323,Amy,"no, the one in bakersfield."
864,Amy,and my boyfriend?
662,Amy,my mother didn’t allow me to watch it. she was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
303,Amy,excuse me. have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
2272,Amy,"no, no, stop reading that."
371,Amy,nope. sounds gop rop e a top.
1110,Amy,"sheldon, that’s not a real thing."
2828,Amy,it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
802,Amy,that’s from sheldon. he told me he had it engraved.
1241,Amy,"yeah, me, too."
1245,Amy,i’m sorry you got stuck with me. i bet you wanted to be with bernadette.
1160,Amy,thank you. vegas!
1103,Amy,"sheldon, all snow white needs is one little kiss to wake up."
713,Amy,i panicked and said woodstock. i just wanted to show sheldon off to my family.
191,Amy,"if this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
203,Amy,i came as quickly as i could.
1783,Amy,ooh. there’s a cover band in the lounge.
215,Amy,"it seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched bengal tiger."
731,Amy,you’re hurting me.
3351,Amy,"oh, the more details, the more sorry. well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. i made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
867,Amy,why?
179,Amy,"not for sex, for convenience. you can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance."
1032,Amy,how’s that?
1573,Amy,and i’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
1098,Amy,"come on, do it with us."
3054,Amy,"this was a potential issue, so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you."
1251,Amy,great. sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. he doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member. 
1045,Amy,here you go. i picked up the chinese food just the way leonard used to.
1965,Amy,"no, hold on. all canines instinctively know how to swim. why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?"
2905,Amy,what are you doing?
2373,Amy,"no, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. i’m, i’m just a little nervous."
843,Amy,so it does bother you.
2902,Amy,how about if i just don’t breathe at all?
3070,Amy,i’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
2896,Amy,"sorry, you brought it up?"
1154,Amy,let’s box it up.
3067,Amy,"better than ever. he asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. he’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him."
11,Amy,dandruff shampoo. i have dry scalp.
3255,Amy,"i can hear your face talking, so we’re even."
1501,Amy,i think i have you both beat. imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
1768,Amy,"i’m with him three years, nothing. she’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off."
2947,Amy,no. 
2814,Amy,i’m sorry for bringing this over here. 
1329,Amy,but the chinese team found the element.
3147,Amy,that’s a real thing?
685,Amy,little more. no. that’s got it.
2708,Amy,sheldon.
1494,Amy,"ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
1528,Amy,i’m being rude? you’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
2971,Amy,"well, how about we start a little smaller? like moving the furniture around."
743,Amy,perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
3318,Amy,how did you get from croissants to a unicycle?
1992,Amy,"it’s not about me and sheldon. it’s about a young woman in the 1800s named amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named cooper she falls in love with."
2246,Amy,"hey, i know sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. i think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair."
1081,Amy,"i didn’t mean now. hello? yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. well, i’d like a normal boyfriend. deal with it."
2130,Amy,"and at the same time, not."
884,Amy,"wow, my boyfriend is friends with stephen hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar. everything really is coming up amy."
2835,Amy,"oh, hi. hi."
2031,Amy,i think we’re safe.
3020,Amy,"yeah. penny, you’re the one who introduced him to bernie."
1953,Amy,"33 seconds. okay, that’ll be our baseline."
2502,Amy,"hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this."
1608,Amy,"maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. lol, right?"
1980,Amy,they have it.
1639,Amy,sorry i’m late. what did you do?
708,Amy,"you know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after i’ve already told everybody i’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. go home and play your game."
36,Amy,shamy?
2018,Amy,"wow, the store looks great."
1441,Amy,oh.
1270,Amy,"well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
3359,Amy,"yeah, that’s the one."
1637,Amy,"let’s get you some food. you, you’ll feel better after you eat."
1678,Amy,yeah. we were hoping it might cheer you up.
1717,Amy,see? this trip was good for you.
1280,Amy,i shouldn’t have said it. i’m sorry.
72,Amy,i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother.
48,Amy,"yes, but if i’m successful, i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
1757,Amy,so when do you guys plan on getting married?
3323,Amy,what are you doing?
2915,Amy,thank you.
1485,Amy,so what am i supposed to do now?
288,Amy,"oh, blah, blah, blah. give me some sugar, bestie ."
2743,Amy,"well, sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but i don’t think that’s happening."
2853,Amy,things didn’t work out?
28,Amy,we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
2187,Amy,it’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
1151,Amy,and that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
2618,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go with them."
2925,Amy,"you know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
1821,Amy,"bernadette is a successful microbiologist. she should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. i mean, what kind of message does that send?"
3039,Amy,"sheldon, don’t overreact."
3290,Amy,sings in mandarin. *
1324,Amy,what’s next?
2292,Amy,no. he’s a theoretical physicist at caltech.
619,Amy,i saved you a dumpling.
1832,Amy,"i disagree. as a female scientist, i think what you do affects all of us."
2860,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
3400,Amy,who’s he?
1394,Amy,"all right, mister, i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology."
536,Amy,"excuse me. i’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. and i’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. what do you say, bestie? we can do shirts and skins. i’m shirts. called it."
23,Amy,"in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the second world war?"
1765,Amy,"i’ll tell you what. if we stay, i’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
2619,Amy,"you know, if that study’s real, leonard might come back smarter than you."
2595,Amy,you have sporting equipment?
3183,Amy,why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?
709,Amy,my boyfriend’s a jerk.
2037,Amy,"well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick."
1955,Amy,"all right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
1275,Amy,"good night, dr. cooper."
2119,Amy,"well, that was an exciting 40 seconds."
1144,Amy,"you know, i might be able to help you with this. there’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less."
2993,Amy,"i guess, i guess we should stop."
887,Amy,"oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points."
1022,Amy,"okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, i can’t even take you seriously."
1700,Amy,"don’t i know it. what is that, polenta?"
1136,Amy,i’d like to know why penny’s here.
2613,Amy,"and yet, i’m not."
1544,Amy,"i think if i were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it."
3228,Amy,you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. it’s not a good influence.
1830,Amy,"well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so amy saves the day."
3421,Amy,"so, what do you think?"
2834,Amy,"it’s a nice enough spot. you know, if i’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…"
3011,Amy,i got a gryffindor robe for you.
1557,Amy,why can’t raj find a girl? the mystery continues.
2204,Amy,"you mean the night that i went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
2067,Amy,why do you even want to do this?
74,Amy,precisely.
3220,Amy,and don’t start thinking about it now.
487,Amy,"sheldon, i’m going to ask you something, and i’d like you to keep an open mind."
2365,Amy,thank you.
606,Amy,"hang on, dr. c. what’s vexillology?"
1945,Amy,sure.
829,Amy,"all right. well, tell him amy called."
3233,Amy,i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.
117,Amy,don’t worry. i’ll avoid the nether yea.
71,Amy,sheldon?
3146,Amy,"oh, really. anybody we know?"
2990,Amy,sheldon.
618,Amy,mit…
3409,Amy,"i don’t know. might be the new jersey talking, but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
2983,Amy,i’ve got the neosporin. who got hurt?
2409,Amy,"well, i’ve been waiting for this for so long, i’ve just built it up in my head. i don’t know what to expect."
918,Amy,"for hours. fortunately, i couldn’t understand most of it ’cause sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask."
112,Amy,"interesting. how will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?"
3249,Amy,"number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
458,Amy,you’re kidding.
374,Amy,"oh, i could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
3332,Amy,so?
1165,Amy,you guys enjoy your evening. i’m gonna go before i ruin anybody else’s weekend.
684,Amy,little higher on the right.
1897,Amy,i know i was thinking that. is this a show on flags or mind reading?
3261,Amy,we’re finally making progress. i wish we could do it without fighting.
2444,Amy,i’m curious. why do you call sheldon moon pie?
983,Amy,"so, what’s the plan? are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?"
77,Amy,"sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me."
29,Amy,"in a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. the low-lying city of copenhagen is flooded. thousands die. devastated, the danes never invent their namesake pastry. how does one miss that?"
300,Amy,of course. what’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
2040,Amy,"keep it down, we’re working here."
1799,Amy,"no, no, it’s okay. i was born with it. if you put a double-a battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
2439,Amy,"that’s great. and look at you, sitting in sheldon’s spot. you know, i don’t even get to sit there."
3106,Amy,"well, everybody has things that they need help with. like me, i can’t see without my glasses. and right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
55,Amy,i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
1445,Amy,hmm. can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
3425,Amy,every word. our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
1455,Amy,sure.
2191,Amy,i just hope i did the right thing.
227,Amy,"don’t be needy, bestie. that’s probably part of what chased leonard away. what i am saying, sheldon, is that your group is leonard-centric. if it were a town, it would be leonardville. if it were an islamic nation, leonardstan. if it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing hooray for leonardwood."
1802,Amy,we’re having the best time.
1982,Amy,have you even seen it?
2731,Amy,"i mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so i can see what lights up."
313,Amy,"i must say, penny, this is great fun."
2539,Amy,"hey, everybody, listen up."
1036,Amy,no.
673,Amy,i was a fool from summer lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
698,Amy,"gentlemen, as much as i’m sure sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and i have other plans. we are attending my aunt flora’s 93rd birthday party."
1861,Amy,what pressure? all i said was you look handsome. can you please open the door?
2602,Amy,"well, um, did you know i have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain i ever dissected?"
1171,Amy,what?
892,Amy,i feel like i’m in high school again.
2195,Amy,i’m hanging up.
2627,Amy,"ooh, that sounds cozy."
893,Amy,i know. it’s finally working.
2522,Amy,i’m sorry i brought it up.
260,Amy,yes. he looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. although it’s not much of a contest. the other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
3288,Amy,"fine. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
2972,Amy,"look, we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
1047,Amy,yes.
707,Amy,"sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? isn’t that a little rude?"
767,Amy,can i wear my maid of honour dress?
3111,Amy,is there anything we can do?
812,Amy,penny said she’s not sure she wants to be leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
2895,Amy,"sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
2757,Amy,bye.
2364,Amy,why not?
2224,Amy,"i know, but sheldon had this clause in the relationship agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a klingon."
2981,Amy,"sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. why don’t you let leonard keep a few things?"
3176,Amy,you’re actually going to comic-con?
99,Amy,pillow fight!
2131,Amy,"you know, there’s nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort."
998,Amy,"it’s your assistant alex, isn’t it?"
118,Amy,"did you know that the iconic valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?"
3210,Amy,and there is the love of which i speak.
2275,Amy,because it’s new and weird and i’m just trying to figure it all out. and i knew if i told you guys i had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
3404,Amy,i gave you one job. keep an eye on him. how hard is that?
3186,Amy,"sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying."
2564,Amy,i got here as quickly as i could.
3337,Amy,"you know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
2820,Amy,why is nothing easy with him?
1911,Amy,"cut. sheldon, that was beautiful."
324,Amy,"you are, with hair that smells like strawberries. and we’re going to use that to our advantage."
3428,Amy,"everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. everybody hurts, sometimes."
3165,Amy,yeah?
400,Amy,"no, i am your friend. please don’t be mad at me."
705,Amy,you sure you’re okay with this?
1912,Amy,i pressed it.
1800,Amy,we had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
257,Amy,bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard.
2536,Amy,"well, i’ve, you know, seen him without pants on."
1624,Amy,"well, that’s got to be a good feeling."
723,Amy,what’s the difference?
1436,Amy,i am in the mix. and i’m the hottest one.
951,Amy,"thank you, sheldon."
522,Amy,"come on, bestie, you’re up."
3129,Amy,come on. you’ve got so much to feel good about. you’ve got a great job now.
2728,Amy,"well, whatever happens, we’re here for you."
2220,Amy,but then i decided i don’t want to go changing who i am just because of some man.
2171,Amy,wow. hope i can catch the bouquet from here.
1881,Amy,"i’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. just last night i tried to see how many fava beans i could fit in my mouth."
2911,Amy,"are you suggesting al-ghazali was aristotelian? ‘cause if anything, he was anti-aristotelian."
2261,Amy,"uh, bernadette, you’re my ride."
616,Amy,"her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth."
1706,Amy,"what do you mean, why did i come? you’re my boyfriend. i haven’t seen you in over a month. i just drove six hours to help you out. don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
3271,Amy,"well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
90,Amy,what’s the dress code?
1384,Amy,happy thanksgiving.
3442,Amy,"hi, sheldon. everything okay?"
3134,Amy,it is warm in here.
2360,Amy,"that’s nothing sheldon hasn’t done before. dave’s just a big fan of his work. besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again."
771,Amy,"all right, that’s enough. today is not about you two. today is about howard and bernadette and me."
532,Amy,"sheldon, i’m disappointed. as a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. i could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. but this? lame-o."
942,Amy,i was parked in sheldon’s spot.
139,Amy,there was no question. i simply said hoo.
1663,Amy,do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
197,Amy,"i’m not finished. all scientists have to fund-raise, sheldon. how do you think i paid for my lab?"
980,Amy,why not?
462,Amy,"sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?"
395,Amy,i just have one question about the chair.
20437,Leonard,just get in here.
20156,Leonard,of course. she deserves to be happy.
18804,Leonard,"you make a lot of sense. i like this table, and i’m getting it."
12646,Leonard,yeah. everything since the eighth grade. 
19080,Leonard,"oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting."
14007,Leonard,"yeah. i got a dressmaker’s mannequin, i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
21063,Leonard,"that’s sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of bert, too."
19704,Leonard,what?
13596,Leonard,so why’d you ask?
12224,Leonard,"uh, yeah, uh, i just, i got your mail again, here."
12236,Leonard,hello lesley.
20060,Leonard,"i’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
13890,Leonard,"hey, penny. how was work?"
13869,Leonard,"sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
21173,Leonard,"well, we had started binge-watching luke cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me. "
12345,Leonard,that was three weeks ago.
13799,Leonard,that’ll do it.
16480,Leonard,elegant.
19705,Leonard,what happened? did you tell him it was my idea?
16325,Leonard,"no, no, i do. it’s just i knew i was having curry tonight and i only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
16470,Leonard,"no, he’s bluffing."
12113,Leonard,this is it.  i’ll do the talking.
16174,Leonard,then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
12732,Leonard,"howard, listen…"
21493,Leonard,"oh, the video game. yeah, that was bad."
12964,Leonard,how are we going to get it upstairs? 
14748,Leonard,hey.
18561,Leonard,"hey. i just wanted to let you know that i, i posted my findings."
18593,Leonard,"hi, uh, um, i’m leonard?"
19424,Leonard,"then, of course, rubbing our success in sheldon’s face."
19715,Leonard,"so, stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if howard sells the house?"
13306,Leonard,"uh-huh. seriously, six months?"
20376,Leonard,hi.
21398,Leonard,"i don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother."
13590,Leonard,"oh, she’s a doctor."
20346,Leonard,what do you think about giving sheldon’s ticket to stuart?
16274,Leonard,"last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the kama sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
20573,Leonard,"you know what, this part isn’t that technical. you actually could."
21433,Leonard,yeah.
20999,Leonard,that’s right. i’m her change daddy.
13483,Leonard,"okay, i have pokh."
18981,Leonard,i don’t know what you’re upset about. i’m the one who’s losing.
19482,Leonard,now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
13849,Leonard,i assumed he was joking. you’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
13529,Leonard,"there, see? problem solved."
21770,Leonard,we can fix that. let’s leave.
20063,Leonard,"uh, do you mind if i sit?"
12632,Leonard,oh.
21087,Leonard,then yeah.
16649,Leonard,cool.  uh-oh!
20037,Leonard,"please, tell me how i can fix it."
15981,Leonard,we get it. 73 is the chuck norris of numbers.
13868,Leonard,"don’t look up, there’s cameras."
19341,Leonard,but the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. it doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
18514,Leonard,were you drunk?
16458,Leonard,"no offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
17470,Leonard,that’s so great. 
20981,Leonard,"oh, i don’t even know. i just liked his name. theo sassler. okay, and look at this. i even got a change maker. how much change you want, little lady?"
17001,Leonard,"you know what? i am tired of living in fear of this guy. i’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things i should have said in high school. you know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, i do know why i’m hitting myself.”"
16832,Leonard,priya and i are in love. i think we could get married someday.
16684,Leonard,"oh, sorry. this wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
15902,Leonard,"nice going, raj, just got him down for his nap."
15696,Leonard,what?
13935,Leonard,i’m not afraid of him.
12962,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i still can’t afford it. "
21065,Leonard,wow.
21347,Leonard,"well, she’s so excited, i can’t do that to her."
17562,Leonard,oh!
16701,Leonard,maybe. we enter the dungeon.
19218,Leonard,you would go to a beach house?
18177,Leonard,no.
16123,Leonard,i’d like to kick your little brown ass.
17617,Leonard,"no, it’s a nitrogen laser. it’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg."
15348,Leonard,"hi-lo. oops. i started to say hi, and then i switched to hello in the middle. it came out hi-lo. duh. uh, it’s nice to meet you. i’ve read both your books and most of your papers. i’m leonard, i live"
20109,Leonard,they’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. let’s hope the lug nut expands.
17331,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, clear your weekend. starting saturday morning, star wars< marathon"
16005,Leonard,"yeah, we came to talk to zack. hey, zack."
13316,Leonard,"it’s thursday. listen, penny."
21037,Leonard,but you won’t be living here.
17992,Leonard,"oh, that’s cool."
12785,Leonard,"i’m at work, sheldon.  "
19670,Leonard,"okay, but it’s a drive, the one i went to is in san diego."
21326,Leonard,who forgot to crack the window?
14341,Leonard,"yeah, that too. everything’s broken."
15426,Leonard,"mm, joyce kim was kind of curious about what i did for a living, and i was going to kind of show it to her. it’s not important. the point is, the guys and i went back to the apartment."
12141,Leonard,"unless, superman matches her speed and decelerates. "
15657,Leonard,"yeah, i guessed that."
16973,Leonard,yeah.
16500,Leonard,i thought the movie was about 18th-century vienna?
15409,Leonard,you are so naive. just like i was seven years ago.  i’d just started at the university.
18081,Leonard,"fine, then that."
16278,Leonard,th-th-th-that’s okay. i can infer from context.
15825,Leonard,where did you get that?
20402,Leonard,this weekend.
19038,Leonard,i’m your son. what about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
14308,Leonard,"oh, too bad. i guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
17875,Leonard,that’s great.
19864,Leonard,why did you need a belt?
15329,Leonard,and i have food here. you said you were going to call.
19766,Leonard,"yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee."
17484,Leonard,"hey, i didn’t say it."
17211,Leonard,"once i tried carrying around a duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me duncan."
13219,Leonard,what’s with him?
18220,Leonard,sheldon.
12065,Leonard,so it’s based on your life?
17700,Leonard,"you know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us."
14303,Leonard,what were you doing at penny’s?
13138,Leonard,"what is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal. "
20447,Leonard,"excuse me. uh, bad news. the maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour."
16930,Leonard,you’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because i said we weren’t on a date.
17672,Leonard,"good morning, sunshine."
17289,Leonard,what happened?
15463,Leonard,coming!
14623,Leonard,fine. i’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
21325,Leonard,"aw, that used to work with sheldon."
16904,Leonard,i don’t know. scree-scree.
19912,Leonard,"yeah, you’re right. that is the term i’m looking for. you are a dirty double mother suckler."
17655,Leonard,"really? ‘cause i went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once."
13187,Leonard,"bite me. sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
14641,Leonard,how about that? einstein was wrong.
15905,Leonard,"calm down, sheldon."
21000,Leonard,and that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
18127,Leonard,"wait, sheldon’s going to be there? we all promised we weren’t going to go."
12800,Leonard,"yeah, at home. "
12246,Leonard,"you proposed the experiment, i think you should present your findings first."
12146,Leonard,"we don’t need strength, we’re physicists. we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes. give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth, it’s just a matter…  i don’t have this… i don’t have this i don’t have this."
18310,Leonard,"no, because i didn’t want her on my team."
20118,Leonard,do i really have to do that now?
15091,Leonard,"uh, let’s see. yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
19044,Leonard,"so, listen, there was something i was hoping to float past you."
17314,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning."
18170,Leonard,you’re kidding.
16080,Leonard,what are you doing?!
15550,Leonard,"funny how things work out, isn’t it?"
21761,Leonard,they’re lawn chairs. and there was no place for company.
14684,Leonard,yes.
16908,Leonard,are we overthinking this?
20723,Leonard,just a whole lot of afrin.
14822,Leonard,"i gotta say, i am really impressed. this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even. "
21277,Leonard,"oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you."
15150,Leonard,"anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
12530,Leonard,"fyi, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the uv light. "
12843,Leonard,you can’t let this kid get to you. you always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
17163,Leonard,"no, you should. absolutely. that was me being pedantic. that’s our first bug. you reported it. i can fix that. see? this is good."
21681,Leonard,hello.
20656,Leonard,this meeting is a waste of time. whether we make the switch from post raisin bran to kellogg’s raisin bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
18023,Leonard,"no. no, no, no, no. but if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me."
20645,Leonard,"no, he’d be bat-man-bat."
19921,Leonard,wow. when does that start?
17717,Leonard,i hate this guy.
16420,Leonard,i heard about it from sheldon. he got it from amy.
12570,Leonard,problem?
15886,Leonard,would someone please turn off the sheldon commentary track?
14133,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go?"
18237,Leonard,"oh. thank you, raj. i’d be honoured."
19086,Leonard,okay. good luck.
20126,Leonard,i hope so.
14074,Leonard,i thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
16437,Leonard,"good, good. everything okay between you two?"
15162,Leonard,how is this maritime salvage?
20052,Leonard,"what, you actually want to meet her?"
14629,Leonard,"yeah, i’m familiar with bert and ernie."
15328,Leonard,i was going to see that with him.
21554,Leonard,hello.
14786,Leonard,the only thing in here are blue ice packs.
19285,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sorry, too. we’re about to share the rest of our lives together. it’s our money, who cares who has it?"
19689,Leonard,so what’s the problem?
18622,Leonard,is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
16601,Leonard,"thanks, mother. i feel much better."
15688,Leonard,"hmm, recently? not much."
14500,Leonard,"sheldon, dinner’s here."
15084,Leonard,"got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? think it’s gonna rain? instead of underpants, i covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. thoughts? okay, i know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
13510,Leonard,congratulations. you’re officially one of us.
16188,Leonard,"i’m very hungry. for food, right?"
13033,Leonard,"look, you’re here, we have plenty of room."
18451,Leonard,what’s up?
20246,Leonard,i know. i also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
13183,Leonard,"no, no, i didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast. "
21733,Leonard,"uh, yeah, experimental physics."
14746,Leonard,thank you!
19437,Leonard,do you know what a disaster this is?
21400,Leonard,"look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that penny and i are afraid to be alone."
15073,Leonard,we’re going to switzerland to see the cern supercollider! and ski. we’ll also go skiing.
14802,Leonard,hey.
18328,Leonard,to the tar pits.
18529,Leonard,and we can just put this whole thing behind us.
12435,Leonard,is there a theme?
16027,Leonard,"did i do something? i mean, i tried to be friends with zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
19221,Leonard,hey.
13444,Leonard,"hey, ramona. come on in."
13460,Leonard,touche.
15514,Leonard,"well, then what do you want us to do?"
20188,Leonard,"we’re just bending the rules a little. we have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. it’s not like when dr. goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a russian girl in an apartment in van nuys."
18704,Leonard,"you got your job back. that is great news. i didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."
18408,Leonard,"well, i took you there. all you did was…"
20211,Leonard,we’re not getting caught.
12272,Leonard,"by the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos. "
18516,Leonard,it’d actually be nice to not hear sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
20285,Leonard,"you don’t know my birthday, do you?"
12329,Leonard,huh? cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
15692,Leonard,"fine. if i don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
20324,Leonard,"what do you want, a medal? it was your gum."
20789,Leonard,"sorry, but i don’t think i need your permission to have my father at my wedding."
18337,Leonard,are you kidding me?
19318,Leonard,"so, uh, what’s the deal? you take off your ring when you go to work?"
19054,Leonard,"because i love penny, and want to give her the life she deserves."
13975,Leonard,i’ll start again.
18594,Leonard,"no, i am he. uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something i’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. um."
12824,Leonard,"if i stand, i’ll vomit. "
13942,Leonard,"okay, how about this? i’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
14106,Leonard,"you know, i’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at i can’t score with. i think i’ll let you two take this one."
12192,Leonard,"sure, that’s another way to go."
19093,Leonard,"um, let me just have some coffee first, and then i’ll have the strength to tell you how much i won’t be doing that.  hello?"
16753,Leonard,yes.
16612,Leonard,i’m proud of you.
17610,Leonard,have you noticed that howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
14080,Leonard,"what is it, sheldon? "
12210,Leonard,got it. .
20247,Leonard,"hey, buddy. how you doing?"
13706,Leonard,"okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
20566,Leonard,yeah.
18453,Leonard,"he’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if i’d take a look at it."
17207,Leonard,there. done.
13098,Leonard,why not?
18393,Leonard,that was kind of icy. you two okay?
12213,Leonard,stay in formation.
20225,Leonard,"thank you, barry."
15241,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
15809,Leonard,what are you talking about?
14294,Leonard,"yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…"
15869,Leonard,what happened?
18963,Leonard,"yeah, we won’t be eating arthur tonight."
15888,Leonard,"bet if i could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together."
21414,Leonard,"well, she’s done."
21008,Leonard,"yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
13642,Leonard,i didn’t cry.
16148,Leonard,oh. we should get going.
20012,Leonard,who do you think carries sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the tv?
16230,Leonard,"what, with my tongue in your tail?"
14368,Leonard,"i’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
16438,Leonard,"no reason. i was just talking to raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
13170,Leonard,hi. 
13459,Leonard,"so, how’d it go with ramona last night?"
13874,Leonard,how was rock climbing?
19010,Leonard,like what?
13282,Leonard,"well, i think tonight was a very good start."
12633,Leonard,"oh, that’s the bottled city of kandor. "
14147,Leonard,she’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
14267,Leonard,"no. look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
18821,Leonard,"well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby."
12919,Leonard,"fine. here i go, taking one for the team. in the sack. hey leslie."
20268,Leonard,can i see?
14324,Leonard,"well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort."
17708,Leonard,"oh, great. we’re still dating, right?"
21185,Leonard,you want to decorate it tonight?
18723,Leonard,"uh, fifteen…"
19537,Leonard,"that can’t be much fun for amy. you know, at work today, he tried his first red bull."
15583,Leonard,why? what’s the problem?
18751,Leonard,"plus, i’m not sure it’s a great idea to take penny to where wine comes from. what? it’s a joke. oh, come on. we bust on each other. i wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs."
15059,Leonard,"in any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
13520,Leonard,"oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say."
20687,Leonard,"oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. bernadette does the same thing with you and koothrappali."
21432,Leonard,"you know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera."
15488,Leonard,right. right. so how you doing?
12175,Leonard,what?
15772,Leonard,"if the past is any indication, no."
14290,Leonard,you think that’d help?
18967,Leonard,i am not a crybaby.
12740,Leonard,"what are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over. "
12203,Leonard,what?
21619,Leonard,"hey, guys!"
19355,Leonard,"just relax, it’s a joke. you don’t have hormones."
19690,Leonard,sheldon.
17153,Leonard,"no, i mean just you and me."
17956,Leonard,"to live with penny and not you, you crazy bastard."
15007,Leonard,"so roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
16792,Leonard,"uh, yeah. it’s issue number 21. first appearance of hellboy."
18252,Leonard,so?
18941,Leonard,yeah. we should do it more often.
18306,Leonard,"i just said, couples sound great."
16011,Leonard,"uh, no. oh, this is zack. he’s a friend of ours. zack, this is stuart. he owns the store."
19532,Leonard,so you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
15478,Leonard,doesn’t have to be tonight. i’m free pretty much always.
14344,Leonard,"yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break."
17388,Leonard,what are these?
12228,Leonard,what is wrong with you?
12281,Leonard,what?
13302,Leonard,what’s going on?
16814,Leonard,"hey, you got a minute?"
18844,Leonard,"yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. well, it’s true. once i saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up."
17365,Leonard,what?
15399,Leonard,"yeah, i wanted to explain."
15437,Leonard,what for? it’s not going to rain.
19393,Leonard,"tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, i’ll think about it."
19524,Leonard,what are you doing? it’s time to go.
20991,Leonard,should’ve punched that guy.
16320,Leonard,"holy crap, are you connected to the oak ridge national laboratory?"
18327,Leonard,"yeah, penny might be onto something."
15952,Leonard,"mm, dreamily doodling mrs. leonard hofstadter in a notebook?"
21645,Leonard,you’re not even watching!
12631,Leonard,is this all stuff you want me to try on?
19204,Leonard,why are you even part of this conversation? you don’t know anything about women.
21320,Leonard,"this is an euler’s disk. it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
14518,Leonard,why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
20058,Leonard,that’s not helpful.
17364,Leonard,once you open the box it loses its value.
15418,Leonard,"actually, i couldn’t get too mad at him about joyce kim."
13497,Leonard,yes.
16923,Leonard,"are you sure? because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
18004,Leonard,you’re kidding.
16342,Leonard,no. i actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
21447,Leonard,when does that start?
17061,Leonard,glad i was sitting down for that. did you and amy get in a fight?
14465,Leonard,"it’s actually a pretty simple process. you see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…  "
13882,Leonard,"we’ve got to be missing something. let’s start again. the movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45."
15891,Leonard,"oh. well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw star trek: nemesis."
14257,Leonard,say what?
17457,Leonard,yeah.
19871,Leonard,"yeah. i worked hard on that speech, too."
21680,Leonard,that is my girlfriend. i swear to god.
12711,Leonard,how?
17642,Leonard,"don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs."
18940,Leonard,you and i never just hang out like this. why is that?
21527,Leonard,"first thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it."
19312,Leonard,"oh. well, you know, just being myself, really."
12746,Leonard,"oh, god! sheldon does not have a cousin leo."
14933,Leonard,"come on, howard, bernadette, you’re both scientists. help me out here."
16337,Leonard,and she likes you.
14439,Leonard,check.
15452,Leonard,the laser?
16131,Leonard,sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. we’re reading the reviews.
18948,Leonard,"well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too."
16015,Leonard,"fine, if zack’s going to be superman, i want to be green lantern."
15819,Leonard,what.
12907,Leonard,"okay, let me try it this way, uh, i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team. "
12823,Leonard,"yeah, so?"
16808,Leonard,"well, you know, it’s comic con. i’m lion-o from thundercats."
18964,Leonard,i know.
14018,Leonard,she said shush. i should have shushed. 
19974,Leonard,"so, we’re still getting married?"
13327,Leonard,sheldon…
17612,Leonard,"hey, what are you doing here?"
21062,Leonard,that is unbelievable. good for bert.
15017,Leonard,that was amazing how you handled him.
16841,Leonard,that actually does help.
16287,Leonard,"i know. i usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
19374,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. end of story."
13276,Leonard,"no, changs."
18084,Leonard,same here.
20492,Leonard,that’s just research. we’re never gonna make any money from it.
19771,Leonard,"you know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, i looked through a door, and i’m pretty sure i saw a display case with the ark of the covenant."
18810,Leonard,that.
14447,Leonard,"damn his vulcan hearing. not a good time, sheldon."
17474,Leonard,"she said no, can we drop it now?"
17120,Leonard,and we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
18275,Leonard,"i don’t. i really don’t. just try it on. oh, yeah."
14346,Leonard,it wasn’t bad advice. it just wasn’t particularly helpful.
13861,Leonard,then why learn how to swim?
15200,Leonard,what?
13939,Leonard,"you guys suck.  come on, please? he’s so big."
20985,Leonard,"well, i brought my moneymaker. let me shake it. "
14586,Leonard,hey.
14832,Leonard,that’s where sheldon sits.
15082,Leonard,it is.
18806,Leonard,"hey, all set. what do you think? there’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window."
18831,Leonard,"oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?"
21636,Leonard,"gesundheit. or as they say in switzerland, gesundheit. you getting a cold?"
15080,Leonard,no.
14414,Leonard,bye.
13155,Leonard,i was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
20653,Leonard,your attendance implies it’s not.
20564,Leonard,"howard, what do you think?"
19828,Leonard,or we could be omegas. they get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
15283,Leonard,you know what? i’ll just spend the evening alone.
15563,Leonard,"sheldon, this is ridiculous."
18109,Leonard,hey.
20520,Leonard,he is?
18348,Leonard,"they weren’t boobies, they were muscles. and the make-up was green. i was pretending to be the hulk."
18075,Leonard,yeah. although…
13429,Leonard,it’s never safe.
18740,Leonard,maybe this isn’t a good idea.
18782,Leonard,"well, give it a go."
14944,Leonard,"what’s your point? in order to keep having a sexual relationship with penny, i have to give up everything i believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who i am? i can’t do that, howard."
20615,Leonard,you’ll wish it would kill you.
12212,Leonard,"warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
18885,Leonard,"okay, that’s enough."
16012,Leonard,"hey, i got new boots this year. guaranteed to add three inches."
15390,Leonard,coming right up.
21181,Leonard,yeah.
15067,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’ve been dreaming about spending valentine’s day with a girl since i was six."
14480,Leonard,"uh, if you don’t mind, mrs. cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to los angeles, and you have no idea how much i want to be on it."
20274,Leonard,yeah.
13307,Leonard,"hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water."
18871,Leonard,"forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?"
15856,Leonard,why not?
17912,Leonard,i say we investigate.
13505,Leonard,put it on the agenda.
14535,Leonard,morning.
15396,Leonard,i thought we had something special.
20138,Leonard,it wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
12739,Leonard,"let it go, sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. "
20235,Leonard,and what are you getting him back for?
19954,Leonard,i know. you think people are gonna be mad?
14931,Leonard,you’re welcome. how’s your fish?
12679,Leonard,what? 
12734,Leonard,"oh, another hug, thank you."
19359,Leonard,"oh, the girls really did a nice job."
18798,Leonard,nary an argument? nary?
20294,Leonard,"face it, you can’t stump me. i am the king of husbands. i know that you don’t like the lingerie that i got you on valentine’s day. i know you hate the word moist. i know…"
14633,Leonard,"well, i sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, i was trying to remember what i read on google, so…"
21644,Leonard,"you know what, go to hell and set their thermostat."
16391,Leonard,what are you doing?
13905,Leonard,hey.
20328,Leonard,"all right, just stop. this is ridiculous."
12189,Leonard,"i’m very, very sorry."
15950,Leonard,i love you.
16440,Leonard,"yeah, you do. you dog, you."
16231,Leonard,"okay, i’m out of here."
19015,Leonard,"well, it matters a lot. i don’t want to be a bran muffin. i, i want to be a cinnabon, you know? a strawberry pop-tart. something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes."
19627,Leonard,"not right now, sheldon."
16055,Leonard,"so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
18214,Leonard,i have a job.
17410,Leonard,oh.
20327,Leonard,"hey, can we please get back to work?"
16298,Leonard,yeah.
15529,Leonard,what’s there?
13250,Leonard,what happened to you?
19057,Leonard,it’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
12319,Leonard,"yes, i was there."
16032,Leonard,what about me?
17171,Leonard,it’s colour coded.
12642,Leonard,"oh, careful. that’s my original series battlestar galactica flight suit. "
18926,Leonard,you made fun of us. said it was stupid.
20380,Leonard,so you’ll go to the doctor who convention with me next week?
19507,Leonard,buddy.
19987,Leonard,"buddy, i’m so sorry. is there anything i can do?"
19403,Leonard,i don’t think he had a family.
12506,Leonard,"oh, i don’t think she’s a whore."
15602,Leonard,"so, this is nice. first time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
20468,Leonard,"let’s see. what’s young and fun? uh, we could go dancing."
19328,Leonard,"no, because i liked it."
20526,Leonard,"so, mother, i’m surprised you came all this way for sheldon’s birthday."
19468,Leonard,yeah.
12274,Leonard,"you’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
14126,Leonard,is that what he’s drinking? it’s not even real beer.
20272,Leonard,are we gonna be much longer? i really have to go to the bathroom.
14408,Leonard,"hang on, i know i don’t possess the tools of leadership, but i don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
18428,Leonard,"oh, my god, is she okay?"
16679,Leonard,ready.
15061,Leonard,i am taking penny.
15129,Leonard,no.
12358,Leonard,that narrows it down. 
17796,Leonard,"fine. howard, what do you do?"
12954,Leonard,not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
12702,Leonard,what was i supposed to say. 
21039,Leonard,"look, i get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours."
15161,Leonard,"no, it is not yours. we all went in on the box together."
21598,Leonard,"um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate. "
12616,Leonard,it’s from the institute for experimental physics. they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on bowes-einstein condensates. 
20317,Leonard,it’s just an earworm. it’ll come to you.
13599,Leonard,"hi, howard. howard?"
18636,Leonard,"oh, come on, no, that’s not what i meant."
21425,Leonard,"i mean, they didn’t say anything, but i just kind of felt like i was being a weird third wheel."
18060,Leonard,it’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
12353,Leonard,"no, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends."
17559,Leonard,she seems nice.
13841,Leonard,hey kripke.
17552,Leonard,"so, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?"
19790,Leonard,"no, no, no. we’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation."
20134,Leonard,"wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
15724,Leonard,there you go.
16513,Leonard,water nymph.
16236,Leonard,how come it’s not a party when we do it here?
14961,Leonard,we like games.
13192,Leonard,"okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. we went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could i have possibly gone wrong. "
21766,Leonard,why not?
16983,Leonard,"yeah, it’s “penny already eats our food, she can pay for wi-fi.” no spaces."
13246,Leonard,of course. out of respect.
16370,Leonard,"fine. you walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. what if he says no?"
20101,Leonard,what?
18070,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s, wait, i can go home without you? bye."
13696,Leonard,are you sure? that doesn’t sound right.
16961,Leonard,"hey, can i talk to you about something? it’s a little awkward."
21261,Leonard,"that’s great, i’m happy for you."
18410,Leonard,that’s beautiful. is that shakespeare?
19624,Leonard,"hey, you okay?"
19617,Leonard,"yeah, thank you."
20477,Leonard,"hey, raj, i read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?"
16000,Leonard,that happened to you?
13097,Leonard,"really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. "
21575,Leonard,"fine. i accept your premise, now please let’s go."
15380,Leonard,you still have a cold?
21781,Leonard,what’d you do that for? i had plenty of time. 
19904,Leonard,"you mean, my hypothesis. i hypothesized it all by myself."
16746,Leonard,"i hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
13627,Leonard,because this is not star trek
16780,Leonard,everything? aren’t you worried about your health?
13600,Leonard,that’s just ridiculous. why are you cooperating with him?
20513,Leonard,i’ll check his room.
18349,Leonard,that was to keep my muscles from sagging. can we please stop talking about this?
16644,Leonard,why don’t you just give me five minutes? i’ll google how to do this. i’ll call you right back.
19487,Leonard,"uh, i’ve got some bad news. there’s no cell service in here."
16986,Leonard,"yeah, because i have something weird to tell her."
15645,Leonard,"no, no, it’s not like that. it’s, uh, i don’t know what it’s like. but there is something i should prepare you for."
16212,Leonard,"wait, wait. what?"
13842,Leonard,"alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore."
14352,Leonard,"yeah. right. sure. the thing is, before you guys went out, i spoke to him and…"
12671,Leonard,"yes.  my name is dr leonard hofstadter, and i could never please my parents so i need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. but he’s worse."
18972,Leonard,"mm. well, i think more about if i’d have any regrets."
13008,Leonard,"it’s not a bidding war, i’m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store. "
20797,Leonard,"hey, we’re here."
15849,Leonard,guava?
19119,Leonard,exactly. right after they said yeah.
13533,Leonard,"no. look, this has to stop."
20176,Leonard,"come on, barry, there’s a swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. can’t you spare any?"
15901,Leonard,what’s a stadium pal?
13789,Leonard,"by the way, my leg is killing me. thanks for asking."
19656,Leonard,okay.
19197,Leonard,and are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
17653,Leonard,"okay, i get it."
21578,Leonard,"here comes our new boss, be polite."
21223,Leonard,"sorry, thank you."
18660,Leonard,what?
20159,Leonard,"wow. that, that was crazier than i thought."
14300,Leonard,"hey, how’s it going."
17627,Leonard,you should visit more often. what are you doing?
18643,Leonard,"i don’t know, i got all confused when you said honestly."
13863,Leonard,where are we going?
15371,Leonard,"what, uh, you and me? yeah, we did. not too long ago. how are you doing with it?"
20075,Leonard,"i wonder if that’s why i have such a dysfunctional relationship with sheldon. i had a dream the other night that i was in a cave and i was nursing a baby, but the baby had sheldon’s head on it."
21463,Leonard,i honestly don’t remember.
14747,Leonard,i am not going to fold.
16019,Leonard,"if it makes you feel any better, when i was dating penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
20809,Leonard,"oh, we were following howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
20692,Leonard,from amy.
13548,Leonard,howard’s at the mars rover lab. he says he’s in trouble. defcon 5.
16653,Leonard,"yeah. sure, sure."
21014,Leonard,yes.
14686,Leonard,i’m sorry?
19286,Leonard,thanks again for having us.
18164,Leonard,you’re kidding. he’s still alive?
18784,Leonard,"oh. wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?"
17694,Leonard,"trust me, call her."
17544,Leonard,you okay? you seem a little distracted.
18439,Leonard,i can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
14759,Leonard,eyes on the road. eyes on the road!
14027,Leonard,"you know what baffles me, sheldon?"
19469,Leonard,i thought you hate giving gifts.
15069,Leonard,"no. but it does involve air travel. okay, um, let me slice this swiss cheese with my swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of swiss miss instant cocoa."
20957,Leonard,"look, even when penny and i started living together, there was a learning curve. but i promise you, it does get easier."
12167,Leonard,"yeah, he didn’t tell it right."
12418,Leonard,"well, that part’s true! "
16603,Leonard,"you know what, guys, i’m not in the mood for paintball. what do you say we just bag it?"
18658,Leonard,"okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
17622,Leonard,"yeah. it’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. here, i’ll show you. we’ll just put this pencil over here."
15806,Leonard,no-one’s going to ask if i spent the night with raj’s sister.
14135,Leonard,"hi, my name’s leonard."
17367,Leonard,"well i told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box."
13686,Leonard,"it is actually. in fact, i gave it a lot of thought and i decided it was time for us to live together."
17761,Leonard,"you get a cookie, too."
18099,Leonard,"oh, my god."
19882,Leonard,thank you.
20104,Leonard,"let’s see, a lever, a lever."
12648,Leonard,great.
13756,Leonard,thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
21553,Leonard,he doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. bring a book.
21306,Leonard,"oh, we can get this. is there any chance it’s upside-down?"
20859,Leonard,yes.
16587,Leonard,"no, i’m fine with it."
21206,Leonard,just ignore him.
18975,Leonard,i just thought of one more.
14644,Leonard,"if you’re referring to the work of benjamin franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. he also invented the franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. kites, ho."
13556,Leonard,"just said howard’s a terrific guy. he’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
17015,Leonard,right.
17320,Leonard,"sheldon, go to bed. you have work in the morning."
21605,Leonard,two seats right there. 
17280,Leonard,"no. no, i’m not."
13870,Leonard,"yes, he’s new at the zoo."
20549,Leonard,"sorry, but we can’t sign this."
20265,Leonard,not really.
12340,Leonard,right… i didn’t….
14605,Leonard,"okay, well, then i’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. that’s right, i did it. i cut ’em."
17604,Leonard,"remember, show your work."
14409,Leonard,what is it?
17797,Leonard,and you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
19459,Leonard,"i’m not doing it. you killed him, you do it."
16585,Leonard,she lied.
18431,Leonard,"stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. all right. you seem pretty confident."
15284,Leonard,since when do you take after-dinner walks?
19834,Leonard,"my god, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him."
17675,Leonard,"no, no. listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. and when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. open it."
16634,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it. you didn’t catch bugs from penny’s chair.
21051,Leonard,"just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell penny."
17002,Leonard,no.
17802,Leonard,"i know, but when i shop online, i can do it on the toilet."
16903,Leonard,the bird’s still there?
20120,Leonard,that helped.
18345,Leonard,why are you reading pride and prejudice?
17257,Leonard,wow. that’s rough.
21436,Leonard,"anyway, i know it’s silly, but since raj moved in, i’ve been feeling a little left out."
19645,Leonard,this is cool.
14487,Leonard,why does it have to get weird?
18848,Leonard,what do you mean it’s too late?
14062,Leonard,i thought we were going to play halo tonight.
13785,Leonard,"well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!"
19205,Leonard,there’s something i wanted to run past you.
15851,Leonard,"no, seriously, i think i’ve finally figured out my problem with women."
20953,Leonard,"look, here’s the thing you need to understand about sheldon. he’s the worst."
14893,Leonard,when did this happen?
13941,Leonard,"guys, there are four of us and one of him."
12730,Leonard,"howard, i’m sorry… we’re… we’re"
14580,Leonard,"so, what’s going on?"
16411,Leonard,"mm, it’s complicated, but as i remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
17946,Leonard,why would you say that?
19587,Leonard,and you don’t think that’s too rough?
20586,Leonard,"okay, we’ll take ’em. but, i swear, if it’s will smith in shark tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original."
13705,Leonard,i don’t know what that means.
13330,Leonard,chosen by science?
20286,Leonard,"well, what is it?"
13313,Leonard,"you mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime sheldon?"
13589,Leonard,"exactly. thank you. do me a favour, tell koothrappali that next time you see him."
12808,Leonard,won’t my footsteps set it off? 
20702,Leonard,what is it?
21201,Leonard,"if you must know, penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me."
16662,Leonard,"oh. well, i have some work to do, so…"
19498,Leonard,"because of you, i’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. i’m not allowed to whistle. i don’t wear shoes that might squeak."
14263,Leonard,yes
20084,Leonard,"huh? if you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. penny hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?"
17933,Leonard,you’re not sick. you just don’t want to face kripke.
12310,Leonard,yeah.
12078,Leonard,excuse me?
14091,Leonard,"hey, we’re all going over to the apple store to make fun of the guys at the genius bar. you want to come?"
19248,Leonard,everyone stop. this was a stupid idea. negative reinforcement isn’t working.
13836,Leonard,"well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
15741,Leonard,"hi, amy. sheldon’s not here."
15659,Leonard,"all right, fine. so you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
13575,Leonard,i’m hoping that’s three different guys.
19240,Leonard,i’m sure mrs. florida’s walking funny. can we get back to work?
18474,Leonard,skee-ball tickets?
16722,Leonard,"oh, that’s pretty steep."
21341,Leonard,we’re helping raj figure out his finances.
14966,Leonard,does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
20681,Leonard,"anyway, amy, thank you for sticking up for me."
19688,Leonard,did they hate it?
21505,Leonard,don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
13726,Leonard,"i really like you, but i want to see how things go with mark?"
15778,Leonard,"you don’t want that, do you?"
19417,Leonard,any chance you know what it is?
14925,Leonard,"of course, i would never make fun of you."
14526,Leonard,"right, right. you’re saying you talked to penny?"
15568,Leonard,"fine, but don’t expect my help."
12019,Leonard,not really.
13566,Leonard,"yeah, i really didn’t think this through."
15873,Leonard,what are you doing up?
12834,Leonard,what are you talking about? 
16301,Leonard,"uh, penny, there’s something i have to tell you."
18122,Leonard,gentlemen.
15728,Leonard,"it was going well. i was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in safe mode. the manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
16897,Leonard,"you know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
20465,Leonard,"ha, ha. you married an old man. tell you what. let’s do something fun tonight."
19230,Leonard,"well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
16879,Leonard,"yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
21218,Leonard,thank you.
15346,Leonard,"she’s here, she’s here. how do i look? do i look smart?"
14462,Leonard,"hey. listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, i didn’t have a chance to give you this."
17593,Leonard,"i don’t know, uh, casper the alcoholic ghost?"
12756,Leonard,how long is he going to stay here.
15441,Leonard,"hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? penny."
21386,Leonard,"you know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
13305,Leonard,want to catch me up?
15759,Leonard,and your poll numbers just keep dropping.
18856,Leonard,"hmm, i’m a professor at stanford."
18343,Leonard,"there, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. you know what? do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it."
17339,Leonard,do you mind if i spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
20924,Leonard,"never leave a belt on the floor. at night, they look like snakes."
21556,Leonard,"wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
16051,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re not in charge. it’s my idea. i’m in charge."
15100,Leonard,you’re not going to switzerland!
13914,Leonard,you’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
20922,Leonard,just nod and smile. he’s almost gone.
21640,Leonard,"first of all, the projects were totally different. i was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. if you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, i’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
19272,Leonard,"i don’t, either."
18155,Leonard,really?
15872,Leonard,"to tell you the truth, i thought if anyone was going to screw things up for howard, it’d be sheldon."
17953,Leonard,aw. here’s what i think of your roommate agreement.
15240,Leonard,"no, there was no spat."
15202,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
12737,Leonard,because sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin leopold. 
13517,Leonard,"penny, can i talk to you for a minute? hi."
20848,Leonard,"you realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
16384,Leonard,"uh, sheldon?"
17643,Leonard,"that’s really nice, sheldon, i’m happy for you."
20655,Leonard,"oh, you know what? i’m not going."
14158,Leonard,"uh-huh. look. mrs. fiona fondell from huntsville, alabama has ordered two."
17744,Leonard,really?
20984,Leonard,"okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. "
13333,Leonard,"really, really bad."
12422,Leonard,"oh, to be honest, i don’t think it’s going to work out. "
19807,Leonard,"yes, it is, wil."
13908,Leonard,"fourteen dollars, huh?"
20462,Leonard,"sixth grade, but i wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…"
15296,Leonard,for an hour and a half?
12343,Leonard,because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. 
14599,Leonard,"uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but penny and i occasionally need some alone time."
19430,Leonard,congratulations.
12591,Leonard,whatever you recommend.
20418,Leonard,that raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
12744,Leonard,get out.
18125,Leonard,probably not.
17704,Leonard,"right, the case of who murdered three saturday nights of my life?"
15925,Leonard,penny kissed me.
20554,Leonard,"of course, we can split any profits three ways."
13953,Leonard,hey.
12499,Leonard,"because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. "
19421,Leonard,i still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
19595,Leonard,"all right, do it. call him. let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished."
17165,Leonard,"night. attaboy, hofstadter. nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. hey, i’m back."
15274,Leonard,"hey, where you been?"
15237,Leonard,i honestly don’t care.
18457,Leonard,"mr. nye, hello. i’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
19127,Leonard,"look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
17371,Leonard,why would you open mine?
12147,Leonard,do you have any ideas?
19334,Leonard,next level.
17193,Leonard,"sheldon, canada is not going to invade california."
15585,Leonard,why are you introducing yourself?
17127,Leonard,"the, the gas station across the street."
21405,Leonard,should we go bring him back?
21309,Leonard,"no, but when we show this nonsense to sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it."
20440,Leonard,"penny and i have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no."
20223,Leonard,he wants more money.
15686,Leonard,i’m not jealous.
17454,Leonard,she’s good.
17192,Leonard,i have to get a lock for my door.
21018,Leonard,"uh, no. "
13827,Leonard,"oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. personally, i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
13560,Leonard,ooh. cool.
14241,Leonard,"hey, penny… and stuart, hey stuart."
19605,Leonard,why don’t we go get the food for the party.
20944,Leonard,i’ll give you a hint. we’re watching daredevil.
13453,Leonard,"hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
20734,Leonard,"no, i mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system."
20295,Leonard,because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
16338,Leonard,"not really, no."
20679,Leonard,no.
16838,Leonard,no. i’m having a moral crisis.
18245,Leonard,would you just relax?
19032,Leonard,"that’s a rude thing to say, out loud."
20178,Leonard,what are you doing?
14282,Leonard,alright.
14694,Leonard,"yeah, no, i’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
19653,Leonard,"admit it, you’re a little turned on."
13356,Leonard,no.
16062,Leonard,that’s just sheldon backwards.
16834,Leonard,go ask penny; she’ll know what to do.
19635,Leonard,in love yet?
17304,Leonard,"you know, i think this is a good stopping point. uh, it’s your first real game. i threw a lot of information at you."
15797,Leonard,"okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
18503,Leonard,"no, no, honey, if i take it off, sheldon wins."
15985,Leonard,really? this is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
17021,Leonard,nancy. you called me nancy for three years.
12056,Leonard,"yes i now, but…"
21526,Leonard,"hey, a toast. thank you all for your support while we worked on our air force project. and please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
21661,Leonard,"you look beautiful, lieutenant uhura. now prepare for inspection."
14979,Leonard,just keep walking. 
15128,Leonard,nope.
17052,Leonard,mm-hmm. yep. i see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
15308,Leonard,then why did you have chinese food with us?
16554,Leonard,sorry. does sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
12455,Leonard,how so?
12718,Leonard,"i don’t get it, i already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
15836,Leonard,"look, i’m sorry raj, but the truth is i was with priya last night."
19301,Leonard,what? why didn’t you say that first?
14178,Leonard,no!
15136,Leonard,sheldon’s in jail?
19711,Leonard,yeah. but now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
19965,Leonard,"oh, that’s too bad."
21424,Leonard,"or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game."
17741,Leonard,"yeah, you all do. anyway, i feel like he’s hitting on her. she says he’s just being nice and that i should trust her."
21672,Leonard,‘sup?
13960,Leonard,penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead!
18943,Leonard,"oh, doesn’t seem like it. she got sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
12960,Leonard,snipe!
14923,Leonard,"i hope you’re hungry, bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
20623,Leonard,"okay, i’ll go. never have i ever been arrested."
15425,Leonard,"well, it turns out i had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
20335,Leonard,aw. am i like the dryer sheets of your heart?
14237,Leonard,"sure, why not?"
15600,Leonard,okay.
15777,Leonard,really? you’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? you know what happens when you yawn in public.
19110,Leonard,"so, sheldon, tell us about your trip. where’d you go?"
20683,Leonard,"well, they argue all the time. they aren’t that close."
13157,Leonard,really?
14573,Leonard,what do you mean?
17668,Leonard,"no, specific to my situation."
17424,Leonard,"no, it should be: why are you?"
13351,Leonard,celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. right sheldon?  
12745,Leonard,who are you? 
15368,Leonard,"oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
20302,Leonard,"well, hey, okay. let me make this up to you. sometimes i keep an online journal. i want you to read something that i wrote."
15429,Leonard,so i did something stupid. i’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. what were you doing seven years ago?
17055,Leonard,"next time, you should open with that."
21082,Leonard,"oh, i laughed so hard, i burst a blood vessel in my nose. it’s fine."
16831,Leonard,"now, let’s not do anything rash. she’s really hot."
14111,Leonard,so?
13762,Leonard,"yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
14214,Leonard,"sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
13031,Leonard,"so missy, what brings you all the way from texas? "
14846,Leonard,what did i do now?
15556,Leonard,sure.
18072,Leonard,"well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. happily married guy throwing dinner parties."
21650,Leonard,keep going. i’m listening.
13458,Leonard,are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
21754,Leonard,i’m sure he’ll go away.
17583,Leonard,"all right, pictionary. what are the teams?"
13431,Leonard,"well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings."
13859,Leonard,"well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
15201,Leonard,"what, to you, is a large crowd?"
20735,Leonard,what good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about armageddon?
19171,Leonard,"um, whew? is this about the test, or is this about us?"
16663,Leonard,okay. wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
20508,Leonard,oh. that was really an asthma attack. i just sold it.
18151,Leonard,"you can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. i just, i don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it."
19522,Leonard,bye.
16443,Leonard,congratulations!
13310,Leonard,"why should i do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming."
13527,Leonard,"i reiterate, knuckle under."
19302,Leonard,can i help you?
16994,Leonard,i don’t know.
16976,Leonard,it’s you.
13629,Leonard,want some more wine?
17752,Leonard,you know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
19445,Leonard,"no, admit that you contaminated the clean room."
18412,Leonard,"sheldon, i know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? all right, i can’t believe i’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and i’m starting to get worried. please say something."
19320,Leonard,"oh, he was upset. so sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage."
18041,Leonard,"uh, hang on. empty your pockets."
14517,Leonard,what are we drinking now?
13308,Leonard,beats me. they were playing all last night too.
15169,Leonard,this ring.
20599,Leonard,whatcha doing?
13736,Leonard,"yeah, good for me. i’ll never have sex again.  i was wrong. see ya."
12943,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m sorry.  i’m not! "
21101,Leonard,"sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
21756,Leonard,i didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
14140,Leonard,"believe me, howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked."
21363,Leonard,is that nice?
15435,Leonard,never mind. okay if i watch some tv?
12275,Leonard,you could have stopped at “it could go well.”
12024,Leonard,hi.
19074,Leonard,yeah.
14504,Leonard,what’s that supposed to mean?
15471,Leonard,how many times have i asked you not to do that?
14764,Leonard,"yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
21415,Leonard,he does raise an interesting point.
12071,Leonard,our shower works.
19440,Leonard,it’s not a moth.
16631,Leonard,there’s no junk jiggling. we just talk.
15625,Leonard,"uh, went splitsville."
19888,Leonard,"i don’t know, some time tomorrow morning."
18897,Leonard,"i got to tell you, the more i read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited i get."
15908,Leonard,we really want to see this. is there anything you can do?
14788,Leonard,okay.
17440,Leonard,"i don’t know, it just came out. people say weird things during sex all the time."
17259,Leonard,"joke all you want, but you think about it."
17397,Leonard,"yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. nothing to worry about."
16559,Leonard,just not against their will.
16457,Leonard,superceded!
13850,Leonard,"i don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? proximity and valence electrons."
14281,Leonard,"that’s not an email, that’s leslie’s facebook page."
15598,Leonard,what?
13406,Leonard,"sheldon, sit down."
17666,Leonard,"sheldon, i wasn’t done talking. she hands in the paper tomorrow. i know i could help her. and she’s my girlfriend. i, i should be allowed to help her. why aren’t i allowed to help her?"
12216,Leonard,"forget the sword, sheldon, help raj."
19875,Leonard,"really? sex last night, pancakes this morning, am i dying?"
15935,Leonard,what kind of guys did you used to go out with?
21152,Leonard,"well, it is their child."
14889,Leonard,all right. he “has” a “girlfriend.”
16171,Leonard,swell. i need a drink. do we have any alcohol?
16046,Leonard,we’re gonna write an application…
19443,Leonard,sure. if the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
14932,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
20000,Leonard,you know what? it’s fine.
19471,Leonard,blue and yellow make green.
17024,Leonard,"hey, for the record, jimmy wasn’t the reason i wet the bed. that one has my mother written all over it."
14058,Leonard,wackadoodle.
12597,Leonard,i’m pretty sure her name’s lalita.
19454,Leonard,do you want the fire extinguisher?
13350,Leonard,"close enough, come on.  hi raj."
19252,Leonard,"so you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?"
16431,Leonard,"oh, i’d wait."
14524,Leonard,hey. what’s going on?
15608,Leonard,"okay, let me just get right to it. amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
17315,Leonard,i was sleeping.
12337,Leonard,fish nightlights.
14293,Leonard,suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
19531,Leonard,"that is a tough one. uh, i know he brushes both of them."
16132,Leonard,read this woman’s tweet.
18595,Leonard,"eh, uh, well, i was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?"
16138,Leonard,"yeah, it’s weird. even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
16891,Leonard,"oh, hey. you work the lunch shift?"
12238,Leonard,"right. lesley, i would like to propose an experiment."
12208,Leonard,"oh, i’ve got it. how about if we replace panels a, b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium. "
14558,Leonard,"well, you shouldn’t."
21200,Leonard,are you gonna laugh at the answer?
14760,Leonard,"hey, stuart, have you seen sheldon?"
21582,Leonard,sorry.
18533,Leonard,how am i the bad guy? she’s the one who married someone else. i’m the victim.
19175,Leonard,"okay, well, this might make you feel better. uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. also, we both think i’m not funny. huh? see, you’re not laughing."
12105,Leonard,to mend her broken heart. this situation is much less complicated. there’s some kind of dispute between penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv. she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
13463,Leonard,"hey, penny."
15986,Leonard,every idea is better than this idea.
15168,Leonard,"yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. hey, how about this? until we figure out what to do with the ring, penny holds on to it."
21308,Leonard,just keep thinking. i got it.
13128,Leonard,"yeah, no, sure."
17341,Leonard,"oh. so you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into speedy gonzalez?"
16940,Leonard,yep.
18674,Leonard,that’s it? you’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
16652,Leonard,"so, how are your mom and dad?"
19964,Leonard,did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
12774,Leonard,i mix pancake batter in this! 
15355,Leonard,yes?
18447,Leonard,"dr. jeffries, hello again. leonard hofstadter."
13806,Leonard,he said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
20237,Leonard,when did we get a wall safe?
12440,Leonard,i call frodo!
15951,Leonard,"coming. hey, lovebug."
12342,Leonard,"i didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession.  this is a particularly disturbing one. "
16374,Leonard,that’s incredible.
20769,Leonard,"we’d still get in, but first i’d hit you over the head with his stick chair."
17835,Leonard,are we done with this?
19145,Leonard,baseball.
13454,Leonard,uh…
15624,Leonard,"no, i mean since the shamy hit a reef."
21571,Leonard,our pleasure.
19370,Leonard,i sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. this is nice. i kind of wish no one else was coming.
17483,Leonard,no.
16408,Leonard,"i know. just do it. there’s a big inspection coming up, and i don’t want to lose my tv privileges."
14824,Leonard,and the board of directors. abort! abort!
21603,Leonard,i’m back. 
13680,Leonard,we’re not living together.
18076,Leonard,"actually, all i did was invite you."
21142,Leonard,"well, i’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there."
18715,Leonard,"listen, i could never do what you’re doing, okay? i would be terrified."
21612,Leonard,hoo-boy.
18463,Leonard,"oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends."
20436,Leonard,hey. what happened? is amy gone?
12378,Leonard,"that was fun, lesley, thanks for including me. "
13428,Leonard,"yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. please learn how to drive!"
15663,Leonard,why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
16030,Leonard,green lantern.
20931,Leonard,"that’s it. it’s sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
14728,Leonard,"no, we just had a little spat."
16978,Leonard,"with a hologram? nice. hey, do you see this?"
17267,Leonard,what are you gonna do?
15151,Leonard,we didn’t even get to go through it all. there could be anything in here.
12598,Leonard,"we all know the reason. sheldon, what are you getting at?"
20752,Leonard,"well, i can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."
16307,Leonard,"i’m sorry, but i’m gonna count that."
12027,Leonard,"oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
15095,Leonard,thanks. it’s good.
13540,Leonard,are you kidding me? i already have two strikes.
16548,Leonard,"so, howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as mr. and dr. wolowitz?"
14490,Leonard,totally.
13813,Leonard,come on. wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
18531,Leonard,why are you mad at me? you’re the one that did the stupid thing. i’m just trying to fix it.
12510,Leonard,it’s the only way we can play teams. 
18014,Leonard,"okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
17757,Leonard,"oh, yeah? mummies are wrapped in bandages."
17442,Leonard,"i’m sorry. just, just give me another chance."
14222,Leonard,"you know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
15704,Leonard,you’re saying i couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
15077,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sakes."
15523,Leonard,a lot of people are working on that research. so what is all this?
12611,Leonard,"no, no, no, you don’t get it, um, howard, enable public access. "
19373,Leonard,"because i can’t breathe. i snore, i get sinus infections."
13110,Leonard,why are you learning chinese?
21559,Leonard,"ah, did you see that? she just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. what is happening?"
13673,Leonard,"okay, bye-bye."
20369,Leonard,"uh, she’s my mother. you know her?"
19971,Leonard,yeah?
13361,Leonard,"well, uh, no i… the… no."
19677,Leonard,because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
19213,Leonard,penny is not the reason i didn’t pursue that idea.
19568,Leonard,you’re sure it’s good?
12579,Leonard,what? 
16084,Leonard,"well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
16137,Leonard,"oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
14501,Leonard,"no, we went somewhere new."
17605,Leonard,"get up, we can’t lose at math."
13950,Leonard,no. you can leave if you want to. i’m gonna see this through.
15260,Leonard,"yes, that’s what i’m telling you. we are good. we are great."
14100,Leonard,is that who i think it is?
12360,Leonard,and orcs!
16972,Leonard,yeah.
17137,Leonard,we are next to a suburu with a gore/lieberman bumper sticker.
13824,Leonard,she’s a delightful woman. you’ll love her.
17873,Leonard,what are you doing here?
13394,Leonard,no.
15984,Leonard,"12 years after high school, and i’m still at the nerd table."
21264,Leonard,i said no.
12475,Leonard,"no, i’m a hobbit."
17801,Leonard,"oh, uh, yeah. i got ’em on amazon."
12388,Leonard,"yeah. yeah, i guess i am. "
21617,Leonard,"oh, hi, steph, come on in."
14398,Leonard,"yeah. pretty cool, huh?"
19950,Leonard,i’m in. let’s do it.
15448,Leonard,"okay, well, yeah, come on up. so, how’d you two guys meet?"
16736,Leonard,"sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
14817,Leonard,"no, no."
17096,Leonard,"me, too. so what do you think? are we gonna get back together?"
14150,Leonard,"hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
17130,Leonard,yes.
17010,Leonard,"i’m doing okay, i guess."
20085,Leonard,"yes, please."
20222,Leonard,you know what? it’s fine. keep the money. we just want to be done with this.
21590,Leonard,"oh hey penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
13871,Leonard,"uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop."
14916,Leonard,look at us. getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
20313,Leonard,you were just humming.
17446,Leonard,give it a minute. is that a little smile i see there? i should go.
19115,Leonard,what’s the big deal?
15574,Leonard,"i don’t want to listen to music, sheldon."
21452,Leonard,"i got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once."
16716,Leonard,what did you have in mind?
17663,Leonard,"hang on. okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. chess clock. we each get five minutes to talk about our problems. we’ll take turns. each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. begin."
12232,Leonard,i don’t know. olivia geiger?
13267,Leonard,"well, the thing is, someone’s coming over."
16505,Leonard,"oh, oh, beekeeper to king 12. i capture your pope and release the swarm. checkmate on sheldon."
21566,Leonard,"yeah, she’s definitely going after sheldon."
20386,Leonard,you know what’d be nice? name it after your girlfriends. show them how much you care.
19534,Leonard,"because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said."
12098,Leonard,wow.
13056,Leonard,"okay, uh…. oh, consider this. with your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate. "
15621,Leonard,hey.
18556,Leonard,"oh, there is no winning with you. and koalas and otters don’t even live near each other."
18789,Leonard,"i know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea."
21233,Leonard,i don’t understand what you want.
18825,Leonard,why would you do that?
17361,Leonard,awesome!
20609,Leonard,why are you so mean to me?
15662,Leonard,sheldon.
14095,Leonard,i wouldn’t expect you to. i’ll see you later.
14207,Leonard,"oh, i’d watch that."
12612,Leonard,"no, hang on, hang on.  see! "
15881,Leonard,how about that gorn sitting on the couch?
17045,Leonard,for all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
13898,Leonard,don’t worry about it. it’s my treat.
20874,Leonard,no way.
16265,Leonard,"hear, hear."
17191,Leonard,"oh, no, come on!"
14945,Leonard,what is that?
15289,Leonard,"i’m not going out tonight, raj."
21191,Leonard,"hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in santa barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?"
13217,Leonard,this could work. 
19893,Leonard,what does that mean?
18623,Leonard,it’s a joke.
12038,Leonard,"yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
18417,Leonard,"sheldon, that’s incredible."
20260,Leonard,"ah, i also made oatmeal."
18987,Leonard,"really? because i just heard will you marry me? that’s two proposals, one day. sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name hofstadter."
14129,Leonard,"hey, penny. it’s leonard."
16989,Leonard,i don’t know.
14305,Leonard,"oh, sure, what’s up?"
16168,Leonard,"yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
15841,Leonard,really?
17775,Leonard,"oh. like jaws 4, indiana jones 4, daredevil 1."
21107,Leonard,"you know what, sheldon, take it. in fact, you can have everything, i really don’t care."
16927,Leonard,"uh, right."
12918,Leonard,yes. 
15982,Leonard,remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
17565,Leonard,what?
18528,Leonard,"okay, i found the, uh, court papers that you and zack need to fill out. i’ll print them when we get home."
16006,Leonard,"listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
12680,Leonard,oh jeez. is this suit really look that bad?
12572,Leonard,why?
14612,Leonard,see ya. still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
17857,Leonard,please forgive me. i should have told you about alex.
17326,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. i kind of promised myself i’d get off the computer, be more physically active. get some exercise."
12987,Leonard,what was your first clue?
21330,Leonard,"i’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
21771,Leonard,that your dad?
20677,Leonard,stuart.
12451,Leonard,we’re socialising. meeting new people. 
15670,Leonard,he’s glissinda the troll.
21389,Leonard,hey.
12757,Leonard,o-o-o-o-h! again?
17854,Leonard,why would you do that?
21689,Leonard,"members of the faculty, students, i’m excited to speak to you today. i can’t help but remember the last time i was in this auditorium. two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. but enough about my ten-year reunion. i’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it."
15378,Leonard,how am i betraying you?
18576,Leonard,is someone sick?
20619,Leonard,right. so all we need is to…
20994,Leonard,"no, no, no. it’s not okay."
13810,Leonard,"no, don’t make it so. barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
17818,Leonard,"no, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. pretty christmassy."
13903,Leonard,where are you going?
18192,Leonard,i’m sorry things turned out this way.
12691,Leonard,"because…. uh, friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
16334,Leonard,"well, uh, not far. hey, if you ever wanna start a family, la cañada has some great schools."
18768,Leonard,sorry.
18564,Leonard,it’s not a big deal.
16285,Leonard,"oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? that is so cruel."
15205,Leonard,we think we can help you with your stage fright.
12536,Leonard,almost 6:30. 
18640,Leonard,yes.
13818,Leonard,"you know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing bruce banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
12180,Leonard,i’m not surprised. a well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
15191,Leonard,it’s in a fedex box on its way back to where it came from.
13663,Leonard,that’s absurd.
13421,Leonard,maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
15575,Leonard,"except in knight rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter."
16468,Leonard,are you ashamed of me?
15122,Leonard,he does. and in the kitchen. and in the car. and in his pocket.
14123,Leonard,"i see. well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place."
15051,Leonard,"sheldon, come here."
18059,Leonard,"that’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there."
15974,Leonard,"oh, how’d it go last night?"
16120,Leonard,"i’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. i’ve dated four different women since we broke up and i didn’t tell any of them that i loved them and wanted to have their babies."
13613,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did you do?"
16001,Leonard,"i don’t know, i think we might owe the guy an apology."
18706,Leonard,"oh, hey."
13103,Leonard,"you know, before you got all swollen up, i actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. "
20500,Leonard,i really do.
15404,Leonard,leonard.
14583,Leonard,i’ve always been a little confused about this. why don’t hindus eat beef?
12856,Leonard,is that even possible?
13909,Leonard,"back in the pocket it goes. look, you do understand that sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. it’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
19592,Leonard,are you crazy? you don’t know who this person is. delete that.
17686,Leonard,well answer it. i want to hear.
19058,Leonard,"i know you’ll try. so, should we talk about setting a date?"
15933,Leonard,"what, uh, the kissing and everything? nah, women do that to me all the time."
14606,Leonard,"warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
13168,Leonard,tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
12292,Leonard,nothing.
12036,Leonard,"i think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
15553,Leonard,"palak paneer, that’s penny."
14803,Leonard,you’d have a better shot with the three-breasted martian hooker from total recall.
20638,Leonard,why didn’t you tell me?
21210,Leonard,what? where is this coming from?
20823,Leonard,"yeah, drive safe. "
16003,Leonard,what would i even say?
18832,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
19138,Leonard,"sheldon, i promise. your uvula does not have an std."
15946,Leonard,"thanks, wyatt. i’m a keeper."
13135,Leonard,maybe a little.
18672,Leonard,i don’t know.
19152,Leonard,"you don’t honestly think that, do you?"
18007,Leonard,yeah.
12396,Leonard,pretty good. 
16732,Leonard,"no, it’s okay. i’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
20453,Leonard,okay. thanks. hey. i think you may have dropped this?
20889,Leonard,"according to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two."
13414,Leonard,"okay, fasten your seat belt."
17437,Leonard,so we won’t let it get weird.
17092,Leonard,"oh, god, no. the money’s pretty good. and i used the equipment to make my own bat-signal."
16944,Leonard,"hey, pal. you didn’t see me telling kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
16045,Leonard,she’s not going to steal our idea.
15513,Leonard,how about an acetylene torch?
20490,Leonard,and his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
15771,Leonard,"yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…"
20127,Leonard,"no, of course not. i just feel bad."
13270,Leonard,"alright, alright. well, uh, nevertheless, i have one now and i would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
17986,Leonard,"what do you mean, why? it’s valentine’s day."
19343,Leonard,"let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?"
19308,Leonard,thank you. sorry.
17502,Leonard,"good, i’m glad. "
19227,Leonard,"okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. all right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion."
14871,Leonard,"well, i just, i thought…"
13182,Leonard,why don’t we just go into your….
12170,Leonard,sheldon!
17776,Leonard,"penny’s working tonight, i’m in."
18034,Leonard,"yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."
14910,Leonard,i do.
14427,Leonard,"it’s 7 a.m. i’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and i needed to talk to you."
19456,Leonard,"you miss the blanket now, don’t you?"
12223,Leonard,not much. bro. 
16099,Leonard,"not you, him."
20390,Leonard,good for you.
13247,Leonard,"what? i’ve dated plenty of women. there was joyce kim, leslie winkle."
13907,Leonard,"yeah, they’re very considerate that way."
16551,Leonard,what are you doing here?
14475,Leonard,saloons?
17439,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i did, i crossed a line. i didn’t mean to!"
19956,Leonard,right. no surprises.
15223,Leonard,"oh, right. ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, dr. sheldon cooper."
13607,Leonard,i stand corrected.
14440,Leonard,check.
20555,Leonard,"sure, we could write something up."
18619,Leonard,that’s amazing.
21426,Leonard,"anyway, i figured i can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
19313,Leonard,i don’t know that i’d call myself an infection.
14000,Leonard,she’s only been here a day and a half and i’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
12484,Leonard,"yeah, no, i’m fine. it’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…."
18090,Leonard,penny.
17673,Leonard,"i know, but i have to go to work, and i made you breakfast."
16589,Leonard,"please. sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
14508,Leonard,please don’t be mad.
15094,Leonard,why are you doing this?
15310,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t care if you want to be friends with penny."
15709,Leonard,what the hell? how long has she been here?
13151,Leonard,"yeah, that must get old quick. "
12348,Leonard,i see.
14680,Leonard,so you could teach me?
19616,Leonard,that would be great.
21115,Leonard,is the wi-fi working for you?
13877,Leonard,what’s that?
16839,Leonard,"oh, what the hell. i’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, alice, but i don’t know if i should, because i’m going out with priya, but she’s in india."
15587,Leonard,"penny, steve wozniak was one of the cofounders of apple computer. he and steve jobs started it…"
20139,Leonard,"look at all these activities the university has. rock climbing club, archery, flag football."
13366,Leonard,yeah.
16434,Leonard,hey.
13212,Leonard,no.
19505,Leonard,sheldon.
16583,Leonard,"just let it go, sheldon."
16197,Leonard,i hadn’t really given it much thought.
18400,Leonard,doesn’t matter.
18161,Leonard,"so, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to comic-con?"
17386,Leonard,what if he doesn’t?
16934,Leonard,i’m serious. i’ll do it.
16572,Leonard,when were you going to tell me about this?
21677,Leonard,what?
19474,Leonard,no.
19133,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you doing this?"
17597,Leonard,"no good, sheldon doesn’t float."
20517,Leonard,maybe we could get batman to actually show up.
18697,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, stay."
12663,Leonard,any other questions?
18979,Leonard,i was not gonna propose. it’s already two to one.
16497,Leonard,"well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, i don’t, oh, what’s the word i’m looking for?"
20278,Leonard,otherwise we’d love to.
21055,Leonard,"okay, well, good luck with it."
14595,Leonard,that was fun. thank you.
19287,Leonard,"well, nailed it."
18733,Leonard,"sheldon, buddy, i just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
19159,Leonard,whatever. you can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
13487,Leonard,"no, no, don’t tell her."
19118,Leonard,"yeah. if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?"
15342,Leonard,why didn’t you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton? i am a huge fan of hers!
12316,Leonard,"sounds like a breakthrough, should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? "
12222,Leonard,"oh, right, right right right right."
12955,Leonard,"come on, snipers. "
12792,Leonard,"you call koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. "
17889,Leonard,what did you do?
18552,Leonard,"no, it’s all over."
19599,Leonard,you will not believe what stephen hawking just said.
14646,Leonard,"oh, yeah. it’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
14648,Leonard,"oh. football, sure."
12306,Leonard,"no, no, i’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding."
21116,Leonard,"oh, i knew it, sheldon changed the password."
20243,Leonard,"oh, man, i’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you."
19462,Leonard,"wait, wait, his wing moved."
15408,Leonard,"believe it or not, he was worse when i met him."
19868,Leonard,"yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the east coast."
21552,Leonard,great. tonight he wants to look at ladders at home depot.
12400,Leonard,"thank you. what did she mean, she’s happy for me? is she happy because i’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that i’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. you know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
18258,Leonard,"is it? hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!"
16982,Leonard,i have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
19377,Leonard,"okay, why?"
17595,Leonard,en el acelerador de particulares.
15858,Leonard,"fine, sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
18988,Leonard,"hey. penny, don’t get upset. here. i love you, but, no, i will not marry you."
15936,Leonard,"really? how, how’d we manage that?"
12525,Leonard,"i’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
14177,Leonard,shh-shh-shh!
14740,Leonard,no.
15081,Leonard,"look, sheldon, i know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, i promise i will not kill you. in fact, i’ll even let you eat my brains. but i am taking penny to switzerland."
17249,Leonard,what are you going to do when you get to the university? people are going to recognize you.
15019,Leonard,"me, too, but i paid three bucks for it."
13968,Leonard,yes.
17111,Leonard,even during? ‘cause sometimes i have questions.
12700,Leonard,i highly doubt that. go away. . are you still out there? 
21146,Leonard,are you sure? i’d really like to.
17534,Leonard,i was. now i’m having a nightmare. what do you want?
13115,Leonard,"look, i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…."
13093,Leonard,"oh my god, why did you eat it?"
12066,Leonard,"well, if that was a movie i would go see it."
19846,Leonard,we want you back on the project with us.
18925,Leonard,hey. how about we bring back anything can happen thursdays?
18283,Leonard,"hey, i said i was sorry. what else do you want from me?"
14875,Leonard,um…
19150,Leonard,you don’t even like yorkshire pudding.
12518,Leonard,what’s wrong?
16445,Leonard,you’re pregnant?
21017,Leonard,"well, of course not."
17051,Leonard,"yeah, i feel pretty good about myself. you think we can outrun him?"
18452,Leonard,"hey, i got an email from professor proton."
13679,Leonard,we’re not living together.
19712,Leonard,he always needs all the attention. he’s such a baby.
12653,Leonard,"no, no not at all. a little bit. "
14906,Leonard,you’re my surrogate family?
18172,Leonard,yes.
12184,Leonard,"no, i do not have a sarcasm sign."
17872,Leonard,"yes, but i think this is all a big misunderstanding."
15474,Leonard,"i know. i just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
17325,Leonard,what’s this about sheldon seeing you naked?
21076,Leonard,"really, why?"
16210,Leonard,howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. he had a fight with his mother.
19345,Leonard,what?
16308,Leonard,yeah. the doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. it was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
15866,Leonard,want to get that?
16996,Leonard,it’s two a.m. what are you doing up?
21729,Leonard,there’s three?
20167,Leonard,look at me go.
17846,Leonard,"i don’t know, just having a good day. this morning sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so i got to listen to the radio. that was pretty crazy."
19088,Leonard,i’m gonna miss you.
13652,Leonard,don’t even! i don’t want to hear another word out of you.
13853,Leonard,"aw, you picked up on that huh?"
16782,Leonard,sorry. syrup.
14309,Leonard,why the hell not?
15124,Leonard,stan lee.
19243,Leonard,"okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off."
15365,Leonard,how do you take your coffee?
20432,Leonard,can you please live with us forever?
20467,Leonard,i know. food fight. i’ll keep thinking.
21517,Leonard,that doesn’t seem to be where i shine. how about i just give you one of these?
12150,Leonard,men do things for women without expecting sex.
14067,Leonard,"really? great. sheldon, look. good as new."
20484,Leonard,you’re the other baby.
20669,Leonard,and i’d think you’d understand why i’m annoyed.
12018,Leonard,no.
17749,Leonard,really?
14596,Leonard,oh. okay. tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. just throw it away.
12154,Leonard,so penny’s a little messy.
19731,Leonard,"i don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?"
18382,Leonard,i didn’t dream that?
12941,Leonard,i know someone who would disagree.
14353,Leonard,okay… i just… i kind of…
20700,Leonard,better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? nope.
20228,Leonard,i promise this is the last time.
15313,Leonard,"d-don’t be silly. we’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
14333,Leonard,how teeny tiny?
20439,Leonard,hey.
13690,Leonard,"oh, good. do you have any fabric softener?"
20961,Leonard,"oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. who got him to stop purelling his pocket change?"
19958,Leonard,"you know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us."
13324,Leonard,"that’s not what she’s doing, leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
16845,Leonard,"damn it, i can’t. i can’t, i can’t do this."
19009,Leonard,with your career?
18849,Leonard,"oh, come on."
17786,Leonard,"look at that, i built a fireplace with my own two hands."
14742,Leonard,"no, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
14833,Leonard,i am. are you interested in physics?
16784,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, we say catholics, not rosary rattlers."
20203,Leonard,"all right, let’s all just calm down. nobody wants to report anybody."
21245,Leonard,"careful, i saw this on star trek. smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. hey."
19700,Leonard,oh.
21697,Leonard,yeah.
21155,Leonard,"penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep."
20074,Leonard,"too expensive. you’d think i’d be used to women withholding their love. i mean, my mother did. i mean, no matter how hard i tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me."
15764,Leonard,did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
17555,Leonard,you talk to howard lately?
17998,Leonard,"mmm, would you like some wine?"
17190,Leonard,aaargh. what the hell?
18240,Leonard,"i know. as far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
15190,Leonard,i’m out.
18257,Leonard,best time of my life. 
15309,Leonard,is it possible he said bros before hos?
18376,Leonard,"hey, i was just… what is happening?"
17810,Leonard,"three, two."
16776,Leonard,"we don’t say that, either. i’ll make you a list."
13630,Leonard,what are you doing?
15885,Leonard,"when she comes out with eat, pray, run away from a giant boulder, i’ll read it."
15966,Leonard,no hurry.
20801,Leonard,"and, of course, mom."
16745,Leonard,"wait, let me see if i got this right. you actually asked bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
12267,Leonard,"to… carve the… okay, i’ll see you six thirty."
13125,Leonard,no. no. 
18029,Leonard,"don’t look under that rock.  raj, you okay?"
16510,Leonard,that’s actually my napkin.
17900,Leonard,"look at us, sheldon. we’re the crazy people."
16296,Leonard,yeah.
17237,Leonard,can i control the thermostat?
17357,Leonard,interrupting physi…
15875,Leonard,i’m sorry. why can’t you sleep?
18268,Leonard,and i’m gonna hit the head. that’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
19586,Leonard,read it back one more time.
18668,Leonard,what?
17079,Leonard,"okay, how do i look?"
17498,Leonard,"sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing raj on your date night with amy?"
12044,Leonard,"uh, yes."
20297,Leonard,what? i didn’t know you had a journal.
12693,Leonard,see you.  
12667,Leonard,"look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
16169,Leonard,"oh, good, good."
15447,Leonard,"oh, sorry, i didn’t know you were busy. maybe another time."
12977,Leonard,"okay, i am setting the dials for january 10th, 2328. here we go into the future.  that was fun. "
18960,Leonard,"he was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?"
18991,Leonard,"it was nice, you know. a lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. did you know that arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  hey, the guys are about to start jedi. you want to go watch?"
19580,Leonard,"uh, don’t lower yourself to their level."
18019,Leonard,"fine, you win. you’re a bitch. why couldn’t we just have a nice time?"
13362,Leonard,now. 
18270,Leonard,that is not fair. i complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
20927,Leonard,you enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
19198,Leonard,why say it?
13747,Leonard,okay. bye-bye! what are you looking at?you’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
12402,Leonard,she fixed your equation.
15247,Leonard,you don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
19206,Leonard,"mm, the guys and i were thinking about investing in stuart’s comic book store. is that okay?"
17991,Leonard,you can’t find a card that says that?
14190,Leonard,"yeah, it is."
16332,Leonard,"uh, i kind of have a problem i was hoping you could help me with."
17983,Leonard,you’re kidding. did you heimlich him?
20610,Leonard,i know. did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like colonial williamsburg.
21202,Leonard,"so, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night."
19216,Leonard,then we’ll go to a hotel.
16866,Leonard,"come on, it’s your turn. we said we’d get more fresh air."
16571,Leonard,you’re moving back to india?
18958,Leonard,"yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. you okay? i know he meant a lot to you."
15444,Leonard,screw you guys. i’m gonna go see if she’s home.
19349,Leonard,i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
14218,Leonard,"you’re right. it’s anything can happen thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
16403,Leonard,"– priya, can i come in?"
19694,Leonard,"uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. i mean, that’s what’s important."
13542,Leonard,"well, five is partway between three… never mind."
17896,Leonard,i don’t believe this.
18351,Leonard,"gee, i don’t know. maybe it’s because i was always the subject of her little experiments. did you get to the chapter where she staged the easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long i’d keep looking? the answer, by the way, june."
17876,Leonard,"glasses? i really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my god, you look so smart and hot."
18259,Leonard,"uh-oh, hang on."
14928,Leonard,"come on, penny."
20601,Leonard,"buddy, i am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
18105,Leonard,"oh, very. assuming she takes my call."
18040,Leonard,i’m sorry. that i asked.
13121,Leonard,"i don’t care. she’s upset, i’m going over there. "
13193,Leonard,i didn’t say anything like that.
13340,Leonard,are you proud of yourself?
15860,Leonard,"mulder and scully. x-files. the truth is out there. never mind. uh, so, what would you like to know?"
12880,Leonard,what did you spill on it?
12466,Leonard,that’s penny’s ex-boyfriend.
15756,Leonard,i look forward to it.
17664,Leonard,"he’s probably busy. you’re worried about nothing. give it a couple more days. i’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. my turn. i can’t let penny hand in a bad paper, but how do i tell her it’s bad without letting her know that i read it?"
16870,Leonard,you do?
16862,Leonard,"this time, it’s your fault."
14828,Leonard,yeah. hey.
15385,Leonard,no.
17997,Leonard,"waugh, romance ninja."
13321,Leonard,penny’s been keeping him up at night.
15049,Leonard,sheldon took our order.
16249,Leonard,what you doing?
15949,Leonard,"good night, wyatt. oh, good night, honey."
20123,Leonard,"oh, thank god."
18331,Leonard,"well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, i can’t even say it in front of sheldon."
12758,Leonard,just reset the board.
17772,Leonard,you’re both acting like lunatics. it’s just a parking spot.
14816,Leonard,"sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on kripke, like, uh, like, how the joker got back at batman for putting him in the arkham asylum for the criminally insane."
14072,Leonard,golden dragon.
13526,Leonard,problem with the wifi?
15997,Leonard,they might be smarter than some people.
21579,Leonard,"hey, i just ran into penny, she seemed upset about something."
12778,Leonard,yes.
13132,Leonard,"elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? "
19979,Leonard,"if you’re not into this, we can do it another time."
15432,Leonard,"i did agree to the thermostat setting, and i shouldn’t have tried to change it."
13524,Leonard,norad? you’re using military aircraft?
13385,Leonard,a griffin?
16447,Leonard,what?
20326,Leonard,"oh, yeah, he got a tuba."
16407,Leonard,it’s a splatter thing. there’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
20161,Leonard,"if you’re cranky and retaining water, i have a theory."
13485,Leonard,pukhpa.
17027,Leonard,yes.
16533,Leonard,there was one time i put body glitter on.
19311,Leonard,sure.
12324,Leonard,you don’t have buffets in india?
20136,Leonard,"hey, ready for lunch?"
16692,Leonard,"well, okay. again, thank you."
20580,Leonard,"well, funny story. so, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…"
20696,Leonard,it just said italian sub. i had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
21471,Leonard,"no, it’s always him."
19729,Leonard,"if it’s half as much fun as one times ten to the fourth bottles of beer on the wall, i’m in."
17465,Leonard,i have a couple more quick questions. do you want to call me from the car?
14545,Leonard,"sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
20213,Leonard,what?
19199,Leonard,"uh, do you know how penny told raj he should have left her off his list?"
17261,Leonard,where’s howard?
19603,Leonard,the place really looks great.
20308,Leonard,i’m sorry about the journal. i want to make it up to you. so i’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on facebook.
13102,Leonard,"say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. "
13692,Leonard,are you sure?
16755,Leonard,"i’m going. live long and prosper, sheldon."
19916,Leonard,that’s not what it is.
16881,Leonard,"hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
21336,Leonard,what if he lives in your garage?
13388,Leonard,"that may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
14082,Leonard,he’s right. you can’t. 
20031,Leonard,i figured that out.
14256,Leonard,"well, what happened? we’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
16624,Leonard,"excuse me, that’s priya."
16576,Leonard,uh. that is a beautiful tapestry.
17751,Leonard,"i don’t know. it-it-it’s hard sometimes. everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if i’m standing right there. and they’re all taller than me. why is everyone taller than me? you know what, this is all in my head. it’s my problem, not yours."
19209,Leonard,i know. i was looking forward to it.
18555,Leonard,"i, i don’t understand. all you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. i was trying to make you happy."
15249,Leonard,really? you love them?
16459,Leonard,i’d like to refer that to my attorney.
15843,Leonard,you put moths in my food?
16063,Leonard,we’re not wasting time with names right now.
19385,Leonard,great timing. my check sphincter light just went on.
16315,Leonard,yep.
21539,Leonard,"so, are you excited to have your own place again?"
15394,Leonard,is she suggesting what i think she’s suggesting?
18232,Leonard,i do have to ask you one favour.
18722,Leonard,"i did it, i did it, i’m in the queue."
14225,Leonard,"oh, hey, stuart. this is penny. she’s looking for some comic books."
16292,Leonard,"sure. oh, god, you smell so good. of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. hypothetically, if i had access to a lieutenant uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
13476,Leonard,that only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the earth.
15454,Leonard,"don’t worry about the moon. we, we set our laser to stun."
16695,Leonard,sounds like you had a great night.
19516,Leonard,"okay, we’re headed out, see you later."
17451,Leonard,"i guess we are. so, what’s going on?"
15607,Leonard,"yeah, not my point."
12124,Leonard,"no, it was a valid hypothesis."
15716,Leonard,"well, you know how you’re always saying that amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
12940,Leonard,my physics bowl trophy! 
13579,Leonard,"if i knew you were waiting, i would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole."
16743,Leonard,"for god’s sake, will you stop with the schrodinger stuff."
17780,Leonard,no.
13363,Leonard,hey.
20664,Leonard,why are you taking his side?
16943,Leonard,laura.
18147,Leonard,i thought you grew up on a farm.
19420,Leonard,"well, that’s it. that’s the end of roger abbott."
17519,Leonard,go ahead.
17340,Leonard,ay papi? what is that?
20879,Leonard,"guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. now, can you please try"
21572,Leonard,i don’t know.
14927,Leonard,you’re surprised? your psychic didn’t tell you i was going to be a jerk?
12547,Leonard,"this isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction. "
17213,Leonard,"hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
15581,Leonard,i’m still going to go with you.
21453,Leonard,"i don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
20423,Leonard,"if i’m going to jail, i’m killing him, not breaking his thumb."
14348,Leonard,i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart’s date with penny.
19266,Leonard,doesn’t sound that bad.
18659,Leonard,"well, you have me."
12117,Leonard,i’m sorry.
21032,Leonard,you really didn’t think i’d notice my stuff was missing?
13946,Leonard,"okay, here it is. penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
18553,Leonard,"well, you’re welcome."
17795,Leonard,"okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. sheldon, what do you do?"
15360,Leonard,"uh, six."
20934,Leonard,"hey, sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
20680,Leonard,"i don’t know how you put up with it. he’s impossible. i mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
17263,Leonard,bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
18580,Leonard,"i know, it’s crazy. welcome to the thunderdome, people. "
12999,Leonard,i’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. 
21759,Leonard,"yeah, not a good idea."
15565,Leonard,"you cannot exist as a virtual presence. not here and certainly not at work. oh, good god."
12391,Leonard,"i’m good, i’m good to go. "
21608,Leonard,hey penny.
18256,Leonard,"penny? hey, it’s penny. everybody say hi to penny."
14864,Leonard,"mmm, in a way. we presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
18211,Leonard,"oh, that sounds romantic."
21653,Leonard,"leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. sincerely, maggie mcgeary."
17039,Leonard,"yeah, just back there."
20045,Leonard,i would love that.
17657,Leonard,what are you doing?
14421,Leonard,not exactly. but she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
18962,Leonard,really?
19364,Leonard,it was before my growth spurt.
14104,Leonard,my money’s on tuck and roll.
14391,Leonard,i could use the bathroom at 8:20.
17491,Leonard,"interesting question. on the one hand, i always thought…"
19126,Leonard,"this might not be that bad. uh, you like telling people they’re wrong."
12366,Leonard,lesley and i do research together at the university. 
18707,Leonard,how did she get you to do yoga?
21482,Leonard,you called on him.
19995,Leonard,you sure?
17007,Leonard,"uh, stapled."
14990,Leonard,i’m lactose intolerant.
12320,Leonard,what?
17603,Leonard,"57, 58, 59, that’s one minute."
18325,Leonard,almost.
17269,Leonard,can’t be very long.
18333,Leonard,why would you do that?
13733,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. we’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and i don’t even know what a duvet is but i’m pretty sure if i did i wouldn’t want one, but every time i talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
19232,Leonard,had will have placed?
14516,Leonard,more wine?
18973,Leonard,"mm, you know, that i didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language."
14004,Leonard,did you get the part?
12263,Leonard,great. did we say a time?
14119,Leonard,"boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  but look, penny’s home. why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
19962,Leonard,nothing really. it was just kissing.
17899,Leonard,i thought we agreed this was all koothrappali’s fault.
12593,Leonard,um… raj.
13771,Leonard,"oh, hey, dave. and penny, what a surprise."
20354,Leonard,"um, hey, wil. what you doin’?"
16654,Leonard,oh! i didn’t even think of that. thanks.
15054,Leonard,"hey, what are you and bernadette doing for your first valentine’s day?"
17121,Leonard,i can’t believe you kept this.
16397,Leonard,really? how could you tell?
17310,Leonard,good. i’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
13040,Leonard,i brought snacks.
20968,Leonard,how you guys doing?
17306,Leonard,"did you have fun? because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about."
18142,Leonard,there is no season three. they cancelled that show.
14125,Leonard,"he’s calling to ask you a favour. you might be confused because he didn’t use the words, penny, sheldon, please or favour."
17356,Leonard,who’s there?
17122,Leonard,that is so sweet. in 25 to 30 minutes i’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
19760,Leonard,"i’m sorry, don’t listen to him. we’re actually physicists. we’re giving a lecture at berkeley later today. we just, we had some time to kill."
13426,Leonard,"i wonder a lot of things about you, sheldon, but not… not that."
15781,Leonard,"bifurcated uvula, sheldon!"
18888,Leonard,"two women at the same time? nice job, playa."
21441,Leonard,"well, i mean, i’m sitting right here. you’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
19365,Leonard,very funny.
20155,Leonard,"look, even if it’s not him, amy’s probably going to date someone at some point."
19915,Leonard,thank you.
18882,Leonard,so it’s a family film.
19726,Leonard,"oh, i like to laugh. but say it anyway."
21220,Leonard,earl grey?
20875,Leonard,"oh, my turn, my turn."
14638,Leonard,gonna be a long night.
12262,Leonard,"they…. might all be there. or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example sheldon had quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of quizznos, they have a varied menu."
18567,Leonard,"oh, relax, she’s in her crate. she can’t get out."
13895,Leonard,"well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
16266,Leonard,"oh, the ancient romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
20199,Leonard,"look, you can trust us. we’re respected scientists."
20635,Leonard,"uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. i have money i love, but never spend. we’re kind of a cute couple that way. again, i’m sorry. i shouldn’t have kept it a secret."
20740,Leonard,"i don’t think you have anything to worry about. raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault."
20024,Leonard,"no, of course not. okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? i was trying to lighten the mood. it’s not easy. you try it."
17569,Leonard,"no. but compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity."
16669,Leonard,"what, who told you that?"
16417,Leonard,"oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. you sit."
13326,Leonard,"excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
16022,Leonard,what makes you think i can convince her?
18178,Leonard,"okay, good night."
20705,Leonard,i’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
18780,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. i’m gonna need more details."
21270,Leonard,has he ever had his own place?
21135,Leonard,why? i said i didn’t care.
12952,Leonard,yeah. and that’s my bid.
15896,Leonard,hysterical!
20371,Leonard,"really? any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?"
19708,Leonard,"if you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working."
18093,Leonard,"so, which one do you think it is, matey?"
13879,Leonard,he had lysine but changed it.
13685,Leonard,"actually, i think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend."
20089,Leonard,yeah.
18365,Leonard,no. not everything is about my mom. 
16054,Leonard,thank you. i thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
16229,Leonard,whose tongue?
20261,Leonard,i don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
19065,Leonard,i haven’t heard from sheldon in a while. you think he’s okay?
12282,Leonard,"oh, who am i kidding, i can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
12076,Leonard,"that’s not true, remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer’s had that episode."
18012,Leonard,i thought we were letting it go.
21723,Leonard,i’m leonard hofstadter. i called you about the apartment. you said…
16975,Leonard,hocus pocus pocahontas.
20741,Leonard,morning.
16077,Leonard,hold on. that’s it!
13862,Leonard,"no! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. meet people. talk to them. take an interest in their lives."
12966,Leonard,"come on, guys, push. "
12825,Leonard,lay it on me. 
20398,Leonard,no.
16486,Leonard,very pretty.
13798,Leonard,"what did i ever do to jimmy mullins in the third grade? he still punched me in the face with my own fists. sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time."
16893,Leonard,star wars on blu-ray.
16512,Leonard,you all right?
17380,Leonard,"boy, a restraining order from stephen hawking. it’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from leonard nimoy, carl sagan and stan lee."
16762,Leonard,so what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
14399,Leonard,"oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. sorry, i was gonna tell you."
16605,Leonard,"yes, no and no."
21281,Leonard,"nicely done, howard."
15504,Leonard,four months.
19169,Leonard,sorry.
21310,Leonard,"yeah, i know. that’s not even a math symbol. that’s just charlie brown’s hair."
17847,Leonard,mm. i found this quiz online called which star trek character are you? and it only took me four tries to get captain kirk.
20870,Leonard,"oh, looks like it."
19665,Leonard,yeah?
17462,Leonard,i noticed you never answered me.
16853,Leonard,"uh, not so good. we have to talk."
15775,Leonard,"sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
15064,Leonard,penny.
17783,Leonard,it’s not our fault. our dads never did anything like this with us.
15919,Leonard,yeah.
18293,Leonard,and no one told me?
21239,Leonard,"article 10, subsection c, if questioned penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, i said it’s nothing don’t worry about it. "
14879,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait. when did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
19902,Leonard,"that’s so sweet, you think i have self-esteem."
20844,Leonard,that was almost a minute.
12647,Leonard,my last growth spurt. 
19789,Leonard,"stay out of it, kevin smith."
21779,Leonard,a bad thing. a very bad thing. get the door. get the door! get the door! get the door! get the door!
16327,Leonard,small world.
15527,Leonard,you can always get a badger and find out.
18965,Leonard,"oh that’s, that’s fine. go ahead."
13694,Leonard,"no, everything’s fine."
18838,Leonard,so humiliating? am i driving you to the cheesecake factory…? i’m sorry. i’ll. i’ll stop. i’ll stop.
13992,Leonard,"you brought your husband to work, you know the rules. meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
20404,Leonard,"that’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited."
21111,Leonard,i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
14064,Leonard,get out.
19693,Leonard,cooper and his team?
16887,Leonard,"yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
12552,Leonard,"here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for indian food."
13712,Leonard,"i just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
15015,Leonard,"don’t bark at me. i fell, too."
19062,Leonard,oh.
12776,Leonard,huh. i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology. 
16821,Leonard,you’re sure it’s not weird.
14554,Leonard,oshikuru: demon samurai.
15732,Leonard,"well, i’m off to meet bernadette’s friend. how do i look?"
12255,Leonard,"you’re right. i didn’t ask her out, i should ask her out."
15400,Leonard,i don’t?
17145,Leonard,"well, i was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. that was the plan, right?"
17951,Leonard,"you know what? screw you, sheldon. you are the most annoying person i have ever met."
14187,Leonard,hello.
20341,Leonard,"i’m also really happy, but i can’t pretend it’s for you. new star wars in three days."
21334,Leonard,sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.
12692,Leonard,"no, it’s this friday, at eight. "
13571,Leonard,"what is? no, not like that! just, leonard went to the office."
20770,Leonard,"oh, please don’t."
19648,Leonard,which book are we looking for?
18278,Leonard,where do you think i would take you?
18719,Leonard,"they sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…"
12953,Leonard,"it was a spur of the moment thing, i figured it would go for thousands and i just wanted to be a part of it. "
17336,Leonard,"hey, listen, i kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then i wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if i should have asked you first. then i thought if i did check with you first, you’d think that i was taking things to seriously. and then, then i got a nosebleed."
15627,Leonard,i think sheldon really misses amy.
13342,Leonard,"well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive."
14483,Leonard,"and bring you home. so, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
18857,Leonard,"uh, uh, uh, hang on. do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?"
20668,Leonard,"yeah, that’s right."
17067,Leonard,glad i could help.
17105,Leonard,"well, i don’t know how you have a relationship without talking."
20090,Leonard,"hey, you’re early. the movie doesn’t start for an hour."
12956,Leonard,where are your snipers?
12973,Leonard,seconded. 
18840,Leonard,i know. i thought we’d take yours.
18058,Leonard,i wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
13189,Leonard,"okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. it’s like saying “i’m really enjoying this meal, i’m going to slow down and savour it.” "
13062,Leonard,"sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. "
18903,Leonard,women. who knows what’ll set ’em off?
21515,Leonard,so you think it’s okay?
21322,Leonard,how ya doing?
16793,Leonard,sorry.
16797,Leonard,"uh, yeah, yeah, sure, i guess."
19012,Leonard,"why? because i’m a, a smart decision?"
15493,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
18820,Leonard,"oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours."
18101,Leonard,"excuse me, but i think i’m just as qualified as you are."
18799,Leonard,no. sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
19883,Leonard,"well, i’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. but i have to say, this is very freeing."
17497,Leonard,"actually, i’m hanging out with penny. "
14870,Leonard,"um, tomorrow?"
19899,Leonard,east texas.
19268,Leonard,"you know what, you don’t have to give me this. you keep it."
14208,Leonard,"okay, well, i’ll take you."
12820,Leonard,w-wait! 
19226,Leonard,robot prostitute.
15740,Leonard,"okay, where are you?"
17836,Leonard,terrific. something weird happened and i don’t know what to do about it.
16550,Leonard,"hey, if i roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. if you do it, you’re still not a doctor."
20676,Leonard,"if sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly.  oh. maybe someone’s here to apologize."
15859,Leonard,"so, when howard said the fbi would be contacting me, i was expecting mulder. glad to see i got scully."
20215,Leonard,it’s probably usc or ucla.
13352,Leonard,dr gablehauser.
19411,Leonard,"well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer."
13194,Leonard,"look, everything went fine. i didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. the woman across the hall is into me. "
15301,Leonard,"what do you want, sheldon?"
20942,Leonard,eh.
15208,Leonard,i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
20781,Leonard,"did she think you were choking or… i’m sorry, that’s great. thank you for spending time with her."
19371,Leonard,"oh, not fun. the doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses."
13940,Leonard,"okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
20689,Leonard,who do you think told koothrappali to go to human resources?
16615,Leonard,that doesn’t sound like mocking.
19636,Leonard,"well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
12939,Leonard,"sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
14138,Leonard,why?
19825,Leonard,"yeah. that’s better than what i did say, which was, fine, i’ll eat them with club soda."
15754,Leonard,"look, uh, joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
20722,Leonard,i smell nothing.
15119,Leonard,"hey, stuart, what’s going on?"
20832,Leonard,"mary, i’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
19383,Leonard,hey. what’re you working on?
15641,Leonard,"okay, fine. live with cats. be like my aunt nancy. she had dozens of them. and do you know what happened after she died? they ate her."
13564,Leonard,i can’t tell you that.
19297,Leonard,"great timing, food just got here."
16364,Leonard,did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
15927,Leonard,"she introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
18426,Leonard,"actually, it can be, but i told you sex doesn’t count."
16609,Leonard,"uh, yeah, sure."
19544,Leonard,"i turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there."
17322,Leonard,poor guy. he must have been exhausted. sheldon like to sleep while leonard play the bongo!
13623,Leonard,stephanie barnett is single.
17332,Leonard,we are going to play the online game.
12010,Leonard,"what, are you kidding? you’re a semi-pro. "
17716,Leonard,what?
18800,Leonard,he’s afraid the original owners will come back.
16729,Leonard,so?
18379,Leonard,mom?
17114,Leonard,"well, i want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. just, just help me out here. how does a miserable date end in sex?"
16563,Leonard,"there’s a reciprocity clause. you get to pull the plug on him, too."
16103,Leonard,shh-shh-shh-shh. sheldon’s asleep. what’s going on?
12710,Leonard,oooaw. this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath.  what?
20657,Leonard,you’re the only one who eats them.
14739,Leonard,"so, are we going to talk about last night?"
18752,Leonard,we’d be happy to watch cinnamon.
15292,Leonard,"yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
20004,Leonard,we’re good.
14953,Leonard,"i know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
18228,Leonard,"that’s the thing, you can’t. i’ll be on a ship in the north sea."
18015,Leonard,"oh, i’m not. it’s about you."
13969,Leonard,yes.
14493,Leonard,"there’s more to life than sex, raj."
18089,Leonard,amy.
12365,Leonard,"lesley, this is penny, she lives across the hall from sheldon and me. "
18682,Leonard,hey.
13622,Leonard,the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
13507,Leonard,sheldon’s onion ring. just put it back!
20257,Leonard,you’re in a good mood.
15291,Leonard,don’t worry. you’ll meet a girl someday.
14108,Leonard,"she’s probably heard every possible line, howard. why don’t you just try hello?"
13986,Leonard,"boy, you suck."
18571,Leonard,as i was saying…
16516,Leonard,that’s not your water.
15219,Leonard,"damn right, i’m angry with my mother. for god’s sake, i was eight years old. she humiliated me. that’s when the bed-wetting started again."
16143,Leonard,it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.
17860,Leonard,"hang on. are you feeling insecure? because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, i don’t know what i’m bringing to this relationship."
19922,Leonard,"oh, my mother."
13822,Leonard,i came home with no pants.
19496,Leonard,what? then. then why don’t you do it?
14775,Leonard,"of course, they did. that’s what grandmothers do."
21399,Leonard,why are you saying we have marital problems? we don’t have marital problems.
12788,Leonard,"howard, it’s leonard, code milky green. "
15411,Leonard,"for all i knew, he was the crazy one. he had this really deranged look."
17132,Leonard,what?
20200,Leonard,my friend does make a decent point about the money. i don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
16401,Leonard,oh. that’s too bad. i wonder what happened.
17013,Leonard,"jimmy, i’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
20810,Leonard,"okay, mom, you sit over there."
21560,Leonard,"penny laid into me, too. apparently, i’m overly fixated on premium swiss chocolate bars."
20357,Leonard,i’m really nervous.
12257,Leonard,"good afternoon penny, so hi, hey. uh… i was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
14456,Leonard,"well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his darth vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the force, so i’d say, a little better."
20644,Leonard,"you know, never have i ever made love in the forest while it was raining."
13052,Leonard,"alright, noted. but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister. "
12970,Leonard,"hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, i can drop you off at work yesterday. time travel joke, it’s not… never mind. "
17221,Leonard,i can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
20659,Leonard,you have fun. i will not be attending.
15105,Leonard,"yeah, really."
21095,Leonard,"well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
20565,Leonard,"hang on. maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too."
16810,Leonard,you’re kidding. you have your own book?
21177,Leonard,"for the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
16173,Leonard,"well, mrs. latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
16038,Leonard,"i was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. you just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
15494,Leonard,she’s not coming back.
12779,Leonard,they asked me to come in.
13770,Leonard,"what it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. it’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
14220,Leonard,"oh, absolutely."
18285,Leonard,"you know what? i’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying."
13682,Leonard,we’re not… where’s my bat signal?
14167,Leonard,"yeah, no. but, sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
17585,Leonard,in what universe is that a present?
16353,Leonard,i don’t know.
13636,Leonard,"no, i’m not. i’m bleeding."
18761,Leonard,"it’s a little late, but i’ll take it."
18681,Leonard,i’m gonna go talk to penny. 
20533,Leonard,"again, no…"
13803,Leonard,"i’m begging you, stop talking."
20819,Leonard,we’re not gonna be brothers. we’re not gonna be stepbrothers. go to sleep.
19647,Leonard,yup. got the code.
21631,Leonard,"fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
20318,Leonard,is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
20940,Leonard,"if you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
20903,Leonard,right. listen to me. we can’t do anything until you do your part. so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
12890,Leonard,"after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
15297,Leonard,how could you get lost? your phone has gps.
12904,Leonard,"well, you’re a friend, and you like batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team. "
16561,Leonard,"if you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
21178,Leonard,you know how easily i blister.
19989,Leonard,penny’s on the phone with her.
16812,Leonard,you’re very talented. this is really good. did you do… 
14039,Leonard,"okay, that should do it."
16917,Leonard,"does this sound familiar? i’d love to go shoe shopping with you. hiking? it’s great. it’s two a.m., of course i want to go to korea town and sing karaoke with your friends. who wouldn’t?"
18317,Leonard,"um, i’m okay with you driving my car. i’m not okay with you flying my car."
13569,Leonard,no.
12151,Leonard,"i’m doing this to be a good neighbour. in any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds."
17319,Leonard,richard feynman was a famous physicist.
16456,Leonard,schooled!
21488,Leonard,"doing it right now. oh, they can’t. there’s an important little league game tomorrow."
20177,Leonard,yes.
13251,Leonard,"yes i have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
15016,Leonard,"no, that’s a crazy thing."
18112,Leonard,"i’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. my chest is falling into my drawers. i’m not, uh, familiar with this model. how do i make it start?"
19845,Leonard,hey.
17073,Leonard,"you feel like trying something new for dinner? maybe indian, tex-mex?"
15211,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’ll start again."
19265,Leonard,you’re right.
14329,Leonard,"i’m not answering the phone, sheldon."
19913,Leonard,"oh, don’t flatter yourself. she likes everybody better than she likes me."
17532,Leonard,"the guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires."
18861,Leonard,in a minute. i don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any i have in science.
18893,Leonard,"so, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
17868,Leonard,i don’t know.
12889,Leonard,will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? 
18843,Leonard,"i mean, you could say thank you. i did just buy you a car."
12573,Leonard,hi.
16514,Leonard,what’s going on?
17558,Leonard,"ah, congratulations and may god have mercy on your soul. i’m leonard. this is raj."
14847,Leonard,what?
21719,Leonard,"excuse me, i’m looking for sheldon cooper’s apartment."
12992,Leonard,thanks for pointing it out.
20353,Leonard,check.
17216,Leonard,why is that good?
20373,Leonard,"oh, no, i, i’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, i’m better now."
15727,Leonard,"yeah. turns out, they guard the ipods, but they don’t guard the shirts."
20925,Leonard,keep m&m’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
13123,Leonard,i said i’m her friend. not her gay friend. 
12840,Leonard,"it’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it? "
20479,Leonard,ready to play when you are.
15126,Leonard,"you have no idea who he is, do you?"
20743,Leonard,"hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"
20780,Leonard,wow. well done.
19812,Leonard,"okay, fine. sheldon, may i please visit your fort?"
15578,Leonard,that’s it. bye-bye. 
17936,Leonard,"sheldon, kripke’s not smarter than you. you just got stuck on a wrong path. happened to einstein. he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."
17026,Leonard,yes.
18056,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science."
13911,Leonard,"well, what was the plan?"
21197,Leonard,"damn. i burped so hard, i died in my game."
17554,Leonard,"if you want help, just hire a grad student."
13515,Leonard,"are you insane? you’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place."
16611,Leonard,"penny, penny, listen, i hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because i have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
19049,Leonard,that’s very sweet. but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
16361,Leonard,that’s not where it was going.
15820,Leonard,"kind of busy here, sheldon."
16809,Leonard,no. but jessica alba did rub my furry belly.
13516,Leonard,thank you.
15911,Leonard,sheldon? sheldon?
15314,Leonard,you used to it yet?
16114,Leonard,no.
13792,Leonard,"oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. very thoughtful."
17902,Leonard,yes.
19340,Leonard,don’t rule out the dating.
12899,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
19581,Leonard,"sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. there’s no upside to doing this."
15021,Leonard,sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
12594,Leonard,"wait a minute, what’s the plan here? let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
13050,Leonard,"sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
18067,Leonard,i had no choice. he kept kicking the back of my seat.
21365,Leonard,do you think she’s as honest with you?
21342,Leonard,what is pink cheeks?
20504,Leonard,"i’m telling you, you got this."
16113,Leonard,good night.
18396,Leonard,i did not.
15666,Leonard,"i don’t know. sometimes your movements are so lifelike, i forget you’re not a real boy."
13042,Leonard,we don’t entertain much. 
19680,Leonard,"so, where do we want to hang it?"
21621,Leonard,"howard, why aren’t you covering us? we’re getting slaughtered out here!"
18185,Leonard,we just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
16416,Leonard,"wow, that’s hard to believe."
14940,Leonard,how can i go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
17910,Leonard,"are you kidding me? after all we’ve been through, i just want to go home."
12660,Leonard,"a joke. okay. how about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. so, he calls a physicist to help. the physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, i have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  right? "
13896,Leonard,"here you go. oh, you owe me another two dollars. the price of mu-shu pork went up."
14726,Leonard,he’s drowning us out. he doesn’t like fighting.
21378,Leonard,"you know what? i’ve gone 12 times. maybe i’ll sit out this year, too."
19098,Leonard,he got all of his stuff stolen.
17520,Leonard,what are you doing?
18000,Leonard,"trying to have a magical night here, guys."
20688,Leonard,she defends him all the time.
17728,Leonard,"none of this matters. i trust that penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy."
17108,Leonard,what does she want from me now?  what’s up?
16568,Leonard,"oh, come on! why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
13904,Leonard,"but if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in green lantern’s ass."
16735,Leonard,"no, i was gonna grab raj and howard and have a good time."
15465,Leonard,how did i ruin him?
20073,Leonard,"i mean, she’s really beautiful. she could have any guy she wants. which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."
14250,Leonard,what about the ones in the corner?
16727,Leonard,two hundred.
19927,Leonard,i get it. smallville almost wrecked you.
16139,Leonard,we might be starting to zero in on your problem.
21758,Leonard,"hey, sheldon. this is howard and raj. they work at the university, too."
14443,Leonard,i’m going to go let penny know we’re back.
15520,Leonard,whatcha doin’ there? working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
20570,Leonard,hey. what are you doing here?
18742,Leonard,"chicken out. we’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
14030,Leonard,thank you.
16569,Leonard,when is the time?
21561,Leonard,if i take a lactaid a half-hour before and some pepto right after.
19870,Leonard,i guess not.
15344,Leonard,thank you. why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
14714,Leonard,wait. what are you talking about?
19878,Leonard,really? that’s amazing. and you gave me the robes to give it in. thank you.
16167,Leonard,no kidding.
15154,Leonard,"okay, bye."
15193,Leonard,"i came in here, you guys were all sleeping. the ring was on the floor. no one was touching it."
20878,Leonard,we only have two months to deliver this to the air force because of you.
19174,Leonard,sometimes.
21682,Leonard,"yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? really? how much for three?"
16829,Leonard,"the problem is, i want to be one of those guys."
20474,Leonard,"oh, thank god."
18391,Leonard,"so, boys, how was the pyjama party? you guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
13027,Leonard,"sheldon, are you going to introduce us? "
15725,Leonard,the volcano thing? no.
17521,Leonard,"sheldon, you are not in charge."
21203,Leonard,because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
15063,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not taking you to switzerland."
21529,Leonard,where is everything?
14784,Leonard,no. that was the last pudding cup.
12606,Leonard,i wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren. 
19315,Leonard,"ah, that’s a good question. apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
18176,Leonard,that’s not ridiculous. good night.
18051,Leonard,"you mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?"
19750,Leonard,"no, but i don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me."
13450,Leonard,what do you mean “deal”?
15521,Leonard,yes.
12458,Leonard,"this is ridiculous, i’m jumping in."
12618,Leonard,forget the parties.
16878,Leonard,"oh, he was up late last night, so i gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
13919,Leonard,i would hope so.
17960,Leonard,"well, i’ve had it. i am done. i can’t, i can’t live with him for one more minute."
21728,Leonard,"i don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
13314,Leonard,i’ll go talk to her.
19245,Leonard,"i think it’ll be pretty clear. if not, we’ll take a vote. oh, and also…"
20888,Leonard,are you okay?
20128,Leonard,i did like that he had the weather on it.
13470,Leonard,we are communicating through the wall.
13760,Leonard,"yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
15480,Leonard,"no, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. especially the whole rodeo thing."
13179,Leonard,"so, gas."
18772,Leonard,"they’ve been in there, like, half an hour."
21096,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
15270,Leonard,"okay, i’m sorry. i’ll shut up."
13737,Leonard,"raj, please, let’s stay serious here. superman’s body is kryptonian, therefore his sweat is kryptonian."
15917,Leonard,i’ll go get penny while that guy spits on our food.
19380,Leonard,"it sounds like either way, i finally get some rest."
17233,Leonard,it’s not crazy.
19934,Leonard,"so, why haven’t we picked a date?"
16048,Leonard,satisfied?
13046,Leonard,how do i have penny? in what universe do i have penny?
18532,Leonard,"wuh, penny."
17698,Leonard,okay. you want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
17964,Leonard,why?
12698,Leonard,what?
19813,Leonard,thank you.
13119,Leonard,"i’m not going to do that, howard."
21574,Leonard,"exactly half. let’s push. okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math. "
20001,Leonard,"yup, just want to get married."
15276,Leonard,"sheldon, i got you your tangerine chicken. i hope you’re hungry."
15717,Leonard,you can’t say that anymore.
16453,Leonard,"yeah, fine."
13237,Leonard,you’re nitpicking.
16060,Leonard,we’re not doing names now. howard?
19928,Leonard,mmm. my pleasure.
14854,Leonard,we’re shocked.
19686,Leonard,i don’t even know what you’re talking about and i agree.
14161,Leonard,"the fifth annual east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance luau."
17522,Leonard,"it’ll be fine. just, uh, pretend he’s wolowitz."
21555,Leonard,oh. i love those.
14112,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because i forgot my flash drive."
16888,Leonard,maybe we should get you home.
21113,Leonard,but you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
14949,Leonard,"okay, let’s go see your psychic."
13328,Leonard,hello.
12428,Leonard,"sheldon, let it go."
15176,Leonard,we’re not giving him two jet skis.
15918,Leonard,"oh, um, is penny here?"
19985,Leonard,amy broke up with sheldon.
21544,Leonard,do you really care about that last one?
14388,Leonard,"all right, then go."
19526,Leonard,call me if you need anything.
16242,Leonard,what?
16694,Leonard,"okay. well, good night."
19290,Leonard,"i usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
18846,Leonard,"oh, my god, stuart?"
19280,Leonard,"i want you to know i get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and i am nothing but proud of you."
12199,Leonard,yeah.
16093,Leonard,it’s an annual science conference. we’ve all been invited to speak.
17727,Leonard,i liked it better when you thought i wasn’t here.
13793,Leonard,"oh, then, i think you’ll appreciate what i got you."
12047,Leonard,you’re very welcome.
19130,Leonard,what?
12278,Leonard,"if i could calm down i wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack."
16202,Leonard,yeah.
16756,Leonard,yeah.
16546,Leonard,kill me.
20728,Leonard,and i doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
14647,Leonard,you want to come watch?
21265,Leonard,fine. you invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for god knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.
19014,Leonard,"no, it’s exactly what you’re saying. i’m the boring thing you’re choosing because i’m good for you."
13875,Leonard,want some chinese food?
19299,Leonard,yes.
12176,Leonard,that’s ridiculous. 
21022,Leonard,khoo-vakh! she took my where’s waldo.
20595,Leonard,"ha, ha. leonard and i are about to see suicide squad. spoiler alert, when i see you i’m gonna spoil it. you’re a good friend."
14321,Leonard,"no, no that’s the past. i’m really more of a right now kind of guy. you know, living in the moment. although i do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. in conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me."
13104,Leonard,"there is a party, isn’t there."
21161,Leonard,"well, he doesn’t live at walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw marshmallow peeps after easter. and that’s the same man who complains you can’t find marshmallow peeps after easter."
13397,Leonard,"goodnight, sheldon."
13711,Leonard,what’s that? really? right now?
20881,Leonard,"oh, i had a good dream that when i carried you to bed, i let your head hit the wall and i laughed."
19307,Leonard,excuse me?
14165,Leonard,how are we doing?
15248,Leonard,chilli cheese fry?
19774,Leonard,"well, the g stands for graphics. that’s a hard g, so i’d say gif."
12061,Leonard,"i think what sheldon’s trying to say, is that sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
12888,Leonard,let’s put it to a vote. all those in favour….
13699,Leonard,you have a really good grasp on this. maybe you could talk to her?
19407,Leonard,"that someone was sheldon, and the day was yesterday. hey, look at this. dear roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. love, mom. wow, look at the date. he saved this fifty years and never got to open it."
20544,Leonard,so what happens next?
19004,Leonard,"yeah, but there was ample parking."
16406,Leonard,sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
16825,Leonard,"i met this girl, and she’s great. we have a lot in common."
19755,Leonard,"we’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue zelda."
15582,Leonard,what about it?
12307,Leonard,"yes, but i get car sick too, so…"
12787,Leonard,"yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, i have to go. "
14968,Leonard,hand me the bat.
16250,Leonard,you do realize everyone’s eating at raj’s again tonight?
16082,Leonard,sheldon! we’re working here!
12148,Leonard,"easy, easy  okay! now we’ve got an inclined plane. the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. "
15829,Leonard,"c’mon raj, how am i supposed to know who she’s attracted to. or was attracted to. or who she might be attracted to. in the future."
19886,Leonard,"my point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. and when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. and for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. thank you and congratulations."
17311,Leonard,i think this could be good for you. maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
14538,Leonard,"no, her bed kind of… broke."
14489,Leonard,yeah?
15844,Leonard,"well, uh, i can’t believe you used sheldon’s toothbrush."
19781,Leonard,psst.
12361,Leonard,"just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
12883,Leonard,"this is our year! with those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before zod. "
18817,Leonard,"oh, hey. you guys didn’t break up."
16112,Leonard,"got it, got it. we can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
18405,Leonard,"well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
20069,Leonard,because i didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
17890,Leonard,"counterpoint, no, it’s not."
18422,Leonard,we’ll be there.
15669,Leonard,yeah.
12191,Leonard,"okay, look, no penny, i think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
19748,Leonard,i know. you want to get a picture?
14542,Leonard,"i’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
17517,Leonard,"actually, to this day, she’s never really said it."
17141,Leonard,i’m just making a point.
21675,Leonard,"i’m sorry alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. i’m sorry alex hit on me, i’d no idea i’m cute."
13405,Leonard,"look, i need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
19324,Leonard,"all right, i’ll get rid of him. but you owe me one."
14319,Leonard,yes.
13067,Leonard,"stay down, bitch. yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
18920,Leonard,okay.
13254,Leonard,how?
19739,Leonard,exactly.
20885,Leonard,you don’t think you’ll be bored?
19476,Leonard,"you know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into."
21558,Leonard,"he just made her laugh, something’s wrong."
18386,Leonard,"no, no, i think it’ll be great. maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. giant baby."
12855,Leonard,"if he were, i wouldn’t be. "
12178,Leonard,"oh, what the hell."
13025,Leonard,howard…
18896,Leonard,yes.
12826,Leonard,how about that. 
16687,Leonard,"okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
16690,Leonard,i did have a great time. thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
13979,Leonard,"all right. uh, what’s new with you?"
16405,Leonard,it’s okay. you didn’t know. i’ll take care of it.
18456,Leonard,why is it odd?
17509,Leonard,what are you doing here? i thought you were out with sheldon and amy.
19997,Leonard,you’re right. i’m sorry. we have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. so what do you think? should we run next door and grab a bite?
18022,Leonard,okay. i know i propose a lot. so how about this? i promise i will never ask you to marry me again.
19867,Leonard,"yes. we’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but i’m not doing that either.  uh-oh. i just got an alert. our flight’s been cancelled."
17060,Leonard,you know digital alcohol is never a solution. what’s going on?
19973,Leonard,"it wasn’t even very good. she was a smoker, i’d just been seasick."
21755,Leonard,what do you want? i didn’t say come in!
15642,Leonard,"hi, mrs. cooper. thanks for coming."
18688,Leonard,"look, i get it, and i want you to know that i support whatever you want to do."
21227,Leonard,is it about the failing state of my relationship with penny?
15883,Leonard,94 seconds.
13780,Leonard,"okay, i have just one question for you. while i am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because i was too smart for you! well, news flash, lady, david underhill is ten times smarter than me! you’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! next to him, i’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! so, my question is, what’s up with that?"
18519,Leonard,"wait, you went to a chapel?"
15965,Leonard,"just for the record, i did not want to be a part of this."
19048,Leonard,"well, well, we might want to live together."
16787,Leonard,"okay. i don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. she’s all the way in india. that would be great."
12357,Leonard,really? what happened?
17911,Leonard,"no, that can’t be right."
12773,Leonard,what for? 
13553,Leonard,"wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
14228,Leonard,"penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. stuart’s a terrific artist. he went to the rhode island school of design."
19673,Leonard,"uh, th, that’s true. how late did we stay up last night?"
20113,Leonard,thank you.
19429,Leonard,yeah. what did they say?
12097,Leonard,"oh, i’ll probably say yes."
21744,Leonard,"i, i’m sorry, uh, in the morning. around eight."
15845,Leonard,"okay, i, i, i think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. but come on, we’re friends. friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. for the record, howard, i’m sorry that i broke our pact."
18628,Leonard,are you set on people laughing with you? ‘cause if you’re cool with at you…
15998,Leonard,a dolphin might.
17529,Leonard,what is it?
18997,Leonard,"it only gets funnier when you explain it, sheldon."
12704,Leonard,yes.
18952,Leonard,"hey, you got a second?"
20319,Leonard,"which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service."
12185,Leonard,penny’s up.
14183,Leonard,"i’m sorry, that really is how it works."
20459,Leonard,"it’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?"
19187,Leonard,what happens if she doesn’t like us?
15733,Leonard,what are you working on?
15753,Leonard,it’s relatively new. i just know that i’m not gonna spend time with someone i don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. i’m okay on my own.
20179,Leonard,we’d have to go to every party city in california.
13018,Leonard,"sheldon, are you okay? "
18842,Leonard,don’t say anything.
21600,Leonard,hey! 
16864,Leonard,"no, it’s not gonna do it."
17799,Leonard,"okay, come on, moving on."
17074,Leonard,"okay, let’s talk about that."
17478,Leonard,how about our roof?
19114,Leonard,i don’t care.
12268,Leonard,how do i look?
19201,Leonard,why?
14652,Leonard,why wouldn’t penny want her friends to meet me?
17937,Leonard,"sheldon lee cooper, i do not have time for this nonsense. now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work."
16087,Leonard,"why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
16412,Leonard,"well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
20320,Leonard,"eh, that just means going barefoot."
20507,Leonard,probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
16295,Leonard,one of them’s upstairs. the other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
13258,Leonard,like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. yep.
17533,Leonard,what?
13105,Leonard,howard. 
13597,Leonard,"listen, i need to talk to you about something."
20654,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months."
19823,Leonard,yeah. i’m excited to help.
12809,Leonard,"well, how do i carry it if i’m on my hands and knees?"
18690,Leonard,"so, well, before making any rash…"
13741,Leonard,"did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. he got lucky."
13691,Leonard,"no, the pants that stephanie got me."
20082,Leonard,"good. because i’ve loved you since the moment we met, and i will keep loving you until the end of time."
12822,Leonard,i don’t think penny’s ever coming here again. 
17281,Leonard,"all right, we gave it 45 minutes. it’s no longer funny. let’s try something else."
19291,Leonard,yeah. it just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
21763,Leonard,i did notify you.
16258,Leonard,i am leaving.
19609,Leonard,we’re not selling his tomatoes on ebay.
19135,Leonard,"you want to know what i think? i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it."
18454,Leonard,"if you would have told me when i was a kid that someday i would be doing science next to professor proton, i would not have believed you."
19692,Leonard,"uh, that, that’s not necessary."
15503,Leonard,his girlfriend.
20817,Leonard,i don’t like it either.
21251,Leonard,"no, raj, that’s a terrible idea."
19777,Leonard,"i was gonna say or, but why bother?"
14532,Leonard,i guess.
12836,Leonard,"huh, yeah? "
12089,Leonard,uh-huh.
17850,Leonard,what do you mean?
21674,Leonard,what?
21508,Leonard,uh.
18923,Leonard,"huh, well, i think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."
18415,Leonard,"yeah, definitely better before."
20958,Leonard,yeah. my record was six.
12839,Leonard,"come on, dennis, i’ll show you the radiation lab."
18947,Leonard,"well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish."
18921,Leonard,it’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
12665,Leonard,you are not isaac newton.
21395,Leonard,hey. 
12370,Leonard,"yeah, my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough. "
18197,Leonard,"see, howard’s just as good a dungeon master as i am."
12303,Leonard,"actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. "
16642,Leonard,"okay. uh, uh, you’re not naughty. uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. you’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
18489,Leonard,"well, i don’t know how to do that."
17638,Leonard,"hello, boys."
18670,Leonard,"penny proposed, and i didn’t say yes."
18432,Leonard,"oh, rose petals."
15008,Leonard,"great. your mom’s not coming, right?"
14134,Leonard,"excuse me.  okay, i’ll be honest with you. i’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. but then i finally realized you’re a human being; i’m a human being. i could just say to you…"
21404,Leonard,"leonard and penny, i’m sorry for all the trouble i’ve caused. i went to stay at howard’s. ps cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building."
19055,Leonard,"well, yeah."
18302,Leonard,you really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
15877,Leonard,what?
20733,Leonard,maybe we should take a step back.
19887,Leonard,so you really think they liked it?
14304,Leonard,"just think. thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
12716,Leonard,what’s important?
17551,Leonard,i didn’t know they gave nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
14758,Leonard,"the brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
17223,Leonard,"fine, what is it?"
18873,Leonard,"hey. oh, how’d the audition go?"
15464,Leonard,are you drunk?
12060,Leonard,"yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in klingon. that’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
12298,Leonard,"ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex."
16190,Leonard,really?
15060,Leonard,switzerland. and i get to bring a guest!
14025,Leonard,"no, that shouldn’t be a problem, venus is up during the day. they’re probably just all staring at the sky."
21731,Leonard,what’s the difference?
19220,Leonard,they seem okay with it.
20831,Leonard,"well, nothing happened, right? it’s over. until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
16869,Leonard,i don’t think amy was eaten by a bobcat.
14378,Leonard,everybody?
16410,Leonard,"yeah! dodgers are baseball, right?"
17918,Leonard,yep.
18272,Leonard,the what?
18244,Leonard,"anyway, we can e-mail, and i think the phone connections are pretty good."
18788,Leonard,sorry. how did it go?
21112,Leonard,"yeah, i like this one."
20480,Leonard,what’s going on?
14340,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sorry, it’s been broken."
20840,Leonard,"penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. but i don’t think i’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. you know, maybe i don’t"
19435,Leonard,"ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. oh, no."
12895,Leonard,i knew that too.
13823,Leonard,thank you. i should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
16965,Leonard,"all right, but just for the record, i checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
13616,Leonard,"oh, clearly i could have."
20757,Leonard,when’s the screening?
14034,Leonard,you and leslie?
14520,Leonard,"schnapps. you’re right, that is fun."
14153,Leonard,"okay, what’s wrong with it?"
12865,Leonard,does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
20078,Leonard,"penny, after all these years, i still feel like maybe i don’t deserve you."
18684,Leonard,"look, if you want to break up, just say it."
19863,Leonard,how’d you get ready so fast?
17963,Leonard,he’s got amy now.
20039,Leonard,"you can’t be serious. ‘cause i messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?"
14471,Leonard,"yeah, but i already saw him naked. just come here."
15551,Leonard,good night.
12818,Leonard,"well, i had to, you see what he’s like. "
15990,Leonard,infinite sheldon?
21300,Leonard,"sir, uh, if i may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. it’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
19346,Leonard,"you know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons."
19911,Leonard,"yes, you are a super weaner."
19551,Leonard,"no, no. people don’t talk about surface tension. if you imagine our three-space as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid bubble… this is exciting. this is really exciting. i have to go find sheldon."
20916,Leonard,"mm-hmm. for two of us, it’s in the right direction."
16794,Leonard,"yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
14253,Leonard,what else you got?
15213,Leonard,how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
18008,Leonard,two can play this game. penny…
16254,Leonard,of course. good night.
15133,Leonard,"yeah, okay. no."
17556,Leonard,smooth. hi.
20686,Leonard,son of a bitch. why is that funny?
21368,Leonard,"he wasn’t in a car, but okay."
15944,Leonard,"thanks for the steak, wyatt."
13339,Leonard,you’d do the dolphins.
21751,Leonard,we have a flag?
20255,Leonard,"well, he’s having a rough time. amy broke his heart, the dvr cut off the last minute of doctor who. that crow followed him home."
15850,Leonard,i give up.
19725,Leonard,"right now, i’m just trying to burp without throwing up."
19509,Leonard,all right. how about we start with two nights a week i live with penny?
19839,Leonard,that’s actually a valid example. animals do deliver messages through scent.
14935,Leonard,"you know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… "
16241,Leonard,"what do you want to do? you want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
16666,Leonard,you okay?
14608,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t ruin the game."
20163,Leonard,three.
13550,Leonard,how can 5 not be worse than 1?
16781,Leonard,i’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
16469,Leonard,then why can’t we tell your parents?
16938,Leonard,it’s cool. go back to kevin.
12562,Leonard,"sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo."
19399,Leonard,"i never thought i’d say these words, but come on, nose spider."
18384,Leonard,"although, technically, indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. he couldn’t even get that done."
20204,Leonard,"no, no, no. wait, don’t go. just let me explain. we’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year."
14730,Leonard,"i don’t want to play a game, sheldon."
19938,Leonard,"it’s not just the date. we haven’t talked about anything. big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?"
16811,Leonard,"cool. oh, look. that’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a chewbacca costume. comic con?"
17271,Leonard,you just called dibs.
13443,Leonard,sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
20658,Leonard,"i’m not going, you can’t make me."
12109,Leonard,we’re not going to give up just like that.
17000,Leonard,"it’s this jimmy speckerman thing. i can’t decide if i should agree to see him or not. of course that might be because the last time i ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
14431,Leonard,glad we cleared that up.
15922,Leonard,that was odd.
15792,Leonard,what?
17652,Leonard,can i take a look?
12464,Leonard,because i’m frodo.
20749,Leonard,"oh, hey, penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?"
20352,Leonard,"yeah, he’s on his way. time for bladder check."
19458,Leonard,"uh, guys, i found an article here that says you can do cpr on birds."
16286,Leonard,"oh, okay. so, what’s up?"
18057,Leonard,that’s actually good. why didn’t i think of that?
19288,Leonard,like i would swing with him.
17407,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no worries."
21532,Leonard,are you implementing phase two?
19815,Leonard,"uh, okay, okay. uh, we, we get it."
13441,Leonard,"no, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
18753,Leonard,"ooh, flowers and chocolates? somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties."
16748,Leonard,i’m going to a party. i’m not turning r2-d2 and c-3po over to the empire!
16835,Leonard,what are you doing?
19067,Leonard,"oh, i know his password, so i can track his phone."
14592,Leonard,"little bit, yeah."
20065,Leonard,"you know, what we did, when we were drunk."
20122,Leonard,you’re right. but what? mexican? italian? german? indian? greek? cuban? chinese? pizza? barbecue? korean? korean barbecue?
14334,Leonard,"well, what are you gonna do?"
18344,Leonard,"it was not a crisis. apparently, i favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
17726,Leonard,i’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
12640,Leonard,putting them on.
15486,Leonard,"oh, hi. hey. hi, leslie."
12326,Leonard,"well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
21211,Leonard,that is ridiculous. 
13154,Leonard,um… yes… i am… asking you out. 
20125,Leonard,"i guess. i’m just, you know, worried about sheldon."
21187,Leonard,ignore him. how did you get the baby to stop crying?
20577,Leonard,"and it helps to have small, delicate fingers. so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and howard."
20771,Leonard,no.
19779,Leonard,yes.
17408,Leonard,"oh, all right."
16836,Leonard,"hey, well, see you. i’m going out. "
20157,Leonard,"listen, i should warn you that maybe asking amy out isn’t a good idea."
15387,Leonard,"hey, you."
15750,Leonard,whoa!
17436,Leonard,"and i promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
18418,Leonard,good to know.
13440,Leonard,"laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?"
17808,Leonard,"you’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. nine, eight."
19039,Leonard,"thanks, mom."
19408,Leonard,look at these notebooks. they’re full of pages and pages of data. he clearly spent years on this.
16211,Leonard,no.
21383,Leonard,"we do have sheldon’s old room. if he really needs a place to stay, i guess we should offer it to him."
20663,Leonard,"because i am tired of him always getting his way. we don’t need a stupid meeting. we don’t even need a roommate agreement, and i hope that sandwich does cause a party."
15786,Leonard,"oh, right, sure. i wish you could stay in la a while longer."
12847,Leonard,great.
17739,Leonard,sure.
12217,Leonard,"dammit man, we’re dying here. "
19545,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
16842,Leonard,"screw it, i’m going."
19685,Leonard,"actually, your name is on the electric bill."
12607,Leonard,"i don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him? "
17920,Leonard,a thousand dollars on action figures? how can you afford that?
16095,Leonard,pretty much. except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
20590,Leonard,they bought it.
19539,Leonard,you didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
14394,Leonard,"howard, this is big science. you could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
13448,Leonard,"no, come on, now, we’re going out."
13916,Leonard,"nothing? it sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
16023,Leonard,"okay, let me see if i understand this. you want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
17905,Leonard,can i use your phone? our car got stolen.
15047,Leonard,only to shampoo professor chambourg’s shih tzu.
14837,Leonard,"yeah, no, i got it."
13618,Leonard,he’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
20333,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s pretty catchy.
17788,Leonard,"oh, before i forget, saturday i’m planning a little dungeons and dragons night with the guys."
16226,Leonard,my sister’s 38 and married.
13592,Leonard,on what?
12687,Leonard,"believe it or not, personal growth. what happened?"
15209,Leonard,"my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and i’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
20234,Leonard,how long have you known adam?
17511,Leonard,i can’t believe i shaved my stomach for this.
18669,Leonard,no.
12624,Leonard,so the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
18955,Leonard,"sorry, buddy."
18976,Leonard,i regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
15149,Leonard,"we were on our way to the chinese restaurant when we thought we saw adam west, so we followed him."
15265,Leonard,"mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. ooh, i’m up."
16319,Leonard,what’s up with the infrared cameras?
19756,Leonard,"uh, i’m just gonna be honest with the guy."
12545,Leonard,"so, we’ll just order three entrees."
12735,Leonard,thanks penny. 
12623,Leonard,"excuse me, i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. "
19485,Leonard,"well, yeah."
13223,Leonard,what secret. tell me the secret. 
19466,Leonard,i can’t do that.
17342,Leonard,uh-uh.
20836,Leonard,that still leaves me here with him.
15134,Leonard,that’s what i’m saying.
20077,Leonard,"i’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. but the good news is that i’m pretty sure i know why."
17882,Leonard,that was san diego comic-con. this is bakersfield comic-con.
13384,Leonard,"he’s irony impaired, just move on."
14109,Leonard,you’re going to need more than 11 hours.
19803,Leonard,why would i have a guy? i don’t have any money.
18597,Leonard,"but, you forget, i did ask you out in real life."
14689,Leonard,"i’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. i can’t believe they had one for dogs."
18914,Leonard,"well, if he does, i’ll see if my bear has a friend."
17146,Leonard,you know what? i don’t have to stand here and take this crap. 
12125,Leonard,really? great.
16185,Leonard,are you insane? i’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
17661,Leonard,"i don’t know what to do. i mean, the paper’s terrible. but if i tell her, she’ll know that i read it and she’ll get really mad."
13166,Leonard,"sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with penny, what happens if i blow it. "
12643,Leonard,"because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit. "
19043,Leonard,it’s nice that you called them esteemed.
20385,Leonard,"well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
21615,Leonard,"hello. oh, hi. yeah, hold on a second. i’ll get him. sheldon, it’s for you."
17294,Leonard,what are you talking about?
20864,Leonard,where did you go to school?
12156,Leonard,"well they don’t. hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
13669,Leonard,"she’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… i never slept with her, i swear!"
21491,Leonard,you’re gonna have to be more specific.
21209,Leonard,"well, hey, come on, just tell me."
16560,Leonard,do you really think you should be eating that cake?
14338,Leonard,um…
12498,Leonard,"yeah, i’m a frickin’ genius. "
18875,Leonard,aren’t you gonna ask?
21690,Leonard,"it was l. frank baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, i’m boring myself. sorry, i can’t see any of your faces right now, but i bet they look like this. uh, you know, i, i wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but i hated it. maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but i didn’t even feel like i existed at that school. and now that i think about it, i bet a lot of you feel the same way. so, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. uh, maybe you never fit in. or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. by the way, 19, and geraldine coco, wherever you are, thank you. maybe you don’t have any friends. and guess what? that’s okay. while all the popular kids are off doing whatever, i don’t know what they were doing ’cause i was never there."
12659,Leonard,"i wasn’t expecting such a crowd, i’m a little nervous. "
21092,Leonard,i’ve always been jealous of how much money raj’s family has.
16607,Leonard,let’s get ’em!
16925,Leonard,"exactly. but this is not a date. so i ask again, would you like anything?"
14073,Leonard,"yeah, well, before they went out of business, i bought 4,000 containers. i keep them in the trunk of my car."
16779,Leonard,these are delicious.
15561,Leonard,you’re in your bedroom.
15062,Leonard,"sheldon, you got a minute?"
16907,Leonard,"no, but she might think i think it’s a date even though i don’t."
19336,Leonard,got it.
16175,Leonard,she hit on me.
21688,Leonard,i don’t get it. there’s actually peanut brittle in… please go to mars.
17488,Leonard,"mm-hmm, international space station. 250 miles that way."
17830,Leonard,hey. just playing a little giant jenga here.
16720,Leonard,"yeah. it’s okay, i guess."
18011,Leonard,you know what? why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our valentine’s day?
16826,Leonard,no. we just made out a little.
13693,Leonard,"oh, no. i wish you’d told me that sooner."
13700,Leonard,"no, but that’s okay. i’ll go talk to her. want to come with?"
20162,Leonard,maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
16556,Leonard,we tried. she doesn’t get along with sheldon.
12930,Leonard,the eta meson.
15183,Leonard,"all right, it starts now."
17861,Leonard,"no, i’m not happy."
20937,Leonard,"the world may have forgotten about dance dance revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
12629,Leonard,"not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. you know, like in the classic sci-fi movie scanners?  you know, bzzz-pchew! never mind. how about this one. it says, “i know my physics, but i’m still a fun guy!”"
19063,Leonard,"well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. i’m sure he’s fine. he probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
20133,Leonard,"buddy, i know me moving in with penny feels like a big change, but it’s not."
15699,Leonard,"what about you, stuart? you have a girlfriend yet?"
19832,Leonard,"well, aliens could only play the golden record if they figured out how to build a record player."
12300,Leonard,"well, chafing, right?"
16041,Leonard,"i was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell."
20901,Leonard,is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
18563,Leonard,"come on, don’t give him a hard time."
19260,Leonard,hmm.
20452,Leonard,"i’m sorry. you’re pretty, i’m stupid. hello. uh, just checking again for hofstadter. still gonna be an hour?"
20811,Leonard,"uh, i would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be."
14159,Leonard,uh-huh. look at the comments.
17871,Leonard,i wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
20794,Leonard,"hey, i, i know things are a little rough with you and mom, but i’m really glad you’re here."
15027,Leonard,"if you don’t come out of there, i’m going to have to drag you out."
17379,Leonard,"yeah, he worships hawking."
19631,Leonard,let’s have a toast. to mrs. wolowitz. a loving mother to all of us. we’ll miss you.
14113,Leonard,why do you have to give your paper to george smoot?
12177,Leonard,o-o-o-oh! .
15044,Leonard,you understand why i’m doing this to you?
20839,Leonard,"and he can’t wait to meet you, too. can i get anyone a drink?"
21721,Leonard,what?
17445,Leonard,"no. hey, do you remember that time when i proposed to you in bed? and you were all, like, what are you doing? that was so funny. so funny."
16183,Leonard,what’s this?
20559,Leonard,what?
13173,Leonard,"oh. okay. but before you say anything, have you ever heard of schrodinger’s cat? "
20316,Leonard,whatever. can we just get back to this?
18575,Leonard,where?
12543,Leonard,we can’t order chinese food without wolowitz?
19717,Leonard,fine.
15287,Leonard,"so, go."
17094,Leonard,"uh, it means if anyone displeases me, i don’t help them set up their printer."
19210,Leonard,yeah.
13309,Leonard,"no, that’s marcie. peppermint patty’s just athletic."
15516,Leonard,"okay, come on. almost there."
18540,Leonard,"yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. on monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
16155,Leonard,"on the bright side, i don’t think president siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
21009,Leonard,so their plan for saving the earth from armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
12936,Leonard,"um, eight.  point four. "
15163,Leonard,"guys, it’s stolen. it should go back to peter jackson. he made the movies, it belongs to him."
18816,Leonard,"well, we should call her."
12516,Leonard,"she’s an enigma, raj. "
12330,Leonard,sounds yummy. i look forward to your work with bacon.
17985,Leonard,"oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have thursday night off?"
16892,Leonard,not really.
16773,Leonard,"so, mrs. cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
20589,Leonard,come on. we’re a couple of smart guys. i’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
19661,Leonard,"hey, hey. listen, i, i have a little confession to make."
16639,Leonard,"okay, so i, i, i guess i’ll just jump right in."
13846,Leonard,oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
15930,Leonard,"i’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
14455,Leonard,"man, i cannot catch a break."
16180,Leonard,"well, forget it! it’s not gonna happen."
18588,Leonard,i’m gonna do it. i’m gonna ask her out.
13769,Leonard,"see ya. ‘bye, penny. have fun. "
17264,Leonard,i never know what to do in these situations. should i give him a heads-up?
19239,Leonard,"so, i’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use maglev technology."
15639,Leonard,"okay, i got it, i got it, she’s not your girlfriend. now listen to me. i know about loneliness. i know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. when i broke up with penny, i got back into my cello, i built a bunch of model rockets, i got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
19697,Leonard,can we please just stop talking about it?
13878,Leonard,can i whistle?
16524,Leonard,i’m fine. that’s nice that they’re getting along.
20053,Leonard,i’m not being weird. am i being weird?
21767,Leonard,i like it.
14951,Leonard,"no, not at all. let me help you with this stuff."
20563,Leonard,what? is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
15275,Leonard,"no, no, it’s fine. i don’t care. i’m over it."
17266,Leonard,"uh, listen, i heard that bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
17181,Leonard,i called your dad. i asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. this seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
17974,Leonard,"cut to the chase, sheldon."
13885,Leonard,"sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency?"
12748,Leonard,"yeah, i got it, sheldon, why?"
15366,Leonard,okeydoke.
15079,Leonard,"sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
19447,Leonard,"what about when you flipped the mars rover, or lost koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
19681,Leonard,but it’s an expression of our love.
21589,Leonard,"what, what, what, what, what? "
12524,Leonard,so? 
15066,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon."
21289,Leonard,"you know, i do have a way to get him out of our hair. i’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time."
14977,Leonard,great. good night.
20015,Leonard,everything all right?
21409,Leonard,"you are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
20704,Leonard,how come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
20083,Leonard,"yeah? that’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."
15959,Leonard,ba-ba-ba-ba. are you sure you want to include him in this?
12694,Leonard,"yes, i did. "
18395,Leonard,"it’s nine o’clock, where you been?"
14389,Leonard,"sheldon, what are the words i can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
19976,Leonard,and it’s the happiest day of our lives.
19620,Leonard,i can’t believe they did that.
15324,Leonard,"and don’t let him go on space mountain after he eats. he’ll say he can handle it, but i promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
18880,Leonard,"you know what, why don’t you just do it? you’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?"
14891,Leonard,what?
14992,Leonard,looks like wolowitz got the net electrified.
18829,Leonard,"no, no, no. this is not a fight. i was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. now it’s a fight."
18198,Leonard,"hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. we just started."
13988,Leonard,"you know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
14766,Leonard,always is a long time. sure. always.
13723,Leonard,huh.
20258,Leonard,what brought this on?
17631,Leonard,"hello, boys."
17441,Leonard,it was the heat of the moment.
13857,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
14882,Leonard,i just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than i do.
17843,Leonard,what do you guys think i should do?
12384,Leonard,"gee, uh…"
13243,Leonard,you went out and bought linen?
19327,Leonard,"wow, donkey kong. this, this was my game when i was a kid."
21098,Leonard,do not tell wolowitz.
17025,Leonard,here’s your cocoa.
14603,Leonard,are you sure?
19157,Leonard,"yeah, toddlers do that."
19219,Leonard,"hey. so, the guys and i are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. i just wanted to know if that’s okay. you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday."
16632,Leonard,i can’t do that.
15723,Leonard,"all right, well, let me see if i can explain your situation using physics. what would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
16708,Leonard,"yeah, every night for the last month."
17645,Leonard,it’s crunchy. just the way i like it.
17571,Leonard,high-energy lasers.
19293,Leonard,"not a problem. i grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what i think love looks like."
18579,Leonard,and i’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
15557,Leonard,"well, okay, with the indian food, the pizza, the thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
18601,Leonard,the end.
19795,Leonard,i’m always excited for you. i’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
16271,Leonard,hey. i thought you were with your new buddies.
18138,Leonard,no. we cannot lose to that jerk.
13657,Leonard,"okay, i’ll be right in."
19452,Leonard,"no, no, no. no, raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
12569,Leonard,"no, never mind, alright, go. "
17606,Leonard,so?
17826,Leonard,"this is weird, right?"
15123,Leonard,hey. guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on thursday?
13472,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not going to learn morse code at three o’clock in the morning!"
18728,Leonard,"sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
18227,Leonard,couple of weeks.
17251,Leonard,fine.
16108,Leonard,"okay, when you say make the best of it."
12101,Leonard,which is?
18206,Leonard,yeah.
19261,Leonard,huh. what is this?
20516,Leonard,"well, just don’t get anything jurassic. he feels like that whole chunk of time has gone hollywood. hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking batman was coming to his party."
13748,Leonard,"actually, i was…"
12982,Leonard,so?
12245,Leonard,thank you. . shall i count down from three?
12892,Leonard,yes.
14806,Leonard,"i am here, right? you see me."
16670,Leonard,"well, you stay as long as you’d like."
12186,Leonard,how did she know it was us?
18864,Leonard,it was. by terminator.
21307,Leonard,"it’s classified. if we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble."
21567,Leonard,and you actually got in a pool?
21237,Leonard,what do you say?
20070,Leonard,what else would it be?
16117,Leonard,true dat.
12062,Leonard,"wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
13609,Leonard,"uh, sheldon?"
19353,Leonard,"and while you’re at it, i know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to."
16861,Leonard,"hey, amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
14313,Leonard,or nobody calls anyone.
15466,Leonard,"come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
19952,Leonard,doesn’t sound very romantic.
15300,Leonard,"oh, just come in!"
18904,Leonard,"oh, yeah. wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?"
12265,Leonard,cos it’s not carved in stone.
17874,Leonard,"oh, would you stop worrying about that?"
20950,Leonard,"hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here."
19192,Leonard,"hey, here’s a thought. why don’t we put up the rest of the money that stuart needs?"
14665,Leonard,"penny, i like all sorts of people. in fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."
17011,Leonard,the newcomb medal.
15315,Leonard,"me neither. oh, sheldon seemed think that i would be upset about you hanging out with him. but i just want you to know it’s fine."
16515,Leonard,have you met bernadette’s parents?
16673,Leonard,"well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, i can tell you that."
16255,Leonard,yeah?
12935,Leonard,"sorry, i panicked. "
15812,Leonard,you?
17293,Leonard,"excuse us for a second. sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. he’s a barber."
16854,Leonard,"okay, uh, here it is. i met this girl and i kissed her, and i feel terrible about it. but it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. and i am so, so sorry."
14720,Leonard,"okay, not to be pedantic, but the last i checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which i think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
17580,Leonard,where are we going?
14262,Leonard,"god, i hope not. and no, i’m not princess leia."
17232,Leonard,you say thank you.
20711,Leonard,"all right, here goes nothing."
18685,Leonard,"no, no, no, no. i take it back. don’t say it. just, just hate me, but stay with me. it worked for my parents."
16660,Leonard,who wants the last dumpling?
15895,Leonard,who’s there?
13506,Leonard,"oh, i’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it."
15567,Leonard,that’s how i’m going to make it look.
14086,Leonard,"it’s just for my notebooks. thanks, penny."
16911,Leonard,can’t argue with that. i’ll get the tickets.
17869,Leonard,sheldon threw us all under the bus.
19881,Leonard,"a, surprised you know that. b, i wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you."
13947,Leonard,"no, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. i, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
19960,Leonard,"okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
20996,Leonard,i am.
16369,Leonard,"hold on, you’re thinking of going there?"
13643,Leonard,"oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
15991,Leonard,do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
13659,Leonard,good night.
16628,Leonard,yep.
15531,Leonard,tough break. you want eggs?
15837,Leonard,yeah.
21196,Leonard,i quoted your favourite nsync song.
13473,Leonard,"don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t  aw! what’s going on?"
12866,Leonard,like what? we can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  
20153,Leonard,"oh. i hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her."
19890,Leonard,"if you could run out and get a phd, that might make her like you."
18908,Leonard,"that doesn’t work any more. he just thinks i’m taking him to the doctor. so, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
21380,Leonard,"oh, how about we compromise and go on the small world ride at disneyland?"
18811,Leonard,"well, it’s always me, take one for the team."
19641,Leonard,should we call howard and bernadette?
12993,Leonard,those are movies.
15962,Leonard,yeah. they do that when you set it on easy.
17877,Leonard,"okay, come with me."
12614,Leonard,who’s running the red corvette?
20548,Leonard,"well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda."
20652,Leonard,"people are coming over, it looked fun."
14011,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i didn’t hear anything after lick."
12392,Leonard,are you sure?
14732,Leonard,and then i say one little thing and i end up being the bad guy!
16958,Leonard,couple of weirdos. why?
12166,Leonard,it’s a joke.
19023,Leonard,i’m not sure. just feels a little anticlimactic.
18917,Leonard,i don’t know. i heard you reading pretty loud last night.
12628,Leonard,ah!
18841,Leonard,"it’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing."
13375,Leonard,yes.
18501,Leonard,there’s a principle at stake.
16999,Leonard,i didn’t have clams.
12416,Leonard,wha… how did it get on the internet?
15011,Leonard,sorry. i’m moving a little slow. i think i bruised my coccyx.
19092,Leonard,morning.
18876,Leonard,"yeah. i had higher hopes for a movie called serial ape-ist 2: monkey see, monkey kill. you know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie."
17560,Leonard,all i said was she seems nice.
18342,Leonard,"seriously, please find another book."
16085,Leonard,"i’m telling you, the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner meets a real need. we’ve got a hit."
17989,Leonard,"hey, you coming to lunch?"
20422,Leonard,"come on, you pain in the ass."
14021,Leonard,you don’t have to. ever.
18515,Leonard,i think you’re the one who fell over.
16268,Leonard,"aw, hell, i miss him."
19064,Leonard,"anyway, as i was saying, sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘cause that’s important. not just for him, but for most anybody, really."
13650,Leonard,you hacked my facebook account?
16873,Leonard, amy. bye.
14450,Leonard,"because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. there was even a plan. we were going to throw his kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
12538,Leonard,leonard. 
19629,Leonard,"how are you doing, stuart?"
17978,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon. i can’t help you. oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face."
21734,Leonard,what is that?
12931,Leonard,prevost’s theory of exchanges. 
16715,Leonard,it’s from game of thrones. what do you think?
17004,Leonard,"no, you’re not. you’re here to see if i get my underwear pulled over my head."
14972,Leonard,what do you want?
20962,Leonard,and who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
12897,Leonard,"sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. "
16768,Leonard,"uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
17982,Leonard,hmm?
20855,Leonard,hi. 
18370,Leonard,"i’ll try, but i might be sad again tonight."
17089,Leonard,"so, polly, tell me about yourself."
16331,Leonard,"oh, okay, it’s not important. it can wait."
18764,Leonard,okay. koothrappali was right. we should have let her watch.
21293,Leonard,okay. where were we?
13295,Leonard,"sorry leslie, i guess i prefer my space stringy not loopy."
14650,Leonard,"yeah, great."
20661,Leonard,you’re being ridiculous.
13241,Leonard,"can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
21153,Leonard,it’s hard to believe howard’s having a kid.
20877,Leonard,"sure, i’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
15731,Leonard,"to be clear, i meant like bernadette, not your mother."
12122,Leonard,we’re home.
20240,Leonard,you have a will?
16450,Leonard,you might not want to do that.
14179,Leonard,why would you just say something like that?
12042,Leonard,hi.
13865,Leonard,"okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, i’m gonna go get a hot pretzel."
21535,Leonard,"she might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything."
13632,Leonard,by making constipated moose sounds?
12561,Leonard,who are you calling?
18570,Leonard,he asked me.
16430,Leonard,marry you?
17434,Leonard,mm-hmm.
17924,Leonard,"well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in the avengers."
21311,Leonard,"well, sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all."
21225,Leonard,"i don’t want to play a game, sheldon."
20662,Leonard,can you please talk to him?
13205,Leonard,what? 
14242,Leonard,"and you guys are going together, great…"
15078,Leonard,"yeah. we also put in what happens if one of us wins a macarthur grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
13277,Leonard,it changed.
14922,Leonard,how did we get actual women?
20201,Leonard,i don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a mexican standoff. what are we gonna do here?
12144,Leonard,"okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. i guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves."
12564,Leonard,"now, raj, kill sheldon."
18513,Leonard,the math is all there. it’s not real.
13163,Leonard,i’m going to talk anyway.
19714,Leonard,of course.
12411,Leonard,who wouldn’t? 
18600,Leonard,"oh, hold on."
12749,Leonard,oh…!
16509,Leonard,here we go.
18708,Leonard,"oh, how many times do i have to say it? i support you."
18630,Leonard,"i know, but you’re going to be a tv star and you haven’t left me yet. that takes guts."
17128,Leonard,yes.
20027,Leonard,i’m not glowing. i’m upset.
19738,Leonard,it could be.
20727,Leonard,what’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
14211,Leonard,"i had to, she called me cutie."
16310,Leonard,she completely understood everything i said. case closed.
13004,Leonard,"look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
18922,Leonard,sure. what’s up?
21327,Leonard,hey.
13287,Leonard,right 
20296,Leonard,sure you did.
15554,Leonard,"and for rajesh koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken mcnuggets."
14778,Leonard,"i can feel it. i can feel the earth moving. it’s moving too fast. raj, slow it down."
19873,Leonard,"greetings, distinguished cheerleaders."
17567,Leonard,"so, alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?"
17245,Leonard,"that tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, i got my money, let’s spend it up…"
13581,Leonard,"that’s a good idea. there’s a bed in there, and i’m very, very, very pro-bed."
14874,Leonard,"okay, sorry."
17778,Leonard,that should lighten the mood.
19257,Leonard,"yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost."
18573,Leonard,"sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
21312,Leonard,no.
18095,Leonard,"yeah, cool."
13503,Leonard,just eat.
12197,Leonard,oh.
12835,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything."
19472,Leonard,no.
20553,Leonard,"or, if we ended up making money from this, sheldon and i could split our shares with you."
18812,Leonard,fancy sounds like a compliment.
17088,Leonard,"hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? see how that goes."
17204,Leonard,i don’t care. i’m done.
20837,Leonard,hello.
13134,Leonard,huh. okay. but my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. 
12204,Leonard,"it is an inefficient design, for example penny has a flat screen tv, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
20562,Leonard,you guys all right?
18475,Leonard,"uh, if i still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
20216,Leonard,let’s not jump to conclusions. a lot of things start with u.
14142,Leonard,let’s go. we’re going to miss the coming attractions.
15532,Leonard,what’s a dogapus?
19414,Leonard,"i think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman. "
17168,Leonard,"okay, bug report taken. next time i will have a better plan for our evening’s activity."
14926,Leonard,"oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? they don’t let just anyone have a web site."
15243,Leonard,no.
19358,Leonard,"he’s right, i was thinking of the lower flermin."
18521,Leonard,"penny, you know those are real, right?"
19737,Leonard,sure.
19814,Leonard,really?
16726,Leonard,nope. maybe another time.
20712,Leonard,"fine. preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing."
14974,Leonard,"it’s getting scary here, too."
15428,Leonard,"not only did sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. or the police. or homeland security."
13750,Leonard,i was working with dave underhill.
12145,Leonard,why not?
18210,Leonard,"hey, you guys have been in there for a while. you doing okay?"
18493,Leonard,really?
12077,Leonard,the worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
18074,Leonard,"mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up."
12381,Leonard,i thought you weren’t interested in me.
12961,Leonard,aaaa-aw! 
13319,Leonard,"penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair."
20592,Leonard,"hey, you were right."
13724,Leonard,"nothing, just rethinking my whole life. okay, here’s the thing, i’m afraid that if i ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me."
15954,Leonard,it’s not difficult for me. i’m having fun.
18711,Leonard,can we please have some privacy?
20009,Leonard,i do.
20862,Leonard,hi.
16130,Leonard,"oh, sheldon changed the password. it’s now penny is a freeloader. no spaces."
20010,Leonard,"yeah, i’m so glad you guys could watch."
20152,Leonard,"well, good. it’s nice to see your mind off amy."
15319,Leonard,i just took him for shoes.
12945,Leonard,bring it on.
15058,Leonard,"actually, professor norton can’t make it. he threw his back out rock climbing."
15229,Leonard,"oh, my god. i’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote yoda. i love you, penny."
19563,Leonard,you wrote a paper on my idea?
12092,Leonard,"save it for your blog, howard."
20451,Leonard,a lot of attitude from the woman who thought mc squared was a rapper.
18267,Leonard,yep. here’s some money.
13634,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sakes."
15102,Leonard,"well, forget it. i was the one who was invited, i get to decide who goes with me, and it’s penny, not you!"
12338,Leonard,"mum’s the word. sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to gablehauser and get your job back."
16820,Leonard,"so, you’re okay talking about this?"
19851,Leonard,"okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be."
21562,Leonard,"eh, i’m worth it."
21379,Leonard,yeah. maybe you and i can do something fun that weekend.
16324,Leonard,"or as you probably call it back home, food."
12585,Leonard,"look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. "
14416,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s me."
21344,Leonard,"we don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
14567,Leonard,yes.
16860,Leonard,"fine. what would you like to talk about, sheldon?"
21351,Leonard,"okay, so this is the main comic-con floor. it’s where all the vendors and exhibits are."
17536,Leonard,why would i be interested? i have penny.
20171,Leonard,what are we going to do?
20193,Leonard,"before i answer, may i just say your skin has never looked better."
13787,Leonard,smooth.
15594,Leonard,this is ridiculous. you’re just making stuff up.
20455,Leonard,what are you gonna say?
15526,Leonard,i don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
20501,Leonard,i’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
21577,Leonard,"you don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… god, that’s a good song. "
13186,Leonard,goodnight.  
18783,Leonard,additional data. you dog.
14626,Leonard,are you kidding? i couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
12672,Leonard,you cannot blow up my head with your mind. 
20363,Leonard,i’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. what would i say is wrong with me?
18468,Leonard,"boy, you will not let this go, will you? oh, jeez."
16738,Leonard,"it never is, is it?"
17894,Leonard,i’ll set the timer.
17489,Leonard,"you know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. the water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine."
16702,Leonard,are you gonna eat that whole pie?
20827,Leonard,i’m glad you decided to stay. it’s gonna be special for penny and me to share this with you.
17038,Leonard,you remember sheldon and raj and howard.
19267,Leonard,"aw, oh, thank you. that is so sweet."
14255,Leonard,i thought you were good at this. you’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
13070,Leonard,"nothing, just catching up. by the way, may i speak to missy please? "
19654,Leonard,why not?
13538,Leonard,"okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy."
13130,Leonard,"okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that i need to know the details of your sex life, i just thought…. never mind. "
20145,Leonard,what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard?
13773,Leonard,maybe i heard you wrong. a lot of words sound like yoga.
15230,Leonard,you’re welcome. i just wanted to put that out there.
15801,Leonard,use your best judgement.
13096,Leonard,"alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
16688,Leonard,"once again, i, i’m really not much of a dancer."
17758,Leonard,"all right, you brought this on yourself. sheldon, get him."
19021,Leonard,"so is that it? are, are we engaged?"
17682,Leonard,i’m sorry. i was just trying to help.
17053,Leonard,"sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party."
20251,Leonard,nirsh.
18287,Leonard,bye.
14751,Leonard,what? who would tell you something like that? why would you tell her something like that?
21370,Leonard,"if you want to drive, just drive. i don’t see why this has to be so complicated."
12244,Leonard,can you define the parameters of the kiss?
13161,Leonard,i don’t think i can go out with her tonight. 
12093,Leonard,"uh, there it goes, it sticks, i’m sorry."
21345,Leonard,"no. which will make me miserable, which is usually sheldon’s job."
16948,Leonard,"okay. so, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
19684,Leonard,yeah.
14385,Leonard,maybe.
15188,Leonard,"last one holding the ring decides its fate. i know, it sounds silly."
13007,Leonard,not for long.
15132,Leonard,whoa! what do you mean all?
18626,Leonard,i bet that bit killed at the chuckle hut.
20169,Leonard,just tell me.
19655,Leonard,hey.
16053,Leonard,okay. you need to get clear on this right now. i am in charge of this project.
12755,Leonard,yeah! funny how things work out. 
13973,Leonard,yes.
17139,Leonard,"yeah, it’s all good. we-we’ll always have feelings for each other."
20277,Leonard,"well, we’re having everyone over."
16719,Leonard,just bilbo baggins’ sword over there.
20148,Leonard,this is easy. i didn’t need to wear a cup.
12063,Leonard,"oh, okay. i love cheesecake."
18686,Leonard,"oh. oh, okay. good, good. so, it’s cool if i cry a little?"
18266,Leonard,"and, oh, that’s me getting rescued after i fell in."
20745,Leonard,who are these people?
14430,Leonard,it was at least five mississippis. a standard hug is two mississippis tops.
13584,Leonard,hey.
16033,Leonard,"um, i guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there."
17879,Leonard,"hey, will you steam my uniform next?"
15591,Leonard,"uh, a blt where the b stands for beaver? i don’t know."
17651,Leonard,"great topic. i can help with that. there are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political."
14395,Leonard,yes.
19129,Leonard,"well, that’s not your fault."
19780,Leonard,this is exciting.
17908,Leonard,"okay, he gets how cool it is."
14270,Leonard,"okay, let’s see. are you from a tv series?"
15299,Leonard,"oh, we really need to get you a girl."
13464,Leonard,why? what are they doing?
21132,Leonard,"sheldon, get out here."
12852,Leonard,pretty sure.
19070,Leonard,he’s at the train station.
14426,Leonard,you really think so?
15961,Leonard,"oh, b-be careful. give him some line. okay, now reel him in."
16098,Leonard,i can vouch for that.
16566,Leonard,mmm. mmm.
14437,Leonard,dinner’s ready!
17976,Leonard,"well, too late, pal. i’m not going anywhere. penny and i are very happy living together. isn’t that right?"
16306,Leonard,"sure, that has birds in it."
12741,Leonard,why not? 
14984,Leonard,"sorry, let me help you."
21074,Leonard,"hey, i’m trying to help you."
14989,Leonard,"great, you do that."
19769,Leonard,that part was pretty good.
13293,Leonard,"okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
14733,Leonard,"what am i supposed to say? sure, penny, i’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. well, leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because i’m penny and i’m pretty and i can do whatever the hell i want! oh, i get it! you think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! no, no, leonard! i’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
17966,Leonard,"please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat."
13782,Leonard,really? why would you say that?
13498,Leonard,yes.
12767,Leonard,what the hell are you doing?
19136,Leonard,might be something to think about.
16028,Leonard,then what are you?
20884,Leonard,"so, what are you guys gonna do today?"
13855,Leonard,hold on. i put some real work into that!
12587,Leonard,his mom’s been saying that for years. what’s up?
19678,Leonard,"well, we did it."
20391,Leonard,let me refresh your memory.
15787,Leonard,"you know, i was thinking, there are some great research facilities in india."
17794,Leonard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves in the smoking remains of santa’s village. clearly, a great battle has taken place."
12967,Leonard,"oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs. "
12034,Leonard,should we have invited her for lunch?
19173,Leonard,"yeah, that scares me, too."
18371,Leonard,leave it alone. that’s my girlfriend.
15489,Leonard,"uh, not bad. you remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
15033,Leonard,what are you talking about?
18732,Leonard,"look, even your friend wil wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
18833,Leonard,"i’m so sorry. i know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?"
17759,Leonard,good boy. here’s a cookie.
12266,Leonard,i’ll get my chisel.
19806,Leonard,"that would be great, thank you."
18714,Leonard,"i swear, i am on your side. "
12382,Leonard,you mean my cello?
13082,Leonard,"oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. i got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
15941,Leonard,see? he doesn’t mind.
14721,Leonard,what was your first clue?
15303,Leonard,what do you want?
15177,Leonard,no jet skis.
18254,Leonard,what was what?
17466,Leonard,i played that pretty well. 
20519,Leonard,can i get his contact info?
20212,Leonard,"the dealer doesn’t care, kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. help me hook this up."
19397,Leonard,"okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, i didn’t even want you there."
17455,Leonard,"you mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
19840,Leonard,yeah. penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
12431,Leonard,a party? 
16089,Leonard,"then i guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of l.a. on your flying pig."
21158,Leonard,i’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. that was a big milestone for me.
19490,Leonard,"okay. and to defend, i roll two sixes. i win."
20790,Leonard,"i know, and there’s no excuse for that."
13790,Leonard,merry christmas.
12243,Leonard,"you mean, kiss you now?"
15147,Leonard,"uh, well, we didn’t actually get chinese food."
17018,Leonard,sheldon.
16998,Leonard,thanks.
13268,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s a date, i have a date coming over."
17435,Leonard,"oh, great."
14536,Leonard,sorry. i haven’t given her your schedule yet.
12950,Leonard,"no, a time machine from sophie’s choice. "
14643,Leonard,"kites, ho!"
17809,Leonard,"seven, six."
18968,Leonard,"the toys were holding hands in a furnace. look, arthur lived a full life. and he inspired a lot of people. sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that i got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift."
12799,Leonard,oh great.
20181,Leonard,how does he get the helium?
14045,Leonard,just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
19702,Leonard,does it have a camera in it?
19859,Leonard,nope. it’s pretty exciting.
14094,Leonard,wow. teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now.
19649,Leonard,here it is. there’s a black light.
19998,Leonard,"oh, don’t worry. they gave me this vibrating coaster."
20408,Leonard,"oh, great. do that."
16462,Leonard,"morning, sheldon."
14544,Leonard,wow!
16312,Leonard,"is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?"
19124,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go with human resources?"
12309,Leonard,the poor guy on the bike. i had a nice time.
18082,Leonard,as is the company.
18582,Leonard,but it is what you got me last year.
18150,Leonard,it just makes things seem small. it diminishes them.
12984,Leonard,can i go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
12469,Leonard,maybe they just want to be friends. 
12395,Leonard,"oh, hi."
12351,Leonard,sounds like a wise man.
21054,Leonard,"oh, so she’s an astronomer?"
13433,Leonard,"no, he lives here now."
18683,Leonard,okay.
19666,Leonard,"okay, uh, well, i hope it’s fun. i mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic."
16647,Leonard,"yes, ma’am."
18703,Leonard,"oh, how’s it going? you taking hollywood by storm?"
12489,Leonard,i’m fine. 
20569,Leonard,"if there was a nobel prize for millennium falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set."
12768,Leonard,with lime jello?
16549,Leonard,"bernadette, that’s great. howard, do you make a buttload?"
17864,Leonard,come here. tell you a secret?
21657,Leonard,"uh-oh, that’s priya."
15070,Leonard,uh-huh.
15739,Leonard,what do you want to do?
20986,Leonard,oh. you think he’s your first autograph?
16086,Leonard,what’s he doing in your apartment?
13647,Leonard,what for?
18802,Leonard,"i know, but…"
15926,Leonard,a big kiss. on the mouth.
16196,Leonard,"i’m sure i would. but why, why, exactly?"
13234,Leonard,that doesn’t matter to me at all.
14912,Leonard,"wait a minute, what are you talking about? what inappropriate behaviour?"
21234,Leonard,hey.
14858,Leonard,it’s up to you. he didn’t call your experiment stupid.
19835,Leonard,they zip him up in that bag.
14335,Leonard,"so, what do you need us for?"
15718,Leonard,"look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
15383,Leonard,"no, that’s okay. it was something else keeping me up last night. and again this morning. and, i didn’t mind. i was up last night. i was up this morning. i didn’t mind. those are your clues."
20694,Leonard,that’s different. i’m like the little girl in poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the tv.
16387,Leonard,does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
21288,Leonard,you’re kidding.
17527,Leonard,why?
18274,Leonard,"come on, this is silly. hey, um, i brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? it’s that sailor cap that you wanted. it’s neat, huh?"
21296,Leonard,colonel williams. sir.
13559,Leonard,"got it. so, can i see you again?"
15398,Leonard,"thanks. it’s really hard to find these in his size. so, listen. i’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
20190,Leonard,remember? don’t ask too many questions?
16323,Leonard,is it racist that i took you to an indian restaurant?
12096,Leonard,"a favour? sure, you can ask me a favour, i would do you a favour for you."
18731,Leonard,"did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a marie callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
15512,Leonard,"you do what you want, i’m not touching another man’s honey tree."
20982,Leonard,"yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck."
18103,Leonard,"mm, not really."
15871,Leonard,i feel awful.
12229,Leonard,"no, i’m not jealous, i’m just a little concerned for her. i didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with."
17718,Leonard,"come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you."
14175,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s not that bad."
17423,Leonard,"all right, let me rephrase the question. why are you wearing long underwear?"
12383,Leonard,no kidding?
19357,Leonard,"oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. try not to touch it when you’re dancing."
20401,Leonard,"yes. and howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay."
16489,Leonard,sorry.
14283,Leonard,"okay, uh, if i get lucky i’ll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city, and if you get lucky, i’ll sleep on the moon."
21473,Leonard,nice try. i’m not going.
18945,Leonard,"yeah, she does."
14412,Leonard,"oh, a blanket."
17540,Leonard,this is ridiculous. are we gonna play cards or not?
12261,Leonard,us guys?
12405,Leonard,yeah. 
18954,Leonard,i just read online that arthur jeffries passed away.
12731,Leonard,i don’t know what to say.
17505,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m sorry. let’s watch the game. "
15386,Leonard,"okay, i’ll give you one more clue. it involved another person."
12029,Leonard,hi.
21489,Leonard,"mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
20114,Leonard,i spent the night in mexico with sheldon.
16918,Leonard,really? you would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
17169,Leonard,"oh, wait, here, almost forgot. here."
13545,Leonard,"you’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic."
17349,Leonard,"all right, i think we got them all. let’s divide up the loot."
18506,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i am out of options. video store owner, nursis manookian, has no next of kin."
16843,Leonard,do you mind? i’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
18586,Leonard,you don’t know that. i’ve been going to the cheesecake factory for years. i could have picked her up.  
12859,Leonard,"that won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
19876,Leonard,a cap and gown? why do i need a cap and gown?
13379,Leonard,just sit down and eat.
17814,Leonard,i don’t know. what’s the difference?
15353,Leonard,"oh, . i think any university would want you. except, of course, any university that had already had you. because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
12971,Leonard,"let’s just do this. guys, ready to push?"
18915,Leonard,how you feeling?
18316,Leonard,"you’re really mean, you know that?"
11999,Leonard,"okay, maybe later."
18541,Leonard,why won’t you sign it?
20622,Leonard,i’ve never played that before.
20405,Leonard,not this time.
21246,Leonard,and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon? cool.
17258,Leonard,"absolutely not. if i’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with ryan gosling, then leonard gots to get paid. so, you think about us getting married?"
19829,Leonard,"whatever. there’s no alphas here, and this is your project. you’re in charge. how do you want to start?"
21130,Leonard,"uh, theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
13989,Leonard,that was fast.
16223,Leonard,really?
21439,Leonard,thank you. i…
16620,Leonard,a hobby?
20541,Leonard,"uh, professor hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together."
13576,Leonard,"oh, you know, i’m a physicist, so, i thought about stuff."
12673,Leonard,you were trying to blow up my head.
18466,Leonard,"he did bite me once. but in his defence, i came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
19362,Leonard,"oh, it’s all right. we ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…"
21769,Leonard,but i said no to that.
15934,Leonard,what? why?
18647,Leonard,hey. can we talk?
13317,Leonard,"okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
16540,Leonard,hell hounds.
18346,Leonard,"actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because indy had the medallion. without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
14008,Leonard,you know what the saddest part was?
17844,Leonard,"hey, pretty lady."
21461,Leonard,you understood the math?
16542,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t."
19944,Leonard,shut up.
14247,Leonard,should we talk to some of these women?
16749,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, we’re going to wil’s. this is your last chance."
12373,Leonard,"what did penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
13462,Leonard,wait for me.
19622,Leonard,and how could a chimp even solve that? that was impossible.
12819,Leonard,no! 
19082,Leonard,you know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
16954,Leonard,"you do? because if that’s what you like, i can be that guy. i swear, i’ll be anything you want me to be."
13437,Leonard,"excuse me. sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
20642,Leonard,"well, that is the grown-up thing."
18796,Leonard,"oh, hang on. check your in-box."
21043,Leonard,yeah? what are you keeping?
14546,Leonard,"come on, you guys, let it go."
13779,Leonard,my leg is killing me. thanks for asking.
13376,Leonard,yes.
14772,Leonard,too bad sheldon couldn’t come with us.
15920,Leonard,"okay, i think a bit of context here might help."
14239,Leonard,i don’t need any insights. i just want to know why penny’s more interested in stuart than me. we’re practically the same guy.
13197,Leonard,you could be batman?
17180,Leonard,"all right, fair enough. i certainly can be quieter when we kiss. i thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? uh, uh, i’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? nah, never mind, it’s right here."
12821,Leonard,wait! penny! take me with you!  
17422,Leonard,do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
19208,Leonard,yeah.
19207,Leonard,"well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. it seems like something we should talk about."
14351,Leonard,great. so how’d it go with stuart last night?
20693,Leonard,"oh, yes, you do. you know you have a weird brother-sister-elliott-e.t. relationship with him."
12595,Leonard,what happened?
18193,Leonard,it’s gonna get crazy.
15036,Leonard,"so, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
18491,Leonard,"i’m telling you, try the hanger."
17321,Leonard,"w-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. no hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
12432,Leonard,"yeah, i don’t know, penny…"
14419,Leonard,"yeah, that’s very comforting."
16363,Leonard,"good, good. i’ll tell you what happens."
17334,Leonard,i’d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems if i wasn’t in shock that sheldon has girl problems.
19982,Leonard,why not?
14474,Leonard,i can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
13084,Leonard,hey. 
20254,Leonard,thank you.
19676,Leonard,"right there, right there, oh, god, that’s it."
16350,Leonard,not the kind with access to drugs.
17888,Leonard,"i’m turning it on, but just to shut you up."
19121,Leonard,and you thought they all had a silver lining.
17042,Leonard,what was i supposed to do? he needed a place to sleep it off.
20256,Leonard,"ah, well, what’s this? a pot of oatmeal? or, thanks to you, what i will now call gloatmeal."
19585,Leonard,"well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level."
18269,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon. i should’ve told you i was back. i just wanted to have a couple days alone with penny."
15293,Leonard,"i do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. and she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
16341,Leonard,"well, now hold on, how about this? how about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
12688,Leonard,no you don’t. no he doesn’t.
17773,Leonard,what i don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
20918,Leonard,you just shaved yesterday. you’re good for three months.
15414,Leonard,"no, i didn’t just move in. first we had to iron out a few details. "
17923,Leonard,"aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. look at my face. do i look smug? i feel smug."
13199,Leonard,"hey, penny, if you’re not doing anything friday night i thought maybe we could go and see a movie. "
13201,Leonard,"great. so you just let me know when you know. so…  oh god, i am the bad fish! what did i do wrong?"
14819,Leonard,let’s keep thinking.
12550,Leonard,"wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth."
20524,Leonard,"i’m sold, you’re ahead of bale."
21085,Leonard,"if it helps, i’m questioning your life choices, too."
21229,Leonard,"i would pull this car over and kick you out, but if penny dumps me, you’re all i got. "
20746,Leonard,what are you guys doing?
14861,Leonard,"when we watch frosty the snowman, he roots for the sun."
12473,Leonard,no. i’m going to assert my dominance face to face. 
14141,Leonard,cheeseburger. i get a cheeseburger.
16039,Leonard,can you say that and not make it sound like i’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
21103,Leonard,"oh, yeah. the mr. spock cuckoo clock."
12463,Leonard,why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
15940,Leonard,"hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? cause i’m good with that."
20917,Leonard,it’s only for five weeks.
14251,Leonard,i think blinky’s cute.
14707,Leonard,this is just half? we’ve been here for hours.
20720,Leonard,hey.
16467,Leonard,"they’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
19837,Leonard,"all right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple."
14900,Leonard,that’s a lousy conversation starter.
17431,Leonard,check it out. it’s the gas i use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. but it also has an interesting secondary use. here. breathe this in.
13768,Leonard,"actually, science is my lady."
19330,Leonard,"next game, let’s switch helmets."
19251,Leonard,it’s late. we’ve wasted hours. can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
14252,Leonard,"wait, so we just go over there?"
13889,Leonard,why?
20329,Leonard,thank you.
19742,Leonard,"if we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
17691,Leonard,and you?
19193,Leonard,it’s kind of a dream come true.
15034,Leonard,"yeah, i’m going to need a little more."
21546,Leonard,"all right, let me start again. uh, you and amy…"
13396,Leonard,and?
17097,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what did i say?"
20016,Leonard,just tell me.
21481,Leonard,"if you’re that upset, go get her back."
15613,Leonard,i think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the shamy could go on for years.
15273,Leonard,i’m pretty sure it’s already over.
12287,Leonard,i can’t because if i don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
13598,Leonard,"oh, hey, guys."
20103,Leonard,"yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
13171,Leonard,thank you. you look very nice.
14277,Leonard,"great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
20812,Leonard,"penny, i’ve always known i loved you, but this last year has shown me that i also love being married to you. thank you for saying yes."
18693,Leonard,do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
14836,Leonard,"hey, look, it’s howard and his girlfriend bernadette."
13318,Leonard,"well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
16473,Leonard,really?
16389,Leonard,"uh, i kind of told her i was working."
12505,Leonard,"so, if you don’t like this christie, why are you letting her stay? "
14259,Leonard,"actually, you can. there’s a whole sport built around it. falconry."
12247,Leonard,none?
15722,Leonard,"well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
13595,Leonard,does that change things?
18989,Leonard,"now, about that second proposal. on the one hand…"
16192,Leonard,oh.
20366,Leonard,what if i get caught?
14001,Leonard,you can’t let her get into your head.
18077,Leonard,"i’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. penny and i just want to do something low-key. you know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres."
18589,Leonard,watch me.
15879,Leonard,"actually, you don’t have insomnia. you’re sleeping now."
14902,Leonard,i want that too. why are you here?
19075,Leonard,seriously? you don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
12371,Leonard,"lesley? no, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
13732,Leonard,"yeah, stephanie got it for me. it’s kind of fun."
12200,Leonard,six two inch dowels.
16651,Leonard,"no, no! no-no-no! the screen froze. it’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
18927,Leonard,"great, what do you want to do?"
14174,Leonard,"sorry. my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford, new jersey."
14076,Leonard,"yeah, buddy?"
14543,Leonard,it’s a… 
16079,Leonard,"howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
12446,Leonard,all i’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny to see me as a member of her peer group. a potential close friend and… perhaps more. i don’t want to look like a dork. 
15545,Leonard,"there’s no cholera in pasadena. just like last summer, when there was no malaria in pasadena."
15020,Leonard,"hello. yeah, i’m leonard hofstadter. yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. oh, god, is he okay? yeah, alright, alright, i’ll be right there."
15628,Leonard,he got a cat to keep him company.
20488,Leonard,"hey, you know what we should do?"
21427,Leonard,"oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. isn’t that right, halley?"
20948,Leonard,"hey, she didn’t compromise. she settled. there’s a difference."
14506,Leonard,duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
14357,Leonard,"hey, stuart, i need to talk to you."
14549,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
15963,Leonard,"hey, baby. i love you! mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
17731,Leonard,i’ll be right back.
21747,Leonard,so where do you sleep?
12430,Leonard,hello penny.
19773,Leonard,i guess this could count as an adventure.
21324,Leonard,"yes, he is."
15443,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. we were just in different places in the relationship.
14332,Leonard,it must be hell inside your head.
19244,Leonard,"all right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…"
16675,Leonard,"rough night, casey jones?"
20593,Leonard,who are you texting?
15511,Leonard,"well, then let’s un-pause it."
15392,Leonard,i don’t understand.
14107,Leonard,so aren’t you going to go talk to her?
19425,Leonard,hey.
15548,Leonard,let’s get you to the hospital.
13977,Leonard,"swell. if you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the powerpoint presentation."
21083,Leonard,"although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so i can get it on video."
16737,Leonard,can you or can’t you?
18436,Leonard,nothing. i love it.
14904,Leonard,it’s not?
19640,Leonard,okay.
15506,Leonard,still digging the shamy?
15501,Leonard,so how’s work?
12996,Leonard,no problem. 
20140,Leonard,what are you saying? we’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
12346,Leonard,where are you going?
15361,Leonard,sure.
17948,Leonard,"what is wrong with you? if i did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks."
17290,Leonard,why would you do that?
19170,Leonard,are you mad at me?
16428,Leonard,lucky bastard.
19991,Leonard,"no, i think it’s because we’re eloping."
20915,Leonard,"and we live with sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
12126,Leonard,our babies will be smart and beautiful.
17323,Leonard,"no, it was called for."
14981,Leonard,i’ll send them a basket of muffins.
19630,Leonard,"if you want, i can yell at you later."
21313,Leonard,aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
14844,Leonard,"howard, relax, i’m not interested in your girlfriend."
18760,Leonard,"hey, cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
13833,Leonard,"i just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
13563,Leonard,"no, wait! if anyone asks you where i went, you don’t know."
16269,Leonard,he actually got pretty good. he made us all matching serapes.
19559,Leonard,i’m not a preschooler.
18088,Leonard,sheldon.
19354,Leonard,"you know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."
12609,Leonard,"okay, the x10s are online."
16871,Leonard,forget about the bobcat.
16021,Leonard,who else would it be?
15691,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m just not dating someone right now. i don’t need to go to a senior centre."
20919,Leonard,"okay. star trek, the original series, the enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
21738,Leonard,"okay, i suppose i could drive you. well that’s a point in my favour, right?"
20583,Leonard,i know. i’m lowering the bar so slowly. this time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
14632,Leonard,"no, no, nothing like that. the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
13528,Leonard,"oh, penny, you don’t want to get into it with sheldon. the guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."
15652,Leonard,does it have melon on it?
21050,Leonard,"i love you, too."
15776,Leonard,"well then, bed mister."
13670,Leonard,"thank you, sheldon."
19687,Leonard,what’s going on?
14157,Leonard,"excuse me, but if i did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
21762,Leonard,"according to the roommate agreement, i’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
15322,Leonard,all right. but let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. i don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
13554,Leonard,okay.
16882,Leonard,what’s going on?
18679,Leonard,"okay, listen, i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but i’m a little distracted right now."
15277,Leonard,okay.
17916,Leonard,"yeah, so, i’m out."
20067,Leonard,"uh, okay, well, um, i got married recently."
17805,Leonard,"it’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
17219,Leonard,to wine and bubble wrap. and to not having to watch sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
18157,Leonard,"the harmony one was fine. we didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand."
20538,Leonard,"seriously, barry, stop."
17283,Leonard,"all right, that’s enough trash talk. one, two, three."
14131,Leonard,thank you.
15272,Leonard,"no, let her go."
13655,Leonard,"no, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
13881,Leonard,hmmm.
17385,Leonard,"raj, you’re our group historian. has sheldon ever begged before?"
18757,Leonard,"mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
19489,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s fine."
20701,Leonard,what?
18374,Leonard,"look, i mean, i’m not proud of it, but it does work. i got her to watch a six-part documentary on monty python. even i was bored, i just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end."
20323,Leonard,come on. i take care of him all day long. you do it for once.
21691,Leonard,u-u-u-uh!
21003,Leonard,i just wanted to make her work for it.
17206,Leonard,where do i sign?
18667,Leonard,no.
20019,Leonard,"no, she had dental insurance."
15220,Leonard,for what?
19253,Leonard,it really does hold up.
17962,Leonard,that a problem?
19422,Leonard,that’s a nice way of looking at it.
21126,Leonard,"uh, can i help you?"
17601,Leonard,i know what he looks like.
13734,Leonard,isn’t that kind of cowardly?
19935,Leonard,"well, of course i know why. but just for fun, why?"
13820,Leonard,"well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
15900,Leonard,"oh, i hope they let us in soon. i’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. the guy makes me buy a gatorade every time. it’s a vicious circle."
14002,Leonard,it’s too late for me. my head is her summer house.
17501,Leonard,"well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, i didn’t want to look ridiculous."
19060,Leonard,"no, i thought he was with you."
20314,Leonard,how does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
21611,Leonard,hey.
14151,Leonard,"uh, hey, it’s your business. do whatever you want."
14862,Leonard,we didn’t have a tree when i was growing up.
14246,Leonard,why?
13338,Leonard,"oh yeah, two zero zero eight nq sub seventeen."
13051,Leonard,"that’s fascinating, but i…"
16851,Leonard,it’s okay. did the right thing. you idiot!
20224,Leonard,is ernest goes to jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
13203,Leonard,what’s going on with you?
12957,Leonard,snipe.
15505,Leonard,wait a minute– a child? you never see this girl. you just e-mail and text and twitter. now you’re considering having a baby?
16680,Leonard,"amy, this is for you."
17813,Leonard,"okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen."
18725,Leonard,"oh, thursday’s gone. just sunday left."
12850,Leonard,yes.
19562,Leonard,you worked out all the math.
16409,Leonard,"mm, i don’t know. i get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape."
14741,Leonard,"oh, come on. this is stupid."
12220,Leonard,"no, i can’t look at you or your avatar right now."
18618,Leonard,what? that’s great. guys.
15707,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe.
21516,Leonard,hi.
19186,Leonard,i’ve seen him do it. it’s not romantic.
17881,Leonard,"hey, hey, hey, hey. this is my comic-con makeup. i love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend."
20867,Leonard,"which means i won’t be able to make penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche french toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
13009,Leonard,he offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
19011,Leonard,"come on, be serious."
16081,Leonard,"no. i mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
17183,Leonard,"right. sorry, sorry."
19530,Leonard,"ooh, emily. i heard him say that to emily. hey, i thought you were staying home."
12922,Leonard,"that’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, i’d like to get on with my question now."
21664,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
21100,Leonard,"yes, you do."
18655,Leonard,"well, i don’t think you called it idiotic."
14087,Leonard,this conference is kind of a big thing. the keynote address is being delivered by george smoot.
21328,Leonard,what’s going on with your dad?
21166,Leonard,who knows what he has down there.
12789,Leonard,"affirmative, with fever."
13716,Leonard,good.
17063,Leonard,that’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
18419,Leonard,"oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. look at me with you. "
19788,Leonard,i don’t think you can do both.
14662,Leonard,"well, yeah, no, i met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. were they here today?"
18787,Leonard,"oh, i’m sorry."
13687,Leonard,at least i have an egg. what do you have?
16947,Leonard,"maybe i’m not done hanging out with…  you’re right, it’s getting late."
21175,Leonard,"oh cool, i’ll be like a pointy-eared paul bunyan."
13847,Leonard,"well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like gepetto, i don’t think it’s gonna happen."
19217,Leonard,fine. then we’ll just stay here and do it.
15440,Leonard,"sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
18612,Leonard,"hang on, i’m gonna give you a little early christmas present. i’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. so, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. look."
19933,Leonard,"yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date."
18604,Leonard,that’s enough.
13006,Leonard,"no, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or darth vader voice changers, i’m getting rid of all of it. "
19242,Leonard,if only we had one.
20382,Leonard,hey.
17649,Leonard,sorry. whatever. it’s all good.
13674,Leonard,why do i feel like i’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
20791,Leonard,"i was wrong, there’s three excuses for that."
12944,Leonard,what are you doing?
18233,Leonard,sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. just keep an eye on him while i’m gone.
19148,Leonard,now you know why we’re not outside.
16984,Leonard,you want to hear something weird?
21106,Leonard,"let me guess, you want it."
21067,Leonard,"yeah, good for you."
19317,Leonard,i’ll be right back.
14678,Leonard,"sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
15530,Leonard,"so, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
15038,Leonard,"okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. good night."
12339,Leonard,like luminous fish.
18774,Leonard,i saw a thai place next door.
17316,Leonard,"no, he doesn’t."
13288,Leonard,"hey, why don’t we all move over there so leslie can join us."
15989,Leonard,lesser warlord of ka’a.
14820,Leonard,"this is brilliant, sheldon. how are we going to deploy it in kripke’s office?"
21536,Leonard,"you won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
14372,Leonard,"then what was oh, boy?"
13227,Leonard,so it’s nothing i did? it’s her problem? 
18953,Leonard,"sheldon, i’ve got some bad news."
14096,Leonard,why not?
18362,Leonard,some sports bar. it’s like they never even heard of quidditch. do we really have to go?
17949,Leonard,hissy fits? i have hissy fits?
17448,Leonard,"are you? you left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
18627,Leonard,"you know, i think we’re zeroing in on your problem."
20287,Leonard,may what?
18726,Leonard,sunday’s gone.
21104,Leonard,so you think you should keep it?
19045,Leonard,"now that penny and i are engaged, i thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements."
21033,Leonard,where’s batman?
21469,Leonard,hey.
12900,Leonard,"can it wait, i need to talk to you."
14367,Leonard,howard’s space toilet. i’ll tell you later.
15932,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
12985,Leonard,what if i knocked you unconscious right now? 
18207,Leonard,"all right, amy, there’s one ogre left. take him out."
17714,Leonard,yes. thank you.
16935,Leonard,they’re in a group. i’m scared.
15626,Leonard,turned to boom-boom.
20603,Leonard,"oh, good."
15347,Leonard,"oh, i have so many things to tell your biographer."
19369,Leonard,look at me. dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
15484,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
20489,Leonard,go out and celebrate. but not your worst idea.
18694,Leonard,bye.
13091,Leonard,"here you go, copenhagen boy, how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade.  come on, come on, oh you clever little…. come on, come on, take that! "
21343,Leonard,maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
16813,Leonard,you can have my car.
19503,Leonard,do you mean that?
17984,Leonard,you’re a hero.
18406,Leonard,"and besides, i do romantic things for you all the time. can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?"
18357,Leonard,maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
17838,Leonard,working it? you can’t even talk to her.
12869,Leonard,"sure. if he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat white russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you. "
19546,Leonard,"wow, you remember that?"
12975,Leonard,"sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. now out of the way so i can sit in my time machine.  okay, i am setting the dials for march 10th, 1876. "
17082,Leonard,"oh, boy, do i?"
21643,Leonard,"aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
20410,Leonard,thank you. i appreciate that.
14373,Leonard,there’s nothing wrong with the science here.
18219,Leonard,i know what you’re doing. you don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
18399,Leonard,doesn’t matter.
15135,Leonard,"oh, come on, why would you do that?"
16013,Leonard,zack?
15225,Leonard,it’s already loaded. just hit play.
13752,Leonard,"no, we play rock band on our x-box."
13978,Leonard,"so, mother, what’s new?"
19787,Leonard,you have a new job.
18001,Leonard,what?
16933,Leonard,"if that’s so, what if i start talking to a girl?"
16178,Leonard,what?
12981,Leonard,"the lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
21315,Leonard,"oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
17750,Leonard,"oh. you know, i’m really starting to not like this guy."
14613,Leonard,what?
14137,Leonard,damn it. i slipped.
16128,Leonard,"i found another tweet from a student at sheldon’s lecture. dr. cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. plus, he looks like a giant insect."
12584,Leonard,"i’m done, anybody else?"
17594,Leonard,"mmm, in all fairness, pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. it’s a pretty well-rounded game."
13389,Leonard,"if we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. a guy who has your back."
16356,Leonard,"okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
14472,Leonard,really?
14464,Leonard,uh-huh. it’ll last forever. i preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
13252,Leonard,"well, there’s joyce kim, but she defected back to north korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable."
21568,Leonard,"uh, so, ramona, tell us about yourself. do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
16426,Leonard,you’re the one who told amy in the first place.
15295,Leonard,"hey, where you been?"
15857,Leonard,"don’t be ridiculous, raj. you’re here legally."
21410,Leonard,i thought we were getting breakfast before work.
12401,Leonard,"you know what, i’m being ridiculous. but who cares what penny thinks, lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent."
17400,Leonard,"oh, come on, that’s got to count. there was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
20466,Leonard,"well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had."
12485,Leonard,what’s that?
19262,Leonard,the one i gave you?
21456,Leonard,how could you lose that?
13852,Leonard,i answered every question sheldon.
13906,Leonard,"a little mood lighting, huh?"
14637,Leonard,another delightful surprise for her.
18141,Leonard,"you know, if you’re trying to make space on the dvr, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? like, um, alphas."
12039,Leonard,i’m going to invite her over. we’ll have a nice meal and chat.
19475,Leonard,"no, no, no, come on, don’t leave. just try it."
12599,Leonard,beats the hell out of me. 
13651,Leonard,are you insane? now she’s going to think i’m desperate. you’ve destroyed this relationship! and you want to know what the worst part is? you don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
16217,Leonard,i just want to talk to her.
20764,Leonard,"so, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?"
16314,Leonard,"i am not opening that door, sheldon."
16207,Leonard,"hey, what’s up?"
13257,Leonard,where did you hear that?
14139,Leonard,so?
19481,Leonard,i wasn’t gonna get beat up.
13776,Leonard,yippee.
12230,Leonard,yeah. he was kinda dreamy.
12003,Leonard,can we please stop saying coitus?
15876,Leonard,did something happen today that’s bothering you?
17745,Leonard,hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
13164,Leonard,"now that i’m actually about to go out with penny, i’m not excited, i’m nauseous. "
12986,Leonard,but it would make the present so much nicer. 
16238,Leonard,i guess you’re right. see you later.
13834,Leonard,"run, monte, run!"
17080,Leonard,what are you talking about?
15415,Leonard,"it was the best apartment i’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
18423,Leonard,i will not.
21696,Leonard,"all right, pressure’s off"
15052,Leonard,who’s miserable and alone?
15477,Leonard,"bummer. anyway, i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
13791,Leonard,"very good, thanks for asking. come on in."
19980,Leonard,"aw. that’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  oh, excuse me. sheldon. hey."
16912,Leonard,"actually, you know what? i think it’s about time i pick a movie we see."
14852,Leonard,"should i, um, leave you two alone?"
13079,Leonard,thank you.
13372,Leonard,let’s just eat so i can get to bed. with any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
18661,Leonard,um…
16581,Leonard,what’s going on?
14003,Leonard,"oh, yeah, there she is. hi, mom."
21649,Leonard,25 cats!
17880,Leonard,"oh, thanks, i thought i had more."
15065,Leonard,"yes, but it’ll be valentine’s day. we can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped alps."
13678,Leonard,don’t you think if a woman was living with me i’d be the first one to know about it?
17274,Leonard,it’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
17615,Leonard,nope. now the lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
12911,Leonard,yes.
15763,Leonard,"hmm, priya’s not back yet? well, i guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
21298,Leonard,"oh, nothing. just some math we don’t need."
14478,Leonard,– we took the red-eye.
12283,Leonard,yes.
14328,Leonard,why would he call me?
15469,Leonard,where are we going?
16977,Leonard,"oh come on, no! we just bought the regular pack."
19214,Leonard,i think someone owes me an apology.
19384,Leonard,yeah?
21030,Leonard,"mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
15046,Leonard,"i heard about this professor at mit who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
18488,Leonard,when i broke my arm i used to stick a coat hanger down there. you ever try that? maybe go in through the ear?
16235,Leonard,"it’s not a party. it’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
16960,Leonard,i hate all of you and myself. three.
21139,Leonard,"well, i’d like that, too. "
19897,Leonard,"of course not. she’s, she’s just a very sweet and god-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs."
14397,Leonard,hi.
16817,Leonard,no. sulfites. migraines.
17904,Leonard,"please, sheldon, i am so not in the mood."
13041,Leonard,"onion dip, it’s onion dip. "
12031,Leonard,"oh, great."
13037,Leonard,"yeah, no, i do, i use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. i spear fish. when i’m not crossbow hunting, i spear fish. uh, penny, this is sheldon’s twin sister, missy. missy, this is our neighbour penny."
16875,Leonard,for all those girls out there looking for the indian monopoly man?
14396,Leonard,i’m in.
12095,Leonard,the hair products are sheldon’s.
19111,Leonard,how were they?
17600,Leonard,i’m trying. don’t yell at me.
12917,Leonard,we can’t ask leslie winkle.
18865,Leonard,"of course. well, hey, how about this? whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do."
17629,Leonard,"no, no. it’s kind of crazy. i’ve never fooled around in the lab before."
18551,Leonard,yes. do you know what that means? that means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
16532,Leonard,i wasn’t swinging around a pole.
13457,Leonard,"hey, aren’t you having breakfast?"
12285,Leonard,"not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if i want to try this again."
12860,Leonard,what?
19884,Leonard,oh. done and done.
18692,Leonard,no. you’re on vacation.
15424,Leonard,"hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
18235,Leonard,"really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
16966,Leonard,i am not washed-up.
19026,Leonard,this would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
15746,Leonard,wow. wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
16693,Leonard,"want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
19008,Leonard,can i get you anything?
14920,Leonard,got it.
16161,Leonard,"well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up."
15388,Leonard,"boy, i’m kind of tuckered out. how are you feeling, elizabeth?"
12059,Leonard,i said i’m sorry.
15589,Leonard,what the hell are you guys playing?
19123,Leonard,"mm, i don’t know. who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?"
12214,Leonard,"that’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, i’ll swat him off."
17350,Leonard,"mmm, you liked professor guyster’s wedding."
14960,Leonard,so are our laptops.
14046,Leonard,we could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
16279,Leonard,sorry! oop!
16698,Leonard,what?
15468,Leonard,how is that my fault?
21564,Leonard,"no offence, stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
13698,Leonard,"yeah, i could say something like that to her. i’ll go do that. thank you."
16452,Leonard,"we were in here first, you can’t be in here."
13224,Leonard,"not that secret, the other secret."
14779,Leonard,better. thanks.
16199,Leonard,"oh, what the hell."
15298,Leonard,what the hell was that about?
13709,Leonard,"okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
21385,Leonard,"hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
13876,Leonard,in the bathroom.
18866,Leonard,putting it in my phone right now.
17723,Leonard,this is silly. i have nothing to worry about.
17508,Leonard,"oh, i’ll get it. go sports."
12231,Leonard,"well, i’m done with penny. i’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
20283,Leonard,"it’s just the four digits, month and day."
13755,Leonard,"yeah, i guess."
14851,Leonard,you told her my experiment was stupid?
15337,Leonard,oh. sure. absolutely.
16498,Leonard,thank you. befuddled. the word i was looking for was befuddled.
14144,Leonard,"w-w-wait, what’s going on?"
18621,Leonard,"uh, no reason. i just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination."
17680,Leonard,"please don’t be upset. i just, i didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."
17248,Leonard,lobster traps?
13880,Leonard,i didn’t think he had it in him.
12139,Leonard,"penny, wait."
21183,Leonard,"if i need a break, i’ll ask for a break."
21550,Leonard,shut up.
17383,Leonard,still going to introduce him?
19212,Leonard,that’s not what happened.
20372,Leonard,"no, no, say it. sing it. rent a plane, write it in the sky."
18614,Leonard,"oh, well, it’s you, swamp thing, stephen hawking, spider-man, but, look, you’re in the mix."
13178,Leonard,"oh, right, no, i’m lactose intolerant."
17134,Leonard,no.
18970,Leonard,"so, what did you think of your first funeral?"
15566,Leonard,at the hands of your roommate?
14205,Leonard,you want to watch battlestar?
12515,Leonard,good night.
13837,Leonard,forget the robot. what happened to you?
21694,Leonard,"ah, push it."
14842,Leonard,what are you talking about?
17413,Leonard,"so, howard wolowitz tying the knot. leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. he was a wild one. well, i guess we all kind of were. i remember this one time, i was with this girl at the beach. we were in the ocean and we started making out. i know, it was crazy. i wasn’t even wearing my aquasocks. then…"
13496,Leonard,yes.
14938,Leonard,"oh, couldn’t be better."
18944,Leonard,"well, penny can be very persuasive. she’s gotten me to do a lot of things i wouldn’t normally do."
16849,Leonard,"wait, i don’t, which part?"
17800,Leonard,okay…
20478,Leonard,hey.
20634,Leonard,"no, i do, and that’s why i hid it."
14525,Leonard,wait a minute. you talked to penny about our sex life?
14411,Leonard,"sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. what’s up?"
15492,Leonard,"um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
15979,Leonard,great.
15157,Leonard,oh.
12046,Leonard,"okay, well, make yourself at home."
14494,Leonard,"nothing flamed out. we don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
18998,Leonard,"whoa, whoa, hang on. there’s no need to insult her."
15323,Leonard,all i’m saying is give me a heads-up.
12412,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’m just glad to be a part of it. so what happens now?"
21257,Leonard,"of course not. i mean, he’s your brother."
18416,Leonard,"if by cool you mean willing to, yes. if by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
17587,Leonard,nothing with quarks.
19703,Leonard,baby’s listening.
21476,Leonard,o-o-o-o-oh.
16187,Leonard,hey. hi.
18313,Leonard,"hey, penny, i just wanted to say good luck, and i hope there’s no hard feelings."
13099,Leonard,"alright, i’ll be right back. "
19061,Leonard,what happened?
14897,Leonard,what is it?
15904,Leonard,"howard, you talk to him. howard? you’re peeing, aren’t you?"
19396,Leonard,how is it my fault?
14672,Leonard,"focus on the game, not the commercials, raj."
19035,Leonard,"before i tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
15035,Leonard,keep going.
17667,Leonard,no. you need to give me some advice.
16376,Leonard,cover for me.
19570,Leonard,"one, two three."
12445,Leonard,"for example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is leakey. "
18154,Leonard,well…
13400,Leonard,"oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out."
13739,Leonard,"i have two words for you. the first is big, the other’s whoop."
19519,Leonard,your george lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
17972,Leonard,what do you want?
19368,Leonard,"my god, who’s the dork now? thank you for wearing your flats."
21387,Leonard,it’s the least we can do.
19030,Leonard,"hey, buddy."
13504,Leonard,here you go.
17701,Leonard,really?
12225,Leonard,"oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. "
14701,Leonard,mimesis?
13804,Leonard,"howard, where you going?"
12477,Leonard,i think we’re all talking to penny here.
15375,Leonard,come on. it wasn’t my fault.
18509,Leonard,why isn’t this bothering you? isn’t your brain getting itchy? this is on your card. this could be ruining your credit score. why isn’t this making you crazy?
18657,Leonard,"no, you’re not."
19809,Leonard,are those my sheets?
16915,Leonard,"yes, i do. the only reason i went is because you wanted to see them, and i wanted to have sex. to this day, i can’t see a sandra bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
17467,Leonard,what are you doing?
17968,Leonard,"is it? we’re together all the time. financially, it makes great sense. can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?"
15170,Leonard,will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
19925,Leonard,can it wait until i put a band-aid on a goat bite?
14128,Leonard,"i don’t know. some sort of placebo effect, i guess."
17897,Leonard,"mine, too. anybody got any ideas?"
14628,Leonard,"okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
21613,Leonard,"hey, wh-where are you going?"
12848,Leonard,great. 
18510,Leonard,what?
15701,Leonard,why don’t you just break up with her?
15533,Leonard,is somebody working on that?
14807,Leonard,"how ya doin’, buddy?"
12009,Leonard,thank-you. we’ll be right back.
20943,Leonard,do it.
14560,Leonard,"no, you’re not sanding penny."
13775,Leonard,"that’s funny. by the way, my leg is killing me. thanks for asking."
14217,Leonard,you’re joking.
17228,Leonard,"fine. but mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
13159,Leonard,"sheldon, i think i’ve made a mistake. "
17460,Leonard,have a nice night.
19637,Leonard,"yeah, sure, that might be fun."
15734,Leonard,"ah, you’re going off the grid."
13424,Leonard,so what is it you’re doing?
18781,Leonard,"no, hang on. hang on. are all those things equal to you?"
16215,Leonard,"yeah, that’s a real pickle. bye."
15736,Leonard,what if she just comes over?
19097,Leonard,"okay. uh, i’ll, i’ll come get you. what’s the address?"
13490,Leonard,"yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current mrs. wolowitz."
14226,Leonard,"i think we’re fine, stuart."
14589,Leonard,what are you thinking?
17411,Leonard,"wow, that’s very nice."
19215,Leonard,"well, maybe we have lost our focus."
20205,Leonard,"okay, but now there’s this swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. we really need this helium."
20431,Leonard,"hi. so nice to finally meet you. let me take this for you, meemaw."
17719,Leonard,really? here?
14666,Leonard,"okay, some of my facebook friends aren’t geniuses. my point is, if we’re going to be a couple, i should be friends with your friends."
21031,Leonard,"bernadette told howard, howard told me, plus, i can see all my stuff is gone."
12174,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to get out of here."
21604,Leonard,"…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…"
15013,Leonard,"oh, my god! are you… "
16526,Leonard,i don’t care. i don’t have anything to hide.
14993,Leonard,don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
17353,Leonard,"sure, what’s up?"
19294,Leonard,yeah i don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
19793,Leonard,from a kevin smith movie?
13668,Leonard,"oh come on! sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that."
14325,Leonard,"well, yeah, stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store."
20206,Leonard,here’s the money. can we do this?
14578,Leonard,"so, what’s going on with raj?"
20464,Leonard,"no, they’re not."
12385,Leonard,penny? what about her?
13371,Leonard,"it’s not a date, and that’s racist."
18499,Leonard,or it’s resolved.
16641,Leonard,not good?
13017,Leonard,"thanks. hey, do you want to, i don’t know, later…"
13577,Leonard,"well, i wrote some of it down."
14014,Leonard,"you shush, i’m happy, i want to talk about it. you know what my mother would say about this? she would say because you were not loved by your father and i was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children."
15112,Leonard,"not really, i’m just an enthusiast."
21470,Leonard,is that it?
18712,Leonard,no.
15637,Leonard,"okay, yeah, fine."
20803,Leonard,mom.
16909,Leonard,you’re right. i’m fine. i’m wearing this.
21777,Leonard,"well, i’ve adjusted the formula."
19724,Leonard,you want some of this? i’ll give you some.
15099,Leonard,some what?
16351,Leonard,"thank you, officer."
18238,Leonard,yeah.
12356,Leonard,"hey, how did it go?"
18182,Leonard,"actually, he’s a genius."
21565,Leonard,you kept walking. i think you did.
19504,Leonard,"come on, don’t get upset."
16413,Leonard,"don’t tell anybody i told you, but i heard she might be breaking up with him."
21523,Leonard,absolutely. i just want you to be happy. and maybe a little turned on about how selfless i’m being.
18071,Leonard,"you know, when i first met howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, i sat in gum."
21573,Leonard,i’ll do the talking.
21444,Leonard,"yeah, why?"
21438,Leonard,"well, to be truthful…"
14224,Leonard,"come on, i’ll help you pick something."
18729,Leonard,do what you want. we’re getting scalped tickets.
21226,Leonard,"its not that i’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. they start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
13156,Leonard,yes what? 
17210,Leonard,"that’s not bad, howard “rocket man” wolowitz."
15140,Leonard,"look at that. to my friend, leonard, from stan lee, excelsior!"
14459,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
19575,Leonard,really? what’d they say?
15971,Leonard,"oh, the reverse psychology thing. i see. that’s very clever."
21498,Leonard,"it’ll be fine, let’s just go."
17278,Leonard,i get it.
21188,Leonard,please tell me you didn’t use amy’s magic juice.
21519,Leonard,"well, thanks. and i don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like."
21776,Leonard,there’s no mistake.
19831,Leonard,okay. great. how do you want to start?
16135,Leonard,really? triumphant?
14559,Leonard,"no, this has to stop now."
18184,Leonard,"yes, sir."
12517,Leonard,"she’s gone, sheldon. "
13535,Leonard,sheldon’s kryptonite.
15076,Leonard,not the roommate agreement.
18525,Leonard,"well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. you need to get this taken care of."
12429,Leonard,"you hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
13604,Leonard,hmm. lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
16623,Leonard,of course i like amy.
21248,Leonard,i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
13028,Leonard,"you too, swell, also."
12549,Leonard,"if we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
21602,Leonard,sorry.
16567,Leonard,sorry.
15224,Leonard,you might want to check youtube.
13360,Leonard,almost.
17167,Leonard,even doctor who?
18792,Leonard,"seriously? you haven’t used this desk in years. the second i want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?"
12234,Leonard,so?
19937,Leonard,i don’t know. because we don’t have a date?
15184,Leonard,and it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
18477,Leonard,oh. i forgot about this. my aunt made it for me when i started college.
13934,Leonard,i do.
14631,Leonard,"okay. speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, i made a pact with wolowitz that kind of involves you."
14070,Leonard,i’m afraid so. you know the cashew chicken i get you monday nights?
19908,Leonard,it came from tiffany’s.
19942,Leonard,"okay. well, then it’s settled. small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies."
18009,Leonard,all right.
15671,Leonard,"so anyway, that’s great news about you and bernadette."
13614,Leonard,oo-oo-oh!
13425,Leonard,what does that mean?
19428,Leonard,sad?
12846,Leonard,great.
15651,Leonard,hang on a second. i could have the fruit platter.
13242,Leonard,"relatively modern. why, what are you wearing?"
18169,Leonard,do you remember his old theme song?
15238,Leonard,what do you want from me? i just don’t give a rat’s ass.
12454,Leonard,"i  want to get to know penny’s friends, i just, i don’t know how to talk to these people. "
17376,Leonard,"and that’s a lie, right?"
16691,Leonard,and also for breaking the head off the ice swan so i could hold it against my pulled groin.
18605,Leonard,"oh, good. is the baby born yet?"
18388,Leonard,please let me be there when you tell her that.
13200,Leonard,what about saturday?
20578,Leonard,we had a full spool yesterday.
18053,Leonard,"got it. all right, i’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. like s. smith instead of samantha smith."
13638,Leonard,"oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. "
20783,Leonard,seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
15320,Leonard,fine. i’ll take him for shoes next saturday.
16597,Leonard,that’s so nice.
14410,Leonard,"sheldon, you know i can’t eat butter. i’m lactose intolerant."
17148,Leonard,what are we doing?
21485,Leonard,we’re pinned down.
17722,Leonard,"it’s not a big deal. he’s just in her history class. they’re working on a project together. i don’t even know why i care. you know what, i don’t care."
19158,Leonard,you believe this guy? he has to be the best at everything.
16070,Leonard,what are you doing?
21279,Leonard,that’s because we are.
12299,Leonard,"i’m not sure that i do. um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer."
21412,Leonard,"sure. you’re living here for free, i guess i owe you."
17161,Leonard,"before an application is released, they give it a trial run. w-we could do that. and if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
12849,Leonard,"okay, well, right now i’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but i really don’t need any help. "
17988,Leonard,"okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. because i am like a romance ninja. you don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!"
18213,Leonard,how’s that been working for you?
14033,Leonard,i don’t care about that.
12158,Leonard,what are you doing?
20558,Leonard,"guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? howard’s invention, sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. which i’m sure penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now."
15401,Leonard,so you’re not judging me?
15010,Leonard,yeah. did you notice all the people looking at us?
18069,Leonard,that’s what you said five minutes ago. amy and penny are already in the car. let’s move it.
18378,Leonard,"uh-huh, i can already feel it working."
18437,Leonard,"it’s true, i did. i did say that. when we were at the used bookstore together and i saw the first edition and i bought it."
20301,Leonard,"you know me, i’m a big ol’ bookworm."
15473,Leonard,i wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
14358,Leonard,"i think i gave you bad advice about penny, and i want to apologize."
19423,Leonard,"you know what? this bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. let’s make a pact. when one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting professor abbott."
15003,Leonard,i think penny likes to skate. the four of us could double.
19412,Leonard,"oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."
15821,Leonard,what do you want.
12294,Leonard,what’s new at the cheesecake factory?
18280,Leonard,"no, i don’t."
13416,Leonard,"okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
14731,Leonard,"an old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. that’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
20483,Leonard,"relax, there’s room for two babies in this group."
14878,Leonard,"i drove, mother. i’m driving now."
16941,Leonard,"don’t worry about it. you know, there’s some guys over there. you should go talk to them."
14342,Leonard,"all right, well, off the top of my head, i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow. i mean, glacial."
15672,Leonard,"ah. well, i guess for you guys that’s like regular golf."
15807,Leonard,like what?
21170,Leonard,and their sherpas.
12207,Leonard,"oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
15992,Leonard,hey.
15234,Leonard,"yeah, probably."
16129,Leonard,wow. how do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
12137,Leonard,"so, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?"
21458,Leonard,"but, boy, it is funny to think about."
19040,Leonard,"yes, it would."
18265,Leonard,and this is me doing the titanic pose on the boat.
16508,Leonard,yes. it’s my water.
19552,Leonard,which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. so what do you think? what do you think? so what do you think?
13701,Leonard,hey.
14892,Leonard,no!
15242,Leonard,what? no.
14708,Leonard,"oh, you’re kidding me."
17157,Leonard,"me, too, i missed you."
18974,Leonard,that’s true.
17656,Leonard,please be good. please be good. uh-huh. uh-huh. okay. she writes like she cooks.
14369,Leonard,"yes, you did, didn’t you?"
15937,Leonard,"well, did you apologize? did you have to woo me?"
14322,Leonard,"yeah, well i wouldn’t say cool, i’d just say, that’s leonard!"
13544,Leonard,"or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
20973,Leonard,that’s awesome. is this for serial ape-ist?
12143,Leonard,"i have 26 hundred comic books in there, i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells."
15762,Leonard,whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  okay.
12661,Leonard,"it’s a classic, right? "
21167,Leonard,absolutely not.
15042,Leonard,no cilantro?
17959,Leonard,"i swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being i have ever met."
17250,Leonard,"fine. just get back under your blanket, and i’ll drive you there."
15072,Leonard,no.
16731,Leonard,see that? i just saved us forty bucks.
18196,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice. but relax, sometimes change is good. uh, you were worried about zachary quinto being the new spock, but you wound up liking him."
17884,Leonard,yeah.
15227,Leonard,"no, no, i’m good. if my p.e. teachers had told me this is what i was training for, i would have tried a lot harder."
18666,Leonard,to my room.
21659,Leonard,"come on, priya, just admit i embarrass you!"
14349,Leonard,morning.
13150,Leonard,"oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig ipod… yeah, no, how could he do that. "
21182,Leonard,do not need a break.
16200,Leonard,what?
16479,Leonard,all right.
16377,Leonard,i can’t believe we’re going all the way to san diego to confront this guy.
18778,Leonard,"oh, hey. you’re back. how was your trip?"
19929,Leonard,yeah. i wish i’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
21118,Leonard,"you’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
19820,Leonard,congratulations.
18247,Leonard,i’m covered.
14954,Leonard,"really, that’s the line? psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
18153,Leonard,you know what? never mind. we gave it a shot. let’s just see what else is on.
20906,Leonard,"it’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
15785,Leonard,"i don’t know. when i’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response."
15649,Leonard,"no, no, no, i can do it."
13493,Leonard,what are you doing?
19069,Leonard,that’s weird.
19547,Leonard,"you know, when you talk like that, i want to take you right here on this table."
13020,Leonard,"i’m glad you agree. i hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. "
12443,Leonard,"no, it’s not…"
18092,Leonard,bernadette.
20130,Leonard,"hey, we brought you thai. where is everything?"
13175,Leonard,"so you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. it’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. "
19274,Leonard,"hey, you got a sec?"
20547,Leonard,"hold on, hold on. so the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"
12415,Leonard,doctor what?
17062,Leonard,"no, i can’t. i’m playing grand theft auto later. look, i’m no expert in women."
15846,Leonard,"hey, you got snoopy out. can i have a snowcone?"
12959,Leonard,snipe!
16186,Leonard,"good night, sheldon."
20049,Leonard,what? why?
17279,Leonard,"no, he didn’t. nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. okay, uh, forget one-on-one. let’s try a free throw contest. first person who makes a basket wins the office."
20377,Leonard,"oh, great. dr. gallo is terrific. you know, i, i’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what i have to say, but she made me see…"
20983,Leonard,never been on this side of the table before. i feel powerful.
19161,Leonard,i’m not jealous. i just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
14432,Leonard,i guess i’ll see you.
12456,Leonard,go on.
12040,Leonard,"well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
12347,Leonard,oh. 
15987,Leonard,suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night. none come to mind.
16290,Leonard,oh. okay.
19959,Leonard,"remember, uh, a couple years back when i was on that research ship in the north sea?"
15495,Leonard,thirty feet.
18815,Leonard,"or you’re just a tall, annoying frog."
19776,Leonard,"look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this."
19003,Leonard,"what about when you did, uh, anne frank at that cute little theater?"
17697,Leonard,"oh, yeah. fifth grade. sixth grade. seventh grade. eighth grade. ninth grade."
14022,Leonard,"good-bye, mother."
20217,Leonard,"listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules."
18202,Leonard,"what’s the big deal? raj bailed, so we could use some extra players."
17764,Leonard,"sheldon, let it go. it’s not a big deal."
14991,Leonard,sorry about that.
14136,Leonard,ready.
12766,Leonard,no problem. welcome home. 
20575,Leonard,"after you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."
20141,Leonard,"i got a triple-word score with a double letter q. if that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? hey, barry kripke started a fencing club."
12049,Leonard,what?
20505,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
17626,Leonard,what?
15377,Leonard,i didn’t betray penny.
18599,Leonard,because i know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
19761,Leonard,thank you so much. see? maybe honesty is the best… what are you doing?
14943,Leonard,"do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
19730,Leonard,that soy frappuccino i had.
15363,Leonard,wow. you really make science come alive.
18677,Leonard,"you need to let it go, sheldon."
18385,Leonard,your father’s a gynaecologist.
15145,Leonard,why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff?
12535,Leonard,"i know, i know, look, you have a tv in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed? "
17214,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, i will take you to the dentist."
17981,Leonard,no.
19983,Leonard,what happened now?
20072,Leonard,"you know, on some level, i’ve always believed that i don’t deserve a woman like her."
12527,Leonard,i’ll get you a blanket and a pillow. 
19786,Leonard,it really is.
20714,Leonard,hang on.
15633,Leonard,zazzles?
16617,Leonard,"listen, i don’t want to be rude, but priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
12504,Leonard,sure. what’s going on.
19817,Leonard,hey.
17885,Leonard,"oh, hang on a second. "
12264,Leonard,and that’s still good for you.
18276,Leonard,good morning.
12157,Leonard,"come on, we should go."
12887,Leonard,the ladies?
19142,Leonard,we are so smart.
15897,Leonard,who‘s there?
16970,Leonard,you okay?
17016,Leonard,i don’t think something like that’s even possible.
16962,Leonard,"yeah, that’s not it. stuart’s kind of interested in amy."
13921,Leonard,and that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
21361,Leonard,"no, i want you to go."
18017,Leonard,"yep. you know what? that was pretty crappy of you. i mean, all i wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it."
19992,Leonard,they’re running a little behind. should be pretty soon.
12198,Leonard,"um, here’s the thing.  penny. just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too i regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. the hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. some mistakes, such as madame curie’s discovery of radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. another example, from the field of ebola research…."
21614,Leonard,a-a-a-aw!
17654,Leonard,"it’s like when i started doing chin-ups, i didn’t want you to see until i could do one. fyi, really close."
18916,Leonard,are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
19746,Leonard,"i’m about to lose control, and i think i like it."
14168,Leonard,bam.
13610,Leonard,do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
18189,Leonard,it’s important you know how much you mean to us.
13884,Leonard,"well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and i don’t see a sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a sheldon-approved theatre."
20671,Leonard,stop saying meeting.
15864,Leonard,really?
14913,Leonard,"what the hell, agreed."
19112,Leonard,hang on. you travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
19153,Leonard,"there isn’t any ranking. and if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it."
17012,Leonard,"oh, i can’t take all the credit. you helped a lot."
15397,Leonard,hey.
19295,Leonard,should we go?
15515,Leonard,"you have any ideas, raj?"
20636,Leonard,is it a secret bank account? because that would be awesome.
20890,Leonard,what?
12495,Leonard,penny?
20173,Leonard,that shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
14813,Leonard,good.
14798,Leonard,"never mind, what’s your announcement?"
14299,Leonard,behold?
17329,Leonard,it would be like our world of warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
20718,Leonard,"okay, have fun."
17066,Leonard,"well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
18102,Leonard,yup.
13239,Leonard,"so, yeah, good to see you."
13541,Leonard,compromise. watch babylon 5.
16166,Leonard,"you kind of remind me of her. she enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
17733,Leonard,"oh, cool. that cute blonde on four?"
14327,Leonard,he wants to talk about penny. i don’t want to talk about penny.
12705,Leonard,and what would i have said afterwards? 
17032,Leonard,"uh, yeah. sure, i guess."
18043,Leonard,"well, is that all of it?  just set it down."
14390,Leonard,how was it resolved?
13393,Leonard,"sheldon, i was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my x-ray diffraction experiment."
12468,Leonard,"why should we leave? for all we know, he crashed the party and penny doesn’t even want him here. ."
13640,Leonard,"i did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
13848,Leonard,there was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. roommate wanted. whistlers need not apply.
14634,Leonard,"come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. and you know that deep down inside, howard’s a really nice guy."
21592,Leonard,i’m at work. 
16802,Leonard,right.
18168,Leonard,"it would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. i just used awesome wrong, didn’t i?"
14403,Leonard,no.
19542,Leonard,maybe in the morning.
15555,Leonard,"uh, 12 bucks."
14915,Leonard,i’m over it.
19569,Leonard,"okay, partner, let’s do it."
20630,Leonard,"what, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
16460,Leonard,not as much as you.
13086,Leonard,seen it.
12221,Leonard,excuse me.
13177,Leonard,what was your question again?
18046,Leonard,"look, i know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. so, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with."
21627,Leonard,"okay, well, um, what about this? what does this mean?"
17415,Leonard,i totally had sex in the ocean.
17351,Leonard,who you bringing?
21549,Leonard,"well, the last three nights i’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a walgreens in arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. now ask me how i’m doing with amy gone."
13816,Leonard,he’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? the guy is devastated.
12720,Leonard,"okay, why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
20325,Leonard,i love you.
16002,Leonard,why me?
15870,Leonard,and i may have hit on her a little bit.
13482,Leonard,that’s it. no more thai food.
20637,Leonard,really? why?
13226,Leonard,i promise. 
12924,Leonard,she’s in. 
13255,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
14771,Leonard,"oh, hey. dune."
15502,Leonard,"yeah, we all are."
18250,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?"
15090,Leonard,seriously?
19843,Leonard,i know.
12804,Leonard,"okay, he must be in his bedroom. my spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my bat-signal. "
21150,Leonard,hang on. i’m counting. it’s okay.
18517,Leonard,i want to go.
13999,Leonard,nothing. mother likes looking at brains and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
12829,Leonard,"graduate work, very impressive."
18548,Leonard,"hey, you’re in a good mood."
15630,Leonard,yeah.
18801,Leonard,"well, he is here. so unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing i can do about it."
19255,Leonard,"yeah, i’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
17866,Leonard,sure.
17335,Leonard,that’s what your father used to say?
17687,Leonard,"hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy."
20651,Leonard,"seriously, that guy’s dating two women?"
19332,Leonard,"uh, guys, we’re locked in here."
17496,Leonard,"well, hang on. why do you believe that he knows what it is and i don’t?"
14404,Leonard,a little bit.
12664,Leonard,"i didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. it’s not science."
17152,Leonard,"hang on. penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
18759,Leonard,to the bedroom.
14249,Leonard,how about those two?
12135,Leonard,"so, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
12242,Leonard,"heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. "
19352,Leonard,"if you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the disney channel. so, anything else planned for tonight?"
16222,Leonard,"penny, this is raj’s sister, priya."
20886,Leonard,"look at that, it is a party."
19321,Leonard,"no. i got upset. and sheldon made me a beverage, too."
21122,Leonard,hey.
14755,Leonard,why didn’t you say so?
20420,Leonard,what are you doing?
17817,Leonard,what are you drinking there? a little eggnog?
20854,Leonard,that’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
17546,Leonard,just say it.
14376,Leonard,"yeah, i know the feeling."
17343,Leonard,"keep an eye on those expiration dates, i’ve been burned more than once."
18737,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. you’re gonna get in trouble."
17855,Leonard,at least i know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
12810,Leonard,what? 
19611,Leonard,"i don’t know. i mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
17236,Leonard,can i sit in your spot?
15618,Leonard,"i assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of slim jims and the latest issue of bombay badonkadonks."
16565,Leonard,no backsies.
14577,Leonard,oh. i’ll be there.
21046,Leonard,over my assless chaps you will.
17472,Leonard,where’d you get a beer?
13439,Leonard,"oh, good god."
18735,Leonard,"mmm, what if we go as the fantastic four, and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us."
13570,Leonard,"just say, leonard went to the office."
13140,Leonard,"aw, good for me. where are you going?"
20087,Leonard,wow.
16119,Leonard,"no. no, i understand. i got too intense, you had to back off."
14619,Leonard,but you have a whole bunch of ’em.
13411,Leonard,booting.
14438,Leonard,reconstituted thai food.
14799,Leonard,are you really going to be on npr?
14654,Leonard,sorry.
15108,Leonard,"just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in geneva, switzerland for our first valentine’s day."
19013,Leonard,so i’m like a bran muffin.
12542,Leonard,"howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
15179,Leonard,give me that.
15459,Leonard,"no, thanks."
12610,Leonard,"hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
18572,Leonard,sheldon.
16300,Leonard,"yeah, bitches are the worst."
14202,Leonard,"uh, yeah, i’d love to."
20180,Leonard,who is he?
19087,Leonard,"bye, buddy. sheldon?"
12279,Leonard,why?
20853,Leonard,"you’re not a lawyer, sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all."
15549,Leonard,no.
15286,Leonard,"where you going with this, raj?"
19619,Leonard,what do you think?
14690,Leonard,"anyway, wish me luck."
20778,Leonard,"oh, sheldon invoked rosa parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
15862,Leonard,"good. it’s a good relationship. of course, most of my relationships are good. probably because i exude confidence. people are drawn to that, you know? confidence, not exuding."
17104,Leonard,ah now th-th-there you go. always made it worse.
12654,Leonard,"okay, i’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
13404,Leonard,how did you get here in the first place?
12913,Leonard,how exactly would that laugh go? 
18236,Leonard,"there’s beer in the fridge. anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
12007,Leonard,"one across is aegean, eight down is nabakov, twenty-six across is mcm, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across port-au-prince. see, papa doc’s capital idea, that’s port-au-prince. haiti. "
16385,Leonard,oh-oh.
18826,Leonard,so are you really not gonna do this movie?
17676,Leonard,don’t ask me. a little elf did it.
20008,Leonard,"penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. i like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."
17901,Leonard,"come on, let’s just start walking. there’s got to be a gas station or something nearby."
12566,Leonard,"that will do, raj, straight for the tank."
20775,Leonard,you did everything you could.
14393,Leonard,hang on. let’s talk about it. this is a national science foundation expedition. i don’t know how we can turn it down.
14863,Leonard,"mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
21061,Leonard,"i’m sorry, is that a yes?"
13751,Leonard,"actually, he’s pretty cool. i mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a black diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
15451,Leonard,"let me explain what we’re doing here. um, in 1969, the astronauts on apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
12165,Leonard,"well, we’ll get out of your hair."
16400,Leonard,"fine, don’t tell me."
16541,Leonard,sure
13215,Leonard,that was fast. 
17154,Leonard,"yes, and i think we should go anyway."
16191,Leonard,oh. then what was last night about?
17525,Leonard,i’m starting to get a sense of it. don’t worry. i’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
20202,Leonard,"afraid so, skippy."
18497,Leonard,"monday morning i’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the dvd. pay the late fee, and prove to sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. ah!"
17961,Leonard,i was thinking here with you.
20276,Leonard,you really should.
15203,Leonard,"sheldon? sheldon, are you okay?"
16090,Leonard,"okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up."
12118,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m so sorry i dragged you through this."
15805,Leonard,please don’t tell anyone i spent the night with raj’s sister.
19189,Leonard,"wow, raj, you were not lying about her."
21352,Leonard,"i know. sometimes howard wears a striped shirt so we can play where’s wolowitz? okay, now, this is us camping out in line for the avengers panel."
21468,Leonard,don’t you have any friends he can date?
18085,Leonard,"you know, too."
14659,Leonard,"oh, that’s excellent. it’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t"
13720,Leonard,"um, little bit.  what?"
20056,Leonard,you guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
15413,Leonard,"in retrospect, that was clue number two."
18286,Leonard,stop it.
12450,Leonard,okay. 
16752,Leonard,"no, i just got a text from stuart. brent spiner is at the party."
15233,Leonard,yeah.
15592,Leonard,"i can figure this out, let’s see. um, well, beavers eat tree bark. the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon. so, i’ll say cinnamon."
20307,Leonard,"be right there. hi, lover."
16068,Leonard,"okay, that’s it, you’re fired."
15087,Leonard,rupert murdoch?
15597,Leonard,did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids? it’s pretty interesting. this guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
20763,Leonard,you think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
19438,Leonard,what do we do? should we call someone?
14184,Leonard,"raj, help me out here."
17787,Leonard,"aw, i got a little paper cut."
16857,Leonard,"uh, kind of?"
18608,Leonard,hang on. why would i be fat?
13480,Leonard,"sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
20970,Leonard,i’m very happy for you.
17515,Leonard,some people might say it was romantic.
18652,Leonard,"so? even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
19734,Leonard,what? this road trip just got crazy.
17883,Leonard,"well, it’s a lot smaller. it’s more about the comic books. the way these conventions used to be before they went all hollywood."
15738,Leonard,she’s been here before.
14441,Leonard,"uh, oh, sorry."
12683,Leonard,"alright, oh wait, they use it to in…"
16396,Leonard,"i’m not going to do that, sheldon."
15198,Leonard,you won.
15570,Leonard,i’ll be damned.
20097,Leonard,"fun, i’ve never been there."
12100,Leonard,"she asked me to do her a favour, sheldon."
14360,Leonard,you’re kidding. never worked for me.
18931,Leonard,no.
19582,Leonard,"upon review, i’ve changed my mind about the cooper-hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. in fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like cooper and hofstadter."
17510,Leonard,"well, it’s not really a great time. penny and i have some things we need to talk about."
20395,Leonard,i wish that all the time. usually before i blow out birthday candles.
20667,Leonard,"oh, of course, because i’m the only adult around here."
15120,Leonard,stan lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
21581,Leonard,"you can stare at your board all day sheldon, she’s still going to be right. "
20338,Leonard,"i don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale."
21189,Leonard,see you guys at work.
12686,Leonard,"oh, i give up."
12690,Leonard,no you don’t. he doesn’t.
17743,Leonard,"trust me, it doesn’t."
17588,Leonard,no.
21045,Leonard,"oh, hey, sheldon."
15827,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t need an alibi. nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  thankyou. now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (sheldon writes “i doubt it” on leonard’s whiteboard."
17187,Leonard,hello? they gave me a band-aid. hospitals do not issue band-aids unless it is medically necessary. that is the law.
15110,Leonard,oh!
19940,Leonard,"okay, two friends each."
12634,Leonard,"you see, kandor was the capital city of the planet krypton, it was miniaturised by brainiac before krypton exploded and then rescued by superman. "
21642,Leonard,"yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
15928,Leonard,you think?
16375,Leonard,"hit the… hey, sweetie. yeah, i’m sorry. i’m gonna be working late. i, i, i miss you, too. okay, sure, i’ll call you when i get home. okay, bye-bye."
20808,Leonard,hey.
12470,Leonard,then he and i are on equal ground.
15215,Leonard,"why don’t i just start? sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
16678,Leonard,wouldn’t you rather bring sheldon?
21157,Leonard,"sorry, stuart."
16957,Leonard,"well, ho-hold on. what if the wizard casts a helmet of confusion spell on billy the kid’s cowboy hat?"
14872,Leonard,"you are, it’s just…"
16247,Leonard,hi.
17162,Leonard,"well, technically, this would be an alpha test. a beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…"
13230,Leonard,"first i want to say that it’s not sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. "
18860,Leonard,great.
18827,Leonard,"well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"
12374,Leonard,"if penny didn’t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, penny, thought that i should her, lesley, out, indicating that she, penny, had no interest in me asking her, penny, out. but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she, lesley, had turned me down then she, penny, could be offering consolation. that’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. but while thinking, good, leonard remains available. "
14029,Leonard,"yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!"
12424,Leonard,are you even listening to me?
15009,Leonard,"you had some nice moves out there, howard."
14843,Leonard,has it ever worked?
16905,Leonard,sorry. do you think i’m overdressed?
13967,Leonard,"here’s your tea, mother."
21459,Leonard,"relax. i know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
12308,Leonard,"sorry about your car, by the way."
18625,Leonard,i take it back. that was funny.
19838,Leonard,"it’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. i mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
13982,Leonard,"yeah i, i thought you guys might hit it off."
15340,Leonard,"yeah, it’s just one sneeze.  you’re on your own."
17542,Leonard,"yup. i told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, i’d take him for ice cream."
16047,Leonard,"it’s not boring at all. you see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…"
20969,Leonard,why does she get that? we never got that.
21366,Leonard,"sure, or you can."
17591,Leonard,"oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? oh, oh, a hot dog."
13466,Leonard,seriously? you’re not coming?
16283,Leonard,"yeah, good. new contacts. i should have done this years ago."
13794,Leonard,"you know, ’cause you’re so into science."
18288,Leonard,"so now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
17781,Leonard,"i’m no expert, but i think the hook has to go through the worm."
20665,Leonard,leave me alone.
18982,Leonard,"yeah, i think i would."
16616,Leonard,i don’t know. why?
14071,Leonard,szechuan palace closed two years ago.
21520,Leonard,"well, i don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, i’ll find a way to deal with it."
12397,Leonard,"pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
20443,Leonard,not really.
19502,Leonard,"sheldon, i, i’m sorry if i hurt your feelings. i’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
15334,Leonard,what am i smelling?
17602,Leonard,"because he’s hard to find. if he was easy to find, the books would be called there’s waldo."
14497,Leonard,"i’m not saying it was bad, i’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
13644,Leonard,"thank you, dr. cooper."
13176,Leonard,it’s also not pink and has no berries.
19521,Leonard,"i don’t want to talk about it. there, the place is all yours."
14673,Leonard,"there’s no fooling you. now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
19847,Leonard,"great. now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it."
19446,Leonard,"because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
12678,Leonard,excuse me. is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
17572,Leonard,"not yet, but i can remove unwanted hair from two miles away."
16803,Leonard,more halloween candy? didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
17126,Leonard,"obviously, when i saw that you were in ours, i went and used another one."
20951,Leonard,"good. then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
14996,Leonard,they call themselves bozites?
19256,Leonard,"i think what penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a roomba."
17954,Leonard,no.
16739,Leonard,got it. can i have my water?
18018,Leonard,i’m not saying that.
21081,Leonard,then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
14089,Leonard,"yeah, i wish."
15804,Leonard,no.
19144,Leonard,"yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate."
21455,Leonard,she’s kidding.
14834,Leonard,"actually, my tests of the aharonov-bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
19606,Leonard,"mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation."
14959,Leonard,what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
13117,Leonard,"it was penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up."
21217,Leonard,okay.
21722,Leonard,dr. cooper?
12041,Leonard,hi. again.
20189,Leonard,"sure. so, are we doing this?"
12949,Leonard,some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. 
15130,Leonard,that’s bruce lee.
16270,Leonard,long before the cats. i think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. i still have some of the currency.
17828,Leonard,i can’t blame you. tiny twister was a complete bust.
12786,Leonard,"yes, "
19394,Leonard,the doctor said i should be out of surgery by ten.
20143,Leonard,no gym shorts that can be yanked down.
16648,Leonard,"taking shorts off. there we go. naked, naked, naked!"
17999,Leonard,"uh, where what is?"
13061,Leonard,"we all make mistakes, let’s move on. "
15714,Leonard,"yeah, what?"
17702,Leonard,"actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre fridays."
16790,Leonard,"oh. watch out, sheldon. this little boy casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
13436,Leonard,"so, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. once again, i’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach snapple into a helium neon laser. short answer is… don’t. and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is dr. sheldon cooper. dr. cooper?"
20062,Leonard,hey.
19418,Leonard,really?
21397,Leonard,"you didn’t do anything, it’s sheldon. that’d make a nice needlepoint pillow."
14572,Leonard,let’s go.
20997,Leonard,"well, she moved in across the hall."
18946,Leonard,really?
17140,Leonard,"see, she knew what always meant."
12976,Leonard,"so, when it’s your turn you can."
15372,Leonard,"i, um, i don’t follow."
19356,Leonard,"wow, you look amazing."
15681,Leonard,"right, right. so you’re still just texting and emailing? you don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
14745,Leonard,"thanks, stuart. let me ask you something. do you think it’s okay for penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
17578,Leonard,what do you got?
16194,Leonard,"oh, don’t say that. you’re a very attractive woman."
21492,Leonard,more.
12091,Leonard,"come on, i’ll show you the trick with the shower."
14609,Leonard,see? ruined.
18891,Leonard,aren’t you gonna ask me?
21413,Leonard,bye.
19996,Leonard,and you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
13153,Leonard,what about if you went out with me?
18919,Leonard,what?
12387,Leonard,"no. no, there’s nothing going on between penny and me."
12295,Leonard,"good. good. and what about your, uh, hallway friend."
20822,Leonard,i’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
14593,Leonard,uh-huh.
13572,Leonard,i’m going to the office.
20413,Leonard,"sheldon, i accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. i’m not in a position to just say you can come."
17224,Leonard,"s’mores, huh? good for you."
19338,Leonard,"oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at benihana last night."
20417,Leonard,they’re not going on the trip.
12500,Leonard,probably. 
15104,Leonard,"sheldon, at this point, i would go by myself before i would take you."
14566,Leonard,"i’m not. and penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
19598,Leonard,"and you as well, mr. our-premise-is-intriguing."
14320,Leonard,about what?
12314,Leonard,"why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
16181,Leonard,"i repeat, not gonna happen."
13447,Leonard,"oh, yeah. no, we were just going."
21656,Leonard,or it could be sy-fee.
16146,Leonard,"oh, dr. siebert, twelve o’clock."
20707,Leonard,sure. i’d like to meet her.
18709,Leonard,"fine. i’m not sure you should have quit. but if you care so much what i think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?"
16867,Leonard,did you try calling her on the telephone?
18773,Leonard,how long should we stay?
14735,Leonard,"calm down, we’ll make the movie."
20091,Leonard,what are you talking about?
15490,Leonard,"uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
21354,Leonard,"every hotel is booked. but, yeah, see this space here between sheldon’s feet and my head? that’s where you go."
18785,Leonard,moo-stache.
13552,Leonard,what’s the emergency?
20904,Leonard,"yes, you can."
18296,Leonard,aw.
13373,Leonard,yes.
15491,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. we were just in different places in the relationship.
18617,Leonard,what happened?
20350,Leonard,we will.
18110,Leonard,yeah. just thought i’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
16357,Leonard,"uh, we are. in the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
18098,Leonard,"my point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real."
13829,Leonard,not yet.
16442,Leonard,"oh, hold on, howard. there’s lots of better times."
14582,Leonard,"don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
17582,Leonard,"i don’t have a problem with stuart. besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store."
19363,Leonard,"no, you wouldn’t have."
21078,Leonard,"i wet the bed until college, but i don’t think that’s a quality fix."
13995,Leonard,no.
18339,Leonard,"yeah, but sheldon and amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. they have each other for that. so, how was school?"
18695,Leonard,no.
13077,Leonard,i don’t celebrate my birthday.
17970,Leonard,great. i’ll go get my stuff.
14463,Leonard,it’s a snowflake. from the north pole.
20978,Leonard,"yeah. wow, an appearance by george lucas… ‘s dermatologist. oh, i want that autograph."
13586,Leonard, thank you.
17859,Leonard,you do that?
19426,Leonard,how come you’re up so late?
18912,Leonard,what about loop quantum gravity?
12728,Leonard,i don’t know what to say. 
13910,Leonard,so you’re a little behind on your bills. everybody gets behind on their bills.
18822,Leonard,"but penny, this was your idea. you said that i should stand up to him."
21299,Leonard,"it’s just a theory. uh, it’s not even worked out."
16899,Leonard,"well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. "
16036,Leonard,"look, i know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but i’m a little warm, so i’m going to turn it down."
20086,Leonard,what is this?
15269,Leonard,i’m not pressuring you.
16771,Leonard,"uh, yeah, it’s raj’s sister. it’s kind of tough. she’s in india. also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
14216,Leonard,"come on, howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
20445,Leonard,she meant emily.
20799,Leonard,"this is sheldon’s mother, mary."
18507,Leonard,"oh, oh, no, no. it’s because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held. according to father solakian, no one attended. luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. i lit a candle and prayed for your death but i’m not armenian, so it probably won’t work. this is over, right?"
21360,Leonard,"oh, why? do you not want to go?"
19451,Leonard,and you found somebody you could push around?
19853,Leonard,"what about when we went to comic-con and dressed like jabba the hutt? you got to be jabba’s head, and i got to be his fat slug butt."
12762,Leonard,here we go. 
20626,Leonard,"well, never have i ever used sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink."
18795,Leonard,i’m putting all this stuff in storage. we don’t need any of it.
21557,Leonard,"knowing sheldon, nothing."
19566,Leonard,"you know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal."
19464,Leonard,i don’t know. there’s still a bird in here. we are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
18080,Leonard,what information?
20691,Leonard,"you know, you don’t need to use sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement."
20941,Leonard,yeah.
17208,Leonard,i’m gonna go home and take a nap.
14240,Leonard,"you’re right, i really should be asking strangers on the internet."
19105,Leonard,"all right, fine. hey, can you think of a reason i shouldn’t invite amy to come with me?"
12898,Leonard,"howard, sit down."
15634,Leonard,"okay, we need to talk."
19375,Leonard,thank you.
18568,Leonard,thanks.
15180,Leonard,"okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
18401,Leonard,laser’s warmed up.
13088,Leonard,"look, i am in the halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24/7."
15539,Leonard,hmm? how much you got?
14424,Leonard,"yes, okay, but i’m gonna be gone for three months. what if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
18438,Leonard,"no, no, it’s okay. it’s really thoughtful."
13139,Leonard,i’m pretty sure i never said that. 
15455,Leonard,"now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
18295,Leonard,great. 
14709,Leonard,nice meeting all of you.
20550,Leonard,thank you for your time.
13588,Leonard,"so, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
19492,Leonard,"look at you, being all mature."
21591,Leonard,hey.
18907,Leonard,"so, business in the front, science in the back."
21655,Leonard,"hello? oh, my god! is he okay?"
17507,Leonard,"absolutely. you’re the girl, i’m the guy. now, you watch your football game while i make you a little plate here."
21735,Leonard,yes.
14698,Leonard,"okay, yeah. i can see the difference."
15661,Leonard,"why can’t he have a desk, sheldon?"
19432,Leonard,why not?
21208,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on with you?"
20057,Leonard,"oh, great, there’s mandy."
20461,Leonard,is that a big deal?
21686,Leonard,you’re right. this is even weirder than i thought.
16880,Leonard,her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
16328,Leonard,"of course, i did. i talked and talked and talked."
14182,Leonard,what?
18002,Leonard,"no, tell me."
18878,Leonard,"uh, uh, does it at least pay well?"
18750,Leonard,i wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
15206,Leonard,"we can help you. we can be your team. like, uh, professor xavier and his x-men."
18984,Leonard,it’s just such a big decision. i don’t want to have any regrets.
20220,Leonard,"no, nothing. we just changed our mind."
14663,Leonard,of course not. why would they be? why would i ask? why am i rambling? why don’t you stop me?
18435,Leonard,"this is great. it, thank you, it’s, so much."
13129,Leonard,actually it’s not all that easy to find. 
20242,Leonard,you bought her a ring?
16121,Leonard,"okay, good night."
17112,Leonard,"yeah, except for when i got the foot cramp."
16209,Leonard,still arguing over which csi is the best?
13292,Leonard,thank you.
13216,Leonard,where are you gonna live? 
20047,Leonard,"hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?"
21294,Leonard,this train thing worked out better than i thought. he’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
18117,Leonard,go away.
13032,Leonard,"if the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight? "
13783,Leonard,he tried to take nude photos of you?
18277,Leonard,so am i driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
15923,Leonard,you’ll never guess what just happened.
15141,Leonard,"oh, hey, buddy. how’d it go?"
14812,Leonard,are you really admitting defeat?
16638,Leonard,"so, here we are. back in bed together."
14454,Leonard,"what? uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
17706,Leonard,"yeah, it was."
14401,Leonard,yeah.
21198,Leonard,why?
12893,Leonard,"oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. he only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
15071,Leonard,how does that involve air travel?
15983,Leonard,no. what happened?
20902,Leonard,"sheldon. we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you. so have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, i don’t care."
17646,Leonard,it’s great. i love it.
19310,Leonard,that is amazing. how long have you been collecting?
17892,Leonard,"yeah, that sounds fun."
14955,Leonard,so what? it’s the same food.
12551,Leonard,we don’t order egg rolls.
13830,Leonard,nice little bot you’ve got here.
13013,Leonard,"okay. i did not want to do this but, i have here the rare mint condition production error star trek: the next generation geordi laforge, without his visor in the original packaging. if you do not get out of my way, i will open it. "
21156,Leonard,"sheldon, howard and i are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
14176,Leonard,"so they steamed your dumplings, get over it. new topic, please."
17246,Leonard,what the hell are you doing?
15596,Leonard,i’m going to my room.
16594,Leonard,i don’t want to talk to amy.
19614,Leonard,thank you.
21569,Leonard,you think you should call amy?
16856,Leonard,"oh, my god, you are amazing. i mean, i don’t deserve you. wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
15536,Leonard,thank you.
14343,Leonard,"you know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. you know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. and, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
12028,Leonard,"leonard, sheldon."
16606,Leonard,what are you doing?
15316,Leonard,his mother?
15232,Leonard,yeah.
20537,Leonard,"yeah, well, don’t be a stranger."
15321,Leonard,you’re taking him to disneyland?
19675,Leonard,"yeah. you get the paint, i’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this."
17166,Leonard,"um, i’m not sure, but i think the right answer here is no."
18550,Leonard,"yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. they faked the results."
13817,Leonard,"okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
12447,Leonard,"hey, sorry we’re late. "
15564,Leonard,i am looking at you.
17031,Leonard,really?
13147,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i know that part. "
19727,Leonard,public restroom kit. everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
19920,Leonard,"oh, really? that’s too bad."
16124,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
13402,Leonard,"sheldon, i told you, i only have access to the free-electron laser at night. i can’t drive you for the next few weeks."
21524,Leonard,not if i want to be doing this later.
20334,Leonard,"well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?"
17678,Leonard,"no, i, i mean, it was good. there were just a few things that needed a little polishing."
15683,Leonard,"no, no. maybe a little."
20759,Leonard,you do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
16105,Leonard,"uh, sure."
13832,Leonard,"neat. good work. sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
16423,Leonard,no.
20530,Leonard,"okay, i’d better go in there and talk to him."
18230,Leonard,"yeah. and i’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and i’d hate to do anything that screws that up."
17375,Leonard,"well, hand it over so i can open it."
15055,Leonard,"okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. and let’s see, who’s left? oh, that’s right. my plans. isn’t anyone going to ask?"
21382,Leonard,"no. he can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. i want to say india, but it seems mean."
13601,Leonard,"howard, come on, i didn’t plan on this. these things just happen. usually not to me, but they do happen."
15758,Leonard,"the hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. so, priya, what brings you back to la?"
14908,Leonard,are you guys drunk?
20697,Leonard,that’s true.
12256,Leonard,"no, but you’re right. i should march over there and ask her out. "
20475,Leonard,we are young and fun.
20598,Leonard,"so, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner."
20038,Leonard,"okay, that is the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard."
14286,Leonard,"okay, i hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, i’m pretty sure she is a prostitute."
14642,Leonard,approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. approaching them does.
16645,Leonard,"okay, like usual. good."
20773,Leonard,"okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here."
20647,Leonard,"no, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s batman, but if man-man dresses as a bat, that’s batman-man."
21435,Leonard,i don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.
19031,Leonard,you okay?
12315,Leonard,interesting.
13858,Leonard,"what i’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
20650,Leonard,really? the guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? how is that possible?
20310,Leonard,"huh? some of this? and, since it’s thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?"
18592,Leonard,i will. excuse me.
16367,Leonard,really?
14271,Leonard,"sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
20766,Leonard,he’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
20343,Leonard,i know. it’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
21540,Leonard,"ah, we’ll miss you, too."
17390,Leonard,give it a second. 
13611,Leonard,"okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?"
17973,Leonard,is that so?
17222,Leonard,since when don’t you knock? it’s like the only good thing about you.
13654,Leonard,"me, too."
14883,Leonard,"fine, mom. how are you?"
20614,Leonard,have you been outside in the rain with sheldon?
14550,Leonard,"howard, what did you do?"
16404,Leonard,"oh, god."
17256,Leonard,"it doesn’t matter what i say, you’re gonna tell me anyway."
12005,Leonard,"agreed, what’s your point?"
16721,Leonard,buh-buh-buh-buh! what do you want for it?
20471,Leonard,"no, i don’t need any fish nibbling my business."
15980,Leonard,no.
13774,Leonard,"yes, please shut up. so, um, dave, don’t you think you and i should get back to the lab? you know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself."
15403,Leonard,she let me.
19273,Leonard,"sure. in my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
20040,Leonard,what is happening?
21637,Leonard,"oh, that’s right. thursday is stan lee day."
12159,Leonard,"sheldon, this is not your home."
17300,Leonard,"sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
13368,Leonard,anythingforagreencard.com?
13744,Leonard,you want to work with me?
13365,Leonard,good night.
20945,Leonard,won’t.
14166,Leonard,"sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
21029,Leonard,"fine, i told sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now i’m all confused."
15045,Leonard,that’ll be all. that was fun.
20281,Leonard,"really? how many grown-ups do you know who have mr. spock oven mitts? hey, the recipes are on my ipad. will you pull ’em up?"
20358,Leonard,that’s true.
16257,Leonard,it certainly is.
20873,Leonard,is that a retinal scanner?
18656,Leonard,come on. it’s okay.
17711,Leonard,did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
12626,Leonard,you forbid it?
20695,Leonard,i don’t think so. why?
14457,Leonard,howard…
16896,Leonard,really? do we do that?
21403,Leonard,did you know raj moved out last night?
18222,Leonard,"oh, that’s awful."
18114,Leonard,"got it. oh. there. oh, yeah. yeah, now i’m feeling it. oh, this is great. i could do this for the rest of my life. hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did i read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?"
14934,Leonard,maybe we should just stop talking about this.
20266,Leonard,you just happen to have those in the car?
15195,Leonard,never!
21124,Leonard,"no. this is the level i am stooping to. i believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy."
19914,Leonard,"not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, i always had to earn it."
19089,Leonard,he just made that easier.
18107,Leonard,"thank you. i’m a naive idiot, right?"
18879,Leonard,what does your agent think?
19941,Leonard,fine. i want black-tie.
15384,Leonard,no.
18937,Leonard,i also love you.
14530,Leonard,"hey. uh, what did sheldon say to you?"
13248,Leonard,"uh, what about that girl last year at comic-con?"
17432,Leonard,just try it.
19179,Leonard,because it doesn’t matter. i don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
16704,Leonard,"now that howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
20116,Leonard,"it’s just where i need them. you know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space."
12872,Leonard,"well, we’re not in india. "
19710,Leonard,i’m the one who thought of it.
19263,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
19767,Leonard,"the glass is empty, sheldon. it’s completely empty. if you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?"
20192,Leonard,done.
17979,Leonard,since when don’t you want to live with me?
12990,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe.
12722,Leonard,"oh, come on!"
19107,Leonard,thanks again for coming. six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
15790,Leonard,it doesn’t?
19948,Leonard,"yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together."
16399,Leonard,"so, what’s the gossip?"
18701,Leonard,of course i do. she’s a great actress. i’m proud she’s taking this risk.
19865,Leonard,it gets a bad rap from shows like jersey shore and real housewives.
20899,Leonard,"no, you don’t. but let’s say you do. and don’t say you do, because you don’t. now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
15278,Leonard,i don’t know. why?
14260,Leonard,yes
12050,Leonard,at least i didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
14230,Leonard,problem?
13580,Leonard,i’ve had her brisket. melts in your mouth.
13059,Leonard,"he’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
21620,Leonard,"i’m really very busy. is there any way that we can put this off until i have more time to prepare? of course. but, uh, you understand my trepidation."
14502,Leonard,"no, look, mumbai palace."
13391,Leonard,uh-huh.
17159,Leonard,"oh, i can take it slow. did i ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, karen berberick? to this day she doesn’t know we were going out. made it easier on her when i broke things off."
15420,Leonard,"as it turns out, she was a north korean spy. luckily, sheldon drove her out before i revealed anything important. which i’m not saying i would have."
18450,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
18380,Leonard,i… uh…
19533,Leonard,"howard’s right, that’ll never work."
16336,Leonard,"yes. there, i said it."
17427,Leonard,"when was the last time you were at best buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in russia”?"
19122,Leonard,"hippos are the deadliest creature. a half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
14537,Leonard,"we did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
16830,Leonard,"oh, that’s not who i am."
17403,Leonard,"hey, i got to hand it to raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
13765,Leonard,"uh, yeah. i guess."
12742,Leonard,"there is no leo, how can you say that? "
18837,Leonard,sorry.
17125,Leonard,"yeah, well, so was i."
20624,Leonard,"oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. we’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac."
18361,Leonard,you ready to go?
19391,Leonard,"well, i do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike."
18808,Leonard,"she’s right, a committee that important should meet more often."
18167,Leonard,hire him to do what?
18727,Leonard,yeah.
21028,Leonard,ghobe’ 
14964,Leonard,how is that going to help them?
20481,Leonard,what? congratulations.
13461,Leonard,"ah, hey leslie."
16974,Leonard,we should go easy on him. amy’s out with stuart tonight.
15178,Leonard,"you know what? i am ending this. penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. she gave it to me, i have it. i’m sending it back. where’s the ring?"
12317,Leonard,then i guess congratulations are in order.
20046,Leonard,"if you don’t mind waiting for a groupon, we can try marriage counselling."
20574,Leonard,i’ll show you how to do one.
18881,Leonard,"just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?"
16159,Leonard,why?
13917,Leonard,your ex-boyfriend?
18113,Leonard,right. this one might be broken.
16758,Leonard,can we get autographed dolls?
17243,Leonard,"doesn’t look happy, so i’m guessing he wants to talk to sheldon."
13245,Leonard,"you know what, i’m happy that penny’s moving on. it gives me the freedom to move on myself."
21623,Leonard,"hey, penny, it’s leonard. good news, you can take your head out of the oven."
12754,Leonard,"gee, why wouldn’t i?"
18320,Leonard,this stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. i’m telling her i’m quitting.
13728,Leonard,what speech?
16772,Leonard,"please pester her. please, for me."
16885,Leonard,cuddles?
12814,Leonard,then why did i have to crawl? 
18309,Leonard,do you think penny’s mad at me?
21219,Leonard,thanks.
18224,Leonard,"anyway, stephen hawking’s team is looking into that, and i’ve been invited to join them."
19798,Leonard,i went to school for half my life. i have a doctorate. i’m still paying off college loans.
15442,Leonard,"i don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
19906,Leonard,"so, mom, you haven’t seen penny since we got engaged."
13353,Leonard,sheldon!
14380,Leonard,"you could have waited until morning. i know, look who i’m talking to."
16655,Leonard,"i don’t know about this, howard."
15214,Leonard,why don’t we just talk?
18305,Leonard,couples sounds great. or we could mix things up. maybe pick names out of a hat. whatever.
21119,Leonard,"sheldon, i know what you did, now change the password back."
15538,Leonard,it’s no big deal.
18143,Leonard,they did.
21259,Leonard,"yeah, sure. he really worked with the drug enforcement agency?"
13983,Leonard,"i hate to tell you, but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd."
19808,Leonard,hello? what is this?
17886,Leonard,to show people when they don’t believe me.
12291,Leonard,we both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
16156,Leonard,"face it, raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
16822,Leonard,"you know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then i would be fine with that."
18402,Leonard,"no, no, what are you doing? he’s both happy and quiet. it’s like seeing a unicorn and bigfoot at the same time."
14713,Leonard,"there you go, she has to pick up her friend justin at the airport, aand i can’t play ’cause i’m going with her, right?"
21058,Leonard,that’s true. sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
16193,Leonard,thank you.
17262,Leonard,"i’m sorry. so, listen, i heard something about him. can you keep it between us?"
17977,Leonard,"well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels."
21371,Leonard,that’s not it because you’re clearly upset.
15993,Leonard,hey.
16066,Leonard,"oh sheldon, stop it."
12923,Leonard,we are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
20949,Leonard,"when you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. you just have to keep communicating."
13446,Leonard,"uh-huh. the viewing area’s right over there. sheldon, your girl… date… person… ramona’s here."
13024,Leonard,maybe she’s his lawyer.
14354,Leonard,comic book store.
18186,Leonard,"that’s too bad. but still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
17348,Leonard,"raj, imperial troopers on your tail."
18460,Leonard,"oh, god."
12288,Leonard,"stop asking me all these questions, i need to take another shower."
14061,Leonard,"no, it’s leslie winkle. it’s a long story."
17548,Leonard,"mmm, doesn’t matter. half the time, he just ends up playing with the box."
21420,Leonard,tina?
16895,Leonard,"i know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
18850,Leonard,"come on, guys. raj put a lot of effort into this. and that’s great. it’s not sad, it’s great."
20238,Leonard,when did we get a floor safe?
17381,Leonard,like it was ten hours ago. what about it?
21497,Leonard,"honestly? it’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
17841,Leonard,i didn’t steal anyone.
15483,Leonard,"great. maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
16061,Leonard,no.
18538,Leonard,"well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited zack."
20365,Leonard,that’s just crazy. how would my going in there even help you?
20608,Leonard,anything you’d like to say to him?
16833,Leonard,now we’re getting somewhere.
14948,Leonard,would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
20186,Leonard,do you want liquid helium or not?
18500,Leonard,"oh, i’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so i can return the dvd and see the look on sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that i didn’t let this get to me."
18064,Leonard,"uh, excellent question. um, i suppose i’ve always been into science, you know. my mother and father are scientists, so i was kind of led in that direction. uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. to be honest with you guys, when i was your age, i wanted to be a rap star. like snoop dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. yeah, no, sure, you laugh. just like my mother did. after i confided, i was derided and chided, my moms and i collided. she said my dreams were misguided. that’s just a little freestyle."
16517,Leonard,"howard and his mother are at the hospital. come on, we gotta go."
13608,Leonard,she doesn’t mean it. she’s just being nice.
19019,Leonard,oh. then i guess i’m in.
12807,Leonard,fine.
12717,Leonard,do you have a cousin leopold.
20684,Leonard,"penny, but…"
14406,Leonard,"i can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. oh, son of a bitch!"
19258,Leonard,"so, one of my favourite video games of all time is called shadow of the colossus, and it was only for playstation 2, but then they came out with a new version for ps3 with better graphics. i finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. or something about yoga."
14181,Leonard,why are you making it worse?
15543,Leonard,"no, no, don’t ask."
15705,Leonard,no.
16277,Leonard,"yeah, if i had contacts i would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
12465,Leonard,oh no.
19269,Leonard,"the car was a gift, it was something you needed. i was happy to help you out."
20756,Leonard,"that is very mature of you, so i’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
19869,Leonard,i don’t think so.
19984,Leonard,"oh, no. seriously?"
20414,Leonard,"fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come."
19572,Leonard,is your tongue blue?
20713,Leonard,"good, it’s not just me."
21646,Leonard,"oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
21367,Leonard,i don’t have a problem with your driving.
14999,Leonard,"aye, aye, captain."
12393,Leonard,oh yeah. but doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
19439,Leonard,"okay, how do we catch it?"
14155,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
13945,Leonard,"sheldon, not now."
18137,Leonard,"how about it, sheldon?"
14976,Leonard,"he’s right, penny. it’s all there."
17188,Leonard,thank you for hiding my star wars socks at the emergency room. is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
18282,Leonard,why would anyone claim to be from new jersey if they weren’t?
20495,Leonard,the same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. you.
20649,Leonard,you mean like through their window from behind a bush?
20331,Leonard,"yup, she’s right. for every newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an edison who was just a jerk. that could totally be you."
12873,Leonard,"okay, that was uncalled for."
12043,Leonard,"anyway, um. we brought home indian food. and, um. i know that moving can be stressful, and i find that when i’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. also, curry is a natural laxative, and i don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
16368,Leonard,i’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
20892,Leonard,you only had one.
15744,Leonard,uh…
17328,Leonard,"you mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
20108,Leonard,"guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?"
13449,Leonard,"let’s go. okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is."
17549,Leonard,"no, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track."
12442,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, there’s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
17737,Leonard,"no problem, brother. stay frosty.  we’re still dating, right?"
20591,Leonard,"oh, you’re good at this."
17155,Leonard,"excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
21396,Leonard,perfect timing. food’s ready.
16969,Leonard,"sure, sure. uh, when will stuart be back?"
18303,Leonard,it’s not funny.
13235,Leonard,absolutely.  oh bite me! 
14831,Leonard,"relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
12239,Leonard,"pfff, i’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. anyway, i was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. "
18445,Leonard,"oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him."
13266,Leonard,i kind of have other plans tonight.
18853,Leonard,so one of us came back from the future to murder stuart?
17469,Leonard,"there’s howard’s rocket, live from kazakhstan."
12503,Leonard,so? we’ll start now.
15267,Leonard,we really need a strike here.
12474,Leonard,hello penny. hello kurt.
15562,Leonard,i can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
18763,Leonard,"i don’t have a vet. i have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. you’d think i’d have a vet."
18020,Leonard,"okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that."
15898,Leonard,hugh who?
18398,Leonard,"sheldon, i’ve known you a long time, and i’m going to tell you this with all the love i can possibly muster. amy’s right. you’re wrong."
18996,Leonard,i don’t know. the bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in schindler’s list is tough to beat.
21346,Leonard,she’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
15544,Leonard,what the hell? what’s the matter?
12367,Leonard,what happened to elliot wong?
20232,Leonard,why is he writing to you?
18522,Leonard,"yeah, they are."
16493,Leonard,you’re kidding. 3-d?
13718,Leonard,"not specifically, but, uh, i did tell her that i had feelings."
15947,Leonard,maybe i could go in a little late.
12947,Leonard,"wait, i don’t think it’s shatner."
14162,Leonard,amazon offers one-day rush.
18108,Leonard,hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. mrs. davis.
17849,Leonard,yeah. and the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
16798,Leonard,"sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. what’s that word?"
12761,Leonard,how was your family?
12323,Leonard,"interesting, you should lead with that."
19072,Leonard,it’s not just that. my mother would kill me if i let something happen to him.
21490,Leonard,hot dogs.
16868,Leonard,"if you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
20871,Leonard,wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
18021,Leonard,glaringly obvious. go on.
21253,Leonard,"oh. yeah. okay, sure. what’s going on with your brother?"
14734,Leonard,what?
14973,Leonard,but you don’t like other people.
21626,Leonard,"okay, how’s that?"
18126,Leonard,do anything interesting today?
13232,Leonard,"a place for fun, a place for knowledge. see, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal. "
20512,Leonard,"well, where’s that information been this whole time?"
12420,Leonard,your old tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. 
19709,Leonard,no.
19842,Leonard,all we have to do is rig up a 3-d communication system.
17930,Leonard,"oh, teacher! me! me!"
21665,Leonard,too casual?
16636,Leonard,how about when you put gps trackers in your garbage because you were convinced north korean spies were stealing your doodles? the chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. the strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. the time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
17333,Leonard,"we’ll miss you, sheldon."
16094,Leonard,i think her weekend just opened up.
19501,Leonard,you have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. it’s exhausting.
21093,Leonard,"yeah. i loved it. love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
13418,Leonard,watch out.
13923,Leonard,"oh, no. oh, you don’t want to do that."
16280,Leonard,"sorry! pardon me! oh, i’m so sorry! my fault! check it out. i just got contacts."
15196,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i was up in the administration office, and i happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science."
15546,Leonard,when would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
19844,Leonard,"yeah, you know what else it is?"
15349,Leonard,"are you hungry, thirsty? can i offer you anything?"
14210,Leonard,what are you doing?
19857,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re not in charge. raj is in charge."
18086,Leonard,"when you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution."
19331,Leonard,i wonder where dr. lorvis is. he’s been gone a while.
15037,Leonard,sounds like a great plan.
18818,Leonard,but the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
13064,Leonard,sit down.
20640,Leonard,"if that’s what you want to do, yes."
12453,Leonard,where do you get this stuff?
15199,Leonard,"hey, you didn’t want a slurpee at 7-eleven, you don’t get glasses."
20476,Leonard,it can be. confetti fight. maybe you should take a break. i got this.
18747,Leonard,a little.
19659,Leonard,why a turtle?
14703,Leonard,"oh, i guess so."
13530,Leonard,"thanks a lot, howard."
16333,Leonard,move out.
20690,Leonard,"you’re, you’re right, it feels good."
19555,Leonard,"no one told you to taste them. come on, is, is this good or not?"
14716,Leonard,"no, you didn’t."
18158,Leonard,"oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
18894,Leonard,sounds rough.
17550,Leonard,"no, no, no, no."
13508,Leonard,"no, no, no,  no, i don’t think that’s where it was."
13137,Leonard,"yes, you should, go ahead, say it. "
17133,Leonard,what?
15929,Leonard,penny kissing me is not insane. she used to kiss me all the time.
12410,Leonard,"i’m not sure, but i think i’m about to discover how the banana felt. "
12152,Leonard,"almost there, almost there, almost there. "
16931,Leonard,"come on, he’s not that cute."
16297,Leonard,no?
12790,Leonard,"howard, listen to me."
16102,Leonard,"it was a late-night vote. we were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. it’s not technically road trip god, it’s travel supervisor."
15001,Leonard,intellectually about 30 hours. emotionally about 29 years.
16150,Leonard,thanks.
14551,Leonard,why are you carrying extras?
15367,Leonard,something his mother taught him.
16924,Leonard,"no, i love them. i save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. and why did i let you eat them?"
20898,Leonard,you don’t.
12928,Leonard,here’s your tee-shirt.  
17396,Leonard,"look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
20724,Leonard,"yeah, mm-hmm."
20226,Leonard,can you give us a minute?
21134,Leonard,because you were being selfish.
14019,Leonard,"all right, mother. um, have a nice flight."
15711,Leonard,no.
20929,Leonard,"i’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together."
18676,Leonard,i know.
12733,Leonard,well… i don’t know what to say. 
21121,Leonard,"all right, i tried."
18644,Leonard,"look, do i think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? of course i do. but isn’t los angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? all right, look, we’ll come back to that."
14209,Leonard,golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
13784,Leonard,"oh, yeah. i’m so… oh, that’s terrible."
14201,Leonard,"it’s a little insulting, don’t you think?"
16164,Leonard,that was a great meal.
13359,Leonard,a lackey?
18420,Leonard,"buddy, i don’t think you can. i mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. this thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
15560,Leonard,this is ridiculous. i’m coming to talk to you.
12655,Leonard,let’s go.
21587,Leonard,vulcan nerve pinch!
13585,Leonard,"yeah, a couple."
12708,Leonard,well now you are.
21609,Leonard,hi sheldon.
16276,Leonard,i tried in the seventh grade. i could never get used to them.
16329,Leonard,bye.
15226,Leonard,"uh-uh, give it a minute."
21593,Leonard,"no, don’t, don’t…."
15893,Leonard,"thank you, amy."
14896,Leonard,"you’re right. i’m-i’m-i’m-i’m sorry, i’m way out of line!"
18218,Leonard,interesting that you would bring that up when i might go work on a boat.
18470,Leonard,he can’t help it. he can’t. he really can’t.
20218,Leonard,ma’am.
13845,Leonard,"yeah, i got the same one. and that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line."
21521,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, i’ll just, i’ll suck it up."
20487,Leonard,it’ll be fine. people have kids every day. you’ll figure this out.
18598,Leonard,"you know, maybe you and i wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself."
14460,Leonard,come on. we said we were sorry.
14171,Leonard,"we got an e-mail from the east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance. they want another thousand penny blossoms."
14985,Leonard,"god, sheldon. what the hell are you doing out there?"
19889,Leonard,"no need to. as soon as she flies into california airspace, i’ll feel a disturbance in the force."
18883,Leonard,"so, are you gonna see her again?"
18027,Leonard,yes?
20137,Leonard,that’ll teach her to care about your health.
12490,Leonard,it’s not your fault.
13582,Leonard,don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
16035,Leonard,what should we do?
16712,Leonard,"look, i know they have money. i don’t think it’s that much."
12129,Leonard,"uh, i’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up."
13053,Leonard,"that’s great, but i…."
21163,Leonard,did you at least have a good flight down there?
17922,Leonard,yeah. maybe wesley snipes and toucan sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
15029,Leonard,what?
17450,Leonard,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i screwed things up pretty good with penny."
16586,Leonard,hey.
14068,Leonard,"nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him."
21542,Leonard,"uh, could i talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
13826,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to call it off."
13279,Leonard,i sure hope so.
14753,Leonard,"oh, come on. sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that i don’t trust penny? sheldon? where did he go?"
16619,Leonard,"oh, good."
13656,Leonard,maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
19095,Leonard,i’d love to. i’m just about to do yoga with penny.
12782,Leonard,"alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. "
17506,Leonard,"i just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets."
14737,Leonard,"hang on. they’re showing a new digital print of time bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
12335,Leonard,what happened to your scrambled egg research?
15159,Leonard,seedy underbelly?
15024,Leonard,"yeah, well, he’s extra special. hey, shelly. what you doing?"
19235,Leonard,i don’t know. you did it to me.
21332,Leonard,"yeah. well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine."
17768,Leonard,i don’t have any.
15735,Leonard,the old unabomber approach. kudos.
16040,Leonard,"oh, yay for me. what about you guys? i can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
18754,Leonard,"got you a little something, too."
17006,Leonard,scrotum.
19020,Leonard,"not like, i guess i’m in. like i guess, i’m in!"
14919,Leonard,don’t worry. we’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
21652,Leonard,we’re going to have to be very quiet.
16477,Leonard,"that, that’s brilliant."
17075,Leonard,"we all do. now, how about dinner?"
16127,Leonard,no. why do you ask?
18486,Leonard,how about that? sheldon’s being reasonable.
17581,Leonard,it’ll be good to have him back.
16902,Leonard,"sheldon, just ignore him."
13467,Leonard,"okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is."
13152,Leonard,what about me?
15153,Leonard,"here’s spock’s head with no body. here’s mr. t’s body with no head. oh, yeah, here’s spock’s body with mr. t’s head. i pity the fool who’s illogical."
13938,Leonard,fine. just enjoy your little game. i’ll make this quest on my own.
14445,Leonard,"i missed you, too."
20013,Leonard,i’m okay.
18358,Leonard,"sorry, buddy."
16251,Leonard,you’re having people over?
15616,Leonard,i didn’t agree with him.
12574,Leonard,hi! 
16577,Leonard,what?
18990,Leonard,"hey, buddy. heard you’re having a rough day. you all right?"
19674,Leonard,"damn straight, almost 1am. and we weren’t even watching tv. we were watching netflix, like the kids do."
20521,Leonard,"uh, nice guy. but it was a little weird to hear batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."
16201,Leonard,"oh, nothing’s going on. excuse me."
21216,Leonard,"go ahead, it’s fine."
19541,Leonard,"you lie down, he’ll be here in a minute."
14736,Leonard,"hey. we’re, uh, going to the movies."
21284,Leonard,can we please stop talking about poodles?
12707,Leonard,"it’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. "
14763,Leonard,"it’s a little hard to explain. he does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
17906,Leonard,"our clothes, our wallets, phones."
16725,Leonard,will you shut up?
16575,Leonard,so. hot in india?
15834,Leonard,yes.
18869,Leonard,so go to the bathroom.
14311,Leonard,"uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. you know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
16537,Leonard,that’s nice. what about?
16796,Leonard,"thanks. you, too. you know, go ahead and take it."
14423,Leonard,"yes, obviously."
14811,Leonard,"i fell on the floor. all right, he got you, you can get him back."
13445,Leonard,"uh, the kitchen’s fine.  hey, what are you doing?"
15256,Leonard,"what? no, it’s okay. we don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. everything’s good."
13819,Leonard,"seriously? gamma rays? bruce banner? you didn’t get the incredible hulk from that? never mind, just, please go talk to him."
16289,Leonard,"no, no-no-no, i’m ready! i gave up the gift of sight for you. if that’s not moving on, what is?"
14075,Leonard,"oh, god, i wish i had."
18433,Leonard,you made the bed? you really are pulling out all the stops.
14773,Leonard,"i wish penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
20486,Leonard,"buddy, i, i think you might be overreacting."
13714,Leonard,hey.
18201,Leonard,"no, no, no, amy, wait. i know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? it’ll be fun."
13265,Leonard,terrific.
13531,Leonard,"hey, you guys are talking again. good. what happened?"
17443,Leonard,"again, i’m sorry. you know, with howard and bernadette getting married, i got caught up in a little wedding fever. i take it back."
20356,Leonard,"yeah. no matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again."
17201,Leonard,"oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?"
20739,Leonard,not a lot. i just couldn’t start until you walked away.
21035,Leonard,"ooh, maybe i could turn it into a gaming den."
20442,Leonard,"yeah, just get it over with."
12875,Leonard,"yeah, mission accomplished. "
18868,Leonard,if only there were a solution to that.
13754,Leonard,ow! ow!
14163,Leonard,don’t yell at me. i’m not manufacturing. i’m just web design.
16432,Leonard,"man, he’s going to be blindsided."
18055,Leonard,"guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game"
20674,Leonard,"howard, just come in here."
17514,Leonard,penny and i have some issues we need to talk about.
14752,Leonard,"okay, yeah, it’s true, but i can live with that stuff. what i can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
16815,Leonard,thanks.
21011,Leonard,i wouldn’t worry about it. she’s probably just distracted by work.
12706,Leonard,"i couldn’t say that, i would have to say, you were terrific and i can’t wait to hear you sing again. "
18251,Leonard,what is it?
17405,Leonard,"whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping j-bombs, don’t you think?"
21236,Leonard,"would you please help us make a relationship agreement? but one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule. "
18260,Leonard,"no, it’s a drinking game. whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!"
19584,Leonard,somebody else do it.
19816,Leonard,"that’s pretty cool, sheldon."
20731,Leonard,why didn’t you say something?
16425,Leonard,"well, the point is, if this got out, it would destroy howard and raj’s friendship."
18330,Leonard,it’s just a bunch of pants.
12179,Leonard,morning. 
17662,Leonard,is it possible we’re having two different conversations?
14365,Leonard,"no doubt, no doubt. okay, well, i’m sorry it didn’t work out."
13298,Leonard,"wait, where are you going?"
20908,Leonard,"um, i don’t really know how to say this."
13991,Leonard,he lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
21013,Leonard,she’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
18536,Leonard,come on.
18645,Leonard,"that is not what i said. look, i think you’re really good. i truly do. but this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. i mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
21773,Leonard,"oh, this just might be your lucky day."
15155,Leonard,"ooh, look, an indiana jones connect-the-dots."
20244,Leonard,you did go pfft.
13578,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
21255,Leonard,"well, i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. how long do you think he’ll stay?"
14020,Leonard,morning.
15166,Leonard,give me that.
17940,Leonard,"i know you’re joking, but i’d be okay with that."
17944,Leonard,ow!
21394,Leonard,i don’t know. yours looks like he has worms.
17433,Leonard,i have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
12067,Leonard,well it sounds wonderful.
17369,Leonard,it’s broken.
15312,Leonard,i guess not.
19351,Leonard,you’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
20099,Leonard,"hey, watch your speed. i hear the mexican police target tourists."
16348,Leonard,"oh, no, not glenn?"
17684,Leonard,wow.
15075,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been through this. i’m taking penny."
20703,Leonard,that sounds fun.
19716,Leonard,subtle.
21066,Leonard,right. be polite.
13612,Leonard,what landing party?
16176,Leonard,i think so.
12014,Leonard,okay.
15325,Leonard,"yeah, don’t let goofy near him. he’ll have nightmares and i’ll have to deal with it."
20869,Leonard,"well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
18755,Leonard,"it gets better. instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
15482,Leonard,"how am i supposed to let it go? you used me for sex! morning, mrs. gunderson."
19924,Leonard,hey.
15612,Leonard,really? silence?
20617,Leonard,i don’t think i’ve lit a real fire before.
19276,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, hear me out. i know things got a little weird last night."
12862,Leonard,"howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. "
19419,Leonard,"so, was there anything that professor abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?"
19405,Leonard,"hey. hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important."
18720,Leonard,"well, this is it, this is it. this is it."
18854,Leonard,does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off terminator?
15165,Leonard,what are you doing?
16358,Leonard,"well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
12513,Leonard,"you know, penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime."
13746,Leonard,"congratulations on the macarthur grant, by the way. big fan."
15263,Leonard,it’s good that we got out and did something physical.
18132,Leonard,do it.
21266,Leonard,"i’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
16874,Leonard,"i’m single, i don’t need this crap."
13715,Leonard,thank you.
19333,Leonard,oh-hom yeah.
21430,Leonard,"well, what am i supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
19518,Leonard,"hello, can you hear me? sheldon, i haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years."
16824,Leonard,come on.
15458,Leonard,"yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
17158,Leonard,"well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. have you ever tried it?"
20761,Leonard,people do it all the time.
14436,Leonard,"hey, guys, can i just say something? how about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? this is literally the top of the world. only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
13355,Leonard,you can stop smiling now.
12567,Leonard,"there’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher. "
19945,Leonard,"yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff."
16766,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
14884,Leonard,now i’m less fine.
12406,Leonard,"hey, lesley."
21305,Leonard,okay. this is everything he had on the board. i’m sure we can figure the rest out.
15251,Leonard,get into what? why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? they’ve been in your life a long time. they make you happy. they deserve to know.
21105,Leonard,"keep the clock, sheldon."
18584,Leonard,"hey, buddy."
13347,Leonard,"and when we go in there, let’s show raj that we’re happy for him."
19046,Leonard,i’m not.
15395,Leonard,we’ll all be naked in front of each other.
21658,Leonard,"oh, yeah, i’m feeling it."
16676,Leonard,what’s in the bag?
16052,Leonard,"well, yes, and you’re listed as chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief operating officer."
18459,Leonard,"okay, we’re almost ready to go. once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes."
21478,Leonard,"oh, hello. join us."
13220,Leonard,i still don’t know why you left.
19202,Leonard,will you stay out of this?
21633,Leonard,laser.
15306,Leonard,"okay, when you say seeing penny, what exactly does that mean?"
19229,Leonard,how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
15083,Leonard,what do you think? 
14254,Leonard,no.
16008,Leonard,see?
13994,Leonard,fine. let’s go. i think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. i’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the italians.
13184,Leonard,"yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. solve for r."
13568,Leonard,i don’t know. just tell them i went to the office.
20793,Leonard,"uh, i don’t, any day now."
15431,Leonard,"oh, uh, clear nail polish. i had a mani-pedi. men can get those. anyway, i may owe you an apology."
12033,Leonard,bye. 
15143,Leonard,"okay, that’s enough, howard. the poor guy’s had a tough time. he had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
13512,Leonard,"listen, don’t worry. i’ll talk to him."
17611,Leonard,"okay. hey, howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?"
16990,Leonard,"no, that was a different guy."
19102,Leonard,"yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled."
12103,Leonard,"come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
12478,Leonard,"okay, i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. i mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery. "
19101,Leonard,i’ll be there as soon as i can.
20815,Leonard,what is happening there?
20965,Leonard,of course you do.
20842,Leonard,"hey, i’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute."
13074,Leonard,"oh, it’s called trestling."
19292,Leonard,what?
21180,Leonard,thank you.
19801,Leonard,"what does that mean, under your bed?"
19185,Leonard,"yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met amy. yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. not the way i would categorize the two of us."
20020,Leonard,yes. i felt guilty as soon as it happened. i feel guilty every time i see her.
21036,Leonard,but you won’t be living here.
17586,Leonard,no.
17095,Leonard,good. remember that when i take my shirt off.
15828,Leonard,hey.
13965,Leonard,"okay, bye. my mother’s coming to visit."
19993,Leonard,"hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door."
18367,Leonard,that sounds nice. yeah.
14738,Leonard,just give us a minute.
19168,Leonard,come on. it’ll be fun.
19931,Leonard,really good.
12006,Leonard,excuse me?
14553,Leonard,they’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
13660,Leonard,"no, you’re not."
18487,Leonard,"so, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the dvd, here’s what that means. don’t fixate on it. don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. or nag me through the door while i’m on the toilet."
16142,Leonard,have you seen him?
18687,Leonard,yeah.
13240,Leonard,"it wasn’t awkward. it wasn’t fun. besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on."
15271,Leonard,"fine. just tell me what to do, and i’ll do it."
17358,Leonard,where did you get that?
14688,Leonard,what’s wrong with a football jersey?
19639,Leonard,i’m in love. let’s do something else.
15167,Leonard,you always get your way.
18180,Leonard,where is he?
13954,Leonard,yeah. hang on. sheldon!
18741,Leonard,hold on. we always do this. 
21408,Leonard,"just one second. help, cinnamon’s loose in the building."
13331,Leonard,you got penny to sign up for online dating?
19961,Leonard,"okay, um, well, there was this girl."
21499,Leonard,aaargh.
16538,Leonard,that’s funny.
18978,Leonard,what?
18087,Leonard,"raj, you’re up."
13213,Leonard,no. 
20098,Leonard,"if there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?"
18026,Leonard,you do?
17793,Leonard,"it’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme."
14276,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, are you coming?"
14522,Leonard,"god, i had the most horrible night."
12404,Leonard,"regardless, i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley, i’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. "
20920,Leonard,"and you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
17113,Leonard,"well, there was a lot at stake."
21047,Leonard,do you know what you need to do now?
17919,Leonard,hmm. kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and bernadette.
19713,Leonard,"i swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter."
17313,Leonard,"i got to tell you, i’m a little worried about him."
15096,Leonard,you hate babylon 5.
16339,Leonard,"well, now, hold on. what kind of distance are we talking about? because we are neighbours. i mean, i can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
14658,Leonard,how was your football party?
14069,Leonard,"penny, penny, i think i know what to do. sheldon, i have some bad news."
13583,Leonard,"dear god, no!"
13284,Leonard,sure.
18887,Leonard,what’s up?
14877,Leonard,um…
15831,Leonard,"uh, i was out."
21340,Leonard,hey.
15606,Leonard,"uh-huh. anyway, i’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
18299,Leonard,"a tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
17710,Leonard,"oh, good, an english accent, the sexiest accent you can have."
20912,Leonard,"thanks for understanding, sir."
17659,Leonard,no.
12813,Leonard,it wasn’t on? 
14528,Leonard,excuse me.
15880,Leonard,you’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
16163,Leonard,"excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. i’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, i received a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physics."
16637,Leonard,it’s like living with a chihuahua.
15648,Leonard,i saw what you did there.
14066,Leonard,i don’t know. texas?
19303,Leonard,may i ask why?
13959,Leonard,bye.
17198,Leonard,because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
17641,Leonard,just explaining the theory of relativity. twice.
14829,Leonard,"sure. the more, the merrier."
19079,Leonard,then what can i do?
13262,Leonard,"oh, i’m flattered. so, how do you suggest we proceed?"
17570,Leonard,"oh, seti, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. you should introduce him to sheldon. the search is over."
18100,Leonard,"no. i mean, i’ll apply, but i’m not gonna stoop to playing politics."
20299,Leonard,"come on, don’t be mad. it was a long time ago, and it was an accident."
21114,Leonard,"oh, i do. the, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it."
16448,Leonard,"i can’t hear you, i’m in the shower."
20856,Leonard,i saw it. it’s big.
18430,Leonard,"i have to say, this is the best top ramen you’ve ever made."
18890,Leonard,were you seeing other men?
15285,Leonard,yeah?
21224,Leonard,i really don’t know.
16016,Leonard,you can be aquaman.
19827,Leonard,we could be betas. they’re second in charge.
20729,Leonard,way better.
20975,Leonard,what? why not?
16025,Leonard,hey.
16928,Leonard,"you’re kidding me. uh, can i see you for a sec over here?"
17418,Leonard,"no, uh, that, that’s it. i don’t know much about women. raj, you got anything?"
16067,Leonard,"that’s enough, sheldon."
17543,Leonard,i didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
16747,Leonard,going to wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
16414,Leonard,really? who?
14485,Leonard,how about that? i finally caught a break.
20135,Leonard,fine.
15288,Leonard,and you think my presence will help with that?
14026,Leonard,"yeah, more cutbacks."
20303,Leonard,"okay. well, then i’ll read it to you. it’s from the day we first met. beauty, thy name is penny."
15839,Leonard,"no, no, no, would it help if i told you that i offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
16227,Leonard,"oh, come on. it’s not boring at all. she’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. hmm?"
20214,Leonard,what is it?
12215,Leonard,"raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
21117,Leonard,"well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now i’ve got you, so it’s either sheldon or gargamel from the smurfs."
18554,Leonard,what?
12011,Leonard,"sheldon, this was your idea. a little extra money to get fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment."
18577,Leonard,"well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister."
14857,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe because i’m crazy?
21084,Leonard,you’re up.
18311,Leonard,"geez, i never realized you were so competitive."
19176,Leonard,i just want to say one more thing about this. just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
14452,Leonard,"aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. so write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
16372,Leonard,"oh, geez, i don’t know if i can ditch priya two nights in a row."
21350,Leonard,"hang, hang on. so i have to bring penny, you can’t afford it, howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
12297,Leonard,just say the but thing about doug and then i’ll get her back. 
17046,Leonard,that’s my french toast.
20170,Leonard,"oh, well, that kind of stinks."
14413,Leonard,"oh, wow, cool."
19249,Leonard,no.
13320,Leonard,wow.
13844,Leonard,there you go. now any e-mail from wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
19848,Leonard,how is that building on what he just said?
14160,Leonard,holy crap. someone just ordered a thousand penny blossoms.
18969,Leonard,i got your back.
21125,Leonard,"no, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. hello?"
12362,Leonard,i’m sorry. give him a hamburger. 
14818,Leonard,"okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
19460,Leonard,okay. mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
18253,Leonard,"sheldon, i got to go inside. it’s getting rough out here."
12725,Leonard,i don’t know. how am i supposed to remember all of this.
13000,Leonard,it’s not about money.
14983,Leonard,he just gave it to you?
16914,Leonard,i hate those movies.
18364,Leonard,"nothing, i’m fine."
18324,Leonard,call me a lady part. we’ll see about that.
16495,Leonard,no.
20271,Leonard,"okay, we saw them. can we go catch the movie?"
13801,Leonard,killer robot. we built it.
16004,Leonard,"i got a better idea. we’re all responsible. i say we all go. come on, who’s with me? free comic books to anyone who comes with me. i might get punched. you really want to miss that?"
13662,Leonard,we’re not living together.
13645,Leonard,"hey, can you open this for me?"
15417,Leonard,do i get some sympathy now?
20672,Leonard,you love the simpsons.
17851,Leonard,"um, why would i mean alex?"
17784,Leonard,"my dad was an anthropologist. the only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an etruscan boy. i hated that kid."
16182,Leonard,i won’t be too late. i’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
17563,Leonard,"wait, alex. do you want to join us?"
19975,Leonard,because we love each other.
15715,Leonard,yeah. so?
20219,Leonard,thank you for coming back.
13930,Leonard,"do you guys remember penny’s ex-boyfriend kurt?  yeah, that’s him. it turns out he owes penny a lot of money, and i’m gonna go get it from him."
21651,Leonard,who is it?
15364,Leonard,"morning, sheldon."
20044,Leonard,call you back. hey.
15253,Leonard,how can you not be sure?
20849,Leonard,there goes our big payday.
13344,Leonard,"okay, let’s try it this way, what if the people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve?"
14203,Leonard,"yeah, i’ll get to it, don’t nag me."
12301,Leonard,"of course, yeah, emotional chafing. hey, do you want to see something cool?  i can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. "
15751,Leonard,"or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. there are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. look, howard, i appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
15700,Leonard,"oh. well, good for you."
13615,Leonard,what invitation?
19100,Leonard,"sheldon, hang tight. hey, do you want me to bring anything?"
16501,Leonard,"thanks, yeah."
12296,Leonard,"no,  you were saying, but…"
15402,Leonard,"nevertheless, i’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why i did what i did."
20470,Leonard,of course.
19361,Leonard,i took a little lady i like to call loneliness.
16633,Leonard,"i did it last night, i’m not doing it again."
15712,Leonard,"no, i’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
15854,Leonard,"hi. i’m leonard. and you are beautiful. you pop, sparkle and buzz electric. i’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
14792,Leonard,"quick, get forks."
12449,Leonard,"oh, he’s the doppler effect."
20716,Leonard,i mostly just smell my nasal spray.
13743,Leonard,"uh, y-yeah."
13180,Leonard,"well, good night. "
19071,Leonard,"it’s dark out and he’s alone, i don’t like it. let’s go get him."
20263,Leonard,this is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
15498,Leonard,i’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
16487,Leonard,hadn’t really thought about it.
13915,Leonard,"actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the los angeles county superior court?"
16073,Leonard,i don’t want it better. i want it my way.
14967,Leonard,"hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared."
21462,Leonard,that’s just great.
17748,Leonard,"i do, of course i do."
21749,Leonard,on occasion.
19483,Leonard,"ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor amy."
21628,Leonard,do not make a sound.
13998,Leonard,"oh, relax. she took sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
13054,Leonard,whatever. you have to do something about it.
17265,Leonard,"hey, howard, i need to tell you something."
17059,Leonard,you want to talk about it?
16240,Leonard,i really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
19520,Leonard,"ooh, and one time when you were asleep, amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever."
12054,Leonard,"sheldon, sit!"
13229,Leonard,"yeah, hi, listen, i know what’s been bothering you about us, and i have the answer. "
12057,Leonard,"yes, i remember."
18590,Leonard,"i, uh, ah, um, i…"
13303,Leonard,"great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
20861,Leonard,don’t speak.
18271,Leonard,i actually have used those exact words before. in that order.
14749,Leonard,sure.
15341,Leonard,"when you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
20502,Leonard,can you focus on what we’re talking about?
14625,Leonard,i’ll see what i can do.
12553,Leonard,"yeah, we can always divide soup."
19538,Leonard,he chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
16650,Leonard,"oh, damn it!"
17428,Leonard,you must be burning up.
18104,Leonard,i just keep thinking about how cool it would be if i called my mom and told her that i got tenure at caltech.
12227,Leonard,"no, i’m fine. penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
16427,Leonard,"oh, yeah? what about it?"
12948,Leonard,i don’t believe it.
20384,Leonard,"well, we are, because dr. gallo made me realize that i’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter."
16751,Leonard,"hey, sheldon?"
13639,Leonard,i can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
16144,Leonard,s-y-f-y. sy-fee.
15262,Leonard,"this is fun, huh?"
19999,Leonard,"oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
16591,Leonard,"oh, bernadette, please play my clarinet."
16705,Leonard,are we ready to order?
19556,Leonard,really?
21726,Leonard,telling you? telling you.
16284,Leonard,just two. everyday and dress.
17763,Leonard,"well, he’s not wrong. howard did go to the international space station."
20567,Leonard,that beats the onesie i was gonna get them from baby gap.
16920,Leonard,thanks. tickets are eleven bucks. not a date.
15822,Leonard,what alibi?
18042,Leonard,you know why. the nintendo ds. and the psp. now the gameboy.
12419,Leonard,no kidding.
13080,Leonard,"no. but it was okay. i mean, when i was little i’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson, and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when i got to the door i could hear people whispering, and i could smell german chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
17362,Leonard,ah!
21004,Leonard,she makes more money than i do.
15039,Leonard,told you.
14657,Leonard,hey.
18121,Leonard,call someone.
13561,Leonard,psst! psst!
14671,Leonard,"okay, a complete pass. first down, new england. i think i’m starting to get this."
17252,Leonard,"sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. what about hawaii?"
18899,Leonard,"oh, my god, you’re jealous."
21321,Leonard,"but raj is from india, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath."
19001,Leonard,you having second thoughts about acting?
17969,Leonard,yeah.
12759,Leonard,hey! 
12277,Leonard,i’m having a panic attack.
15115,Leonard,"well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
14364,Leonard,"yeah, no, yeah, wow, i’m sorry. that must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
12988,Leonard,yes i’m upset. 
16034,Leonard,you’re being a bully.
16288,Leonard,"um, not great, i guess. but penny and i are just friends."
18208,Leonard,"all right, amy, it’s your turn. we need one more hit. finish him off."
12486,Leonard,no.
21434,Leonard,i’m sure i’m overreacting.
20897,Leonard,"uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
13101,Leonard,yes he is.
17083,Leonard,where on earth did you get that from?
18359,Leonard,i’ll see you later. i gotta go watch a stupid football game with penny.
18063,Leonard,"alright, alright. boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? thank you, astronaut howard. um, i am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because i get to test theories and work with lasers. yes?"
12022,Leonard,new neighbour?
21684,Leonard,"hey. i’m sorry, we’re still here. is everything okay?"
15189,Leonard,thank you.
17943,Leonard,now you know how i feel when i have to put it on you.
16484,Leonard,got it. bye.
14291,Leonard,"i don’t know, howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy."
14557,Leonard,"no, i don’t want any chocolate! sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
13297,Leonard,i guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
20021,Leonard,"what do i mean? boy, that’s a toughie."
20627,Leonard,never should’ve told you about alvin and the chipmunks.
12884,Leonard,"come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people. "
21525,Leonard,thank you.
17144,Leonard,unbelievable. 
16233,Leonard,can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
17865,Leonard,"with all these women chasing me, i kind of do feel like captain kirk."
16421,Leonard,do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound jewish guy who lives with his mom?
12781,Leonard,no kidding?
18994,Leonard,poor mrs. wolowitz.
16069,Leonard,because you’re impossible to work with.
12111,Leonard,"come on, we have a combined iq of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
15354,Leonard,"uh, sleep night. i mean, obviously, good night. i started to say sleep tight, then i changed my mind in the middle. i swear to god, i’m smart."
18191,Leonard,you want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
17241,Leonard,positive.
17459,Leonard,hey. off to work?
21160,Leonard,yeah. let me finish packing this stuff up. you know how sheldon is if he sees christmas stuff lying around after new year’s.
16153,Leonard,uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
19166,Leonard,what?
20048,Leonard,"wake up, wake up, wake up."
12142,Leonard,"excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman’s flight is a feat of strength."
13704,Leonard,"listen, we need to talk."
17028,Leonard,you got one for good luck.  i’ll get it.
14937,Leonard,what the hell is eighth base?
16697,Leonard,"well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear.  ow! why did you do that?"
17136,Leonard,fine.
14617,Leonard,"because when i made that agreement, i didn’t think i’d ever have a hot girlfriend. and i was positive you never would."
17811,Leonard,the walls are getting slower.
12270,Leonard,six thirty. 
21243,Leonard,"ignore him. yeah, sorry about the breakup."
14049,Leonard,you’re welcome.
15595,Leonard,you bumped the table and you know it.
19096,Leonard,"oh, my god, are you okay?"
14894,Leonard,mitzy’s dead?
16126,Leonard,sure.
18557,Leonard,"the, the element never existed. i didn’t take it away, science took it away. be mad at science."
20753,Leonard,"hmm, i just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond."
16863,Leonard,"amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
16125,Leonard,no!
14476,Leonard,what can i tell you? they probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass costco over there.
16894,Leonard,not on blu-ray. only twice on blu-ray.
18383,Leonard,"penny, come back. i’m sad for real now."
20014,Leonard,"thank you. finally, there’s a mrs. hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me."
12183,Leonard,"yes! for god’s sake, sheldon, do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth."
15743,Leonard,hi.
13913,Leonard,"it’s probably not as bad as you think. let’s take a look. maybe we can find some corners to cut. oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
20629,Leonard,"i don’t, i know, but this isn’t a big deal. it’s just a little savings i put aside."
19669,Leonard,really?
19583,Leonard,do it.
21699,Leonard,i hope it kills us both.
15127,Leonard,"good, good, so, who’s stan lee?"
16506,Leonard,"uh, that’s my water."
15840,Leonard,very hard.
19109,Leonard,sheldon.
17352,Leonard,"yeah, i’m glad."
18985,Leonard,"on the one hand, if i say yes…"
15684,Leonard,jealousy? what do i have to be jealous of?
13486,Leonard,really? define it.
17856,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did you do?"
16734,Leonard,i was actually thinking about going.
19850,Leonard,it’s not simon says.
16359,Leonard,we got him. we’re almost done.
14013,Leonard,this is actually gonna happen.
20673,Leonard,"oh, good, go. you know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, i read the books, don’t get too fond of this character."
13522,Leonard,"well, actually, technically, you did do it."
12444,Leonard,"terrific. um, this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group, and i need you not to embarrass me tonight. "
13415,Leonard,you don’t need air bags.
17156,Leonard,sorry. i’m having dinner with penny. i have to get out of here.
18736,Leonard,does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
15623,Leonard,"i gotta tell you guys, i’m a little worried about sheldon."
13111,Leonard,"if i were you, i’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken. "
15629,Leonard,"he takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
19271,Leonard,"i know, and i’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean i can’t do something nice. like this."
17195,Leonard,"oh, fun. i get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the village people."
21214,Leonard,mm-hmm.
19149,Leonard,"oh, that poor waiter."
12689,Leonard,"oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
12857,Leonard,like what? he’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. 
12969,Leonard,"uh, just give us a few minutes."
20900,Leonard,your problem.
17452,Leonard,"i’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
12289,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no. turns out that raj and howard had to work, and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet. "
18464,Leonard,"wow, you ask really hard questions."
13951,Leonard,"i guess, technically, that was my fault.  i’m not leaving here without penny’s money."
12714,Leonard,"oh, i’m getting a bad feeling. "
12926,Leonard,sheldon.
17938,Leonard,how did i do that? i got to remember how i did that.
14200,Leonard,"well, dts has more low end, so… okay."
20805,Leonard,is that howard in front of us?
16584,Leonard,"they slept together, sherlock."
16764,Leonard,"sheldon, she just got off the plane. she doesn’t want to cook."
18119,Leonard,"oh, if you, if you like banana bread, i’ve got a-a great recipe. the trick is in, in fresh ground, i’ll e-mail it to you."
17685,Leonard,i don’t know what to say.
17401,Leonard,"oh, i will. there is no telling what might happen."
20675,Leonard,"oh, i just ran out of patience with sheldon’s nonsense."
17822,Leonard,it wasn’t amazing. i got a c-minus four years in a row.
19720,Leonard,"oh, now he’s a genius? all you ever do is make fun of him and engineering."
12075,Leonard,how so?
13727,Leonard,"oh, right, yeah, um, so, stephanie, here’s the thing. i really like you."
16667,Leonard,i thought you were reading.
19147,Leonard,"c’mon now, throw one."
17449,Leonard,we got you that book last year. wasn’t everything in there?
16730,Leonard,"okay, fine. just the sword, two ten."
16640,Leonard,"uh, you’re a naughty girl. and, and, uh, i, i want to punish you with my love?"
15294,Leonard,"i’m pretty sure martha stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat japanese guys."
14122,Leonard,so?
19406,Leonard,it still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
12290,Leonard,"you’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common. "
18756,Leonard,"thank you. seriously, please don’t make me go."
14093,Leonard,"well, that does sound much simpler. how long is this going to take?"
21442,Leonard,"i don’t know, you pretty much covered it."
15333,Leonard,come on. it’s just a cup of coffee.
18246,Leonard,yeah.
19567,Leonard,"wow, it’s all happening so fast. should we just sleep on it?"
16711,Leonard,could you tell us?
17712,Leonard,"well, maybe you should tell him."
14890,Leonard,"oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, i’ll get you a plate. mom, you remember penny."
18793,Leonard,are you really gonna sit here all day?
21215,Leonard,have fun.
14448,Leonard,"yes, i feel terrible about it. i will never forgive myself, i don’t expect you to either, and i would really appreciate it if you would leave me with penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
15351,Leonard,"well, who wants to stay in a hotel? with windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
14044,Leonard,"well, we’re not gonna tell him i did it."
20342,Leonard,i think penny has a point. you can see it another day.
14782,Leonard,you know what’s a cool name? angelo. that has angel and jell-o in it.
15852,Leonard,what does that have to do with me and women?
16097,Leonard,they’re bigger than mine.
15863,Leonard,"you are beautiful, you know that? you pop, sparkle and buzz electric. i’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
19342,Leonard,"hey, where’s bernadette?"
16044,Leonard,what?
17790,Leonard,"little bit, yeah."
12099,Leonard,must we?
16929,Leonard,i know what you’re doing.
15528,Leonard,"that long, huh?"
20905,Leonard,seriously?
13605,Leonard,"howard, howard, look at this."
14895,Leonard,i don’t believe this. why am i the last to know?
20330,Leonard,"that’s a trick question, right?"
14762,Leonard,i’m not leaving until you talk to me.
15245,Leonard,i’m walking away from you now.
20146,Leonard,i always wanted to be a swashbuckler when i was a kid.
14729,Leonard,i don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
13075,Leonard,"forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is saturday? "
21580,Leonard,"hey, what’s the matter? "
19165,Leonard,fine. we’ll take it right now.
14911,Leonard,"once again, i’m driving. i’m right here."
14941,Leonard,and that didn’t bother you?
19024,Leonard,"oh, i know. this might help."
16761,Leonard,two for thirty. and you come to my birthday party.
17932,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, we’re going to be late."
14498,Leonard,"to tell you the truth, i think we were both a little, i don’t know…"
19698,Leonard,"nothing, i’m fine."
16355,Leonard,"hey, penny. we’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
19664,Leonard,in sunglasses and a hat after i parked two blocks away.
16282,Leonard,thank you.
19765,Leonard,we understand. thank you so much.
20394,Leonard,"no, he’s fine. we just needed a little break."
17429,Leonard,he keeps emergency purell in the car.
13742,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
14519,Leonard,what?
21348,Leonard,that i would do to her.
14236,Leonard,when did you pick up on that?
20552,Leonard,"well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all."
20719,Leonard,we’re leaving now!
13395,Leonard,"didn’t i tell you i’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements."
13162,Leonard,other people would say “why not?” 
17607,Leonard,"sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. now, you either stick your face in that pie or i’m gonna stick that pie in your face."
16886,Leonard,"amy, what are you doing here?"
12055,Leonard,well this is nice. we don’t have a lot of company over.
13796,Leonard,maybe we should start small.
19404,Leonard,"i know. you can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box."
20207,Leonard,it’s actually pretty common in our field. there’s not much you can do about it.
12938,Leonard,go ahead.
14035,Leonard,and the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
15381,Leonard,"are you having trouble sleeping? ‘cause, boy, i was up all night."
16439,Leonard,no. that’s not what he meant.
12160,Leonard,"when the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place."
13114,Leonard,"penny, are you okay?"
14284,Leonard,"uh, raj, can i, can i talk to you for a moment."
13872,Leonard,i’m sorry. can we please just do it one more time?
20932,Leonard,"it’s weird. this must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. unless they feel sad, then it’s different."
13066,Leonard,and he’s down!
20348,Leonard,well…
21110,Leonard,you know what? there is one thing i would like.
21232,Leonard,"okay. i don’t get it, you said make an effort, here i am making an effort. "
18469,Leonard,"no, i have to go pick him up. bill nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
16995,Leonard,i told you. that was a different guy.
12196,Leonard,what did she say? is she still mad at me?
13795,Leonard,it’s a saturnalia miracle.
21057,Leonard,why does he need a baby? he’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
14995,Leonard,"any place specific or just the bozeman, montana loony bin?"
17914,Leonard,"sheldon, your food’s getting cold."
18565,Leonard,"okay, barry, that’s enough."
12069,Leonard,should i say something? i feel like i should say something.
17288,Leonard,"if you’re not happy, why don’t you just let kripke have the office?"
17119,Leonard,exactly. we pretend like our date went badly.
20349,Leonard,"yeah, the wait is finally over."
21357,Leonard,"hey, i was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be hulk and she-hulk. or we could paint ourselves blue and go as nightcrawler and mystique."
19517,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
12620,Leonard,"shut up, howard. sheldon, we have to do this."
16253,Leonard,"okay, well, tell him i loved him on star trek."
15973,Leonard,"yeah, well, not necessary. we broke up again."
14607,Leonard,just play a potion card.
19926,Leonard,i’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
12531,Leonard,"well, sleep tight."
12426,Leonard,"oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
19910,Leonard,"yes, and we’ll get back to that. but, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. you’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers."
14769,Leonard,"uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
21416,Leonard,"i understand it, sheldon."
12980,Leonard,sorry.
18065,Leonard,"i never wanted to play the cello. how do you meet girls playing the cello? hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"
12958,Leonard,snipe. 
16963,Leonard,no. he wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
12769,Leonard,i don’t think so.
14640,Leonard,"long, long night."
16783,Leonard,i hadn’t…
18171,Leonard,and he wrote him a cheque.
20829,Leonard,"hey, guys, come on in."
12461,Leonard,yes. but i need a wing-man.
13045,Leonard,"excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister."
13534,Leonard,"all right, i really didn’t want to do this, but… here."
13891,Leonard,stop it!
13721,Leonard,"yeah, yeah it’s all good. everything’s going to work out. one way or another."
17650,Leonard,am i allowed to ask how the class is going?
18037,Leonard,i don’t know.
19378,Leonard,"if it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
15522,Leonard,yes.
12163,Leonard,no.
18743,Leonard,even batman breaks the rules. 
12577,Leonard,i bet you’re right.
15022,Leonard,hi. i’m dr. hofstadter. where is he?
19494,Leonard,"on earth? in our lives? that, that, that we’re living?"
13594,Leonard,are you sure?
18889,Leonard,was it the two women thing or the playa? it was the playa.
19759,Leonard,"we don’t have an appointment. we, we’re just fans of mr. lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
18884,Leonard,you have my blessing. go for it.
14575,Leonard,"we’re watching goonies, gremlins and young sherlock holmes. they were all written by chris columbus."
15605,Leonard,got it.
18490,Leonard,that’s stupid. why?
16906,Leonard,i’m going to the movies with penny. i don’t want her to think that i think it’s a date.
15619,Leonard,"oh, no."
13301,Leonard,"yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?"
16979,Leonard,you’ve got to be kidding me. you friended stuart on facebook?
20670,Leonard,i don’t want to.
17487,Leonard,this is it.
12621,Leonard,"okay, let me put it this way, i’m doing it."
21449,Leonard,"it can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven."
15994,Leonard,"oh, thanks."
13772,Leonard,"yeah, i know. i’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. you always said you had yoga."
15358,Leonard,"i did, but it’s been a while, and i wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
17917,Leonard,you get that these are personalised action figures.
14724,Leonard,are you listening to yourself? do you know how childish you sound right now?
21775,Leonard,"excuse me, but i’ve been working on this a long time. trust me, it’ll work."
19453,Leonard,"okay. on the count of three, i’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
21477,Leonard,that’s actually funny.
13519,Leonard,"yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?"
14486,Leonard,you know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
19718,Leonard,"of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. uh, new salon topic. what’s more important, an idea or its execution?"
18790,Leonard,waah. i don’t want a table.
16275,Leonard,"hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, i’d be okay with that."
14590,Leonard,you are a dirty girl.
18373,Leonard,"well, whenever i talk about how awful my mom was, penny will do anything to make me feel better."
12269,Leonard,can you tell i’m perspiring a little?
14345,Leonard,"good, good. well, you kids have fun tonight."
19381,Leonard,"i told you, there’s nothing to worry about."
14227,Leonard,you mean for someone who’s into comic books?
17296,Leonard,have you ever seen them?
16953,Leonard,"well, then, i’m putting sex back on the table. what do you think about that?"
13430,Leonard,"fine. assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
12483,Leonard,"there’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
14505,Leonard,i don’t know
14568,Leonard,you’re not changing how penny laughs.
12831,Leonard,yes sir. 
18006,Leonard,that’s the spirit.
16922,Leonard,i’m going to get some fries. you want anything?
21297,Leonard,"as a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool."
19512,Leonard,"i thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun."
16664,Leonard,all righty then. guess i’ll just get started.
15421,Leonard,that was part of it. the other part is what happened with the elevator.
19514,Leonard,"well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start."
13722,Leonard,really?
18901,Leonard,"penny, have you seen my good inhaler?"
14534,Leonard,"good, good."
18933,Leonard,aw. what’s wrong with her?
18951,Leonard,may the force be with you. get it?
13778,Leonard,do whatever you want.
12436,Leonard,"he’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…"
21123,Leonard,separating my delicates.
21275,Leonard,"and, sorry about the suitcase."
20411,Leonard,"appreciate that, too."
18318,Leonard,uh-huh. like death?
13525,Leonard,sheldon? i just dropped him off at the comic book store. why?
21745,Leonard,fine. i’ll take it.
15258,Leonard,really? i wouldn’t know what that’s like.
16760,Leonard,twelve.
17777,Leonard,fun. we know how much you love that.
21685,Leonard,little ball of fur.
21421,Leonard,i went to your office christmas party?
14444,Leonard,"yeah, i just stopped by to say…  yeah, so, hi!"
21070,Leonard,they say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
19751,Leonard,"okay, yeah. what do we have to lose? i’m a little nervous."
17377,Leonard,you’re kidding.
12252,Leonard,"i’ve been thinking about names, i’m kind of torn between einstein, newton and sergeant fuzzyboots. "
12622,Leonard,"oh, come on. the only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically. "
15960,Leonard,fines?
13291,Leonard,"if the word is pee-pee, just do it."
17695,Leonard,"keep going, buddy, you’re doing great."
19701,Leonard,"look, i know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing."
17526,Leonard,okay.
19034,Leonard,"hi, mom. i have some exciting news."
13023,Leonard,sheldon’s office? is she lost? 
16530,Leonard,"well, you know, the way i took my clothes off."
16889,Leonard,"yeah, sheldon, what would it take?"
18602,Leonard,"hey, sheldon sent us all an e-mail. happy holidays from texas. and there’s pictures. aah! don’t open them. do not open them."
20646,Leonard,but what if man-man dressed as a bat?
18560,Leonard,"fine, i’ll publish."
19427,Leonard,"mm. i know how you feel. i spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that raj took when he thought no one was looking."
15673,Leonard,"yeah, and don’t you forget it."
16303,Leonard,no.
19413,Leonard,"because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
19602,Leonard,no problem.
16009,Leonard,"uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store."
15461,Leonard,why not?
17561,Leonard,this should be fun.
16024,Leonard,it’s leonard.
16544,Leonard,"so, no, on the shepherd’s pie. can we move on?"
19762,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe they’ll call imperial officers to take us to a holding cell on the death star.
13120,Leonard,what about “damsel in distress?”
13325,Leonard,"leslie, you are way off base here."
14860,Leonard,i’m glad you enjoyed it. most people aren’t that interested in what i do.
21772,Leonard,"oh, man. is that a two-stage rocket?"
13757,Leonard,"i had no idea it was so heavy. the thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?"
12322,Leonard,mahalo’s a nice touch. 
13090,Leonard,no.
18803,Leonard,"you’re right. i mean, he decides what tv shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. i wanted frodo, but we can’t both have frodo, so guess who’s stuck with samwise gamgee."
18641,Leonard,honestly?
12942,Leonard,"my physics bowl trophy!  “leonard is so smart, sheldon who?”"
14787,Leonard,"oh, god, i am so hungry."
17419,Leonard,hello.
16791,Leonard,that was pretty droll. with a hint of ammonia.
13442,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
14898,Leonard,i don’t want tea.
18292,Leonard,"um, since when can koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
21271,Leonard,did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
12363,Leonard,make it two. 
21278,Leonard,so you’re gonna throw me under the bus?
18511,Leonard,what?
16710,Leonard,deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
17852,Leonard,what?
15867,Leonard,could you get that?
19891,Leonard,"uh, i don’t know. they’re pretty different."
20625,Leonard,this game’s dangerous. i could get you in trouble.
16713,Leonard,"listen, guys, i’m sorry, i don’t mean to be rude, but i need to go call raj’s sister, who i love so much. so vastly much."
18745,Leonard,"howard, you in on this?"
17384,Leonard,"so, come on, how was the first day with hawking?"
17330,Leonard,"all right, let’s do it."
18262,Leonard,"we finished the experiment early, so i thought i’d come home and surprise you."
18665,Leonard,"penny, don’t."
13802,Leonard,"howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
14702,Leonard,what the hell are you talking about?
16471,Leonard,it’s blackmail!
18073,Leonard,trying to paint a picture.
17393,Leonard,give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
16818,Leonard,"okay, we used to go out, right?"
16967,Leonard,really?
12644,Leonard,"uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. "
14316,Leonard,"oh, hi."
16592,Leonard,do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
19436,Leonard,"you shut the loading doors, right?"
17490,Leonard,"mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity."
15311,Leonard,yes.
18705,Leonard,and i support you.
13244,Leonard,borrowed?
17975,Leonard,"oh, get this, suddenly, sheldon wants me back because amy wants to move in with him."
16020,Leonard,she didn’t tell you?
15305,Leonard,sheldon!
14683,Leonard,"please, i’m asking you as a friend."
16224,Leonard,"i thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
20368,Leonard,thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
19022,Leonard,all right.
21702,Leonard,"you got to stop beating yourself up over this. i mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
17596,Leonard,just pick another game.
15664,Leonard,"so anyway, howard asked penny to talk to bernadette, and she did, and bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
15599,Leonard,sure.
20472,Leonard,that sounds fun. when’s it start?
15460,Leonard,have they found a match for you?
15339,Leonard,kidding. just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
17056,Leonard,"oh, a little red dead redemption, huh?"
15584,Leonard,"no, i think a doorknob has you stymied."
20032,Leonard,can’t believe i’m spending my wedding night with you.
20149,Leonard,what?
14481,Leonard,"uh, yes, ma’am."
19029,Leonard,"hey, hey, what the hell?"
13587,Leonard,i’m sorry?
17417,Leonard,"well, howard, i don’t know much about women."
14630,Leonard,over puppets?
17660,Leonard,"penny started taking a class. she wrote a paper, she didn’t want me to read it, i went behind her back and i read it anyway."
13856,Leonard,"it’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
19963,Leonard,"and then nothing. i stopped it. but it still bothers me, and i wanted you to know."
16109,Leonard,right. so we’ll just call the middle here the neutral zone.
21052,Leonard,really? the last green thing i saw you eat was a skittle.
21267,Leonard,our gaming room. i was gonna put a scented candle in it.
13112,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. "
12641,Leonard,"no. no. scientists do not compromise. our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. not to mention, sheldon is batcrap crazy. "
16133,Leonard,yeah.
14790,Leonard,what kind of score are we looking at?
13399,Leonard,you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
16703,Leonard,"oh, god, did you watch bridget jones again?"
20007,Leonard,it’s okay. i don’t have to say them.
12896,Leonard,just ask another one.
12064,Leonard,"i don’t eat it, i just think it’s a good idea."
15379,Leonard,"yeah, i guess i did."
19802,Leonard,"wait a minute, you have a guy?"
14539,Leonard,perfectly formed miniature human being.
18273,Leonard,"come on, i said i was sorry."
15593,Leonard,what?
18190,Leonard,"i’ll, i’ll call for help."
20787,Leonard,i’d love it if my dad could come.
12558,Leonard,so?
15005,Leonard,i haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third matrix movie.
15747,Leonard,whoa!
16529,Leonard,"every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, i’d put on a little show for her."
13210,Leonard,"it’s not you, howard, he says he’s moving out. "
14841,Leonard,yeah? so?
19180,Leonard,"marriage is scary. you’re scared, i’m scared. but it doesn’t make me not want to do it. it, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
16573,Leonard,she’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
14279,Leonard,that is a lot of cologne.
14956,Leonard,it’s obviously a typo.
15865,Leonard,"is that, oh, my, i didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, i’m starting to exude."
13312,Leonard,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
20105,Leonard,we’re gonna be here foreever.
17131,Leonard,"uh, uh, uh, yes, i did."
12497,Leonard,"are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?"
16267,Leonard,he kind of does.
16828,Leonard,"here’s the thing, i, i’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
17421,Leonard,"folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
13695,Leonard,"yeah. it’s wonderful. okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
15632,Leonard,so you decided to get the whole manhattan project?
13731,Leonard,hey.
15615,Leonard,"well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
15757,Leonard,problem?
17303,Leonard,hmm.
19139,Leonard,"come on, give him a hard one."
14261,Leonard,yes
12838,Leonard,not heavy ones. 
18387,Leonard,"yeah, i know."
13900,Leonard,"fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. "
18794,Leonard,"if you’ll recall, the vogon fleet blew up the earth anyway."
18828,Leonard,"i don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, i’m sure you know what you’re doing."
15332,Leonard,want a cup of coffee?
20542,Leonard,"ready when you are, professor hawking."
17993,Leonard,from her micro-husband. that is amazing. how long did this take you?
13958,Leonard,that’s it? did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
16291,Leonard,"no, no, i’m confident. it’s not like i’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. although, this will be the first time i’ll be the one saying it."
21570,Leonard,"you got feet and legs, you do it."
14386,Leonard,"easy peasy, i’m doing it right now."
20576,Leonard,"yeah, perfect."
18566,Leonard,i can’t believe they kicked you out. 
19037,Leonard,you know what? it’s probably fine.
16318,Leonard,whatcha doin’?
12140,Leonard,"um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon?"
17812,Leonard,"okay, continuing our quest."
16304,Leonard,"all right, well, anyway, darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
15988,Leonard,fellas. it’s been 30 minutes. nobody’s touched each other.
16913,Leonard,"no. you always picked, and it was always the same. an hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
19386,Leonard,i’m not allergic to latex.
14645,Leonard,we’re heading out for some kite fighting.
21676,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sweating my bald cap off."
12386,Leonard,"well, i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so i guess there’s no point in bringing it up. "
13912,Leonard,was there a plan b?
19390,Leonard,"buddy, i, i get that you’re worried about me and i, i appreciate that, but i’m not going to die."
16580,Leonard,yes.
19511,Leonard,you got it.
13488,Leonard,aw!
20494,Leonard,how is that a new invention?
16104,Leonard,what?
15254,Leonard,"no, the place to have the conversation was in bed after i said, i love you, and you said, thank you, good night."
15476,Leonard,"okay, i’ll walk down with you. so, last night was fun, huh?"
14152,Leonard,"i’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the web site. so, what do you guys think?"
12128,Leonard,"there you go, pad thai, no peanuts."
12136,Leonard,yes.
17738,Leonard,"hey, alex, and call me leonard. dr. hofstadter is my father. and my mother. and my sister. and our cat. although, i’m pretty sure dr. boots hofstadter’s degree was honorary."
18892,Leonard,thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
19792,Leonard,"well, what if you get it?"
16681,Leonard,"no, thank you. i’m really not much of a dancer."
13619,Leonard,sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. i am really sorry about this.
17848,Leonard,oh. it. was.
20066,Leonard,"no, we just made out."
13985,Leonard,"please, don’t go there, howard."
15577,Leonard,no.
18097,Leonard,"i was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again."
17679,Leonard,"that’s not true. uh, slavery. 1619. your name at the top. that’s all you."
13022,Leonard,"i don’t know, raj. maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  what’s going on?"
21002,Leonard,yeah. i said no.
15487,Leonard,"uh, i know! it’s been a while!"
19804,Leonard,"wil, i’m begging you, just please turn that off."
15702,Leonard,why not?
17033,Leonard,"well, yeah, thanks, jimmy."
19146,Leonard,he’s practicing.
15622,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’m-i’m still trying to work on the defecating clark maxwell, so…"
14710,Leonard,we must not be playing it right.
18698,Leonard,i said stay. i’m going to work. do not follow me. 
21634,Leonard,what the…?
12674,Leonard,"it wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase."
16987,Leonard,"there’s this guy, jimmy speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. he sent me a message through facebook. he’s in town and wants to have drinks."
12581,Leonard,"hey, i thought you were finding new friends."
12169,Leonard,sheldon? hello? 
18139,Leonard,"yeah. uh, maybe we were hacked. you know, the chinese have been hacking everything lately."
13078,Leonard,"no, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way i was raised. my parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
21541,Leonard,i’m trying. this is the best i can do. what are you doing?
15028,Leonard,"for god’s sakes. sheldon, come here!"
19051,Leonard,"i don’t know. we just started to think about this. maybe i’ll move in with penny, or maybe she and i’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall."
19434,Leonard,can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? and here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
20936,Leonard,i’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
20124,Leonard,"you heard him, no."
14012,Leonard,"right. ah! where’s the lime?  oh, okay, we’re sharing."
16901,Leonard,"movies, yes."
12590,Leonard,thank you. this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. thank you. 
18581,Leonard,i love it.
17463,Leonard,"uh, follow-up. are we still dating?"
16757,Leonard,what are you doing here?
21059,Leonard,"well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
14929,Leonard,"i’m sorry, but facts are facts."
17630,Leonard,"no. i did have a shot with the lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough."
17084,Leonard,that doesn’t make it true.
17354,Leonard,"i’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
12639,Leonard,"i know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
21302,Leonard,"okay, look, sheldon, the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you."
13558,Leonard,then why did you?
19852,Leonard,squeeze yourself.
19415,Leonard,"uh, i’ve been looking for a professor sharpe?"
16083,Leonard,"no, that was completely called for. we need quiet."
14375,Leonard,"yes, how did we live before twitter? i guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
19970,Leonard,"i can do that. uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it."
13381,Leonard,sorry.
12902,Leonard,isn’t that confusing? aa might mean something else to certain people. 
20042,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"
14418,Leonard,i don’t think i can go to the north pole.
13068,Leonard,excuse me while i go tell missy the good news. 
13420,Leonard,how did you manage to get on the second floor of the glendale galleria?
13401,Leonard,i just got here.
17927,Leonard,shouldn’t we talk to him? have you learned nothing in six years?
13624,Leonard,it’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
14383,Leonard,"okay, well, do you want to go?"
16946,Leonard,"oh, yeah? spell asthma."
13617,Leonard,not the right seats. 
18458,Leonard,"oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes."
17633,Leonard,"so, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. it uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. here, you hold this."
12519,Leonard,are you sure?
15914,Leonard,listen to me. you are over-tired. you’re not thinking right. put the movie back before we get into trouble.
12874,Leonard,the kid got a girl. 
19529,Leonard,"we all got the christmas card, cinnamon."
17648,Leonard,"why do you think i’d be like that? i get it, you’re taking one class. it’s nice. maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."
20499,Leonard,you may have actually just come up with something.
14088,Leonard,you’ve heard of him?
19565,Leonard,this is good. our idea is really good.
20460,Leonard,"well, glad you’re feeling better."
12273,Leonard,"no reason. oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea. "
14849,Leonard,what was i supposed to tell her?
19588,Leonard,do you really want him to write back?
16627,Leonard,that’s three minutes. should we see what we got?
14307,Leonard,what about it?
20006,Leonard,yeah.
18476,Leonard,"yup, oh, here you go."
20715,Leonard,"oh, i found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. it teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
19696,Leonard,it’s kind of a big deal.
17240,Leonard,five.
18549,Leonard,"well, you’re about to be in an even better one. i didn’t want to say anything until i knew for sure, but, i’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and i disproved it. your element does not exist."
14173,Leonard,davy crockett. jiminy crockett was a cricket.
14754,Leonard,where are you going? you just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
16570,Leonard,fine.
17017,Leonard,"sheldon, i got this."
20022,Leonard,"well, no, not socially. but, you know, just at work."
20112,Leonard,we got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
20758,Leonard,"penny’s busy with my mother, so i’m in."
18906,Leonard,"what about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?"
12328,Leonard,you’re making eggs for breakfast?
21466,Leonard,"so, sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."
15569,Leonard,"no, it’s not."
17816,Leonard,"you see those, too."
20539,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. and believe me, i try. you make me laugh. you make me a better scientist. you make me crazy. you’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother."
13165,Leonard,right.
15676,Leonard,didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
13948,Leonard,"feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. um, i just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
14085,Leonard,it’s perfect.
13336,Leonard,who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
19473,Leonard,yes.
16754,Leonard,"really? brent spiner, mr. data himself. you love him."
17683,Leonard,"oh, hey. haven’t heard from you in a couple days. you still mad at me?"
12951,Leonard,uh-huh.
15894,Leonard,"guys, that’s really starting to get old."
17044,Leonard,"yeah, you did. so, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. and , and, and thanks for the apology."
15907,Leonard,why do you read his twitter feed? you know it’s only going to upset you.
15693,Leonard,"hey, guys."
20894,Leonard,"that’s not helpful. it’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. hey, sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. we can’t do this without you. can you please pull it together?"
20748,Leonard,"hmm, atom of hydrogen, adam of maroon 5, mic drop."
19628,Leonard,buddy.
14477,Leonard,will you please take that stupid hat off?
20821,Leonard,no.
20280,Leonard,i know. i feel so grown up.
19083,Leonard,"no, he looks like a grown man. you’ve seen freaky friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies."
19527,Leonard,sure.
19444,Leonard,i told you my plan. let’s call building services and get help.
17665,Leonard,"maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. i want penny to enjoy school…"
18315,Leonard,"wait, i got it. i got it/"
15999,Leonard,you think penny’s right? were we bullying zack?
20804,Leonard,"mom, please save something for the toast."
19589,Leonard,me-wow.
21205,Leonard,hey.
13831,Leonard,"what’s this do, spin?"
12333,Leonard,and we all thank you.
15057,Leonard,guess who the university is sending to switzerland to attend a conference and see the cern supercollider on february 14?
20142,Leonard,"it’s indoors, so no sunscreen."
13300,Leonard,oh yeah.
18852,Leonard,i’ve seen old pictures of you. you were never a fat kid.
20882,Leonard,what is this?
19885,Leonard,they’re graduating.
19325,Leonard,"yeah, sure. you owe me."
16170,Leonard,"terrific. great. what level is that?  okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
14289,Leonard,"oh, howard’s losing it. check out his latest twitters. “i’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. my life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”"
12617,Leonard,"okay… if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
14010,Leonard,uh-huh.
16206,Leonard,i didn’t do it for the money!
14492,Leonard,what do you mean? it’s new comic book night.
17307,Leonard,hey.
18411,Leonard,he’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
17253,Leonard,"sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
21390,Leonard,"yeah, for a little while."
13035,Leonard,"hee-hee, just classic. "
14677,Leonard,apparently.
21530,Leonard,"it’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the u.s. government and us."
19955,Leonard,it is. it is about us.
13536,Leonard,he can never know that i gave that to you.
15810,Leonard,"okay, fine, i betrayed howard."
15207,Leonard,"yeah, we watched it last week. you said you liked it."
12770,Leonard,"sheldon, you are not sick. this is, but you are not. "
11998,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i’m just a little concerned about you."
17736,Leonard,that’s the name of his gang. the scientists. they are crazy.
15281,Leonard,"what about you, raj?"
16717,Leonard,it would be a replica of a movie prop.
14273,Leonard,"i’ve never been there, have you?"
19329,Leonard,what?
19296,Leonard,"i’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. me neither, leonard. it’s my first time, too."
21446,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
12815,Leonard,"okay, it’s on."
20239,Leonard,there’s a security camera?
17374,Leonard,"so, is that one mine."
19560,Leonard,i earned this. back off.
21739,Leonard,"come on, i just asked."
19059,Leonard,okay. and when would that be?
20602,Leonard,because he’s hitting on you?
19264,Leonard,nothing.
12112,Leonard,just grab the door.
19442,Leonard,a slim jim?
15789,Leonard,"well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, i’m older. look, no more superhero bedsheets."
17170,Leonard,my bug report to you.
12304,Leonard,"yeah, i’m okay. did you spill ketchup?"
21194,Leonard,"well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead i’m gonna keep it to myself."
20273,Leonard,what happened?
18746,Leonard,name one.
18928,Leonard,i’m starting to remember the problem with anything can happen thursdays.
15250,Leonard,no reason. i’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
20424,Leonard,that someone has a name.
17618,Leonard,sign right there.
14359,Leonard,it was?
14024,Leonard,i forget. which one is hammer of the gods?
12201,Leonard,"one package, phillips head screws."
18079,Leonard,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. i meant, golly, sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time."
20347,Leonard,"he’s not that bad. hey, stuart, got any plans thursday night?"
13092,Leonard,what’s the matter?
19298,Leonard,yes.
16064,Leonard,no.
14936,Leonard,what’s going on?
18547,Leonard,of course you’re not. people love trained monkeys.
13886,Leonard,"bye, sheldon."
15972,Leonard,i’ll friend you on facebook.
13970,Leonard,yes.
16390,Leonard,"yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
17699,Leonard,we’re not standing outside by the u-haul while you fondle yourself.
19495,Leonard,that is not a compromise. a compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
18523,Leonard,"yeah, they are."
19238,Leonard,all right.
18195,Leonard,yeah?
17485,Leonard,"thank you, amy. very touching. howard and bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. and that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
21133,Leonard,we lived together 13 years. how can you be so awful to me?
15832,Leonard,"yeah, i, uh, went for a drink."
13961,Leonard,great.
13011,Leonard,"sorry raj, my mind is made up."
14405,Leonard,"i mean, i know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that i’m going to be gone for the whole summer?"
21049,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
12523,Leonard,"your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? "
19558,Leonard,you’re giving me a sticker?
20633,Leonard,six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
16101,Leonard,are you an element in the actinoid series?
14624,Leonard,right.
12172,Leonard,"do you realise that if penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
19682,Leonard,seems a shame to throw it away.
20375,Leonard,"right? to this day, i send her a card every year with a little money in it."
17382,Leonard,really?
14117,Leonard,"only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
20784,Leonard,"look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her."
13491,Leonard,did i miss anything? did they kick giselle off?
19905,Leonard,"you still are. uh, mom, hey, tell mary the story about how i made a van der graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner."
20147,Leonard,that’s not why we’re here.
13367,Leonard,terrific.
19305,Leonard,"i got it, i got it. listen, um, i think there’s been a misunderstanding. see, penny is my fiancée."
21586,Leonard,stop it.
18152,Leonard,"well, then, tell your face."
20921,Leonard,that’s a good question. maybe just don’t come over.
20938,Leonard,you were right. 
20360,Leonard,hey.
12645,Leonard,"ah. technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. so it works as two. "
15093,Leonard,you made frodo pancakes?
18961,Leonard,hmm?
18699,Leonard,yeah.
14901,Leonard,"what do you want, sheldon?"
15816,Leonard,"you can if you try. think about it this way, if i were batman and you were alfred, you’d keep that secret. right?"
20510,Leonard,i think we’d make amazing parents.
21506,Leonard,"yeah, it’s weird."
17212,Leonard,"no, they ended up calling me sock mouth. because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
14015,Leonard,i don’t know. foreplay?
13805,Leonard,wow.
21355,Leonard,"don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. it’s like an all-night party. there’s trivia contests and dungeons & dragons. as we like to say, it’s off the chain mail."
12318,Leonard,"i know, i’m familiar with you."
16522,Leonard,go sit over there.
13034,Leonard,so it’s settled. you’ll stay with us.
18480,Leonard,"no, no, no, i, i looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
13738,Leonard,it’s david underhill. so what?
17616,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there."
20430,Leonard,still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
13108,Leonard,"oh, it’s okay."
13603,Leonard,he just won’t listen to me.
21388,Leonard,i don’t have a loofah.
18133,Leonard,way to hit ’em with both barrels.
12915,Leonard,"so nothing, let’s destroy him. "
20315,Leonard,"well, hum it again. is that the spongebob song?"
13335,Leonard,"let’s see, raj was the kung palo chicken."
21184,Leonard,yeah?
21736,Leonard,"a car, yeah."
17486,Leonard,"no, come on in. hurry."
20959,Leonard,"no, don’t do that."
16378,Leonard,totally.
14947,Leonard,"no, i’m sorry. i really am. it’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
20604,Leonard,you and i could still go and have a nice weekend.
12798,Leonard,"oh dammit, my glasses. okay, i’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
12636,Leonard,"great, be right back."
12508,Leonard,well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half.
15745,Leonard,"yeah. so, bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
20730,Leonard,"i have to admit, i’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
12195,Leonard,it’s fine. you win.
13926,Leonard,really?
17945,Leonard,i don’t know why i avoided the harry potter books for so long. these are great. i just started number six.
16381,Leonard,no.
18648,Leonard,"that was really crappy of me. what you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and i really do believe you could be one of them."
20289,Leonard,"your birthday is december 2, you grew up on perkins street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
17220,Leonard,"i thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
17715,Leonard,what did he say?
19638,Leonard,hmm. i can honestly say penny.
16499,Leonard,"i still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. not that i care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause i don’t."
21639,Leonard,"hey, where’ve you been?"
21186,Leonard,"by the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it."
18874,Leonard,"oh, that’s great."
13417,Leonard,oh.
21073,Leonard,"hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
19728,Leonard,keep going.
19000,Leonard,"a little, yeah."
21750,Leonard,does that really need to be in the agreement?
16682,Leonard,i’m sorry. the bride and groom seem happy.
15500,Leonard,"i don’t think that’s going to happen, sheldon."
21358,Leonard,"yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
15212,Leonard,"um, i don’t know, maybe."
17179,Leonard,thank you.
16800,Leonard,"no, i don’t think i picked her up. besides, i have a girlfriend."
21419,Leonard,jerry?
16463,Leonard,why would i want to do that?
15092,Leonard,what’s going on?
13928,Leonard,"hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
17118,Leonard,"well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? it could be more like a new version of software. penny and leonard 2.0. we can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
18744,Leonard,"i say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses."
19613,Leonard,come on. sorry to bother you.
19085,Leonard,"sheldon, if you really need to do this, i’m not gonna stand in your way."
20096,Leonard,your house?
21743,Leonard,when i have to.
15111,Leonard,"do you want an allergy pill? ‘cause i have ’em all. prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
17577,Leonard,isn’t that enough? it had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. what more do you want?
14563,Leonard,no.
12685,Leonard,what? oh we just had to… mail some letters and 
16344,Leonard,what’s going on?
20002,Leonard,this is it.
20393,Leonard,you’re not dying. it’s just the flu.
20795,Leonard,penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
17164,Leonard,"great. you keep a list, i’ll keep a list. at some point, we’ll exchange."
17958,Leonard,what?
14280,Leonard,"come on, let’s go."
13777,Leonard,brilliant.
17957,Leonard,yes.
21147,Leonard,"okay, i can breathe again. babe, they want to have sex."
13263,Leonard,sounds fun.
19254,Leonard,she doesn’t flirt with doctors.
20033,Leonard,"how am i supposed to sleep? i’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me."
14031,Leonard,are you done?
17747,Leonard,"come on, i’m sorry."
13815,Leonard,he’s been in bed for two days.
18390,Leonard,nailed it.
19860,Leonard,how would i be blinded?
14561,Leonard,"yes, you’re forbidden."
14233,Leonard,"nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
13299,Leonard,what’s the bright side?
15343,Leonard,"okay, fine. where is she going to sleep?"
19917,Leonard,"oh, me."
21737,Leonard,"well, can’t you drive?"
12805,Leonard,raj?
13887,Leonard,interesting.
15726,Leonard,"no, it’s just something i threw on."
14006,Leonard,"of course she did. anyway, that’s not what i was gonna say. when i was ten years old, i built a hugging machine."
15056,Leonard,that’s not what i was going to tell you.
17545,Leonard,"oh. yeah, okay."
14903,Leonard,"thank you, that’s very comforting."
16184,Leonard,i am not going to have sex with her.
12251,Leonard,"i know what you’re thinking, i’ve taken your asthma into account. there’s a feline geneticist in san diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. "
15761,Leonard,yeah. it’s good to see you too. here you go.
19431,Leonard,"sheldon, that wasn’t for you."
13479,Leonard,not unless she destroys tokyo.
16614,Leonard,"fine, whatever. priya will be having breakfast."
12082,Leonard,that’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn’t participate. however briefly.
13272,Leonard,yes.
12407,Leonard,brrrr. why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
15874,Leonard,really? maybe sleep has met you before.
12350,Leonard,"that is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about sheldon?"
13838,Leonard,penny.
16900,Leonard,what the hell is going on?
20306,Leonard,"well, you didn’t read it right. the new star wars is coming. gah."
15848,Leonard,papaya?
14098,Leonard,"yeah, maybe. meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in san francisco."
16466,Leonard,what’s the big deal?
14611,Leonard,why?
19903,Leonard,"subtle, mom, real subtle."
19155,Leonard,"okay, i got to, i, i, i, i got to ask. what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?"
15239,Leonard,can we please talk about something else? maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
17003,Leonard,"you know, i can really do this by myself."
19042,Leonard,oh. how’s it going?
20813,Leonard,cheers.
15826,Leonard,an orang-u-tan?
13471,Leonard,i don’t know morse code.
15137,Leonard,for what?
21090,Leonard,"excuse me, i have to go take some pictures."
14288,Leonard,"maybe, but i’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
18910,Leonard,yeah.
21429,Leonard,"a little, until i saw them in matching tops."
21193,Leonard,i made your favourite. pizza bagels.
16026,Leonard,"okay, listen. you don’t have to wear the wig. at this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
12886,Leonard,the needs of the many.
14223,Leonard,"don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
15014,Leonard,are you okay?
20275,Leonard,"i don’t know if you want to do that, i was just, okay, never mind."
14482,Leonard,we came to apologize.
14198,Leonard,"alicia is an actress, just like you."
18930,Leonard,"you know what? why don’t we just ease into this. let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant."
12369,Leonard,why at my place?
20051,Leonard,"secondly, i can’t think of a more horrible idea than penny meeting mandy."
17893,Leonard,no.
15450,Leonard,"so, menus."
12002,Leonard,"this is hot tub time machine all over again. if future biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with marty and doc in it. because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 biff placed his first bet."
18591,Leonard,you guys are making me nervous.
17833,Leonard,"ah, i’d love to, but i’m supposed to hang out with penny."
15434,Leonard,"so, we’re good?"
20830,Leonard,you don’t know his girlfriend very well.
15719,Leonard,"me? well, how am i supposed to fix it?"
14810,Leonard,raj.
12437,Leonard,"oh, no. "
21362,Leonard,now we’re going as hulk and she-hulk. i don’t want to take my shirt off at comic-con.
17129,Leonard,yes.
19896,Leonard,"see, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around sheldon’s mom?"
20184,Leonard,the man restocking the cereal shelves.
19597,Leonard,stephen hawking liked our paper. said the premise is intriguing.
12258,Leonard,"there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner i mean supper."
18375,Leonard,"i am, i’m really proud."
21496,Leonard,"yeah, i guess."
17142,Leonard,"oh, that is not true."
18858,Leonard,"but if i get a chance to be a tenured professor, i might not have that much choice in where i end up."
19033,Leonard,"whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions."
15861,Leonard,"yes. of course, we’re in different departments. he’s an engineer and i’m an experimental physicist. you know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, hello, maker of the universe, i see what you did there. good one."
19770,Leonard,you did flop around a lot.
19994,Leonard,"i don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. look, it’s not how i pictured it either, but i’m still glad we’re doing it."
21695,Leonard,push it real good.
19577,Leonard,"oh, the pleasure is mine, mr. innovative. uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. do you hear that, mr. out-of-the?"
14306,Leonard,"yeah, vaguely."
19615,Leonard,sorry again.
20355,Leonard,"so, if you don’t like star wars, why are you here?"
20482,Leonard,"why oh, no?"
21437,Leonard,thank you. i just feel…
15259,Leonard,"yeah, i do."
13821,Leonard,"okay, let’s try it this way. remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your tv back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? what did you say? oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
15658,Leonard,"that covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. oh, my god. you ran over a hobo."
16481,Leonard,"okay, well, i look forward to playing with you."
15571,Leonard,uh-huh.
19573,Leonard,"sheldon, this is superfluid helium. put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off."
17177,Leonard,great. good. great. what are you reading?
16225,Leonard,"i love the way you say, i’d love that."
21588,Leonard,what? 
17110,Leonard,"okay, but earlier it seemed like…"
20433,Leonard,that’s my best friend.
21287,Leonard,at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
21331,Leonard,"i’m trying, but i’m judging."
21513,Leonard,"yeah, but she also used to sleep with zack."
20989,Leonard,"but i-i-i, oh. nothing about that was good."
18956,Leonard,comforting you?
18700,Leonard,"i don’t know. she already thinks i don’t support this, so if i call, it might look like i’m checking up on her."
17416,Leonard,"actually, you did do one of them together."
15948,Leonard,don’t i know it.
19470,Leonard,"well, i’d like to be green, but you know you always take it."
17172,Leonard,"uh, red means fix right away. yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. and green is i could probably learn to live with it. there’s a key down here at the bottom. it’s neat, huh?"
15620,Leonard,john and yoko.
13160,Leonard,"no, it’s about penny."
16115,Leonard,no.
19784,Leonard,"hey, great."
18966,Leonard,sorry.
17681,Leonard,"oh, come on, you know that’s not true."
15586,Leonard,i think it is.
16574,Leonard,"well, what difference does it make? if you’re moving back to india, we’re obviously breaking up."
18851,Leonard,"oh, no, no. that’s clarence darrow. it’s from a game sheldon made up called chutes and lawyers. you slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
19604,Leonard,"we know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."
12433,Leonard,we’re really more….
16057,Leonard,it’s not a joke. it’s the real design.
19461,Leonard,anything?
17537,Leonard,you can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
15000,Leonard,maybe you need a fresh start.
18696,Leonard,no.
19078,Leonard,"come on, come home with us and tomorrow i’ll, i’ll take you to legoland."
16111,Leonard,"of course, sometimes the federation and the romulans would enter the neutral zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
14317,Leonard,"good, good. you?"
12876,Leonard,"well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart. "
21599,Leonard,"hey, sorry i couldn’t find a parking spot, how are you doing."
18149,Leonard,"oh, don’t say cute. that’s the worst."
18335,Leonard,"this one is, too."
19549,Leonard,"exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, i fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?"
12682,Leonard,skynet is kinky? i don’t know. 
12526,Leonard,"penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. "
15631,Leonard,"hey.  oh, no."
18823,Leonard,fine.
17050,Leonard,"i’m not afraid of you any more, jimmy. now get out!  uh-oh."
18620,Leonard,"so it, it’s just flirting?"
17366,Leonard,really? i don’t even notice any more.
21504,Leonard,"yeah. although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, i’m pretty sure i saw smoke coming out of his ears. you’re not really considering working for him, are you?"
21109,Leonard,"well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
12086,Leonard,"that’s great, you guys have to go."
13710,Leonard,"okay, well, i ju… i think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, i had it!"
13745,Leonard,"wow, y-yeah, sure. yeah, no problem. uh, here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in new jersey, they always know how to reach me. so…"
13653,Leonard,"really? oh, look at that, i have a girlfriend."
15335,Leonard,yeah. shame he has to wake up.
12359,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, orcs are magic, superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk."
12336,Leonard,so… fish. 
20798,Leonard,"dad, you remember sheldon."
21475,Leonard,and we lived happily ever after. 
18607,Leonard,"oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man."
13465,Leonard,"yeah, i can see that. sheldon, halo night, koothrappali’s. you coming?"
14009,Leonard,my father used to borrow it.
12715,Leonard,your cousin leopold?
18905,Leonard,are you sure you want to do this?
21335,Leonard,"hey, you guys let stuart live with you. why not raj, too?"
17037,Leonard,"sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
14706,Leonard,"no, i’ll watch the end of the game. besides, there’s only three minutes left."
16018,Leonard,you’re jogging.
16837,Leonard,"yeah, me, too. i can’t make up my mind."
15525,Leonard,how’s that?
20528,Leonard,speech! speech!
18334,Leonard,"hey, i am every bit as much of a man as penny. now, let’s do this."
18321,Leonard,why?
14814,Leonard,what if you could make kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
15376,Leonard,"penny, i can still drive you."
13049,Leonard,thank you. 
16330,Leonard,it is pretty spicy.
16252,Leonard,really? levar burton’s coming here?
17579,Leonard,"magnets: what do they stick to? if the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking."
19164,Leonard,"so, this is accurate?"
18397,Leonard,i thought amy was gonna drive you home.
13273,Leonard,yes.
14507,Leonard,"penny, wait. aagh! what is wrong with you?"
17858,Leonard,of course not. no. why?
16884,Leonard,"hi, amy."
19749,Leonard,"well, so do i, but they’ll never let us."
17619,Leonard,"uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer."
15074,Leonard,"well, you’ll ski, i’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in switzerland for valentine’s day."
13665,Leonard,i’m going to bed.
12844,Leonard,"well, what are you going to do, sheldon, give up?"
20605,Leonard,"okay, one sec."
17305,Leonard,"like i said, complicated game."
15125,Leonard,"no, no, stan lee."
21079,Leonard,"do it. visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
12240,Leonard,"i was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. but we don’t need to quibble over terminology. "
18770,Leonard,"oh, no, come on. it was a while. it was a while."
17370,Leonard,absolutely.
12460,Leonard,come on.
12853,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully. "
14899,Leonard,then why are you telling me?
14826,Leonard,i think it upsets sheldon when you play with the food.
17019,Leonard,i think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
20571,Leonard,"soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make."
13676,Leonard,we’re not living together.
12729,Leonard,"oh, okay, alright, good. "
14384,Leonard,"sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
14886,Leonard,you must be very happy.
15410,Leonard,that should have been my first clue.
16162,Leonard,what?
16981,Leonard,that’s all of us. can i use the laptop?
19497,Leonard,is it my turn to talk about the compromises i make?
19564,Leonard,when did my idea become our idea?
21483,Leonard,you don’t have to go. you’re welcome to hang with us.
17503,Leonard,great. just relax and enjoy. tonight is all about you.
20518,Leonard,"or a real batman. hey, stuart? didn’t you try to get adam west to do a signing here once?"
20616,Leonard,they have some board games.
15953,Leonard,"you got to admit, i am, i’m delightful."
17461,Leonard,"penny, just, wait. i’ve been thinking about what i said when we were in bed the other night."
18502,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. who cares? look at me."
20435,Leonard,did it?
17771,Leonard,what are you idiots doing?
18807,Leonard,we’re not.
20511,Leonard,way to narrow it down to everything.
21199,Leonard,that’s nice. i wear a size eight and a half.
18226,Leonard,"three, four months."
13956,Leonard,"hey, i know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
14556,Leonard,"yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
21768,Leonard,there you go– three against one.
16788,Leonard,here.
12073,Leonard,no.
17149,Leonard,every scenario i play out for you and me ends badly.
19594,Leonard,never noticed that about you.
12802,Leonard,i’m thinking! 
13860,Leonard,on the floor.
16382,Leonard,come on.
13649,Leonard,"it’s not bold, it’s a mistake. i didn’t change my status."
17338,Leonard,"i don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that i’m a stallion that has to run free. and that would turn you on a little."
20947,Leonard,and i think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
20426,Leonard,"oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her."
17770,Leonard,mmm.
14616,Leonard,"howard, you can’t hold me to that."
16096,Leonard,"don’t worry. just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
19862,Leonard,"mm, i thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. i even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me."
13593,Leonard,yeah.
16386,Leonard,"something’s wrong, i’m not getting any gas. anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
13206,Leonard,good day? 
21450,Leonard,"oh, my god, it’s seven."
20337,Leonard,"guys, tickets already went on sale."
18243,Leonard,yep. i’m really gonna miss you.
17098,Leonard,"oh, god."
16050,Leonard,"okay, we need to stop for a minute."
13065,Leonard,"if we’re going to fight over missy, let’s do it the right way. the honourable way."
14099,Leonard,"oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
17373,Leonard,"okay, that i believe."
21137,Leonard,"well, for me, too. it’s not the same with you gone."
21005,Leonard,"it’s cute, they’re having fun living together."
21746,Leonard,is this it?
21660,Leonard,i think he’s getting worse.
13637,Leonard,stitches? with a needle?
20767,Leonard,we’d still get in.
16596,Leonard,what’s going on? what do you want?
12344,Leonard,"really, when was the last time you left the house."
20166,Leonard,we should let you guys talk.
20208,Leonard,will you stop with that already?
20210,Leonard,let’s just start the experiment.
13469,Leonard,why?
19018,Leonard,then what do you need?
21507,Leonard,"no, no, i’m not jealous, i just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers."
14598,Leonard,"yeah, okay. um, howard, we need to talk."
19467,Leonard,she says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
20050,Leonard,"uh, first of all, you made that guy cry."
21464,Leonard,so howard back monday?
13808,Leonard,"yes, we did, kripke."
12589,Leonard,"look, penny, we’d love to help you, but raj is going through some stuff right now. and besides, he doesn’t drink, so…  really? um, raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking. "
17523,Leonard,what are you doing?
17176,Leonard,can you finish it later?
16741,Leonard,thank you.
15194,Leonard,"there wasn’t ever going to be a winner. there was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. is that really what you guys want? ‘cause if it is, fine, i don’t want anything to do with you. and i don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but i am not cleaning it up!  my precious."
20706,Leonard,"the difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out."
16558,Leonard,you? sure. bring as many as you want.
18977,Leonard,yeah.
15485,Leonard,"if she can do it, i can do it. if she can do it, i can do it. if she can do it, i can do it.  i can’t do it."
20172,Leonard,"i’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month."
21596,Leonard,"hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
20183,Leonard,he’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
12364,Leonard,hey lesley. 
12625,Leonard,"alright, i don’t care what you say, i’m going to the conference and i’m presenting our findings. "
16926,Leonard,great. that’ll be five dollars. i am having the best time. i’m so glad you suggested we do this.
21274,Leonard,that was six years ago. i’m talking about tonight.
13635,Leonard,"no, no, no, i got it."
15338,Leonard,"here’s an idea. i’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
16245,Leonard,right.
15330,Leonard,we’re not fighting.
15352,Leonard,"well, i understand, too."
12998,Leonard,"don’t worry baby, i’ve got you."
20639,Leonard,that’s not true.
16078,Leonard,we’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
17196,Leonard,"i don’t know, what am i doing?"
20863,Leonard,"exactly. yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
20561,Leonard,they’ve been out there a while.
13606,Leonard,i’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
21374,Leonard,why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?
12399,Leonard,"wuh, i don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, i’m not…. sheldon, we have to go! "
12891,Leonard,"i move we are the army ants, all those in favour?"
17186,Leonard,"so, i’ve got a gunshot wound. that’s pretty badass."
14192,Leonard,you’re making her uncomfortable.
14212,Leonard,problem?
20845,Leonard,so some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
16116,Leonard,"sure, no problem."
15445,Leonard,we’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
21364,Leonard,"uh, it’s more complicated than that."
15955,Leonard,what do you want me to do? you started this. do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
12885,Leonard,"sheldon, what, do i need to quote spock’s dying words to you."
15146,Leonard,"one more floor, and i’d be the pulled muscle."
18326,Leonard,got it.
21543,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re being silly."
14969,Leonard,"we’re fine, sheldon."
13419,Leonard,"watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
19785,Leonard,"oh, if she was with an indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, howard and raj."
19625,Leonard,what’s wrong?
14570,Leonard,"i was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
18279,Leonard,i’m going to work. you can come if you want.
12699,Leonard,it’s two o’clock in the morning
15924,Leonard,no.
19322,Leonard,"a little, but he’s basically harmless. he’s actually kind of a nice guy."
12619,Leonard,are there any other honours i’ve gotten that i don’t know about? did ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it?
16665,Leonard,amy?
17298,Leonard,"when you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
17238,Leonard,do i get a card?
16335,Leonard,"why does it have to be about anything? can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
17231,Leonard,"that we go back to the way things were. but when i do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
15868,Leonard,would you please get that?
13269,Leonard,"why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?"
12421,Leonard,really?
13126,Leonard,of course not.
18585,Leonard, what do you think?
16916,Leonard,all the time.
16491,Leonard,"hi. hey, raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
21169,Leonard,hey.
14682,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, please teach me about football. it’ll be fun."
12972,Leonard,yeah. it is by far the coolest thing i have ever owned. 
13840,Leonard,"alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
20406,Leonard,"he’s coming, too."
20820,Leonard,go to sleep.
16189,Leonard,"no, that’s okay."
14917,Leonard,"howard, artificial women are your department. you want to take this?"
19741,Leonard,i doubt it.
19491,Leonard,"i don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. it’s the least we can do."
18047,Leonard,"yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. and frankly, this is one i believe in. okay, here we go. encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences."
21020,Leonard,"superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone."
16076,Leonard,you know what? go put on your bus pants.
14987,Leonard,we were going to have…
13141,Leonard,"oh, sure. huh, maybe i am her gay friend. "
16523,Leonard,is there a history of heart disease in your family?
14988,Leonard,what are you doing? use the door.
13149,Leonard,"oh, penny, i am so sorry."
15187,Leonard,door. 
20115,Leonard,i still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. you’re a young man.
19488,Leonard,that’s true.
17090,Leonard,"oh, sorry, yeah. awkward."
21472,Leonard,"so, rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
14620,Leonard,"no, i haven’t."
18404,Leonard,it’s really sweet what howard wants to do for bernadette.
16392,Leonard,nice shot.
21044,Leonard,what about my robot poster?
20364,Leonard,none of that is true.
19410,Leonard,this has to mean something.
15023,Leonard,thanks for not calling the cops.
14687,Leonard,when are you going to stop making cylon toast?
14774,Leonard,"come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
14594,Leonard,"you know, whatever."
21319,Leonard,you can do this.
18775,Leonard,how’s she doing?
12325,Leonard,what.  howard brought a date?
14776,Leonard,"mmmm, not bad."
18140,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s a fat guy on a segway. that’s funny everywhere.
12494,Leonard,yes you are. 
19719,Leonard,"no, it’s okay. we’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. at least i am. howard, what do you think?"
18434,Leonard,"oh, wow."
18638,Leonard,"nope. uh, uh, i might not know what i meant, but i know that i didn’t mean that. not this guy. oh, no way."
20843,Leonard,that’s okay. i can make it over.
16785,Leonard,what are you gonna do? she wanted to see churches.
13513,Leonard,"just so i know, would you be open to taking his class? you can do it online!"
18360,Leonard,i gotta go.
13202,Leonard,no i didn’t.
17895,Leonard,"what? hey, hey! come back here!"
18680,Leonard,it doesn’t.
13044,Leonard,"uh, yeah, no, uh, bye penny."
17229,Leonard,i thought you said candles were dangerous.
15890,Leonard,"don’t worry, sheldon. we’ll be fine."
18048,Leonard,helping women? y
19401,Leonard,"oh, what’d you get?"
14092,Leonard,what are you doing?
16311,Leonard,"maybe, but that’s not my problem. she’s not my girlfriend, you are."
16991,Leonard,"no, that was a different, different guy."
21667,Leonard,‘sup?
16858,Leonard,"no, no, i messed up a little. you messed up a lot."
14797,Leonard,the cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
13106,Leonard,how could i be mad? you actually risked your life because you cared about me.
19663,Leonard,"well, ’cause i got it at the dirty store."
14942,Leonard,"what am i supposed to do, pretend i believe something i don’t whenever i’m with penny?"
14649,Leonard,"no, no, i’m not, so, great. you’ve got plans doing something you like, i’ve got plans doing something i like, so it’s good."
12286,Leonard,give me the phone. 
17150,Leonard,what? yeah.
16724,Leonard,slow down. two hundred.
18611,Leonard,"i’m telling you, sheldon cares for you more than you think."
17942,Leonard,"all right, we’re down the rabbit hole. what are you doing?"
14587,Leonard,"excuse me, sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
13048,Leonard,"sheldon, can i talk to you in private?"
14958,Leonard,and why is that?
15393,Leonard,elizabeth? what’s going on?
18118,Leonard,"well, look at that. burned a whole calorie."
17598,Leonard,"yeah, that’s when it started."
12658,Leonard,"all? in particle physics, twenty five is woodstock. "
16347,Leonard,you called the police because someone hacked your world of warcraft account?
16316,Leonard, nope.
14569,Leonard,unbelievable.
17175,Leonard,hey. you ready to go?
15964,Leonard,"oh, hey. there’s been something i’ve been meaning to tell you."
15680,Leonard,so what’s going on with you two?
18049,Leonard,"oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?"
14232,Leonard,i don’t believe it. stuart’s putting the moves on penny.
13758,Leonard,"oh, yeah. it’s just a little motorcycle accident."
18163,Leonard,nice shot.
19236,Leonard,guys.
19548,Leonard,"well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own."
20998,Leonard,like a river carves a canyon.
16775,Leonard,"raj, what are you doing?"
21693,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
21023,Leonard,"oh, yeah, there he is."
17182,Leonard,you mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
15264,Leonard,"gets us out of our heads. you get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. that’s not what we’re doing tonight. tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
20545,Leonard,"yeah, we did our own search."
14761,Leonard,thank you.
16992,Leonard,no.
17674,Leonard,"uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of the shoemaker and the elves?"
14145,Leonard,"terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
19836,Leonard,the flower dies.
17779,Leonard,raj is probably right. you should get someone to give you some pointers.
17174,Leonard,"look at that. some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
12334,Leonard,what’s with the fish?
16786,Leonard,"oh, i’m not sure we should."
16454,Leonard,oh. cool. i’ve got a lawyer. and i’ve seen her naked.
19480,Leonard,i did not force you to go to that.
20678,Leonard,no.
13920,Leonard,did he pay you back?
14331,Leonard,no.
14887,Leonard,"not the time, sheldon."
13369,Leonard,you’re joking.
13281,Leonard,"listen, i’m sorry about all of sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
12854,Leonard,go away.
21304,Leonard,"come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. why are you doing this?"
19797,Leonard,"like, times two twice?"
14512,Leonard,"so, you’ve been through this before?"
15053,Leonard,oh. i used to be like that. then i got a girlfriend.
13922,Leonard,well what are you gonna do?
12991,Leonard,"uh, here’s the thing. girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines. "
17528,Leonard,i wish there were more.
12313,Leonard,awesome!
13124,Leonard,"wait, did you say wait?"
14636,Leonard,"girls don’t count klingon, howard. right?"
12583,Leonard,so call her. 
18771,Leonard,"maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?"
20930,Leonard,good night.
14711,Leonard,"oh, gee, sheldon, i don’t think we can play on sunday."
16232,Leonard,i’m having dinner with priya at raj’s. i think howard’s going to be there. you want to join us?
20262,Leonard,what? i don’t want to do that.
16819,Leonard,"i’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so i know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
16859,Leonard,"oh yeah, it is, and you won. i, i, i’m, i’m sorry, i have to go. i don’t believe this."
21176,Leonard,stupid idea.
13095,Leonard,now?
19056,Leonard,"well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh."
16668,Leonard,"i, i’m fine."
19366,Leonard,i would have asked you. in my head. on the way home. while i was having a good cry.
19951,Leonard,thanks.
14785,Leonard,"that’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
13109,Leonard,"hey penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?"
14274,Leonard,"okay, then let’s do this, lets go to las vegas."
15793,Leonard,"oh, uh, yeah, i was trying to see if i could laugh as a woman."
15646,Leonard,hold on to that thought. 
17915,Leonard,"oh, this is neat. think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. it would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. don’t you think?"
16855,Leonard,it is?
12851,Leonard,it would blow up.
16065,Leonard,no.
14547,Leonard,what was that?
17226,Leonard,"no, don’t aw him. he brought this all on himself."
21359,Leonard,"yeah, of course, why?"
17077,Leonard,"no, i mean just you and me."
19643,Leonard,ladies?
13345,Leonard,come on.
17430,Leonard,"before i come in, you should know, i have gas.  "
17840,Leonard,"to my bones. i mean, i’m not gonna do anything about it. i love penny. it’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods."
17189,Leonard,"so, are we still taking things slow? because a gunshot wound today, last week, i slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. we don’t know how much time i have."
21286,Leonard,just keep walking.
16433,Leonard,"yeah, raj, why?"
20117,Leonard,"come on, buddy."
16017,Leonard,what are you doing?
21753,Leonard,shh. just pretend we’re not here.
13346,Leonard,"not really, it’s what you and i would call condescension."
15519,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, great. howard, uh, slow down. what do you mean it happened again?"
17590,Leonard,penny got it.
16435,Leonard,hope you’re hungry.
16590,Leonard,"raj, come on. you fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. a month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
18353,Leonard,"of course, who am i to argue with a check-plus student? just warning you, i’m gonna go right. don’t make a big deal out of it."
16239,Leonard,come with me to raj’s and eat there.
20896,Leonard,i’m gonna get some coffee. you want some?
12013,Leonard,"well, what do you want to do?"
19528,Leonard,cinnamon. give me another one.
16847,Leonard,but i kind of have a girlfriend.
12903,Leonard,"no, i meant…. never mind. hey, check it out. i got you a batman cookie jar!"
16527,Leonard,"no, i do not. you are a mean little man."
19791,Leonard,give me back that juice.
17116,Leonard,why? what are you afraid of?
13707,Leonard,it’s just a little scary.
19233,Leonard,"okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. that’s when he altered the timeline."
17512,Leonard,i’m good.
21629,Leonard,okay-dokay
20807,Leonard,what is his hurry?
12946,Leonard,how do you know these things?
13364,Leonard,you look very nice.
18204,Leonard,"double potion, please."
21495,Leonard,"i drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the hulk."
19231,Leonard,what do you mean?
21606,Leonard,what does that mean?
15043,Leonard,"lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
12354,Leonard,"this is ridiculous. dammit, sheldon, snap out of it. you’re a physicist, you belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room. "
18241,Leonard,it’s not a competition.
17234,Leonard,i kind of like the sound of that.
17035,Leonard,"no, no, no, come on in. i’ll make you a cup of coffee."
17292,Leonard,i’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. i’ll pick you up when you’re done.
19237,Leonard,"guys, what are we doing? we sent the girls away so we could focus."
18839,Leonard,"come on, don’t look so sad. you never know what’s gonna happen. maybe tonight will be great."
21511,Leonard,"we covered this, i’m dumb."
14371,Leonard,what?
16872,Leonard,"uh, she’s your friend. step up."
14511,Leonard,okay?
20041,Leonard,"well, trust me, i wish it never happened."
19247,Leonard,thank you. and now i owe you one.
20600,Leonard,why are you pretending to be outdoors? you hate it.
14705,Leonard,"oh, look at that. the oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. i hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-outs."
19800,Leonard,"hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?"
12015,Leonard,"i don’t know, i’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
15970,Leonard,excuse me?
19901,Leonard,we just spent two hours in traffic. did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
12894,Leonard,"i was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start. "
13259,Leonard,are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
20551,Leonard,"well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
15472,Leonard,where’s penny?
19449,Leonard,"i can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and slim jim in it."
18971,Leonard,"yeah, well, when i die, you can rent a bounce house."
18421,Leonard,"you don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?"
15559,Leonard,"greetings, whatever the hell you are."
17765,Leonard,all that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
19091,Leonard,"me, too. and he was able to take a sabbatical from…"
18895,Leonard,"okay, this was helpful."
17040,Leonard,yeah. it kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
13786,Leonard,lactose.
14199,Leonard,"alicia, what do you want as your default setting for dvds, 5.1 dolby or dts?"
18249,Leonard,"i love you, too."
14767,Leonard,"oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
17020,Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
19608,Leonard,"oh yeah, look at that."
12021,Leonard,is that why they sent you to boarding school?
13729,Leonard,"no! no, no! i wasn’t going to say any of that. i was just going to say, i really like you."
14552,Leonard,"in this case, you bet she is."
14363,Leonard,leonard?
15181,Leonard,"i’m not letting go, you let go."
15118,Leonard,will you please turn your shirt off?
21782,Leonard,"oh, this is pretty nice. uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
21001,Leonard,"the third time i did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
19084,Leonard,"i know, but…"
13807,Leonard,"i don’t know, now they’re just yelling about popsicles. sounds like penny really got to him."
13964,Leonard,"aren’t there any other options? there’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable."
12026,Leonard,"we don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
14868,Leonard,"yeah, you got me. i’m a leibniz man."
12571,Leonard,"okay, now, do you really need the honorary justice league of america membership card?"
18847,Leonard,calling 911.
17767,Leonard,sheldon?
13725,Leonard,"very comforting. okay, so what do i say to her?"
12233,Leonard,yeah.
13131,Leonard,"okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. it just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. "
12496,Leonard,how much have you had to drink tonight?
20305,Leonard,why would i lie?
15674,Leonard,"oh, god, what’s that smell? . oh-ho-hoo!"
14997,Leonard,"penny, i told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
15710,Leonard,that was two hours ago.
20851,Leonard,are you crazy? you can’t put that on snapchat.
21670,Leonard,"i’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
14744,Leonard,"oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of time bandits."
13055,Leonard,because she’s your sister. 
12017,Leonard,see you.
14541,Leonard,"sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny."
17760,Leonard,"oh, mummies and zombies again."
21428,Leonard,"i mean, i’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable."
16528,Leonard,"there are a couple of things i did with penny that might be a little silly, but…"
21418,Leonard,"oh, sure. wait, nancy?"
14442,Leonard,"oh, thank god we’re home."
18805,Leonard,that one? damn right i like that one.
15261,Leonard,wesley crusher was wil wheaton’s character on star trek.
17995,Leonard,"oh, i’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner."
12048,Leonard,"i have a board. if you like boards, this is my board."
20003,Leonard,i love you.
19898,Leonard,thank you.
17468,Leonard,"sheldon, what channel is nasa tv?"
19194,Leonard,it’s not that bad.
16956,Leonard,"it’s probably for the best. for a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
14379,Leonard,you went to president seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
17230,Leonard,"listen, sheldon, this is stupid. i don’t see why we can’t be friends. and i’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. i just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
13763,Leonard,since when?
15218,Leonard,it wasn’t my fault. i had never seen my brother’s project. and my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
14697,Leonard,"none, why?"
19990,Leonard,hey.
16366,Leonard,that’s a relief.
21454,Leonard,you did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
13377,Leonard,yes.
14467,Leonard,"okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
18673,Leonard,because i’m afraid to know the answer.
19747,Leonard,wasn’t even that hard to find.
20387,Leonard,"remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers."
17048,Leonard,"okay, jimmy, it’s time for you to go."
17735,Leonard,yeah. he’s ganged up.
17721,Leonard,"if you’re wondering why i’ve been staring through the peephole, i’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to penny’s."
20737,Leonard,very funny.
19002,Leonard,"yeah, but it’s not always that bad."
18484,Leonard,"i mean it, i’m going to."
14315,Leonard,i’m listening.
19066,Leonard,i’m gonna see where he is.
18713,Leonard,"for some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with sheldon forever."
17297,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. just sit down and let him do it."
16043,Leonard,i checked the app store. no one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
15497,Leonard,"come on. we’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
15737,Leonard,you changed the address on the building? what about mail?
14470,Leonard,"trust me, you’ll be fine. see ya."
21102,Leonard,"fine, take the plant."
21356,Leonard,"i even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
21510,Leonard,"no, i told her she was being not smart. which was dumb."
12560,Leonard,"no, i’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
15943,Leonard,"come here, you."
12434,Leonard,"but thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
17404,Leonard,are you drinking whisky?
18717,Leonard,"oh, i’ve got butterflies."
12108,Leonard,"what did i just…. uh, we’re here to pick up penny’s tv."
20725,Leonard,thanks.
14355,Leonard,"‘cause he’s upset over his situation with penny and if i have to hear about it again, i’m going to kick him in his ovaries."
20080,Leonard,i don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. why would i want to be with someone like me?
13474,Leonard,i know. when is she going home?
20816,Leonard,my father’s not texting me back.
16424,Leonard,i can’t say.
14691,Leonard,"well, i wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
16545,Leonard,sea bass. i’ll have the sea bass.
17123,Leonard,"yeah, hi, hi. how’s it going?"
16136,Leonard,"i don’t know, i kind of promised howard."
15887,Leonard,exactly. they say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
16799,Leonard,"oh, right, your name. that makes more sense than penis."
17955,Leonard,i don’t care. i don’t have to do anything you say because i don’t think i want to live here anymore.
20497,Leonard,yeah. why?
16578,Leonard,i live here.
12439,Leonard,"okay, how about this, nobody gets to be the flash, we all change, agreed?"
14081,Leonard,"sheldon, penny was our only hope."
20648,Leonard,i thought you were back with emily.
16807,Leonard,check it out. jim lee drew this of me two years ago at comic con.
15572,Leonard,refresh my memory. why didn’t i just put you in the trunk?
17391,Leonard,"horse, but mostly just for the height. a little bit for the genital girth."
16317,Leonard,no.
21528,Leonard,"hmm. i don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. now, before we field test, i think we…"
16449,Leonard,what kind of emergency?
19880,Leonard,i don’t think this is gonna work.
12023,Leonard,significant improvement over the old neighbour.
20282,Leonard,my birthday.
14330,Leonard,"no! there, it went to voice mail."
12858,Leonard,"hang on, are we talking about murdering dennis kim? i’m not saying no. "
18341,Leonard,"oh, come on. not that book. it, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
19006,Leonard,and i got itchy and swollen just watching you.
13021,Leonard,"on the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the earth ending life as we know it. "
14206,Leonard,what’s wrong?
12588,Leonard,"oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
15407,Leonard,"so you agree, he’s nuts."
16177,Leonard,"i was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
15204,Leonard,"sit down, we want to talk to you."
18352,Leonard,"i do, too, but there’s not."
17640,Leonard,"sorry, officer."
12368,Leonard,"yeah, sure, why not."
19398,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m sorry i didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
14056,Leonard,"i don’t know what you’re talking about. oh, that. penny did that."
12666,Leonard,you cannot possibly be that arrogant.
20196,Leonard,"uh, i’m leonard. this is my friend…"
19068,Leonard,"not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, i get worried."
12181,Leonard,you think?
20236,Leonard,"my brother was mean to me, too."
18535,Leonard,"wait, you invited him here?"
20914,Leonard,buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
13730,Leonard,terrific.
17820,Leonard,"honestly, because i had enough crappy christmases as a kid and i’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now."
19855,Leonard,"i’m just saying, sometimes raj and i feel pushed aside."
12816,Leonard,i know. 
20532,Leonard,"again, no offence, but so have i."
16100,Leonard,although yours was an eye-opener.
19382,Leonard,"buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?"
21443,Leonard,"oh, i would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
18035,Leonard,lobsters overnight?
19811,Leonard,"yeah, i’m good."
14090,Leonard,"well, we had a vote. three of us voted for airplane, sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
14602,Leonard,i don’t know. what do you want me to do?
20194,Leonard,that must be him.
21663,Leonard,"i can’t believe you think he only wears it on halloween. open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching."
16625,Leonard,"hey, honey."
17036,Leonard,no.
20102,Leonard,and there’s your damsel.
20762,Leonard,"waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."
21752,Leonard,okay.
12541,Leonard,sheldon you just can’t dictate…
19162,Leonard,how ridiculous is he?
12963,Leonard,i just assumed. who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
15422,Leonard,"it was, but one night, sheldon came home from work… "
13621,Leonard,"what, sheldon? what, sheldon? what, sheldon?"
16823,Leonard,"okay, uh, here it is. is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
14815,Leonard,you’re not helping.
19191,Leonard,"why? because they won’t get off your lawn? is stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
20267,Leonard,by stalking them?
13329,Leonard,hi tom. sheldon? didn’t i explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
13142,Leonard,can we please change the subject.
13735,Leonard,sold. “i think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” there. it’s done.
14719,Leonard,"oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. yippee."
20954,Leonard,"i prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but i still need to get all my pants hemmed."
13094,Leonard,"well if i had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? "
19535,Leonard,what is going on?
18635,Leonard,"honey, you only had, like, three lines. that wasn’t gonna happen anyway."
17620,Leonard,that is a pencil sharpener.
20144,Leonard,preach.
15912,Leonard,what is that?
13116,Leonard,"okay, feel better, bye.  she doesn’t want to talk. "
20018,Leonard,"yeah. okay, listen. if you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. we, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. the boat was moving a lot, so i chipped her tooth."
14079,Leonard,"okay. now, we all run out. sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees. raj, howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. then we’ll all have a great view as penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
20909,Leonard,"right. sorry, sir."
18449,Leonard,sheldon.
15172,Leonard,how am i looking now?
13087,Leonard,oh. pass. 
12115,Leonard,oh. we’re scientists.
18471,Leonard,sure.
18512,Leonard,"aaaah! i, you, how can, what!"
18587,Leonard,no.
14743,Leonard,"no, there isn’t! they’re synonyms!"
15416,Leonard,"okay, how about this? let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over. "
12080,Leonard,"what makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, i’m a male and she’s a female?"
18546,Leonard,"i’m sorry, too."
13749,Leonard,"come on, it’s just a video game. and we suck at it."
21534,Leonard,"third floor, wrong apartment."
17344,Leonard,you pick up a y chromosome while you were there? you might be short one.
16273,Leonard,"mm-hmm. great. hey, can i ask you something?"
12355,Leonard,really? that’s impressive.
19113,Leonard,"i’m sorry, so you never went outside?"
21242,Leonard,why?
12649,Leonard,what… . 
16228,Leonard,"oh, wow. i love taming of the shrew. i did a paper on it in high school. who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? in his tail."
17500,Leonard,"i got all your favourites. beer, wings, sliders. we can watch the football game. i even painted my stomach."
19830,Leonard,i don’t know. should we call sheldon and howard?
18223,Leonard,"so, listen, do you remember when i said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
21406,Leonard,"oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. it’s like being possessed, but instead of satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing."
12276,Leonard,"i mean, i’m a perfectly nice guy. there’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? i love pottery!” you know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, i lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then i realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! oh god! oh, my god!"
12514,Leonard,i guess for you that’s an option.
17235,Leonard,"so, do i get breakfast in bed on leonard’s day?"
14060,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sake, sheldon."
19668,Leonard,you’re making fun of me. forget it.
19672,Leonard,"maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
20584,Leonard,"oh. sorry, we can’t."
15307,Leonard,fine. why did you have dinner with penny?
20540,Leonard,"happy birthday, buddy."
17317,Leonard,stop! stop it! stop! stop! stop it!
16264,Leonard,bam. right in the nose. made me proud to own a pc.
20332,Leonard,there goes our shot at him living on the roof.
17504,Leonard,"so, where exactly are we in this relationship?"
13343,Leonard,"really, do tell."
20389,Leonard,and it’s gone.
19367,Leonard,there’s no music.
17409,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
19076,Leonard,"okay, i know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. come on, let’s get you home."
15942,Leonard,"uh, i do, i have to work. but i’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend i am."
12271,Leonard,is it too much?
18950,Leonard,"uh, well, it’s not may the fifth, and it’s not may the third. it’s may the fourth."
17324,Leonard,"i’m sorry, duh, what?"
13043,Leonard,"bye missy, see you."
17798,Leonard,"okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game."
17644,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t think this actually means…"
17887,Leonard,it is on.
12211,Leonard,"don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
21244,Leonard,you’re not being very nice.
17934,Leonard,128
18624,Leonard,no. do you?
12837,Leonard,"come on, dennis, i’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment."
17621,Leonard,it’s actually pretty neat.
16848,Leonard,"you’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
18526,Leonard,i’m hoping you can get an annulment. it’s just like it never happened.
17967,Leonard,wow. it sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
19228,Leonard,"you know, let’s just come up with something new."
21698,Leonard,"come on, we’re going to the hospital."
16436,Leonard,will amy be joining us for dinner?
18128,Leonard,i know. i was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
20709,Leonard,"okay, help me out. how are you doing this? do they know about each other?"
16446,Leonard,"i can’t hear you, i’m in the shower."
16476,Leonard,that is good news. bye.
15302,Leonard,tell me why you woke me up or i swear to god i will kill you.
18472,Leonard,"oh, uh, we played, once. i broke a window."
15182,Leonard,fine. but can’t we go home and start this?
14952,Leonard,great.
19515,Leonard,"yeah, i’m proud of him, too."
17931,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, i know this. uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?"
16488,Leonard,"uh, sure. very… prominent."
16496,Leonard,"well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
15824,Leonard,"oh, god."
15784,Leonard,huh! sorry!
14105,Leonard,"excuse me, but what about me? why don’t i get a shot?"
17471,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, it’ll be fun."
14704,Leonard,"i don’t want to fly kites, sheldon. we’re watching football here."
21440,Leonard,"hey, olsen twins…"
19400,Leonard,you were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. you love me.
12237,Leonard,lesley i would like to propose an experiment.
20493,Leonard,"uh, these are strong, you should slow down."
17438,Leonard,what about  cookies!
19590,Leonard,what did you write?
13408,Leonard,"sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
14601,Leonard,good.
16398,Leonard,you don’t say?
16441,Leonard,pass the soy sauce.
16504,Leonard,hang on. when is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
12882,Leonard,"you’re kidding, why not?"
12695,Leonard,so?
15749,Leonard,"yep, it is."
21314,Leonard,just look at the board.
20531,Leonard,"no offence, but i’ve known the guy a really long time."
18481,Leonard,"okay, okay. i’m gonna show you what’s in the box. but just promise not to flip out."
16525,Leonard,what are you talking about?
19632,Leonard,that doesn’t sound right. my research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
17769,Leonard,"howard, what are you doing?"
14425,Leonard,"so, i can’t go."
13386,Leonard,and mythological.
12752,Leonard,"as you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy."
17862,Leonard,i’m sorry. i just never think of you having feelings like that.
18983,Leonard,hmm.
21174,Leonard,"oh, yeah? and you thought spock ears were only good for comic-con."
12870,Leonard,i think that’s our girl. one of us should go talk to her. 
16883,Leonard,really? amy?
13993,Leonard,"there’s no hurry, mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
13672,Leonard,"she doesn’t like you. um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and i have to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on, so…"
20095,Leonard,india.
20175,Leonard,"hey, barry, we’re in trouble. we need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
14189,Leonard,"that is so great. oh, i’m leonard, i live downstairs. upstairs from here, but under you. not under you per se, but under your apartment."
21207,Leonard,what’s that supposed to mean?
13357,Leonard,not yet.
13851,Leonard,i suppose. i do miss whistling though.
14676,Leonard,oh.
14172,Leonard,one-day rush. i really need to take that off the web site.
13072,Leonard,"oh. you have other plans, or…?"
12994,Leonard,"come on, guys, push. "
12630,Leonard,"they don’t, that’s why i saved this one. "
20988,Leonard,that’ll be four seventy-five.
19946,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not a whiner."
19660,Leonard,"well, congratulations. who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?"
12603,Leonard,"take it, raj. it’s more than i’ve ever gotten. "
15794,Leonard,air freshener.
15694,Leonard,"you realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t."
13122,Leonard,"i’m her friend, i’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
17929,Leonard,"so, cocoa?"
14234,Leonard,apparently so.
14867,Leonard,"no, he doesn’t."
12613,Leonard,"wireless webcams, wave hello. "
14103,Leonard,at least he’s off the train crap.
20742,Leonard,ugh. too much wine.
17217,Leonard,what happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
16952,Leonard,really?
14272,Leonard,"okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. do you want to go to the comic book store? maybe go see a movie?"
12921,Leonard,"there’s not? gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. "
16219,Leonard,why didn’t you call?
16602,Leonard,"hang on, sheldon. how could you not tell me your sister was moving back to india?"
15730,Leonard,"no, i just, i want what you have. you know, i want a woman in my life."
21422,Leonard,i’d still like to know who jerry is.
18446,Leonard,he thinks there’s a difference.
13289,Leonard,don’t make this hard for me.
12193,Leonard,you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  what’s funny?
19667,Leonard,"no, no. we cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."
15803,Leonard,"making pretty good time, huh?"
15590,Leonard,all right. i like a good brainteaser. give it a whirl.
21053,Leonard,how’s that broccoli?
21597,Leonard,"we all make mistakes, let’s move on."
19900,Leonard,"hey, look who’s here."
15682,Leonard,got it.
18356,Leonard,mm-hmm. and?
13646,Leonard,sure. .
20129,Leonard,"i know. and it’s not like we’re abandoning him. plus, we can facetime him whenever we want, you know, once iphones are invented in his universe."
14053,Leonard,"no, no, friends forgive the little things."
12171,Leonard,"are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
19822,Leonard,my mommy raised a gentleman.
14639,Leonard,i had to ask. you didn’t have to say yes.
19892,Leonard,"no, we’re kind of taking it slow."
20438,Leonard,"he never disappoints, does he?"
17014,Leonard,what’s the idea?
14869,Leonard,tomorrow.
18165,Leonard,he was the host of this great… hey!
21120,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m warning you, i can play this game, too."
19104,Leonard,"oh, right."
18465,Leonard,"look, i know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. it’s just how he is. but he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
16418,Leonard,hey!
13562,Leonard,"yeah. listen, i have to kinda sneak out for a while."
14564,Leonard,you’re not squirting her in the face with water.
13719,Leonard,"and then the, the subject got changed somehow."
12979,Leonard,that doesn’t sound too bad.
17185,Leonard,i play a lot of grand theft auto. i think i know how to handle a gat.
17477,Leonard,that’s so cool.
17803,Leonard,"yeah, sorry. uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. what do you do? and, howard, do not say, i feel up the large chest."
18289,Leonard,you know what? you’re a crazy person.
15588,Leonard,of course you must.
21638,Leonard,hey.
15769,Leonard,you’ve really got to get out more.
15774,Leonard,"give me a minute. sheldon,"
16767,Leonard,what’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
21576,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on."
19156,Leonard,so do we. and i’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
13337,Leonard,"penny, you don’t have to do that."
17842,Leonard,i’m androgynous?
19433,Leonard,"you know the best part of working in the clean room? no allergies. check it out. oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen."
13455,Leonard,the one with the little onions? mmm.
19128,Leonard,hey. we just wanted to see how your class was going. where is everybody?
15098,Leonard,"sheldon, i need to talk to you."
21250,Leonard,"well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
13932,Leonard,i could use some help.
18078,Leonard,"hey, where have you been?"
19856,Leonard,wait a minute. sheldon spent a whole day with james earl jones and never told any of us.
17568,Leonard,"oh, that happens to be dr. koothrappali’s field of expertise. you two have a lot to talk about."
17475,Leonard,"what, i can’t propose? i can’t talk to my friends? is there anything else i’m not allowed to do?"
13468,Leonard,sheldon?  what are you doing?!
14835,Leonard,"yes, i am. you want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
20923,Leonard,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this. 
21679,Leonard,"excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. north sea, how can i kelp you?"
16056,Leonard,what?
19306,Leonard,i think so.
21372,Leonard,why would i be upset?
20860,Leonard,i’m getting enraged.
15958,Leonard,"i have a list. fyi, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
12205,Leonard,and control it how?
13423,Leonard,"so wait,you’re just gonna give up?"
19596,Leonard,you really didn’t like our paper?
19250,Leonard,"look. we keep procrastinating. we saw back to the future ii, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like denmark."
17725,Leonard,"well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. i’m, i’m way above average in a lot of other things."
20607,Leonard,"uh, hufflepuff, from harry potter."
18651,Leonard,"there’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
12983,Leonard,because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
12670,Leonard,"i’ve had enough of your condescension. maybe i didn’t go to college when i was eleven like you, maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. no offense. and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
20721,Leonard,"oh, so i shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?"
12533,Leonard,what are you doing? 
15882,Leonard,hey.
20043,Leonard,"oh, we didn’t screw around. we just got drunk and made out."
12085,Leonard,this is not a good time.
17068,Leonard,"there you go, howard. sounds like raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
20568,Leonard,this is cool. when was the last time you and i built something together?
20106,Leonard,i don’t think the lever’s working.
19392,Leonard,"if there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?"
12750,Leonard,"well, that’s leo. hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?"
16299,Leonard,"yeah, me, too."
14055,Leonard,what do you mean?
12797,Leonard,"uh, yeah, i’d be… i’d be happy to penny.  i feel really guilty. "
12219,Leonard,"you betrayed us for money, who are you?"
15509,Leonard,"i’d suggest a lubricant, but i have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
12331,Leonard,"you know, i’m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back."
19895,Leonard,"i change my answer. it, it’s amazing. it’s hot. we can barely keep our hands off each other."
20197,Leonard,"uh, yeah, uh, right here."
12651,Leonard,sheldon i didn’t mean it like that.
17412,Leonard,sheldon…
14793,Leonard,i feel like we’re forgetting something important.
12978,Leonard,are you okay?
17625,Leonard,"uh-huh. well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  so it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe."
12592,Leonard,it’s amazing.
15853,Leonard,"my problem is, i don’t project confidence. so i decided that the next time i meet a woman i think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, i’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
17285,Leonard,what are you doing?
13311,Leonard,why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
12280,Leonard,okay.
19259,Leonard,"well, i was just saying that there was this video game…"
12162,Leonard,"oh, hey penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
13146,Leonard,what happened?
19576,Leonard,"let me see, let me see. one calls it insightful and innovative. we’re insightful and innovative."
18443,Leonard,"oh, gas-x has a new ultra strength. i guess they really do read their mail."
12088,Leonard,"no. and she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
18116,Leonard,yeah.
13574,Leonard,so how was work today?
17178,Leonard,"they kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? all right. look, just remember how this works. we don’t get mad about these things. uh, speaking of which, i’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. got a really fun evening for you. it’s kind of a surprise."
19108,Leonard,"yeah, time’s gonna fly by."
17286,Leonard,why is there a hole here?
17337,Leonard,"oh. i guess i was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
13222,Leonard,you promised penny what? 
15186,Leonard,"oh, crap!"
21213,Leonard,"fine, go ahead."
14801,Leonard,"you know, when sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
12777,Leonard,yes.
15614,Leonard,i did.
15389,Leonard,"sure. black, right?"
13929,Leonard,– come on. it’ll be fun.
18442,Leonard,that’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
18867,Leonard,"all right, i’ll see you guys in 20 years."
21222,Leonard,unsweetened almond…
17368,Leonard,"you know, you’re right. i mean, it’s from you, i’m never going to sell it. i’m opening it."
17720,Leonard,that’d be great. thank you.
12248,Leonard,"ah. well, thank you for your time."
20209,Leonard,and tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
20527,Leonard,oh. you had a party for your 60th?
17832,Leonard,ooh. that’s his take on john wheeler’s quantum foam. that should be great.
14531,Leonard,is that what you want?
19479,Leonard,"hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
12511,Leonard,"penny, you are on fire."
16272,Leonard,morning.
21500,Leonard,"ha, i knew you weren’t asleep."
15976,Leonard,hey.
20491,Leonard,there’s no reason you can’t.
17867,Leonard,"message received. ah, excuse me.  hello. this is dr. hofstadter. okay. all right, thank you. that’s weird. i’m getting called in to human resources."
21512,Leonard,so you think it’s fine if she works for zack?
17692,Leonard,"buddy, i think amy might be upset."
16971,Leonard,a tribe of abra-comanches.
15967,Leonard,what?
14513,Leonard,okay-dokay.
12801,Leonard,you want me to get eye surgery? 
15604,Leonard,"listen, can i talk to you about your girlfriend?"
14848,Leonard,you do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
17301,Leonard,"so, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?"
14078,Leonard,penny is an amazing shot. i think we have a real chance to win this week.
13943,Leonard,"hi, kurt."
13204,Leonard,what’s wrong with your face? 
13980,Leonard,maybe something less personal.
15945,Leonard,a lot of people are doing that.
14855,Leonard,"or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
16248,Leonard,just sit here.
20361,Leonard,how was your day?
15938,Leonard,"yeah, no, i don’t think so."
17575,Leonard,"no, raj had to go to the nurse."
12539,Leonard,"penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
20441,Leonard,you don’t sound very excited about it.
18319,Leonard,penny’s not answering my texts.
17623,Leonard,"very good. and then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. "
14693,Leonard,"good-bye, sheldon."
12806,Leonard,"well i can’t do it, i can’t see anything. "
14312,Leonard,"yeah, or you call me."
18932,Leonard,"raj and howard are at howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?"
18913,Leonard,one of the people that lives in his head.
20419,Leonard,"mm-hmm. well, i would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…"
18886,Leonard,ps4.
17624,Leonard,"you know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."
16610,Leonard,you’re leaving?
19610,Leonard,that would be great.
16846,Leonard,"no, no, no. i, i can’t do this. believe me, i really want to."
17270,Leonard,yeah.
12480,Leonard,"no, penny, it’s okay, i can handle this. i’m not a dwarf, i’m a hobbit. a hobbit. are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
21042,Leonard,i really do.
15640,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. it was mutual!
16281,Leonard,"hey, guys, what do you think? priya took me clothes shopping."
14924,Leonard,great. how come?
18028,Leonard,sorry. maybe next year. i’m just kidding. romance ninja. let’s have sex. waugh!
18372,Leonard,who just had sex with me at work.
14449,Leonard,it was the only way to make him happy.
16707,Leonard,"you left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
16140,Leonard,i’m still not adjusted to how the syfy channel spells their name now. s-y-f-y. that’s siffy.
19621,Leonard,"wait, sheldon gave me a banana in a box. he was testing me, too."
16221,Leonard,the word is forbade.
20514,Leonard,one day. right.
20660,Leonard,thank you.
15041,Leonard,double guacamole?
12030,Leonard,"hi. well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
19448,Leonard,"fine, put the slim jim in the garbage bag."
20523,Leonard,are you crazy? how can you put michael keaton in front of christian bale?
12697,Leonard,that’s very true. 
16806,Leonard,"hang on.  you might be from texas, but i’m from new jersey."
14669,Leonard,"sure, sure, just i don’t know much about football."
21231,Leonard,i came here to apologize.
20187,Leonard,then i’m going to tell him we’re in.
15457,Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. that’s the moon! we hit the moon!
16261,Leonard,this is delicious. where’d you learn to make chili?
21333,Leonard,do you know how much your car costs?
12070,Leonard,"no, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. and paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. now if you look at huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. well, i didn’t make it worse."
12452,Leonard,"she’s not catwoman, she’s just a generic cat."
15327,Leonard,"it’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
19508,Leonard,everything’s fine. we just started talking about living arrangements.
20374,Leonard,"do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?"
15541,Leonard,"it’s okay, you can owe me."
13003,Leonard,just… personal reasons. 
20473,Leonard,midnight. really? you know what? let’s do it.
20311,Leonard,i’m glad you had a nice time with amy.
17608,Leonard,snort it down and keep eating!
19028,Leonard,"okay. well, now that everyone’s here, penny and i have some big news. we’re engaged."
12131,Leonard,"ask him for a napkin, i dare you.  i’ll get it."
15915,Leonard,yeah.
12493,Leonard,"nothing, you’re perfect."
13274,Leonard,"i know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy i would be more than happy to get out of your way."
20336,Leonard,aw.
12459,Leonard,"no, you’re coming with me."
14978,Leonard,4am.
18131,Leonard,"well, well, well, sheldon, fancy meeting you here. i guess the train store in glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. and you, you said you weren’t coming here, either."
15279,Leonard,"do you want the last dumpling, sheldon?"
21075,Leonard,"you just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…"
19450,Leonard,oh. genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a slim jim.
14295,Leonard,"okay, great. um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
18797,Leonard,huh?
15842,Leonard,was it out of respect that you didn’t tell raj about the time you dropped his iphone in a urinal?
15811,Leonard,"alright, and raj."
21725,Leonard,"uh, radon?"
15255,Leonard,i am not pushing anything.
14930,Leonard,"no, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
18718,Leonard,hey. we’re about to buy tickets for comic-con.
13567,Leonard,what?
19646,Leonard,i’m putting the city names in the grid now. i’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
19894,Leonard,"yes, mother."
14146,Leonard,what if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-rtv to provide a better mounting surface?
15160,Leonard,"he’s not saying it’s a magic ring. you’re not, are you?"
20850,Leonard,"you do that, too?"
20151,Leonard,"again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. just checked your prostate."
19409,Leonard,"well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? what if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?"
14850,Leonard,and what would that be?
12302,Leonard,physics. .
15956,Leonard,"well, then, what do you want?"
15685,Leonard,"oh, right. that."
14244,Leonard,take me to a bar with women.
21451,Leonard,seven.
13057,Leonard,uh-huh. 
19540,Leonard,here we are.
17151,Leonard,"i don’t know, he was pretty badass on heroes."
19967,Leonard,"well, like i said, we’re about to get married, and i, i want a clean slate. no secrets."
12908,Leonard,because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
14314,Leonard,"you know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, raj."
19833,Leonard,that would be more helpful if e.t. were real.
12479,Leonard,"no, i said animalistic. of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. "
13012,Leonard,"sheldon, get out of my way."
15818,Leonard,like what?
20597,Leonard,"listen, we did a stupid thing."
19350,Leonard,was that a flask?
14574,Leonard,hey.
19722,Leonard,"lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me."
13648,Leonard,"what? no. no, that’s not right."
17690,Leonard,then amy got mad and left?
14914,Leonard,"mother, remember when i was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
19699,Leonard,what are we doing?
20248,Leonard,yeah.
12657,Leonard,you’re kidding. 
18957,Leonard,"anyway, the, the funeral’s on sunday."
20880,Leonard,"it’s been three and a half minutes, wake up."
16394,Leonard,shooting at a target?
20055,Leonard,how many times do i have to tell you? i have no interest in this woman.
17913,Leonard,"fine, but set them to stun. if we vaporize penny, i’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again."
19117,Leonard,just tell her.
21349,Leonard,see? miserable.
14965,Leonard,what are we supposed to do now?
16582,Leonard,what are you grinding about?
17891,Leonard,really?
16686,Leonard,"well, hey, i’m just as much fun as you are."
13407,Leonard,"so we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
15768,Leonard,that’s pretty cool.
16598,Leonard,"well, uh, okay, um, i don’t want to get back together with penny. we tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but i can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend raj. and then i find out that raj’s sister priya, who i’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to india. so i’m just completely confused and alone."
18061,Leonard,and now you’re also an astronaut.
16205,Leonard,"uh, i’m gonna go lie down."
20399,Leonard,no.
18045,Leonard,she really is.
12555,Leonard,"right, anyway, uh, with wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. sheldon?"
18498,Leonard,"well, sheldon, it took me all morning, but i found the owner of the video store. and i am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. anyway, there is no one to return the dvd to, so this issue is resolved. ah! and i’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, i didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
19877,Leonard,what are you talking about?
12832,Leonard,"so, dennis, how long have you been in america."
16964,Leonard,you know what? never mind. i’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
20738,Leonard,"well, not really."
12376,Leonard,"well, what do you think."
12914,Leonard,"guys, let’s remember that sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
18066,Leonard,"hey, how was your… what?"
13708,Leonard,"sure, when is scary not good? but, okay, um, i have feelings, right?"
18482,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago, and i know we rented it on your card. but it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. so in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
21064,Leonard,how much money did he win?
18734,Leonard,good luck.
16674,Leonard,aw.
20036,Leonard,what are we gonna do?
16661,Leonard,aren’t you going with sheldon?
21618,Leonard,what?
14154,Leonard,not you. i wasn’t asking you. penny?
17845,Leonard,"uh, i guess i am."
21230,Leonard,hey.
18031,Leonard,whoa.
12864,Leonard,"okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. "
15142,Leonard,"yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
18691,Leonard,and i support you.
18634,Leonard,you still got the part. that’s a huge accomplishment.
16259,Leonard,"good-bye, sheldon."
12187,Leonard,"god, this is going to be bad."
16172,Leonard,"um, i’m not sure."
13892,Leonard,"he’s not lying, he does find that fascinating."
12423,Leonard,well what did she mean by that? was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? 
17670,Leonard,i quit.
15326,Leonard,wish i knew. he’s fine with pluto.
14823,Leonard,who is that with him?
19188,Leonard,"nice to finally meet you, too."
18355,Leonard,so you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
17921,Leonard,maybe it’s a shipping problem.
17705,Leonard,"well, i spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection."
15978,Leonard,"it is. you just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person i see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
19732,Leonard,we haven’t been on a road trip in a while. this is fun.
15496,Leonard,"i was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
13971,Leonard,yes.
19824,Leonard,"i get it. uh, just this morning, sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my grape-nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict."
17414,Leonard,right. to howard.
17064,Leonard,sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
17399,Leonard,"hey, i am a young man in his sexual prime. under the right conditions, i-i-i am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
14655,Leonard,"so, penny doesn’t want me around her friends, i embarrass her. what else could it be?"
21337,Leonard,yeah.
12775,Leonard,"you had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? "
19457,Leonard,"relax, it wasn’t your fault."
17109,Leonard,i don’t understand.
19744,Leonard,i don’t think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
16305,Leonard,so what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
13899,Leonard,"it’s, whatever. ten, eleven dollars."
16949,Leonard,"i know, i, i, i crossed a line. and i’m sorry. no, no, no, hang on. i really mean it. and it’s not like when we were going out, i’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. this is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table i’m sorry."
21016,Leonard,why would you tell him that? that’s terrible advice.
13196,Leonard,"i’m not there because i’m taking things slow. which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. and take down that camera. "
14130,Leonard,"delightful. listen, i don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldon’s mouth."
18496,Leonard,it’s called proving a point.
13839,Leonard,"ah, no kidding! a fu man chu? a handlebar pencil?"
15552,Leonard,"here’s my chicken curry. howard, your shrimp biryani."
12004,Leonard,"he’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest. "
20322,Leonard,how does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
18473,Leonard,that one over there.
19360,Leonard,what makes you think i didn’t go to my prom? i went.
19465,Leonard,"no, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
20165,Leonard,i know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
12259,Leonard,"or dinner. i was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
14780,Leonard,what’s so funny?
17244,Leonard,told ya.
15540,Leonard,how can you walk around with no money?
15217,Leonard,terrible. i worked really hard on that project. i stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
21501,Leonard,"i have sheldon, that keeps most people away."
12116,Leonard,what?
13410,Leonard,"because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
16246,Leonard,"oh, sounds great."
18762,Leonard,"oh, crap. what are we gonna do?"
12106,Leonard,"no, sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. there’s two of us and one of him."
14962,Leonard,what about me?
12467,Leonard,"if he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him."
20485,Leonard,would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
17276,Leonard,balls in the basket. 
12168,Leonard,sheldon?
14453,Leonard,"yeah, i feel terrible."
17492,Leonard,i know what the anthropic principle is.
12413,Leonard,oh. okay. thank you.
14407,Leonard,"okay, i can’t do this."
21480,Leonard,is that bert?
14362,Leonard,"during the kissing? what did you do, sneeze in her mouth? i did that to a girl once."
13047,Leonard,"hell, no! "
17425,Leonard,"i’m sorry, howard, but i got to tell you, i’m a little relieved you’re not going."
15977,Leonard,you get to play with raj’s big telescope last night?
15002,Leonard,"no, i think it’s a firmware problem."
19523,Leonard,"hey, we’re home. any progress?"
16198,Leonard,do you mean?
14148,Leonard,where?
17755,Leonard,they are not.
17863,Leonard,why? nothing is ever going to happen between me and alex.
20792,Leonard,"oh, we have to use the stairs."
20606,Leonard,i bought a baseball cap.
18739,Leonard,"well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
15798,Leonard,"uh, cream."
15660,Leonard,"okay. well, how about this? kidnap bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
15713,Leonard,right.
21290,Leonard,"you can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
17925,Leonard,"they could show bloopers. oh, no."
14521,Leonard,"i’m okay. just a little mouthwash, and then i’m gonna rock your world. "
13537,Leonard,it’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
18024,Leonard,"yes. it’s all on you. but i got to tell you, when the time comes, i want the whole nine yards. i want you down on one knee, flowers, i want to be swept off my feet."
17689,Leonard,hold on. wil and amy had an argument?
21071,Leonard,it’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
20088,Leonard,"sure. hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?"
20736,Leonard,how?
17147,Leonard,isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
17085,Leonard,see you later.
20935,Leonard,"oh, don’t worry. once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
18671,Leonard,that’s a good question.
12868,Leonard,"okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with dennis. "
21145,Leonard,"i found it, but it’s empty."
12582,Leonard,so don’t call her.
13866,Leonard,"sheldon, what are you doing?"
16672,Leonard,not really. is that my yearbook?
14515,Leonard,"actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
12669,Leonard,i didn’t screw it up.
13015,Leonard,"still, i think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life. "
13987,Leonard,why are you doing this?
13976,Leonard,"here’s your tea, mother. so, what are you guys talking about?"
18716,Leonard,"my point is, just because i couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. and i’m proud of you. "
16106,Leonard,"so, how do you wanna do this?"
13492,Leonard,"sheldon, the food’s here."
15101,Leonard,she told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
19402,Leonard,"that’s funny. boy, i’m gonna miss these painkillers."
12375,Leonard,how so?
21317,Leonard,"and instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
17476,Leonard,will you shut up?
20802,Leonard,"all right, you two, don’t start. penny and i are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. can you please not ruin it?"
16539,Leonard,it doesn’t matter. i’m the king of foreplay.
14194,Leonard,"hey, penny. this is alicia, our new neighbour."
12576,Leonard,"actually, i read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in india. "
16503,Leonard,i think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
13944,Leonard,"i don’t really go by lenny, but that’s okay. um, you remember sheldon, howard and raj."
21514,Leonard,thank you.
12398,Leonard,sheldon!
20628,Leonard,that’s right.
17447,Leonard,"sheldon, knight takes bishop. you all right?"
19141,Leonard,yes.  
17707,Leonard,who you talking to?
17008,Leonard,"oh, hi."
20415,Leonard,"well, i hope it’s as much fun as the sheldon cooper spell-checks local menus tour."
17635,Leonard,a grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. now watch this.
14269,Leonard,we were up to you.
14957,Leonard,you know what? let’s just get a pizza.
12878,Leonard,"yeah, we really ruined his life. "
17318,Leonard,"oh, hi, penny, guess what? sheldon got bongos."
13811,Leonard,"hey, you got a minute?"
21563,Leonard,like what?
17284,Leonard,"congratulations, sheldon. you win office."
13174,Leonard,good.  
16750,Leonard,you want to drive?
17576,Leonard,"mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. she had to bring him a grover puppet so he could point at what hurt."
14229,Leonard,"ah, yeah, that’s captain sweatpants. he doesn’t really help the point i’m trying to make."
16520,Leonard,"right, fine. i’ll tell howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his."
18284,Leonard,fine. what i did was wrong.
19344,Leonard,"hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you."
20611,Leonard,i was afraid he was gonna eat me.
20359,Leonard,"oh, if anything, i’m trying to get my sheld-off."
18314,Leonard,"relax, it’s a hard puzzle. it’s gonna take a while to solve."
16588,Leonard,what the hell is wrong with you?
20061,Leonard,what?
16658,Leonard,"no, you listen. you’re my woman, and i’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
16968,Leonard,i want to return this wild west and witches ka’a expansion pack.
18389,Leonard,"please, oh, please, just let me be there."
17599,Leonard,uh-uh.
20621,Leonard,"to be fair, good at both."
17926,Leonard,"that is sheldon’s “i’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. come on, let’s just go to your place."
20503,Leonard,i’d enjoy that.
20185,Leonard,he handed you the box directly and called you stretch.
16816,Leonard,no. lactose. gas.
19335,Leonard,better than okay. i am having the game of my life.
20887,Leonard,"oh, it’s complicated. he finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"
14853,Leonard,"okay, good, ’cause i wasn’t really gonna go."
14446,Leonard,"me, neither. except for one night when the heat went out. long story, it’s… don’t ask."
19484,Leonard,that’s what i was doing.
16059,Leonard,are you done?
21760,Leonard,"oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. howard and raj helped me bring it up."
12713,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’m not seeing the help."
19047,Leonard,"actually, this is about where she and i are going to live."
13409,Leonard,"penny’s taking you to the dmv, i’m going to bed."
20339,Leonard,"no, it’s steel magnolias 2: even steelier."
21056,Leonard,"i’m married, i don’t have to be attractive."
16349,Leonard,"thank you, officer."
13249,Leonard,why not?
14063,Leonard,that’s not fair. you’re not even a physicist.
16214,Leonard,hold on. when did priya get here?
14124,Leonard,"give me the phone. hi, penny. it’s leonard."
21034,Leonard,and?
14588,Leonard,"uh-huh. now that raj is working for sheldon, i don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
14195,Leonard,i’m helping.
20525,Leonard,sure.
18492,Leonard,"you got it. if this sweater shuts you up, i’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. now all i need to do is head down to the video store and return the dvd."
14479,Leonard,"uh, no, thank you."
13264,Leonard,"thank you, that’s very thoughtful."
21192,Leonard,and this wine is why.
16890,Leonard,okay. come on. upsy-daisy.
18462,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
14994,Leonard,"oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. everybody’s really excited about it."
13631,Leonard,excuse me. what the hell is wrong with you?
17268,Leonard,what choice did the university have? he snapped. it happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
18606,Leonard,"we talked about it, but howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom."
21740,Leonard,"uh, i’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
12681,Leonard,"see, the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet, and skynet was developed by miles dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to dyson’s death in terminator 2."
16154,Leonard,coffee maker?
18934,Leonard,that’s not what i meant.
14660,Leonard,"oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
16075,Leonard,"look, i’m still happy to drive you to work. nothing’s changed in that regard. we’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
14881,Leonard,"no, i heard that."
20150,Leonard,when was your honour insulted?
17574,Leonard,"ah, it was all right, i guess. got to heimlich a cherry stem out of sheldon. caught raj right in the eye."
12563,Leonard,"you’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. "
17928,Leonard,want me to make you some tea?
19706,Leonard,thank you. what did he say?
19372,Leonard,yeah. it’s a deviated septum. the surgery to correct it is simple. he’s gonna do it next week.
21764,Leonard,what am i doing in your spam folder?
21494,Leonard,"how is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
17824,Leonard,"you did it. the drawbridge is down. you cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. and in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten santa claus. he says, ho, ho, help me."
12134,Leonard,"they’re not going anywhere.  so, you’re coming home from work. that’s great. how was work."
21080,Leonard,let it fly.
15830,Leonard,i didn’t see it.
21040,Leonard,which is why i got you this pink power ranger. put it anywhere you like.
15336,Leonard,smother sheldon in his sleep? wouldn’t that be wrong?
20971,Leonard,did we really need to be here for this?
15636,Leonard,what?
18290,Leonard,okay.
13036,Leonard,those are not mine.
18203,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
12719,Leonard,un-unravelable?
12194,Leonard,no.
12409,Leonard,just extending the intimacy. do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
17203,Leonard,"you know what, i am sick of the roommate agreement. it’s ridiculous. i’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. you know, i had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in garden grove because the one in pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
18263,Leonard,"i didn’t tell sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
15382,Leonard,"no, but i was awake all night."
19222,Leonard,"okay, let’s focus. the girls are gone, we have 48 hours. there are no distractions. let’s change the world."
21168,Leonard,absolutely not.
13378,Leonard,you’re welcome.
19005,Leonard,and you were so good in the tv commercial.
13322,Leonard,"she’s gotten really hooked on age of conan, she’s playing non-stop."
13190,Leonard,i’m not the fish. 
21138,Leonard,no. 
20992,Leonard,why do you do that? can’t you let me have my moment?
14298,Leonard,"yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
12696,Leonard,"sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
12709,Leonard,yes.
13933,Leonard,"you guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
14186,Leonard,the box says kitchen.
14830,Leonard,sheldon…
13427,Leonard,no kidding.
16646,Leonard,all rightie. shirt coming off. ta-da! man nipples.
13511,Leonard,"yeah, yeah. uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, i still have to live with him."
19707,Leonard,why did he think you’re the lead scientist? it was my idea.
15720,Leonard,that is insane.
14727,Leonard,"i heard of ’em. didn’t know they were a band. sheldon, she’s gone. you can turn off the blender."
17815,Leonard,fine. you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. there are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
20229,Leonard,it says right here on wikipedia. a mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
19211,Leonard,we had that idea years ago. how come we never did anything with it?
19279,Leonard,"yeah, of course you do, i’m not just a genius in bed. you sure are, baby."
12312,Leonard,"when i take a girl out on a date, and i do, she knows she’s been dated. capital d. bold face, underline, like day-ted. i think i might have a little concussion, i’m going to go lay down for a while, good night. "
21669,Leonard,don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos. please don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos.
19550,Leonard,"okay, well, this is cool. uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…"
18495,Leonard,no.
14661,Leonard,"well, you know, i just noticed i haven’t really met any of them."
13073,Leonard,oh. alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
18862,Leonard,like you and sheldon have everything figured out?
18129,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and i’m not sure how much help you’d be."
12559,Leonard,"aaah, for god’s sake, sheldon, you are driving me crazy. "
14258,Leonard,fine. i’ll sit here. you take flight and hunt.
12753,Leonard,sounds good.
16354,Leonard,"i’m on it.  hi, mrs. wolowitz. is, is howard there? okay, thanks. that particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
13382,Leonard,he’s not going to have intercourse with penny.
20806,Leonard,i don’t know. he uses that traffic app. maybe there’s an accident.
14783,Leonard,"people could call me angie. yo, angie, how’s it goin’?"
15969,Leonard,i’ll give it a shot.
19143,Leonard,right again. 
15817,Leonard,"because, well, batman has the secret."
13677,Leonard,how could i not be sure?
16659,Leonard,"that’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, i’m gonna give it to you."
19455,Leonard,great. here you go.
21778,Leonard,"okay, i’ve had it with you. you might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. and when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh."
20587,Leonard,what are we gonna tell the girls?
19167,Leonard,why not?
19275,Leonard,i was hoping we could talk about the money again.
15391,Leonard,"hey, who’s ready for halo?"
16507,Leonard,my water. you’re drinking it.
17093,Leonard,"not some kind of nerd, i am the king of the nerds."
17950,Leonard,"you are unbelievable. i don’t know why i put up with you. you’re controlling, you’re irritating."
18769,Leonard,we’re really sorry. it was an accident.
14120,Leonard,so?
20454,Leonard,"oh, i took care of it."
17806,Leonard,"glowing letters appear on the chest that read, if squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of svaty vaclav and his victory."
20747,Leonard,"oh, let me try."
13014,Leonard,"no, i needed to hear it."
16536,Leonard,"hey, what took you guys so long?"
17789,Leonard,"oh, come on, i hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."
15647,Leonard,surprise.
15109,Leonard,thermal? ‘cause it’s gonna be cold.
15406,Leonard,"you heard that, huh?"
14191,Leonard,sheldon…
13753,Leonard,"he’s funny, too. he does this hysterical impersonation of stephen hawking having phone sex. what are you wearing? that’s not, he does it better. anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so i’m gonna go practice my situps."
18194,Leonard,"i’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma."
16593,Leonard,"i’m not in the mood, sheldon."
14361,Leonard,wine? i didn’t say to give her wine.
19642,Leonard,what’s that?
18845,Leonard,what do you guys want to do tonight?
14795,Leonard,"with penny and me, it took two years. now that i think about it, that was three dates."
21509,Leonard,"of course i don’t want you to be unhappy, but i also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. you don’t have to stop, just slow down, i’ll jump out."
17530,Leonard,where exactly did your mother have you tested?
21742,Leonard,"uh, i guess."
17935,Leonard,"what did you do, put this in your tea?"
13195,Leonard,that’s not a bad sign.
18217,Leonard,what do you think?
14083,Leonard,where are you going?
16260,Leonard,of course i’ll be back. i live here!
14873,Leonard,"i know. and those specials, they change every day."
12812,Leonard,alright  i just hit my head. 
20300,Leonard,i didn’t even know what it was. i saw it on your nightstand. i picked it up.
16346,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did they get?"
13214,Leonard,"i didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
14982,Leonard,where did you get all this stuff?
15678,Leonard,"all i’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual hulk."
20893,Leonard,we can’t afford to lose any more time.
15356,Leonard,is everything all right?
20383,Leonard,"wow, that’s amazing. i’m in a pretty great mood today myself."
20891,Leonard,so?
13358,Leonard,you just got him this afternoon.
12121,Leonard,"thank you sheldon, you’re a good friend."
12250,Leonard,"oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. i mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. "
20993,Leonard,no. she cannot kiss. what is wrong with you people?
12596,Leonard,what?
16122,Leonard,"penny’s here.  no, we don’t want to watch bridget jones’s diary!"
16371,Leonard,no one’s getting tortured.
21531,Leonard,"sir, i, i, i’m sorry but i just don’t get it. you came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?"
29524,Raj,it’s fantastic. unbelievable.
34092,Raj,"hey, look, i found an ipod. "
32601,Raj,i’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
31969,Raj,hang on.
33421,Raj,i know. you guys should totally be making out with me.
33867,Raj,"yeah, i saw something for halley and i couldn’t resist."
33603,Raj,it was an accident. the doctor left the folder out on her desk. it’s not my fault i opened it and looked.
31232,Raj,let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
32327,Raj,it has been a while since i got my prostate checked.
32199,Raj,"my father’s a gynaecologist, i think i can handle it. and, now, i’m gay."
31126,Raj,it’s all over her facebook page.
30849,Raj,"i’ve said this before, and i’ll say it again. aquaman sucks."
29565,Raj,"can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in india, there’s an indian starving right here. "
29735,Raj,"psh, what a bunch of crybabies. no guts, no glory man. "
33175,Raj,"guys, fifteen seconds."
30108,Raj,i like the new look.
32388,Raj,can we please get back to the game?
31338,Raj,it was a nice retirement party.
32726,Raj,the doorman said this is the right building.
33835,Raj,"yeah, right. wait, is it rose gold? actually, don’t tell me, i want to be surprised."
33671,Raj,"yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. yes, this is all making sense. good."
29775,Raj,"yes i do, come on. see you later leonard. "
30386,Raj,"well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
33894,Raj,"uh, i gave her an imodium. that’s tomorrow’s problem."
34114,Raj,"so, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
32517,Raj,it’s okay.
29697,Raj,"boy, sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. did you see it, it’s rough. "
30131,Raj,"great. now how are you going to settle it, hmm? there is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
31116,Raj,"yes, i am. the god kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
31795,Raj,"so then i went to cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like hogwarts. that’s where i fell in love with astronomy, and now i’m an astrophysicist at caltech, so i guess you could say, uh, raj is my name and stars are my game. and rhyming is also my game. so, uh, two games. uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. i want to hear everything about you."
33968,Raj,"bye, cinnamon. be a good girl."
30387,Raj,"great. they get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
29810,Raj,the people from people.
31553,Raj,"ooh, hallow-weenies! that’s a good one. they’ll pair nicely with my draculoni and cheese. how do i do it?"
30250,Raj,"all right, but i have some conditions."
31026,Raj,what are you doing?
33002,Raj,"howard, my father cut me off. i have to get my money back for this."
33125,Raj,"yeah, i’m here because i think it’s gonna be like game of thrones."
32301,Raj,"and if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son howard. i’m just kidding. we’ll name him dalib, after my grandfather."
30858,Raj,"you know, if i made more money, i could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."
33424,Raj,"oh, man, when i come out of the closet, i’m gonna nail those guys. yeah, i heard it. shut up."
29606,Raj,"is there another penny here? i had such plans. i had dreams. i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astro-physics. but with a penis, of course. "
30575,Raj,no.
29533,Raj,"blowing the gates. control, shift, b! oh, my god, so many goblins!"
31658,Raj,"uh, wait, can i come with you? my character died."
33055,Raj,hang on. what do i need to do to make you trust me?
30509,Raj,what?
32887,Raj,how was the hospital?
32654,Raj,let’s set up the equipment. it’ll help take your mind off of it.
32630,Raj,huh. bill murray did get it wrong.
33706,Raj,couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
33611,Raj,i’ve never been to palm springs.
32171,Raj,there’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. and it’s when you’re ten.
31472,Raj,i wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
30757,Raj,hello.
31317,Raj,buzz lightyear is not real.
31951,Raj,"you are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your woody allen swagger."
32503,Raj,wouldn’t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else?
30670,Raj,hi.
30975,Raj,very nice. you lie to my sister.
32436,Raj,no jokes about the year i took ballet.
30457,Raj,"you know what? even though i don’t have a girlfriend, i can still have a good time on valentine’s day."
29644,Raj,"oh, too bad. i’ve always wanted to go to long beach. "
29931,Raj,"sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile."
33832,Raj,"very mature. keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack."
33959,Raj,i just never want to be a burden on my friends.
30223,Raj,"ooh, dark matter. we better bring a flashlight. i was making a joke."
32023,Raj,yay.
30961,Raj,"bad news, the nigerian prince may be a fraud."
30806,Raj,"five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"
30734,Raj,"not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
33316,Raj,"right. good catch. anyway, so i’m sorry to waste your time. and, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
33219,Raj,"guys, they’re gonna sell out."
33127,Raj,look at us. we’re like the rockettes.
31597,Raj,he is kind of a weirdo. maybe he’s got leonard nimoy chained up in there. or bill gates. or stephen hawking.
34081,Raj,no. i haven’t played the race card yet.
31925,Raj,how are your crab cakes?
33936,Raj,can i get anyone anything at all?
31133,Raj,"of course. i’m always packing. anyway, um, i had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
33441,Raj,"i buried it there, so we could go home."
32929,Raj,"hmm. what if he’s in prison? what if he’s a spy? what if he’s in a beatles cover band? i’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer ringo."
31662,Raj,"no, no, no, i’m fine."
32099,Raj,"oh, please?"
33791,Raj,"hold on, i don’t think she was impressed."
30069,Raj,yeah.
34183,Raj,can i get my stuff? sounds like it’s gonna be a while.
34148,Raj,"ooh, fun. i love prom. the romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. sorry. autocorrect. that was supposed to say, i like sports."
32159,Raj,"my, my. the plot, like my gravy, thickens."
29529,Raj,"actually, i was less the chatter than the chattee."
31911,Raj,anything can happen.
32980,Raj,"well, i think we should show what earthlings look like."
30615,Raj,"yeah, look. breasts and everything."
30012,Raj,the wolowitz coefficient?
30171,Raj,"very, very smart guys."
31259,Raj,"so, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?"
31981,Raj,"i think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage i saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, lucy, and i didn’t get upset at all."
30545,Raj,did you start waxing?
32936,Raj,"okay, but something smells fishy. and not just because you work around sea animals. that actually sounds interesting, and i’d like to learn more about it. hey, you okay?"
31893,Raj,"you called me feminine. and i, i wanted you to think i was more manly."
33803,Raj,yeah. i’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how i can be a better boyfriend.
33624,Raj,"yeah, yeah, a little."
33163,Raj,"yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. if we present him as a prize, maybe they would."
31012,Raj,wow. i can’t believe old smelly pooper finally got laid.
29639,Raj,i don’t want to be in a jar. i want my brain in an android body. eight feet tall and ripped. 
34098,Raj,sorry.
32655,Raj,do you know any mining songs?
32308,Raj,aha.
31449,Raj,"seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. anything under ten miles an hour and i can combat-roll into the street."
30137,Raj,"ugh, toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
30416,Raj,you know india?
30362,Raj,he’s right.
32259,Raj,"okay, so, i’m on a comic-con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. guys, if i go to jail dressed as the human torch, that might send the wrong message."
30345,Raj,"oh, menopause, nature’s birth control."
33235,Raj,hello.
30244,Raj,"oh, yeah? can you do this? "
32792,Raj,like what?
32898,Raj,it’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
32438,Raj,"hey, guys."
32468,Raj,and play.
31621,Raj,let’s go home. you want to get something to eat?
31706,Raj,great idea. i haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. these cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before i eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
33100,Raj,"that is, that is so good!"
32125,Raj,"well, it was fun. i used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. it’s a lightsabre belt buckle."
31572,Raj,"sheldon, do i really sound like that?"
31386,Raj,"oh, uh, these are my, my friends. this is bernadette."
32635,Raj,"hey, sheldon, you busy?"
31646,Raj,"what about you, sheldon? do you have any plans tonight?"
32429,Raj,why the rush? she isn’t going anywhere.
32258,Raj,i don’t know. maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
30353,Raj,"the meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path."
33755,Raj,"this is not how i imagined this day going, i should be with them right now."
30471,Raj,"and worst of all, fin fang foom."
31797,Raj,what?
29811,Raj,"boy, i bet ellen pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap."
31252,Raj,"hey, guys, check it out. the deluxe limited edition wild west and witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
32795,Raj,"whether you call it god or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. s, seriously? you were just gonna drive away? like my life isn’t hard enough right now. a space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs."
33463,Raj,"okay, i think i see what’s happening here. you’re jealous of me."
30513,Raj,three.
31565,Raj,"try to keep up, howard, i’m killing it."
33601,Raj,"if you want, you can find out right now."
33754,Raj,no. people just keep kicking me out everywhere i go.
32916,Raj,what?
31388,Raj,please have a seat.  i’m thinking double wedding!
30262,Raj,"saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a mystic warlords of ka-ah tournament. first prize is five hundred dollars. if we team up, we’d be unstoppable."
30330,Raj,sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that i had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? rice!
29882,Raj,i saw what you did there.
33039,Raj,"oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and elizabeth mcnulty, who apparently died when she was the same age i am."
29621,Raj,back off sheldon. 
33737,Raj,just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
30170,Raj,but i was summing up.
33450,Raj,"no, it’s just, ever since i started dating claire and emily at the same time, it’s exhausting."
31798,Raj,i was humiliated by yet another woman.
31067,Raj,what if she wasn’t kidding?
32278,Raj,"okay. okay, thank you. oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. she likes katy perry. oh, but don’t do firework, that gets her all riled up."
30754,Raj,"ah, me, too."
31580,Raj,then don’t do it.
33173,Raj,forty-five.
32255,Raj,does he sound like a criminal?
32446,Raj,no problem. how’s your mom feeling?
30791,Raj,"maybe. if it did, i’d be famous. i’d be on the cover of magazines. and then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, i’d have a big mansion."
31530,Raj,i’m in her head. let the dance begin.
30972,Raj,"oh, come on, man. bros before… my sister."
33860,Raj,"oh, daddy, you’re so rich and funny."
33976,Raj,"it didn’t work for randy, it didn’t work for tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for jennifer."
33610,Raj,what time do you and bernadette head out?
33562,Raj,"wow. you’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. now i know how all those army wives feel."
32381,Raj,correct.
29596,Raj,"i’ve got some feelers out. in the meantime, listen to this."
32759,Raj,someone should really close that loading door.
30002,Raj,what’s the matter?
30613,Raj,we finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
33910,Raj,what’s with the gloves?
33876,Raj,but bernadette makes more money than howard. she basically supports him.
31529,Raj,"has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?"
32229,Raj,he brought you a pretty rock.
30458,Raj,"no, no, no, i’m going to have a me day. first i’m going to go to one of those spas in koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. then i’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
31284,Raj,what’s your name?
33467,Raj,"wait, did amy make her spinach dip?"
32263,Raj,"okay, i’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
30154,Raj,do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of john grisham?
29600,Raj,why?
30888,Raj,what?
30434,Raj,"no, it’s okay. i don’t have to go. i’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. i’m a walking brown yelp.com."
34068,Raj,sounds like a lot of work.
31416,Raj,i think we already have. thank you guys so much. let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
30109,Raj,"i call it the mario and luigi, but whatever. hey, how’s sheldon doing?"
31857,Raj,"excuse me. i’m here to pay my respects to professor tupperware, or whatever his name is."
33884,Raj,i’m spoiled? your baby has a cape that costs $300.
31979,Raj,"uh, no, water’s fine. anyhow, i’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and i totally see why lucy did what she did. i pushed too hard. but you know what? if i back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
32048,Raj,which celebrity would you say i look like the most?
32610,Raj,why not?
31435,Raj,maybe we can go up to napa valley. they’ve got that wine train.
31407,Raj,"look, howard, you’re in a relationship. you know you have to make compromises."
33222,Raj,tonight’s the night.
31139,Raj,"okay, just the candle thing."
30882,Raj,i’d like to weigh in here. no.
34043,Raj,i may be moving out soon. i think i found a place to live.
33695,Raj,"i thought that, too. but then i got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
30832,Raj,don’t yell at me!
29870,Raj,"or possibly durham, north carolina."
33747,Raj,"you’ll be happy i did. okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. you wanted to make an entrance. i get it. and here’s your daddy. when he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
29847,Raj,"no, it’s time to put on some r. kelly and suck face."
32876,Raj,"hang on. oh no. oh, no. oh, god, no."
33018,Raj,how’d you do that?
30802,Raj,hey.
31791,Raj,"i got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. excuse me, everybody. can i have your attention, please? we’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. but that doesn’t make us mutants. the only mutants here are in these comic books. we’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. you know what i see when i look around? i see a room full of great people. so let’s give ourselves a break. we are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone."
31406,Raj,"she was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. and you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but i’m actually thinking about doing it."
29828,Raj,"okay, so, saturday night, can i count on my posse?"
32195,Raj,sounds about right.
30569,Raj,there are no solar flares right now.
32810,Raj,"just dandy, mr i-wish-i-was-better-at-improv."
33009,Raj,what’s the first one?
30523,Raj,"true, but thanks to meditation, i am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. now, close your eyes."
33731,Raj,"hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
32893,Raj,"well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and i was just angry at myself."
30744,Raj,"oh, bella, don’t you see? edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you.  coming."
31998,Raj,"you know, you, you and i, you and i have a lot in common."
30558,Raj,i haven’t had sex in a year.
32110,Raj,"okay, let me have it. let’s hear all the raj is a girl jokes."
29607,Raj,"ever since i was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. how can i be a gynaecologist, i can barely look a woman in the eye. you know what, i’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. somebody give me a computer with a webcam. "
34149,Raj,this was really fun.
29768,Raj,we just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
34161,Raj,"hey, claire. hi. it’s, it’s rajesh. i was, i was wondering if you’re free for valentine’s day?"
34006,Raj,these here parts?
32526,Raj,"what up, guys?"
30392,Raj,race riots?
32069,Raj,hello.
31246,Raj,i’ll take one.
32807,Raj,"yes, emily. whatever. where’s sheldon?"
31339,Raj,"hey, look, there’s rothman’s empty office. sad."
33495,Raj,"uh, she’s seeing me."
32882,Raj,"this looks terrible. she, she’s gonna know."
31809,Raj,wait! give me the number! give me the number! give me the number!
32649,Raj,we’re going to be fine.
32304,Raj,not at all. he’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. it’s like me in those moments when i miss india.
31029,Raj,"no, thank you. i’m fine."
33675,Raj,this is fun. i have never cleaned a toilet before.
33956,Raj,"no, you see, i’m doing this so i can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
33052,Raj,and you knew about this this whole time?
32395,Raj,"i, i don’t know if you remember me."
32903,Raj,"okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna."
32170,Raj,all i’m saying is there’s a time to just listen. 
33266,Raj,but it’s beautiful.
29564,Raj,that works. 
34144,Raj,"my dad’s a gynaecologist in india, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix."
32687,Raj,one ladder left.
32331,Raj,"and judging by her lack of adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. i like that in a woman."
32191,Raj,if you were having sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
33280,Raj,what is wrong with you?
32702,Raj,"anyway, any ideas on a gift?"
33992,Raj,"are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? actually, never mind, don’t answer. i’d love to."
32281,Raj,"all right. uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? we’re usually in bed by now, and i want her to know that i’m here. yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon."
32704,Raj,"well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. oh, maybe i could make a gift for them. i know how much you guys love the coasters i made for you."
31393,Raj,"okay, what page are you on?"
30803,Raj,he never touched my telescope.
30606,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
31194,Raj,i’m so mad at you!
33932,Raj,"well, to be honest, leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
32906,Raj,i’m not making any promises.
29527,Raj,are there any chopsticks?
31420,Raj,"that’s really nice of you, howard."
33284,Raj,"you know it. oo-ah, oo-ah."
32621,Raj,"plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work."
31616,Raj,do you think he’s building a bomb?
30439,Raj,he never went back to the university?
33504,Raj,"uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line."
33223,Raj,let’s do this.
31683,Raj,thank you. i hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
29781,Raj,"yes, isn’t she an amazing actress."
33445,Raj,but wouldn’t man-batman just be a batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
30395,Raj,"okay, well, how about this? from the university web site, 7pm to 10pm, norton hall multipurpose room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
32006,Raj,there was.
29695,Raj,holy crap. 
31204,Raj,what? you’re going to make me choose between the woman i love and the money i have very strong feelings for?
33293,Raj,"it is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover."
30919,Raj,"cool, buddy! that’s awesome!"
29714,Raj,he’s got a point.
29678,Raj,"you know, i kind of feel bad about what we did to him. "
33612,Raj,"i don’t know. if i want to watch old people sweat, i can just facetime my family in india."
31328,Raj,"hey, guys, guys, president siebert is headed this way."
30855,Raj,"that’s a hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?"
30753,Raj,i may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
30694,Raj,no.
33669,Raj,isabella. 
32733,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
29848,Raj,"just making conversation. mummy, daddy, i want you to meet my new squeeze, penny."
30766,Raj,"we can still see something. uh, the new sandra bullock movie is playing two blocks away. you know sandy b always brings it."
33368,Raj,"what? he beat out george clooney, and that’s something. like, i love me some clooney."
33169,Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
31612,Raj,he’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
33350,Raj,"i know, you could ask bernadette for a raise in your allowance."
31644,Raj,"i know, but that sounds anti-semitic. anyway, i was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. the theme, movies that killed their franchises."
32359,Raj,have you heard from howard?
33265,Raj,that’s just amy.
32267,Raj,it is. i feel alive.
34079,Raj,i think you made that very clear.
33859,Raj,"good, good. uh, listen, i just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
33208,Raj,"it’s not creepy. i built a footprints on the moon fan page, trent joined it."
32167,Raj,don’t be silly. sit. you look like you’ve had a long day.
33718,Raj,i think you’re both cute.
31488,Raj,"i was, but it’s their anniversary and i didn’t want to be a third wheel, so i figured i’d come over here and hang out with you and penny on your date."
32566,Raj,i’m heckling you. it’s a beloved part of baseball.
32721,Raj,"roger abbott, roger abbott, roger abbott. oh, my god, leonard, i know he’s dead, but try it. it’s fun. roger abbott, roger abbott."
30460,Raj,but i never will.
29636,Raj,"but papa, please…."
31394,Raj,say again.
31544,Raj,we’ll switch. you’ll come sit with me after intermission.
29717,Raj,"okay, every other month."
30711,Raj,can you believe it? little priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in india.
29849,Raj,"here you go, cute huh?"
33099,Raj,"okay, i don’t have it all worked out yet, but i was thinking something like, um, oh, indy, oh, indy, the skies are so windy. is that a flying man with a killer bod? wait, that’s no man, it’s a norse god."
34039,Raj,"i disagree. penny is a strong, independent woman. the more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back."
32433,Raj,she’s very real.
31694,Raj,"i say you tell alex your heart belongs to penny, i provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later i give it to her good."
34088,Raj,i have to go.   
31864,Raj,"whatever. i can see my little princess while i’m at work, right?"
30084,Raj,"ooh, i don’t like where this is going."
31835,Raj,so your theme is i saw a rerun of mad men and bought some crab puffs from trader joe’s? hate to miss that.
30539,Raj,"big or small, i don’t like rabbits. they always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do."
32066,Raj,"dude, this is, this is brutal. "
33946,Raj,"sheldon, she’s fine."
31027,Raj,"oh, cool. can i play?"
30269,Raj,"ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. sign here."
30895,Raj,what happened?
31177,Raj,you’re making me sound like a caveman.
31767,Raj,"yeah. uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of rockford files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing i know, she was tucking me into your bed."
33684,Raj,"yeah, sure. i understand. yeah, i’m very busy, too."
32220,Raj,"yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. you know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
33602,Raj,"well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
31331,Raj,"no hi, raj? no how are you, raj? just straight to where’s the other white guy?"
30984,Raj,what’s the matter?
32835,Raj,"and you’re eating alone at a deli. i don’t buy it, you’re not him."
33849,Raj,"yes, so, i was just warming up some milk for halley, and i thought it smelled a little funky, so i checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says flerbsday."
29956,Raj,leviticus 11:3: “only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
34105,Raj,"but mummy, all the other guys are going to the north pole."
30897,Raj,"it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.  it’s howard. howard, hello."
32802,Raj,"you know what? i think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships."
29830,Raj,sheldon?
32567,Raj,you look like a jackass.
31906,Raj,"a lane frequented by liars. like you, you big liar."
31241,Raj,that is one tough birdie.
33488,Raj,"hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot zack or wheezy little leonard? neener neener."
29531,Raj,"intoxicating, isn’t it?"
33098,Raj,"okay, so it’s a, it’s a david and goliath story. it’s about man against god. it’s called hammer and whip, the untold story of thor versus indiana jones."
29945,Raj,"i’m curious. in the “how well do you know sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?"
33786,Raj,"okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and i will mark them down. "
30986,Raj,"hello, mummy. hello, daddy. how are you?"
34112,Raj,"hey, it’s disco night at the moonlight roller rink in glendale tonight. who’s up for getting down?"
29866,Raj,judge’s ruling?
30382,Raj,"well, i’m going back to india. what’s your plan?"
30126,Raj,"whatever, dude. the point is, leonard’s got one and you don’t."
30755,Raj,"i think he’s eating lunch. uh, sheldon, i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson from the hayden planetarium in new york."
33088,Raj,have you seen this archie comic? it’s actually archie versus predator.
33979,Raj,"oh, well, then i can actually feel the moisture going into my skin. "
31710,Raj,"now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. i’ll set the mood.  oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. that’s right. oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…"
29725,Raj,"dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
32585,Raj,"ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place."
29803,Raj,remember that little planetary object i spotted beyond the kuiper belt?
31737,Raj,"oh, come on. you deserve one. you’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money."
32270,Raj,"he’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
30620,Raj,uh-oh. she wants to meet us.
30853,Raj,"ooh, i call kermit."
32305,Raj,why me?
33420,Raj,"interesting. i mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but i like it."
30988,Raj,"it, it doesn’t matter. howard has a girlfriend."
33066,Raj,"yeah, penny packed you a bag."
30910,Raj,"oh, you don’t want that."
32724,Raj,"maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. strawberries, caviar, oysters. all good choices. yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."
30249,Raj,for you or with you?
33181,Raj,"you just say, uh, hey, siri, what time is it?"
31605,Raj,how did that work out?
33663,Raj,"oh, no, that’s mine."
30593,Raj,i can’t. i’m too sick. go away.
30462,Raj,can’t believe it. we’re going to meet stan lee! 
32542,Raj,she feeds him out of her own mouth?
32912,Raj,"hey, penny, can you give me a hand with this?"
32268,Raj,maybe slapped with a fine.
30371,Raj,"you can’t sink. with all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away."
32310,Raj,"oh, of course."
31256,Raj,you unfriended me? seriously?
30697,Raj,thank you.
29986,Raj,"you fail to take into account that even mute, i am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty."
30178,Raj,but we don’t have tattoos. what if someone asks to see our tattoos?
31863,Raj,"yeah, screw it. i’m going in."
33924,Raj,i cannot thank you enough.
32782,Raj,"dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians."
29854,Raj,i’m taking you home.
32738,Raj,you guys suck.
32663,Raj,"oh, this heat is brutal."
31794,Raj,"later, losers!"
33588,Raj,i’m sorry?
33843,Raj,"like i said, you ladies have fun."
30338,Raj,"okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. that means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
31184,Raj,"yes, but she doesn’t. so get signing, hand monkey."
33935,Raj,"oh, uh, hi, penny. yes, please."
31556,Raj,"oh, by the way, can i borrow your bullwhip and fedora?"
31155,Raj,i’m impressed. this is very lifelike.
32983,Raj,"look, i’m sorry i hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over."
30162,Raj,"sure, we like fun."
31569,Raj,"i think the next time i have to speak to a call centre in india, i’m going to try using an american accent."
32424,Raj,"yeah, literally, none of it."
31158,Raj,"yeah. hey, you know, if this was in sheldon and leonard’s apartment, i wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
30862,Raj,oh. very clever. but still racist.
32883,Raj,"okay, where should i put them?"
32596,Raj,"excuse me, can i say something? i just love both you guys, and i want you to get along. and when i say love i meant as a friend. and, uh, way too soon, right?"
31938,Raj,"so, anyway, last night on video chat, i spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into lucy’s eyes."
33690,Raj,"oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. it’ll be like dining under the stars. you see this, uh, double zero? when it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. sometimes it takes a while."
30678,Raj,"oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of red vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
31376,Raj,"listen, uh, there’s something i want to talk to you about. i, i wasn’t ready until now, but i think it’s time."
31845,Raj,only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
32434,Raj,see? this is exactly the kind of thing i’m worried about you saying in front of her.
29772,Raj,"well, we all knew this day was coming. "
30635,Raj,where does he poop?
33514,Raj,open it.
30793,Raj,"no, you wouldn’t. you’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. my only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people i hired to be my living chess set."
34125,Raj,"oh, guess who."
31335,Raj,follow your heart.
31102,Raj,it’s a good thing.
33116,Raj,that had nothing to do with rachel. it was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
32867,Raj,that’s okay. i can come back later.
30160,Raj,so what do you gals do?
31531,Raj,howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
31494,Raj,what? why?
32261,Raj,that’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
30441,Raj,but he’s afraid of dogs.
33295,Raj,"well, i’ve never seen you here before, claire."
31782,Raj,"well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?"
29749,Raj,"excuse me, but i think you’re missing a big opportunity here. "
30948,Raj,october sixth.
33944,Raj,"thank you, but how do i know you’re not saying that just to be nice?"
30701,Raj,"well, we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."
31813,Raj,"wait. can you at least tell me what went wrong? it’s okay. i can take anything. unless it’s something i did, or said, or am. ‘cause those are, like, my buttons."
31598,Raj,"howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. that’s not okay."
30898,Raj,"yeah, i’m right here, buddy. how are you?"
31120,Raj,"please, come in."
29867,Raj,"not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment."
31886,Raj,thanks. i love hockey.
33281,Raj,"you went to emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying."
32662,Raj,what if we brought them down with us?
33599,Raj,i’m the son of a gynaecologist. i could be helpful. 
32264,Raj,what about that little cup they give you?
30359,Raj,right! that was so good! sweety and meaty at the same time.
31100,Raj,i’m the new homo in town. that came out wrong.
31249,Raj,incredibly so.
31747,Raj,"wow, that’s harsh."
30179,Raj,"oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?"
32333,Raj,"emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
33090,Raj,"hey, we’ve always talked about playing together."
33709,Raj,"this is tough, but i’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me youtube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
31812,Raj,oh.
33804,Raj,we are going to find out.
33774,Raj,"oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk."
29765,Raj,"nice close up, by the way. "
33593,Raj,"whoa, i’m calling my dad, okay? he’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an obgyn. and experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
29894,Raj,you told me you were going to have the talk with him.
29664,Raj,thank you. 
30631,Raj,smooth.
30846,Raj,the archies are over here.
33852,Raj,"fine, you drink it."
34017,Raj,i’d love a personal trainer. i haven’t seen my abs since they opened a shake shack on my drive home.
33954,Raj,"you know, we’re both down on our luck. maybe you and i should try to get a place together."
31878,Raj,"no, it’s not. i’ve always thought that was unfair."
33572,Raj,"you didn’t think i was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here i am."
31235,Raj,this is not a safe place. you can’t share anything here.
32124,Raj,"well, i was feeling bad about how i acted the other night so i made you a little something."
31257,Raj,is that him over there?
32462,Raj,what?
33371,Raj,"come on, sheldon, say something."
32611,Raj,"for your information, emily is working tonight."
31984,Raj,"how can i meet someone new when everywhere i look, i see lucy’s face? tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."
33900,Raj,like a business manager?
31520,Raj,"hey, stuart, come on in."
32839,Raj,i want a picture with nathan fillion.
32963,Raj,and doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
29628,Raj,"but he’s right, papa, listen to him.  you! you are the one who ruined everything! "
32677,Raj,"well, that didn’t go your way."
32009,Raj,"well, i’ve been quite enjoying that. it combines all the superhero fun of spider-man with all the body-switching shenanigans of freaky friday. both versions, original and lohan."
31775,Raj,"i’m trapped. my clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. i think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. what do i do?"
33615,Raj,"answer the question, what are you doing here?"
30516,Raj,"okay in avatar when they have sex in pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
30474,Raj,it’s even got the elvish engraving on it.
30912,Raj,nice place. reminds me of my parents’ house back in new delhi.
30083,Raj,"our dreams are very small, aren’t they?"
32628,Raj,"ooh, that is a lot of hair. ow. and now i’m gonna hear it from jenny."
30107,Raj,it was the only way to keep you from being such a huge dickensian. you see that? i added the ensian.
29780,Raj,terrific. 
33524,Raj,"what about the guy on the channel four news? you know, four on your side? maybe he can be on your side."
30401,Raj,"sheldon, i’m begging you. i want to go to this mixer, and i don’t want to go alone."
33172,Raj,sixty seconds. this is not looking good.
34166,Raj,"ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
33320,Raj,"yeah, of course. we have no secrets."
29757,Raj,"oh sweet krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker."
31244,Raj,a total loser. obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
32814,Raj,no. you have to read it how dr. angus mcdougal of the university of edinburgh would. this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
31594,Raj,"well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. can you hear anything?"
31830,Raj,i’m counting that as foreplay.
30602,Raj,"run. run, run, run. don’t look back."
31640,Raj,calm down. howard has something he wants to say to you.
30497,Raj,"wait, my laptop. "
33096,Raj,i just got chills.
33673,Raj,"no, no, this is brand new. we haven’t even been on a proper date yet."
32385,Raj,perhaps this will help. here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
32958,Raj,"eh. although, to be fair, i watched e.t. build a telephone out of a speak & spell and an umbrella. dude was like a little brown macgyver."
32090,Raj,you called the right person. i believe i have the perfect romantic evening for you to give leonard.
31720,Raj,"fine, then i guess it’s two against two. how do we decide?"
32120,Raj,but this isn’t about the jewellery. this is about me having a place where i can open up about my feelings.
32587,Raj,we are now.
31134,Raj,i did. it was beautiful.
32284,Raj,she’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
32942,Raj,you guys know the new discovery class missions that nasa’s been working on?
31121,Raj,"well, you were always so nice to me, i thought maybe you liked me."
30692,Raj,knock yourself out.
30650,Raj,"don’t ruin it for me, man. i printed out a pdf to read on the potty."
34156,Raj,"hey, leonard. what’s up? what? how did that happen? yeah, okay. i’ll be there as soon as i can. sorry. i have to run to the university."
30210,Raj,halfway is 600 miles off the coast of japan.
34164,Raj,"i mean, this is the first time i’ve ever broken up with someone. i just, i didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much."
33772,Raj,"oh, he’s really good with her."
32190,Raj,"you know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones."
29635,Raj,"it was just this one time, papa, i swear. "
32991,Raj,"very well, thank you."
33703,Raj,it’s my one move.
32915,Raj,"dude, three-time sanskriti school for well-born boys badminton champion."
31917,Raj,i’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
32995,Raj,"but, daddy, i, i miss my family so much, and with you and mummy getting a divorce, i feel sad and empty. buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. so while i can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…"
30409,Raj,"okay, let’s check out the females."
32736,Raj,that would be nice.
32248,Raj,anyone in?
32002,Raj,"no, no, no, that would be crazy. i mean, if i were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
31822,Raj,"anyway, i was hoping i could, uh, pick your brains a little. i’m supposed to take lucy out friday and i need a killer first date."
33324,Raj,i will.
33176,Raj,"five, four, three, two, one. that’s too bad."
31074,Raj,leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. can i stay here tonight?
32329,Raj,"amy, i could use some help."
30785,Raj,"bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."
30735,Raj,"as long as we’re apologising, sheldon, i, i’m sorry i used your toothbrush."
30681,Raj,and i can put it in your office?
32360,Raj,"hey, stuart!"
34127,Raj,"sheldon, i’m talking to someone. you’re being rude. i’ll bet you’re an actress. if not, you should be. you have a very expressive face."
30163,Raj,dark and fun.
30156,Raj,uh… blackened salmon?
30585,Raj,"did you get a cold, too?"
32975,Raj,"okay, i think we should do it right now."
34102,Raj,"that’s the spirit, howard. yes, we can."
32401,Raj,i can’t do that to leonard. this is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
30904,Raj,"oh, right. good one."
33748,Raj,"well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. some day she’s gonna want to see this."
33220,Raj,good for sheldon deciding to stay with amy on her birthday.
32550,Raj,‘cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
31685,Raj,"now that i know she doesn’t like me, i’m kind of into her."
31999,Raj,"oh, yes, i, i too am in the throes of heartbreak. okay, fine, i’ll tell you about it."
33041,Raj,"of ghosts, no. of you, little bit."
32688,Raj,and then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
33177,Raj,"i don’t think it matters. look, sheldon, i believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. okay? not because of a test or a web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams."
30831,Raj,"wait. are we starting now? or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…"
33596,Raj,"this is my friend, bernadette. she’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so i thought maybe you could talk to her."
31445,Raj,"oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the sailor moon costume at comic-con?"
33351,Raj,i wasn’t joking.
32896,Raj,"i promise. why, what’s in there?"
31541,Raj,"it’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes."
33664,Raj,"well, i can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
30671,Raj,"i’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
32989,Raj,i don’t know. why do i own one?
31025,Raj,nothing rhymes with orange. it’s probably lonely.
30596,Raj,"go away. she wants new delhi, not kosher deli. besides, you have a girlfriend."
29923,Raj,"how about “die, toaster, die”?"
32599,Raj,i’m so glad we could work this all out.
30946,Raj,okay.
33446,Raj,"well, that’s just batman."
32058,Raj,"okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
32783,Raj,"yeah, it’s pretty great."
31212,Raj,wow. you’re not only our first astronaut. you’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. you’re like a rock star.
31054,Raj,"sheldon, that’s my water."
29572,Raj,there are no rules in hell! 
30500,Raj,"okay, everybody, and plie. and relevae."
30574,Raj,i’m sorry?
30536,Raj,don’t worry. you’re surrounded by your c-men.
32343,Raj,plane tickets? yeah.
33458,Raj,how could you say that?
32778,Raj,what kind of scientist are you? everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
32202,Raj,"at least leonard, howard and i would have always been friends."
32837,Raj,"wait, hang on. if you’re really nathan fillion, what’s the line from firefly about your bonnet?"
29545,Raj,"excuse me, ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and shiva is the destroyer. when the smoke clears, abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps. "
33696,Raj,uh.
31631,Raj,"yeah, well, i know how to make your egg salad now."
31842,Raj,"okay, um, it was a card for your 18th birthday. inside it said, happy birthday, howard. i love you. dad. oh, and it was a far side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. thinks it’s a fly. silly frog. so funny."
32684,Raj,you fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. you will not fool me again.
31808,Raj,"i must be strong so i don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe."
31946,Raj,"okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
21795,Raj,wait. it’s here.
31138,Raj,can i say i ruined you for white men?
31926,Raj,that’s great.
33210,Raj,"yeah, like she could get trent."
32012,Raj,"well, we’ve all seen your mom. that butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
29521,Raj,"of all the howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite."
31780,Raj,"hey, stuart, you got anything going on for valentine’s day?"
32219,Raj,"that depends. on any level, do you think she’s hot?"
32312,Raj,"and how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. and you threw up again. and so on and so on."
31552,Raj,it’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
32508,Raj,what? don’t send me home. i can’t be alone right now.
29932,Raj,"excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without wolowitz? have you heard from penny yet?"
33481,Raj,"hey, claire."
31451,Raj,"dude, i am so sorry."
32741,Raj,there’s been a problem with an experiment. a bird got into the clean room.
33700,Raj,"i’m sorry. honestly, i didn’t think your job would bother me, but i guess it did. and i hate myself for that. but there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
32648,Raj,"or totally naked. i love howard, but the dude needs a little shame."
29715,Raj,i still want it on my balcony. i say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. 
30029,Raj,are you spock?
33844,Raj,got it.
30959,Raj,"hold on. i’m talking to an orc under the bridge in thunder bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things."
31525,Raj,"in case you didn’t follow that, i’m the coffee."
29760,Raj,incredible. you managed to screw up the screw-up. 
34174,Raj,"oh, i’ll get it."
33836,Raj,"you know, i just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
29975,Raj,what was all that about?
31381,Raj,"oh yes. in my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. plus i want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here i look like six two."
30732,Raj,that was all a lie? this year’s gifts are already wrapped!
29983,Raj,"oh, please.when it comes to terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger."
32598,Raj,"it’s true, you’re both gorgeous. kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. you get why i’ve been alone most of my adult life."
33907,Raj,but i need to earn enough money so i can go to comic-con.
32671,Raj,"by the time i was born, voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. it had seen jupiter and saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. when i left india for america, i was never more scared in my life. i had no idea what lay ahead. whenever i feel that way, i think about how voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. don’t leave. you can do this."
32121,Raj,"there are just some things that i feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my koothrapanties are in a bunch."
30998,Raj,what?
30183,Raj,i wonder how they smell.
34104,Raj,“i’m so lonely and horny i may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
31501,Raj,i really thought she would say it.
32189,Raj,hey.
29559,Raj,"oh, that’s very impressive. and a little racist. "
33193,Raj,"oh, this is cool. so, a few weeks ago i set up a fan page on facebook for our band and…"
32318,Raj,can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
32924,Raj,"yes, you are."
33092,Raj,"it’s been around for years. it’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
31666,Raj,"okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub."
32019,Raj,"hmm. uh, let me see something. "
32346,Raj,have you heard back from emily?
32122,Raj,"yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. "
29670,Raj,"i can’t talk to her, you do it. "
33552,Raj,"well, you’re kidding, right?"
31919,Raj,really?
32891,Raj,"come on, think back. it would really help if you had."
31242,Raj,"hey, look, the new warlords of ka’a expansion pack is out."
32803,Raj,and you think that’s going to help?
33668,Raj,it’s gross but i have to eat it because i met somebody.
32855,Raj,"i don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text."
30860,Raj,i think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
29941,Raj,feel better now?
29525,Raj,why?
33913,Raj,"here, let me help you."
34108,Raj,that’s still not funny.
33399,Raj,"yes. indeed. absolutely. indubitably. i’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and i know it. so, uh, when do you want to meet up?"
32445,Raj,"she’s scary, but it’s a cute scary."
32752,Raj,"uh, you have to take the pin out."
30336,Raj,i don’t care! and why don’t you think i can find a woman for myself?
33995,Raj,"i don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
30057,Raj,prostitute.
31352,Raj,but it says eight a.m.
30854,Raj,"oh, man. scooter sucks. he’s the aquaman of the muppet babies."
33448,Raj,"no, i’m actually dating two women. later."
32632,Raj,"you know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
32231,Raj,"yeah, grow up, howard. god."
32187,Raj,"wait, so star wars and star trek characters can go on the same branch?"
30469,Raj,"hey, i didn’t even mention dum dum dugan or green goblin, matt murdock, pepper potts, victor von doom, oh, and worst of all, millie the model."
34089,Raj,"i can’t feel my fingers, hurry up. "
30290,Raj,"wait, what are you doing? i can’t scissors by myself! howard! come back!"
30511,Raj,then let go of the ring and go.
32719,Raj,"i don’t know. this old pen kind of proves gravity. when i tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off."
29590,Raj,"sorry, mommy, papa, but with all due respect i really can’t go through…"
33904,Raj,"go ahead, make jokes. i don’t know why you think you’re going to comic-con, you just had a baby."
30688,Raj,no.
32128,Raj,not even to sleep?
30638,Raj,penis first?
32086,Raj,that is so beautiful.
34186,Raj,that’s pretty.
31047,Raj,"hey! that’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. leonard may have defiled one, but i won’t have you talking smack about the other."
31225,Raj,he’s probably right.
33133,Raj,how many sips of that beer did he have?
33928,Raj,"but i can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
33064,Raj,"hey, leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more."
33665,Raj,what? what are you talking about?
33432,Raj,i don’t understand.
29737,Raj,"yes, i’m very hopeful. hello missy.  they mentioned there may be side effects. "
31625,Raj,"oh, my god, here he comes. this is it."
33103,Raj,that’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
30826,Raj,i don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
32623,Raj,"that’s nothing, dude. go check out how hung florida is."
31266,Raj,"ordinary, yet i sense it is dripping with magical potential."
31617,Raj,"ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt."
31203,Raj,"i just got her a couple of things. she gives me things, too."
31329,Raj,"you know, if i had a week off, i’d go back to the two bunch palms resort and spa in the desert. i tell you, an hour on the massage table with trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
32948,Raj,"i would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. they would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around."
30451,Raj,why wouldn’t you take penny?
31535,Raj,"oh, my god, you’re back. oh, look at you. you, you look like you grew."
32092,Raj,"oh. you poor thing. you have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach. "
32673,Raj,really?
31875,Raj,"i broke down, and i read lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, i struck her as a little feminine."
29820,Raj,"so anyway, after a fantastic lunch i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?"
32249,Raj,"uh, what number in line are you?"
32492,Raj,is that a real thing?
30922,Raj,you heard me. i forbidded it.
33720,Raj,"do, uh, howard and bernadette know? or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
31183,Raj,"no, but when i was six years old, i tried to start a boy band called frankie goes to bollywood. but i couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like i’m bragging. sign it in a way that i sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, i had servants."
31854,Raj,i don’t know.
33200,Raj,well what do you want to write?
32888,Raj,"uh w, well, okay, look, i, i don’t want to lie to you. i got curious, i was looking around and i broke the drawer on your night stand."
33887,Raj,"thank you, but if i’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, i might as well keep on relying on my father."
30852,Raj,"oh, great. no superman, no wonder woman? all we’ve got is a skinny flash, an indian aquaman, a nearsighted green lantern, and a teeny, tiny dark knight."
30092,Raj,me either.
31956,Raj,what the? are you crazy? you can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. it makes them socially anxious!
30423,Raj,my incredible hulk hands signed by stan lee.
30619,Raj,that was a lousy suggestion.
29550,Raj,"okay, if no-one else will say it, i will. we really suck at paintball."
32925,Raj,the guy who invented it says it’s jif.
31128,Raj,"aw, there’s a thing."
32949,Raj,you should have told him to mind his own business.
32986,Raj,"it’s, like, the best one they make, i just can’t get it to work."
30715,Raj,"dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about."
33523,Raj,"howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help."
32743,Raj,yup. bye.
30486,Raj,all the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride jet skis. that can’t just be a coincidence.
31873,Raj,do you think i’m feminine?
33943,Raj,"maybe moving in was a bad idea. i haven’t been here one day, i’m already causing problems."
32739,Raj,can we please talk about anything else?
31360,Raj,it’s on like alderaan.
32419,Raj,yeah.
33536,Raj,okay.
33299,Raj,excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
29949,Raj,maybe you could run some computer simulations.
33289,Raj,"yeah, that’s true. in fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it."
33408,Raj,"i think we both know if i come over, we’re gonna get back together and…"
34077,Raj,"like, really, a million?"
32053,Raj,"come on. one more time. yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but i think that works in your favour. do you want a beer?"
33478,Raj,"no, i’m still dating her."
31555,Raj,do you have a preference?
30189,Raj,"oh, beef, i’m going to miss you so much. do you know, at the mumbai mcdonald’s, you can’t get a big mac? all you can get is a chicken maharaja mac. and the special sauce, curry, which, in india,"
30629,Raj,are you willing to risk it?
33845,Raj,i would never call howard.
32616,Raj,"hey, the future they show in back to the future ii is only a year away. a lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet."
30871,Raj,"hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta."
31550,Raj,"before i forget, i’d like your opinion on the menus i’ve prepared for the halloween party. the theme is food that goes bump in the night."
30517,Raj,"so, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
29747,Raj,"i am shiva the destroyer, i will have the woman! "
29865,Raj,"that isn’t klingon, it’s yiddish for meat-filled dumpling."
31349,Raj,"what, you don’t like wind chimes?"
30702,Raj,this is not over.
30358,Raj,"one day, i hold a great ball for the president of france, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. i am embarrassed, so i eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
33692,Raj,"oh, please sit. i tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
30117,Raj,"give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person."
34021,Raj,"hey, what’s up?"
31156,Raj,"i, i nibbled. i was being playful."
32045,Raj,"well, i thought… come on, i didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. and some of those puzzles were really hard and i didn’t know who was gonna get penny."
29752,Raj,don’t start with me dude.
30293,Raj,if she gave you any look at l. it was a you suck look.
32169,Raj,"hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did i tell you how to fix it? no. i said, aw, that must hurt, and i rubbed your belly."
31038,Raj,"okay, let’s see if this drug works."
30344,Raj,wow. wonderful. how old are they?
32580,Raj,"emily, you know almost everybody here."
34000,Raj,"well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
33726,Raj,"well, they already had a village."
33888,Raj,"hello, father. we need to talk."
33895,Raj,how bad is it?
32091,Raj,"as i’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…"
33485,Raj,"boy, it wasn’t this hard with bon jovi. i said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that."
31918,Raj,"not that it’s up to you to make me happy. uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. in which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet."
33667,Raj,there’s nothing to tell.
29619,Raj,"hey guys. this is lalita gupta, lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny. isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more! "
30955,Raj,you ever gonna tell him?
31487,Raj,hello-lo-lo.
31251,Raj,totally you.
33796,Raj,"that’s okay, i’m fine."
30157,Raj,"oh, we’re scientists."
29881,Raj,what are negs?
33494,Raj,"zack, this is my friend claire."
29702,Raj,four.
31792,Raj,you really think so?
33822,Raj,"thank you, howard."
32919,Raj,"uh, yeah, i mean, her serve was pretty good."
32117,Raj,"no, thanks."
32652,Raj,"well, that’s what we wanted. this is as hot as the mines will be."
33258,Raj,how is that both our names?
31811,Raj,"uh, would you like to come in?"
30512,Raj,"fine. um, on the count of three. one, two…"
31639,Raj,"hey, got a minute?"
30555,Raj,"what, suddenly i’m not good enough for you?"
33918,Raj,what’s this?
30869,Raj,no. the moment has passed.
33600,Raj,"the polite response is, thank you for noticing."
30865,Raj,"mm. last night, i had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and i bought matching side-by-side mansions. but there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. what do you think that means?"
31687,Raj,"almost. franken berry, boo berry, sugar bear and the honey nut cheerio bee, i believe his name is buzz."
30874,Raj,"i’ll tell you one thing. if i get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl i want to take on a submarine ride. and yes, that time, i meant it to be dirty."
32451,Raj,"uh, so, you’ll watch it?"
30376,Raj,foamy vengeance.
32576,Raj,you guys kiss and hold hands.
29790,Raj,what about leslie winkle.
31665,Raj,"okay. well, a couple of things. don’t tell them i come from money. i want them to love me for me. they must be insanely hot. like, nines or tens."
29782,Raj,how dare you. aishwarya rai is a goddess. by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute.
32874,Raj,she’s gonna know i was looking in it.
30630,Raj,you don’t know we’re wrong yet.
34007,Raj,bye.
33460,Raj,"okay, that i said. but that’s a real problem. you give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. maybe the other girl, but not her."
33353,Raj,"i’d like to propose a toast to our friend, howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…"
30254,Raj,all right. 
30321,Raj,"actually, in this case, i think she was."
32676,Raj,preach.
30400,Raj,oy.
30657,Raj,"philadelphia. okay, now i get it."
33941,Raj,"you’re right, i am humiliated. thanks for pointing it out. you’re such a jerk."
33114,Raj,she has nothing to do with this. i am my own man.
31985,Raj,you think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
30499,Raj,"no, no, no, the sixth season is great. we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken, and then mr. big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. it’s a wild ride."
32775,Raj,"okay. if i make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
32979,Raj,"yeah, you’re missing the point, sheldon."
21794,Raj,cool.
30031,Raj,"what happened with leslie, why did she dump you?"
33532,Raj,address?
32037,Raj,"oh, congratulations. you’re the first team to arrive."
32465,Raj,"and i have to be honest, i thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
30792,Raj,"it is. if you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you."
32875,Raj,"well, there’s a question i better have a good answer to before she gets back."
29812,Raj,"hey guys, what’s up?"
34051,Raj,"come on, sheldon. amy’s only gone for a few months. and now that i’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
32762,Raj,"mmm. amy, that pudding was delicious."
33074,Raj,we don’t have any of those.
33302,Raj,so?
33257,Raj,"so i was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."
34005,Raj,does this place look familiar?
31634,Raj,that’s called a fashion choice.
30967,Raj,there’s no reason to worry.
31213,Raj,"so, what’s gonna happen next? are you and bernadette going to break up?"
31415,Raj,"oh, my goodness. aren’t you the cutest little yorkie ever? you got him for me?"
32362,Raj,stuart? are you okay?
31279,Raj,you were in the middle of an erection.
33763,Raj,"oh, great, now i can say things like i can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? yes, i’ll still help you move."
29913,Raj,in more ways than one. he’s a very handsome man.
33111,Raj,i still love it. i just think there’s room for improvement.
30544,Raj,"i’m just asking, dude. it happens."
33470,Raj,"you know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life game of thrones."
30712,Raj,"alright, this goes without saying, but i’m just going to say it anyway. hands off my sister."
32011,Raj,why are you on a diet?
32114,Raj,"yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so i wanted to do something to let her know i was thinking about her."
33484,Raj,"nothing to worry about. people meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. i met bon jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. turns out, total sweetheart."
33207,Raj,"hey, dude, trent just checked in at the coffee shop on fair oaks."
34016,Raj,that’s nice. i haven’t had much success meeting people online.
32242,Raj,sure. we’ve both been in his shoes. we’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
34069,Raj,"uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into sheldon."
30133,Raj,hallway. 
31496,Raj,"now, don’t blame yourself. he was a groveller from way back. but the point is, the two of you got past it. and, leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? that was some weak tea, dude."
32801,Raj,"all right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
30918,Raj,"oh, don’t be such gloomy gusses. look at the size of these shrimp! at what point do we start calling them lobsters?"
30467,Raj,you called it.
29979,Raj,"whatever it is, i’m guessing we’re doing it wrong."
33106,Raj,cute? it’s not cute. cute is children dressed as vegetables.
33761,Raj,excuse me.
31444,Raj,"oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when leonard and i took howard to las vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. of all the howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!"
32081,Raj,you want a tums?
30680,Raj,yes?
32960,Raj,and he’s all white.
31869,Raj,"oh. i always thought, if i had a white name, it would be gavin."
32880,Raj,she does.
30851,Raj,stupid aquaman.
32500,Raj,thanks for skipping the movie. i couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about emily and that guy.
30485,Raj,"okay, that’s a lot of money. the wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. like a jet ski."
30661,Raj,"oh, god, never again."
31545,Raj,"okay, uh, will i get to see you tomorrow?"
33341,Raj,"before emily, i was alone for so long. i just, i don’t know if i can do that again."
33521,Raj,"oh, if it’s even the u.s. military. it could be foreign military pretending to be american."
33512,Raj,you’re right. you realize what this means?
32269,Raj,"uh, maybe it’ll come up when i apply for citizenship. oh, crap, what if it comes up when i apply for citizenship? "
31944,Raj,"nope. it’s exactly as lousy as advertised. speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. i was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
31557,Raj,i was thinking of dressing up as indiana jones’ mocha-skinned love child. indian jones.
31399,Raj,i like to boogie.
32181,Raj,"hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
29762,Raj,"dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
30128,Raj,how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
33821,Raj,"okay, maybe we should just end this."
30924,Raj,"clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, mike."
31330,Raj,really? what was i doing to your neck last night while you were playing x-box?
33678,Raj,"uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
32447,Raj,"you know, when cinnamon won’t take her medicine, i hide it in a piece of cheese."
30653,Raj,potty is innocent. potty is adorable.
33311,Raj,"actually, that’s why i’m calling. i, um, i just, i need to let you know that i have a girlfriend."
31837,Raj,"yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while."
29778,Raj,not until now. 
32271,Raj,i thought you were a badass.
29952,Raj,"hang on, hang on. there’s a 7-eleven here. we smuggle slurpies, which are essentially icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
33469,Raj,"all right, it’s almost game time. get it? game of thrones, game time?"
32897,Raj,"of course. i know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. my uncle was a worshipper of krishna. but after he died, you know what we found? a statue of shiva. it may not be crips and bloods, okay? but in india, it’s a thing."
31315,Raj,"nothing, nothing."
34168,Raj,yes.
33234,Raj,"well, i should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen."
30667,Raj,you’re kidding.
33240,Raj,"uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced."
30333,Raj,"oh, sure, you can tell when sheldon’s upset."
29906,Raj,"you’re lucky. with me, it’s usually the other way around."
33770,Raj,"oh, my god, what happened?"
32104,Raj,there’s a new sports bar over on colorado ave…
31055,Raj,i know.
30693,Raj,no.
33769,Raj,hello.
29680,Raj,"how come on star trek everybody’s private parts are the same. no alien lady ever told captain kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. "
32871,Raj,"what are you, a little kid? is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?"
32502,Raj,"sorry, i left them in my turban."
31103,Raj,more wine?
30931,Raj,"some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. my point is, you can’t go out with leonard."
30537,Raj,"sheldon says impossible. howard and i say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a batmobile."
32666,Raj,you don’t have to bite my head off.
30393,Raj,"oh. i always thought that was some sort of after-christmas sale. well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
31921,Raj,what else have you been thinking about doing?
29520,Raj,"you mean, you don’t."
29886,Raj,i have three words for you. wrath of khan.
33231,Raj,"leonard, i, i’m scared again."
32578,Raj,"well, hey, you’re my dear friends. you’ll get a christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me."
33256,Raj,"yeah, it is. and you know we get to name it."
32633,Raj,"you know, sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
30141,Raj,holy crap. it’s like silence of the lambs down here.  don’t do that!
30017,Raj,that’s right. she’s with us. guys like that are so pathetic.
32830,Raj,"i was distracted. it’s weird seeing a member of the night’s watch with a kayak strapped to his car. come on. hi, excuse me, s, sorry, i, i don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of firefly. and dr. horrible."
30339,Raj,we did it. we have the west coast feed of hbo.
32100,Raj,"it will be. i don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time i use the phrase my bitch, i’m referring to you."
32877,Raj,"dude, the whole front came off. now she’s gonna know i was snooping."
33298,Raj,sure. i love animated movies.
29946,Raj,damn it. i had lysine and changed it.
29970,Raj,"god, i love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
30095,Raj,what are you working on?
31563,Raj,"what do you mean who cares? look at what i pulled off here. the dj’s on fire, there’s a tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my god, the food. stuart wanted kraft draculoni and cheese."
33614,Raj,maybe howard and bernadette said i could be here.
33113,Raj,"no, no. i’m just evolving as a musician. you’re the one who’s stuck in the past."
30082,Raj,we could play outside.
32403,Raj,"it is. but once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion."
33435,Raj,"please, bernadette. let me leave with my dignity."
32857,Raj,"so, what do you guys want to do?"
32560,Raj,what’s wrong with you?
29573,Raj,"all i’ve got is a needler, and i’m all out of ammo. "
32130,Raj,i don’t get it.
33919,Raj,"this is so generous of you, i, um, i don’t know what to say."
30284,Raj,kites ho!
29589,Raj,why are you telling me about my own culture? 
32764,Raj,"oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god."
30733,Raj,i can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
32352,Raj,"i find a girl i like, and you’re stealing her?"
30172,Raj,"when we tell this story, let’s end it differently."
32397,Raj,"well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me."
30634,Raj,"you know, there’s something i’ve always wondered about aquaman."
34121,Raj,you are my heart!
33751,Raj,"well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
34129,Raj,where indeed.
31725,Raj,"so, i found this web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. how awesome is that?"
30740,Raj,"whoa, whoa, whoa! i don’t want to speak to the fbi."
29580,Raj,"no, no, not like haroun and tanweer."
31108,Raj,"well, uh, to paraphrase shakespeare, it’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
30579,Raj,the cosmological physicist from princeton?
30420,Raj,"जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. that’s hindi for whatever floats your boat. uh, listen, i got a text from that girl abby, and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again. what do you say?"
29793,Raj,technically it would only be rebound if he and penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
33716,Raj,sure.
33693,Raj,"that depends, do they have mexican food in cuba?"
33538,Raj,what are you talking about? they’ve always known where you live.
31882,Raj,just tell me which one you think is more manly. this hockey jersey or this football jersey.
31527,Raj,"hey, you already got a girlfriend. i call dibs."
33315,Raj,"i knew it. okay, we did have a vibe. this is exciting. what’s my next move?"
32943,Raj,"well, they’re looking to include a message from earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
31516,Raj,"do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?"
31600,Raj,"i don’t want to be a ninja, i want to be a cat burglar."
32108,Raj,"yeah, it’s nothing to cry about."
30534,Raj,"all right. you’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in sheldon square."
30589,Raj,it is if you love her and give her a name.
31192,Raj,"whatever, dude. she kissed me."
31953,Raj,"well, you’re very pretty. that could be intimidating to another woman."
30804,Raj,i did shut up. now you shut up.
32765,Raj,"i can’t take it, dude."
33509,Raj,you can’t make me feel bad.
30477,Raj,"hold on. sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
30747,Raj,"of course not. i’m here on an h-1b visa, which means i can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. and i’m not."
30880,Raj,what did i do?
29985,Raj,"no, you didn’t. i did."
32036,Raj,"oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt."
31291,Raj,i bet it is. why don’t women like me?
34083,Raj,"ooh, she’s standing very close to me. oh my, she does smell good. what is that, vanilla?"
31760,Raj,"well, i, i really couldn’t. but, uh, i’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst."
31500,Raj,"oh come on, you know you want to say it. say it. say you love him. say it!"
32153,Raj,i’m in.
31880,Raj,"i was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, sir elton john."
31143,Raj,it’s getting beautiful again.
31076,Raj,"she’s kidding, right?"
33948,Raj,"howard? howard? it’s me, it’s just me. "
33062,Raj,"not yet, this is fun. ooh, i know. i’d let her free my willy. where you going?"
34024,Raj,"sheldon, what did amy have that attracted you?"
34080,Raj,we’re being ridiculous. there’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce sheldon cooper.
30798,Raj,hey.
30603,Raj,"it’s not like that, i’m watching someone’s tv. the good wife is on. i tell you, this is my new grey’s anatomy."
29677,Raj,"hey, look at that.  it’s dennis kim."
33874,Raj,just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that i’m spoiled.
33275,Raj,"okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology."
32449,Raj,"actually, how do you feel about watching house of 1000 corpses?"
29827,Raj,"oh, you’re welcome. of course, i couldn’t get you into the vip section, because, you know, that’s for vips, and you guys are just, you know, ps."
30987,Raj,"i am making her comfortable. besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway."
33914,Raj,"oh, double stuffed oreos, i remember when i could afford you."
30297,Raj,"really? the only thing i’ve learned in the last two hours is that american men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
32589,Raj,we were having a conversation about past lovers.
31855,Raj,"come on, daddy. all the other scientists have seat warmers. this is so humiliating. i’ve got to get tenure. okay, let’s meet halfway. how about i cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? looks like we’re both going to be living like animals."
31094,Raj,this says you can make end of life decisions for me.
31419,Raj,"oh, boy, sheldon’s going to freak out."
32731,Raj,"well, you could be very frugal. i’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm."
32501,Raj,you don’t have to make me anything.
31069,Raj,hell hounds. who let the satanic dogs out? who? who-who?
34053,Raj,"well, here’s your key back."
29661,Raj,she was sleeping with you?
29648,Raj,you did what you had to do. 
31859,Raj,"you two should be ashamed of yourselves. using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever amy plans on doing."
32879,Raj,with what?
31320,Raj,"all right, um, how about, oh, how about rocket man?"
31480,Raj,yoo-hoo! over here!
31144,Raj,screw you. that was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
31966,Raj,"she is. she’s just running a little late. you know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. she’ll be here. just give it a rest, okay?"
29660,Raj,we can’t send him back to north korea. he knows how to get out. 
32970,Raj,what?
30940,Raj,i’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful sheldon-free evening.
30903,Raj,what?
31070,Raj,i got a colossal serpent right here.
32214,Raj,"i almost met someone last night, but i blew it. i was walking cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute i panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?"
33455,Raj,"oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. can’t even remember what that’s like."
32518,Raj,"well, i mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours."
32689,Raj,like who?
34131,Raj,"hey, look who decided to show up."
31358,Raj,"yeah. start saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
31960,Raj,"okay. i know. it was me. i, i pushed too hard. i’m sorry."
30304,Raj,"the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang, an indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from new delhi. it took me a day to put together and two days to paint. this is hello kitty."
30994,Raj,are you listening to this guy?
33322,Raj,"yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work."
33502,Raj,why would you do that? i specifically asked you not to do that.
29656,Raj,go away. 
33685,Raj,i think you’re very nice as well.
30256,Raj,"hey, how come i wasn’t part of this deal?"
31052,Raj,i’m taking a stroll and i’m sporting wood.
30749,Raj,"please don’t send me back to india, it’s so crowded. it’s like the whole country is one endless comic-con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, indian guy."
30899,Raj,"no, no, no, don’t say that. you’re going to be all right."
33202,Raj,okay. i posted it.
32371,Raj,"very good, bernadette. you are a regular byomkesh bakshi."
32320,Raj,"while showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters."
32757,Raj,"don’t blow too hard. if you pop him, i will vomit."
30782,Raj,"dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"
29570,Raj,i can’t see him.
31651,Raj,"mine just took me to his gynecology office. i got so bored, i’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend i was ice-skating."
30777,Raj,miss.
29842,Raj,"hey, leonard, did you see my limo downstairs."
33286,Raj,"you know, sheldon…"
33815,Raj,"howard, get out."
33715,Raj,"it’s a human emotion, sheldon. everyone gets jealous. i’m jealous of leonard and penny and howard and bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
32996,Raj,"just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
31907,Raj,"well, i trusted you, and you let me down. the poor thing’s been shaking for hours."
30042,Raj,"hello, michaela."
31699,Raj,"well, this is all your fault."
30668,Raj,he takes the kitty to the potty?
31400,Raj,w-w-with women. i like to boogie with women.
33120,Raj,"thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
30022,Raj,"come on, you know i can’t talk to women unless i’m lit up like the hindu festival of diwali."
29889,Raj,"oh, snap."
31638,Raj,i didn’t pick up on that. that’s a nice touch.
31423,Raj,"three times. he begged the fox network not to cancel firefly. he begged the tnt network to cancel babylon 5. and when he got food poisoning at the rose bowl parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly."
30554,Raj,"oh, please, we all know i’m the friend you call when you have no other options. if we were the justice league, i’d be aquaman."
32720,Raj,poor roger abbott.
31517,Raj,no problem. my treat. i’ll swing by after work.
32692,Raj,did you go to your prom?
33012,Raj,what a baby.
30508,Raj,"yeah, meemaw did the nasty."
32754,Raj,"dude, it’s not breathing."
29929,Raj,"i’m curious, what part of america is that accent from?"
33306,Raj,"hey, it’s not my fault if american women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes."
31049,Raj,check it! howard pulls one out from under the bridge. nice!
30745,Raj,seven years.
32746,Raj,hey.
33330,Raj,"yeah, i think so. do you have any advice?"
31193,Raj,"oh, fine. let’s agree she kissed both of us."
32521,Raj,"okay. please. so, uh, you, you have tattoos?"
30790,Raj,"hello, hawaii. this is dr. koothrappali in pasadena. i’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. scarlett johansson’s house! i’m kidding, hawaii. mahalo. whoo!"
29655,Raj,the… the picture’s breaking up. 
30065,Raj,interesting. penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
33672,Raj,mm-hmm.
32113,Raj,"ah, i’m making a necklace for my mom. "
30913,Raj,"no. we are very wealthy. but the only difference is, we have more servants."
32847,Raj,what? i don’t need science to win her heart. i have my family’s wealth for that.
31316,Raj,"ooh, ooh! what about we make your astronaut nickname howard “buzz” wolowitz?"
33729,Raj,"well i don’t know if you realize this, but i bought that crib."
31200,Raj,"yeah, that’s good. keep telling yourself that. "
31883,Raj,"good, black is more slimming. oh, that’s her. i got to go be butch. toodles. hey."
32126,Raj,oh gets better.
29933,Raj,"but, sheldon, we don’t have a chance. the only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
31326,Raj,gamma.
29794,Raj,"i bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  and he told me his name was kimberley!"
32348,Raj,"i give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
33335,Raj,please take me back. our love was meant to be.
30405,Raj,"come on, let’s get a drink."
32115,Raj,they’re just having a little trouble communicating. my dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
29723,Raj,why?
30941,Raj,sheldon tells it better.
30037,Raj,but she did dump you.
30470,Raj,"fantastic four, daredevil, invincible iron man, happy hogan, curt connors…"
31190,Raj,"if you were me, would you kiss her?"
33551,Raj,"to a white guy born here, no. if you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
31281,Raj,"i stopped on the way to work. hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
31991,Raj,"well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas."
32499,Raj,yes.
33555,Raj,"well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer."
33702,Raj,come on. what do you say? let me make it up to you.
30651,Raj,it’s a potty. what do you call it?
31433,Raj,"i’ve been doing some research on strippers. one agency i spoke to, said i could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs."
31752,Raj,cool. did she discover a cure for something?
31668,Raj,"great. i bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
30914,Raj,"more than we can use. you see, in india, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."
31816,Raj,i lied. i love them. i only said that so you’d go out with me.
32950,Raj,what makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
32330,Raj,"i thought about what you said last night, and i went back on the dating web site and i was looking at this girl’s profile. she’s amazing."
33908,Raj,i have no choice.
32139,Raj,"oh, can i show her an oil painting i made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
33712,Raj,"well, i’m glad to see you moving forward."
31431,Raj,he got us again.
33192,Raj,they exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
32253,Raj,"hey, since sheldon’s not going to comic-con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
30453,Raj,i know. i saw the tweet.
30970,Raj,i totally had one of those.
30480,Raj,is it eddie crispo?
33841,Raj,okay. you ladies have fun tonight.
30378,Raj,here comes kripke!
33263,Raj,that is a great idea.
32035,Raj,"okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
34025,Raj,really?
30076,Raj,"if you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte."
30369,Raj,i thought it was funny.
30525,Raj,i’m not going to punch you.
34090,Raj,we brought food.
33670,Raj,"yes, in the telescope room."
31371,Raj,i’ll let you know.
30067,Raj,"i’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny."
31112,Raj,hey.
30280,Raj,"okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! now, come on, sheldon, finish him off!"
30325,Raj,"well, that was rather unpleasant."
32952,Raj,"okay, that sounds good."
33677,Raj,"oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
34140,Raj,no!
33277,Raj,what are you doing?
29851,Raj,"now you listen to me, i am no longer a child, and i will not be spoken to like one. now if you’d excuse me, i have to go throw up."
32040,Raj,i invited you to my murder mystery party.
31224,Raj,you should’ve seen your face.
29771,Raj,"adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the t in often? "
32157,Raj,"hey, guys, i’m trying to cook in here."
32626,Raj,not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
29797,Raj,"okay, we’re all set."
31931,Raj,"uh, yeah, sorry. she’s just a little shy. the first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."
32290,Raj,moo-stache.
33778,Raj,have you tried anything to fix it?
29542,Raj,"oh, god, look at this buffet. i love america."
30813,Raj,"you don’t like mouse boy? how about, uh, uh, kid vermin?"
30835,Raj,you realize you can’t win.
33400,Raj,"right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, i’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. but it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything."
30966,Raj,"oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. i’m not going to be your go-between."
31838,Raj,of course.
31216,Raj,"hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the borg queen in first contact?"
34176,Raj,me
29614,Raj,i can’t believe i’m sitting here next to little lalita gupta. 
30412,Raj,"not so loud, but ideally, yes. thanks."
30797,Raj,where?
29629,Raj,"go ahead, tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren."
31512,Raj,oh. something about latin music just makes me feel like i’m on a white sand beach in rio.
33565,Raj,"well, i didn’t get to see you last night. it was the least i could do."
32645,Raj,huh. all this time i never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
30379,Raj,i believe that’s the president of the university.
30717,Raj,okay then.
32838,Raj,"although, i knew the line, doesn’t make me nathan fillion."
31403,Raj,"hey, uh, can i run something by you? it’s about lakshmi."
32055,Raj,"my parents’ money. uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
32522,Raj,i don’t. i have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
30190,Raj,yeah let me start practicing for it. do you want fries with that maharaja mac?”
31378,Raj,it means i like women as well as their skincare products.
29766,Raj,"and the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there. "
30660,Raj,"well, if that’s the case, penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
30784,Raj,i do appreciate that.
32619,Raj,"he’s right. also, what kind of name is biff? sounds like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough. biff."
32279,Raj,"as if valentine’s day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? and with cheap chocolate, no less?"
32140,Raj,"good, good. ‘cause no matter how hard i try, i cannot get the twins to look alike."
31115,Raj,"why do you care so much? you’re dating my sister, and penny and i are in love."
33317,Raj,"not me. ever since you admitted we had a vibe, i’ve been planning our wedding."
31867,Raj,"she said she recently went on a date with a guy named roger? and he’s indian? and he’s an astrophysicist, too?"
31035,Raj,that’s not the point.
30685,Raj,one more time?
30385,Raj,"what you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at mario kart."
33828,Raj,"well, i want to make sure we get invited to all the parades. "
30243,Raj,you are not my superior.
33794,Raj,"i don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason."
33740,Raj,"all right, hold on. i’m gonna drive like we do in india. get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
32356,Raj,"uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."
29610,Raj,"you’re right. i… i am talking to you. hello penny, how are you?"
30954,Raj,"son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!"
32749,Raj,"all i’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. it. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now i have to hear the two of you? and who cares who’s smarter? if it’s leonard or me or, you know, it’s christmas, let’s say it’s howard."
29539,Raj,you might be bound by them right now.
31790,Raj,what is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
33326,Raj,spending valentine’s day with emily.
33777,Raj,"yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from walking dead into a lullaby. "
31471,Raj,"right now, howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny jewish greek god. zeusowitz."
34103,Raj,hello.
32085,Raj,why is that great news?
32405,Raj,"oh, my goodness."
30184,Raj,sorry. i lost my cool.
30495,Raj,it’s all of ours. 
30663,Raj,that’s very offensive.
30370,Raj,you laughed.
29546,Raj,oh dear.
30864,Raj,so it spells sheldon?
31240,Raj,"yes, please. this is way better than the movie."
31363,Raj,"here you go. i’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
29616,Raj,"you have lost so much weight! that must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! do you remember?"
34109,Raj,and she was my second cousin.
31206,Raj,"my parents are making me choose between money and you. i choose you.  and that necklace, yeah, that, too. but none of those things matter, because we have something better. we have love."
30322,Raj,yeah.
33838,Raj,whoa. just trying to help.
33393,Raj,"no, i kind of feel like being alone right now."
30925,Raj,no!
29682,Raj,okay. first order of physics bowl business. we need a truly kick-ass team name. suggestions.
33851,Raj,"okay, yes, i will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
30816,Raj,"oh, hey."
29663,Raj,"oh, yes. there was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. "
33510,Raj,he’s got him there. the d even stands for department.
30404,Raj,did you really have to bring it in with you?
31034,Raj,i’m not sure. some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
32472,Raj,and if you’re not in the mood for coffee i can always make you a chai tea-3po.
33132,Raj,"whoa, whoa. walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work."
32516,Raj,"uh, look, you and i haven’t made any commitments to each other."
31763,Raj,sure.
33797,Raj,"i’m not a virgin, sheldon."
34042,Raj,without me.
30834,Raj,"no, uh-uh, you’re going down!"
33889,Raj,"i have come to an important decision. i will not be accepting your money any more. i’m a man, and i can take care of myself."
30088,Raj,"well, i’m a hindu. my religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. three months at the north pole with sheldon and i’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"
29612,Raj,overdo what? happiness? freedom? this warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
30281,Raj,"what are you waiting for? kill wil wheaton! from hell’s heart, stab at him!"
30584,Raj,"maybe, but i don’t care. that’s the great thing about nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. i call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
30706,Raj,that’s what she said.
31486,Raj,"my pleasure. waiter? a bottle of champagne and three glasses. oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?"
30204,Raj,"thank you, sir. "
34018,Raj,you should send that to jimmy fallon.
31132,Raj,"no, no. after we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if i had protection."
31787,Raj,"oh, yeah, think about it. we’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. it’d be like the best relationship ever."
29969,Raj,"you always say that, but we never do."
30148,Raj,"no, i’m behind on my wiki-reading i’m kind of on a john grisham kick right now."
31656,Raj,"but, a cannon? am i really out of the game?"
32559,Raj,"aw, you brought cookies for everyone?"
32863,Raj,"oh, okay. uh, brothers and sisters i have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. who am i looking at? yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. calm down."
30000,Raj,"let’s find out. leonard, ready?"
32727,Raj,"i was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of hubble’s law. i keep seeing the number 90 repeating. that could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."
33549,Raj,yeah. this military guy showed up at howard’s door. he was terrifying.
33089,Raj,i don’t know. maybe jughead’s a terminator.
33721,Raj,"okay, cool."
30968,Raj,i’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend sanjay.
30522,Raj,"okay, sheldon. i’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. these methods come from the ancient gurus of india and have helped me overcome my own fears."
29973,Raj,we hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
30070,Raj,you mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
33119,Raj,what took you so long?
32456,Raj,"all right, let’s get this over with. ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it."
31072,Raj,"really, ten miles? you’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? moron."
34084,Raj,"she’s so chatty. maybe my parents are right. maybe i’d be better off with an indian girl. we’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. "
30799,Raj,"oh, you know. same old, same old. looked through a telescope, saw some stars. big whoop."
30824,Raj,it’s easy. the spider’s crawling up your arm.
31602,Raj,"but next time, we’ll be cat burglars."
30929,Raj,are you sure? that doesn’t sound right.
29608,Raj,and it’s about to tell my parents that i’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta. 
30654,Raj,if i don’t have to boom-boom.
32071,Raj,like a hero.
29887,Raj,"actually, i was just checking my e-mail. but, uh, no, the rover is not responding."
32491,Raj,thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. aren’t you gonna get 3-d glasses?
33537,Raj,that’s not him.
32038,Raj,your next puzzle is a riddle. and who better to give it to you than the riddler?
31786,Raj,"you know, you and i have so much fun hanging out. if you were a girl, all our problems would be solved."
33307,Raj,"uh, it’s hard to say. i think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if emily’s really the right person for me. i mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"
30676,Raj,you have a desk.
31933,Raj,"you don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
32959,Raj,"well, my feelings were real when he was about to die."
30438,Raj,how long can he keep this up?
30164,Raj,in my fanny pack.
32744,Raj,"hey, what’s going on?"
33771,Raj,"you know, in india when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. not always, sometimes we’d leave."
31484,Raj,i don’t understand.
33312,Raj,"well, no, no. i, i didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out."
30355,Raj,"it’s your american accent. everything you say sounds stupid.  stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
31150,Raj,"come on, dude. this is my sister you’re talking about."
30356,Raj,"if i could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and i would be their king."
31876,Raj,i have to talk to her about this.
29624,Raj,"oh, screw princess punchali."
31993,Raj,"that’s so much better than the old, ugly ones."
31847,Raj,"yeah, me neither. it should be about the work. and if i can’t get tenure, i’d like to see you or sheldon get it."
29563,Raj,we could cut it into thirds. 
33554,Raj,"fine, i’ll put it on facebook like a caveman."
31934,Raj,why would you leave like that?
30496,Raj,sure. let go of the ring.
30510,Raj,"it’s, it’s not working, dude."
29561,Raj,"oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from. "
29625,Raj,but you’re not princess punchali.
33444,Raj,and i like to think i helped.
33097,Raj,"so i have an idea for a filk song. it’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
30652,Raj,"that’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?"
30421,Raj,i don’t get it. you had a great time.
29837,Raj,"it was in the limo. they sent a limo. i have a limo. i just love saying limo. here, sip on this while you’re getting ready."
32513,Raj,"maybe. i, i don’t know.it’s late, i should, i should go. look, i do get what you’re saying. instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, i need to work on my fear of being alone."
30765,Raj,"oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in."
30641,Raj,"all right, uh, forget pulling. how about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"
29963,Raj,"if anybody cares, i still have to pee."
30580,Raj,holy crap!  holy crap!
32933,Raj,"okay, you got me there. you here looking for money?"
32178,Raj,"howard, listen to me. you’re a great husband. yes, your listening skills could use some work. but it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
33636,Raj,"hey, show her the trunk. show her the trunk."
32111,Raj,thank you.
31677,Raj,"nope. i guess the heart wants what the heart wants. or in this case, doesn’t, i mean, at all. what?"
30360,Raj,"i know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
32828,Raj,so should we go talk to him?
32452,Raj,you’re a good friend. i owe you one.
32415,Raj,"thank you. thanks, thanks. i’m sorry. i can’t do this. my, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and i’m seeing her saturday, and i’m glad you like it, it’s from j. crew."
31728,Raj,no.
32296,Raj,"uh, off. and on. and the oprah network. this is so much better than watching tv like a muggle."
33738,Raj,i’ll pull the van up.
30614,Raj,the dating site matched a woman with sheldon.
33188,Raj,"you know, i read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. the key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes."
30202,Raj,"it’s a little early, isn’t it?"
30487,Raj,there are no jewish hobbits.
29841,Raj,dude.
33628,Raj,you coming?
32226,Raj,"okay, nice talking to you."
30741,Raj,i’m brown and i talk funny.
31238,Raj,hummingbirds are pretty.
32615,Raj,"boy, when you met bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
33824,Raj,maybe i won’t settle down. maybe i’ll just play the field.
31270,Raj,"hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?"
29691,Raj,why? because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney? 
30881,Raj,i did. you said no bridget jones.
33369,Raj,thank you. that’s why i say keaton’s number one. he brought a sense of humour to the role.
29594,Raj,"okay, i know what i’m going to do."
33829,Raj,"yeah. well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
31856,Raj,unbelievable. you have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
30710,Raj,"hey guys, guess who i found at lax. my baby sister priya."
33878,Raj,i don’t want to say.
33920,Raj,"as much as i appreciate this, i can’t accept it, okay? halley’s my goddaughter, i don’t take care of her for money."
33780,Raj,did that do anything?
31268,Raj,"can’t you just enjoy the wonder, sheldon? why must you peek behind the curtain? or up the butt?"
29605,Raj,"where did my life go, penny? one day i’m a carefree batchelor, and the next i’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi. "
33142,Raj,you may want to leave the room.
29869,Raj,marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
30205,Raj,"well, i ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
32062,Raj,"oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. jenny309. i hope that’s not her weight. "
33071,Raj,"uh, okay, let’s see. they’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea."
32486,Raj,"if she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?"
32821,Raj,"yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
29937,Raj,"go, monte! go monte!"
30964,Raj,"okay, i see where this is going. fine, i’ll have sex with him."
34001,Raj,"yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
31173,Raj,"tell her it doesn’t matter. tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
32490,Raj,so the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
33375,Raj,"i know. i mean, do i open it? do i return it?"
32138,Raj,can i tell her i miss her?
30927,Raj,why are you holding hands? i forbid you to hold hands.
29895,Raj,during which she defected to north korea.
33958,Raj,"well, no offence, but i didn’t go to art school. i have a phd in astrophysics."
29696,Raj,what did they give you?
31657,Raj,"wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? because if you’ve got one, i need it bad. get in here with your rod and give it to me."
30044,Raj,"not now, leonard, michaela’s inviting me to a party. you better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."
31236,Raj,"come on, sheldon, star wars."
30025,Raj,"oh, okay, okay, my turn. are you in the six star wars movies?"
30581,Raj,when can i sit with you again?
33439,Raj,can i squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
33130,Raj,my name is little orphan annie. you killed my father. prepare to die.
34065,Raj,"i keep telling you, close the bathroom door."
31045,Raj,"oh, derived from the word angel. appropriate."
31387,Raj,and this is howard.
31261,Raj,"hey, i won a newcomb medal, too."
30220,Raj,all right.
32444,Raj,get it? because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
32581,Raj,"and this is leonard, this is penny."
33043,Raj,"look, i care about you a lot, but we are very different people."
30124,Raj,that’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
30155,Raj,goth food.
31996,Raj,"uh, excuse me, mrs. davis?"
33264,Raj,"so, uh, what were you thinking? combine their names?"
32067,Raj,"this is the worst. if we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
34113,Raj,"hey, those are my lima beans!"
33942,Raj,what do i have to be happy about? my life’s a wreck.
31336,Raj,like what?
33519,Raj,you can’t ignore it. it’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
31437,Raj,"hey, everybody! the bachelor boy has arrived! for he’s a jolly good fellow…"
31461,Raj,"well, i know how to make it special."
33783,Raj,"okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
33498,Raj,"i mean, come on, look at you. you’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. next to you, i look like me."
30867,Raj,what are you talking about?
31641,Raj,"howard, that’s not how we practiced it."
33328,Raj,"you mean the strong, sexy angel i can’t stop thinking about? who can say?"
34086,Raj,"hey. sorry i’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
33233,Raj,"uh, i’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. you’re more than welcome to join me."
31111,Raj,to friendship.
21792,Raj,you’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
33528,Raj,"i, i think he wants us to pull over."
33028,Raj,"i guess i’m just more of a pottery barn, crate and barrel kind of guy. maybe pier 1 if i really want to cut loose."
31165,Raj,i don’t know if i want to play anymore.
29938,Raj,"no one’s arguing with you, dude."
31827,Raj,"excuse me, i’m meeting a girl here. it’s kind of our first date."
33205,Raj,"he is so cool. hey, no hard feelings, but i’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him."
31678,Raj,"amy, i’m really sorry. i didn’t mean to upset you."
29704,Raj,two.
34187,Raj,"have her get season two. season one, it was still finding itself."
33617,Raj,shall we toast?
30380,Raj,"well, how could you not put in an abort?"
34150,Raj,hey.
32691,Raj,"oh, yeah, i got that evite. ever since i saw pretty in pink, i’ve wanted to go to an american prom. but then i saw carrie, and i did not want to go to an american prom. but then i saw never been kissed, and i’m back on the prom bandwagon. this prom thing’s been a real roller coaster."
32784,Raj,why?
31357,Raj,you know what would be great? let’s do it like the old days.
33858,Raj,"and j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is princess bride."
30121,Raj,"just fine? oh, dude, the fourth harry potter movie was just fine."
34124,Raj,who is it?
31050,Raj,"oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places."
33606,Raj,"okay, well, that’s a problem."
33917,Raj,"thank you, but it doesn’t look like i’m going to comic-con this year."
33087,Raj,"hey, look, the lug nut’s off."
31593,Raj,i think it’s an old storage room.
32629,Raj,no way. not bill murray.
34153,Raj,what is wrong with you?
33254,Raj,"come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."
32769,Raj,space ice is no joke. i can’t even watch frozen anymore.
30346,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
30542,Raj,maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with penny.
29615,Raj,"little lalita. that’s kind of fun to say. little lalita, little lalita, little lalita, you should try it."
30762,Raj,"well i earned it, dude, i ate all my broccoli."
29976,Raj,you know what i’m thinking? i’m thinking howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. i’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
29927,Raj,what difference does it make? fat is fat.
30186,Raj,"so, my visa’s only good as long as i’m employed at the university, and when they find out i’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. by the way, when i say squat, i mean diddly-squat. i wish i had squat."
33023,Raj,"yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
31726,Raj,"yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. you can even choose your accessories."
34100,Raj,it’s hot in here. must be summer.
31818,Raj,"oh, i totally am. if it wasn’t for this beer, i couldn’t even talk to you right now. i’m a wreck. there are many things seriously wrong with me. and not quirks, either. like, diagnosable psychological problems. maybe brain damage."
31195,Raj,how dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
31754,Raj,"way to make lemonade. you know, from around the corner where fudge is made."
33333,Raj,"you’re right, let’s talk again in a few days."
32668,Raj,oh. is it amy?
30394,Raj,no. we would just walk around and see what’s what.
30429,Raj,"not tso the chicken, so the question. so?"
32969,Raj,this is great.
34158,Raj,"hey, there."
32799,Raj,i may not be liking this game so much.
30982,Raj,don’t say your doom. who opens the door for their doom?
31521,Raj,what’s the big deal? you guys are bringing your girlfriends. i didn’t want to sit by myself.
31367,Raj,"bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. you’re in charge of healing all of us, not just howard."
32345,Raj,"hey, you busy?"
30294,Raj,"oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. you don’t have a hammy."
33480,Raj,"it’s, it’s beautiful."
30097,Raj,"so, who’s up for a movie?"
29693,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
33189,Raj,"no, seriously. it’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. it’s about, it’s about simply being."
31301,Raj,"hey, don’t talk to her like that. she’s a lady."
30730,Raj,"okay, i’m good."
31581,Raj,wow. an end of an era.
33580,Raj,"i think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. so, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
31364,Raj,"hey, i plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
33739,Raj,"team baby, go."
31945,Raj,"let’s see. six. that’s pretty cool, i have six friends. kind of like sinatra."
32299,Raj,"a second trip to space, i’ll miss you."
30503,Raj,"i think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. from what i know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies."
32454,Raj,"hey. listen to this. murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."
32524,Raj,"it’s, uh, been a long time since i’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder."
30020,Raj,why?
33535,Raj,very well.
31615,Raj,it’s the atomic number for technetium.
33327,Raj,"oh, i am, i am. i, i guess i’m still wondering if emily and i are right for each other."
33016,Raj,really? i don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. you know mummy and her crazy imagination i’m so lucky i take after you.
32101,Raj,"wait, i don’t understand. they didn’t find the element?"
30821,Raj,no. but it’s a stupid test.
32790,Raj,"you see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? it’s called a sikhara. it symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
30559,Raj,"don’t flatter yourself, dude. i want to go out and meet a woman."
29961,Raj,i should’ve peed before we left.
30221,Raj,"come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years."
29998,Raj,non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
31178,Raj,"really? ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
29796,Raj,sure.
29604,Raj,"great, then we’ll get married, i won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. "
33411,Raj,"as a matter of fact, i do. i’m gonna comfort her, because i’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
29637,Raj,please wait until i get into the hall. 
34133,Raj,"good morning, sheldon."
32102,Raj,"oh, that’s a big deal."
33183,Raj,i don’t sound like that.
30926,Raj,"it’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. if you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! all right, you may talk in the bedroom, but i want this door to remain open! all right, just this once you may close the door. but keep in mind i’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  priya, this is your brother. when you get this, tell leonard to check his voicemail."
32984,Raj,"yeah. like when you took sheldon to texas and showed him all around nasa, you didn’t even think to ask me and leonard."
31751,Raj,"well, then, i should tell you i broke the wheel and the handle. so, is everyone from bernadette’s company going to vegas?"
29613,Raj,okay.
29726,Raj,"three hundred, and i’ll throw in my original 1979 mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effects. "
33571,Raj,how can you be embarrassed around me? i’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
33892,Raj,"yeah, that’s right. keep asking yourself that. but i still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will."
33998,Raj,you’re not going to prison.
33984,Raj,when did he leave?
32477,Raj,it was just a suggestion.
31101,Raj,"he’s living at my place, so i’m living here."
32149,Raj,"i don’t believe you, you’re lying to me. "
30185,Raj,"okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
31478,Raj,"oh, okay. i’ll just go home and be alone. which is cool. i eat alone, i sleep alone, i cry alone, so, cool."
33370,Raj,"yeah, of course."
32442,Raj,"oh, uh, howard was an astronaut. maybe that’s where you saw him."
31978,Raj,so i guess what i’m saying is i get where lucy’s coming from.
32251,Raj,so that’s it? everything’s sold out?
33897,Raj,i have a card for emergencies that i pay for myself.
31511,Raj,sure. mmm. bossa nova. you listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
31040,Raj,india.
30590,Raj,hi.
30639,Raj,"really? a robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. that’s funny, ask anyone."
33412,Raj,good talk.
31438,Raj,"may i have your attention, please? we are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend howard wolowitz."
32015,Raj,"well, it’s kind of hard to tell. "
33285,Raj,"oh, god."
32672,Raj,"you call yourself a friend? i was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. you’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward."
29585,Raj,why did you do that?
31733,Raj,"it’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  he’s right, dawg."
31430,Raj,"okay, uh, i’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck i’ve always dreamed of having."
32109,Raj,"penny, how’s it going over there?"
31011,Raj,how did that even happen? did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
33241,Raj,still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
33807,Raj,hey. 
31607,Raj,"sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."
32639,Raj,"oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
30235,Raj,it means doo-doo.
33540,Raj,"hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."
34055,Raj,"i really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. you know, i was in a pretty low place in my life."
30237,Raj,"ah, well, in this context… "
30965,Raj,"good, because i would hate that."
32528,Raj,"boy, i’m so hungry today. i wonder why?"
30872,Raj,what do you think we should sell it for?
29999,Raj,knight to queen’s bishop-five.
33898,Raj,"that’s a penguin i sponsor. they’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so i felt bad."
31401,Raj,"thankyou. and once again, my baloney likes girls. wait-wait. you don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. yeah, okay, that time i heard it."
29902,Raj,"too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before."
32084,Raj,"it is awesome. uh, you should probably go after her."
30033,Raj,me? no. i just got vegas baby from vince vaughn in swingers. .
29597,Raj,can you believe how pushy she is?
32732,Raj,and we still don’t know who framed him.
32920,Raj,"okay, uh, i’m gonna own you, bitch."
30058,Raj,"uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the jewish girlfriend experience."
32758,Raj,it’s a christmas miracle.
29676,Raj,maybe we’re too smart. so smart it’s offputting. 
33654,Raj,it’s a gravitational wobble. it could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
30786,Raj,yeah. like his haircut material.
30478,Raj,"no, that’s okay. i’ll get it."
30134,Raj,"my stomach. indian food doesn’t agree with me. ironic, isn’t it?"
33503,Raj,did you guys see there’s an avengers screening? joss whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
32291,Raj,"here, you can have your seat."
29736,Raj,"we are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. why would they be looking for test subjects here? "
32842,Raj,"no, stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."
33054,Raj,let’s leave leonard out of this for the moment. this is about you and me.
33082,Raj,of course. all we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
32682,Raj,"yeah, i’m not quite sure how to respond."
30724,Raj,on caprica night?
33616,Raj,here you go.
31518,Raj,okay.
31061,Raj,"what do you mean, a show?"
31318,Raj,"well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
30673,Raj,has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? if you look at neutron scattering data…
33046,Raj,who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
32606,Raj,"ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
30375,Raj,what’s this?
29659,Raj,"well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to sheldon?"
33817,Raj,"yes, i’ll take you back."
31971,Raj,no.
32728,Raj,does it work?
33313,Raj,"wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?"
31370,Raj,i can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
32218,Raj,no. no pretty girls. the point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
32461,Raj,i’m just gonna say it. that’s not okay. why can’t i be in a relationship with a girl who likes the sound of music?
33290,Raj,"i’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
31608,Raj,what if it’s booby-trapped?
31147,Raj,sorry. go on.
33586,Raj,so where are we going?
30983,Raj,legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
34147,Raj,"no, never. what is porn?"
31439,Raj,does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
31989,Raj,i will. you can download my paper on the van allen belts from the university server as well.
32228,Raj,hey. good to see you.
30484,Raj,your guy eddie crispo?
31929,Raj,hold on. isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
32427,Raj,"she had mixed feelings. but when i said, emily was cool with it. emily’s the best. why can’t you"
32597,Raj,"it was, and i may have made it seem like a bigger deal than i should have."
29784,Raj,"by moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with wolowitz?"
33372,Raj,"and it was gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. learn as if you were to live forever."
29732,Raj,"i’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees. "
33865,Raj,i can’t believe what i’m hearing. this is deeply hurtful.
33826,Raj,"i appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, i’m swooping in on her like a vulture."
32252,Raj,we would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
32641,Raj,"look, i get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, i was thinking about when howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
30956,Raj,so never.
33722,Raj,"oh, but i bought chinese takeout."
33978,Raj,i can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
33542,Raj,that’s what he said to me.
32383,Raj,"okay, murder suspects, leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. you’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. and welcome to 20 years in the future. hey, you guys just time-travelled. stop looking so bored."
33128,Raj,my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
32471,Raj,can i make you breakfast? admiral ackbar’s snack bar is open for business.
31807,Raj,"see you. no, wait, take her number. i don’t want the temptation."
32849,Raj,"yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
29753,Raj,thank you. i apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
32602,Raj,and snacks.
32386,Raj,"oh, no. in this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after i became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, madonna."
29692,Raj,"yeah. sack up, dude. "
33198,Raj,maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
31667,Raj,in a new delhi minute.
33015,Raj,"nothing. i was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay."
31804,Raj,why would i want her number? i don’t want anything to do with this woman.
32753,Raj,what did you do?
32180,Raj,nonsense. you need a little fattening up. you’ve been looking too skinny lately.
32551,Raj,this is the part where you talk.
30950,Raj,"yes, it is. very cool!"
30302,Raj,it’s open.
32760,Raj,"well, that’s that. the room’s compromised. they’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks."
32119,Raj,i’ll tell you where it’s coming from. all you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
34022,Raj,"no, you didn’t. okay? look, bert, when i had money, i dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. and then i gave up my money, and now i’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
33543,Raj,"calm down, okay? try not to think about it."
30361,Raj,"oh, i’m so hungry!"
30215,Raj,i’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
31947,Raj,of course.
32316,Raj,"thank you. that was the closest i’ve come to sex in, like, two years."
32416,Raj,"my friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like i’m being deceitful."
31073,Raj,"okay, gotta go."
30840,Raj,what the hell did i do?
33977,Raj,"with your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
31973,Raj,"penny, i, i miss her already."
30193,Raj,what are you eating?
31008,Raj,none taken. you should hear how she talks about you.
33170,Raj,not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. we really have led full lives.
31017,Raj,the lonely guy and the two happy couples? i’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
31770,Raj,but i have a cream sherry hangover and i smell blintzes.
33086,Raj,is that enough to melt the lug nut?
33426,Raj,well this is kind of anti-climactic.
32794,Raj,"sorry. you’re right. i’m so stressed. but you know what, whenever i walk into that temple i realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. we’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us."
32244,Raj,we’re sorry amy didn’t want to go.
32910,Raj,"you know, tor, the god of tunder. as i was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"
29809,Raj,peer review? it’s people magazine. people picked me.
32047,Raj,i just wanted to do something beautiful.
33187,Raj,"no, i was in india, it was humid and smelled funny."
32548,Raj,"i don’t know. i mean, she’s lonely. he needs a place to stay. i doubt there’s any funny business going on. and even if there was, who cares? they’re both adults."
30810,Raj,"oh. well, that’s disappointing."
33666,Raj,that’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
29536,Raj,he’s selling the sword of azeroth on ebay.
32773,Raj,i can’t stop thinking about it.
30332,Raj,you brought your mother into this!
31902,Raj,"it’s very simple. for breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an english muffin, but not both. we’re watching our weight. uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like."
30533,Raj,you own the damn thing. just take a freaking sweater!
33598,Raj,"i have to say, i am happy with your obgyn."
33526,Raj,"uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us."
32017,Raj,do you want my help or not?
32222,Raj,that’s a mirror.
32065,Raj,yes.
30494,Raj,i’m signing off now.
31084,Raj,"well, i would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. and the memory of gene roddenberry."
31109,Raj,"what’s wrong with me, penny?"
32976,Raj,okay.
29611,Raj,"okay, now i just need to make sure i have a lalita before i meet the grasshopper. it’s a sweet green miracle. "
32315,Raj,fine. but no more making fun of how i say tings.
31558,Raj,what’s wrong with you?
30820,Raj,are you crazy?
32354,Raj,"hello, emily."
29622,Raj,if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
29839,Raj,"nothing, i was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous."
32497,Raj,"yeah, okay."
32572,Raj,"mmm, i love how they put a waterfall at centre field. it really ties the whole stadium together."
33201,Raj,"dude, if i was wearing a bra, i’d throw it at your head right now."
33394,Raj,thank you.
31129,Raj,you can’t ruin a friendship with sex. that’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
29554,Raj,"really, because i saw peter pan, and you’re dressed exactly like cathy rigby. she was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man. "
32147,Raj,"i love you, penny."
34110,Raj,"we represent the lollipop guild, and we want you."
32840,Raj,"ah, it’s good enough for facebook."
31082,Raj,you’re kidding.
33139,Raj,"uh, he’s indian. we’ve already got one of those. ooh, we should find a nice latino, really round us out."
30646,Raj,"oh, sure."
33493,Raj,i said no questions.
21784,Raj,hey.
32276,Raj,"oh, my god, cinnamon, are you okay? i can’t believe you two. you do whatever it takes to save her life. if she needs new organs, i’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
32413,Raj,"as a matter of fact, i did. i’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, i’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes."
32625,Raj,"hey, it was match point."
30180,Raj,but we just got tattoos. wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
31986,Raj,you would do that for me?
33557,Raj,"oh, i’m not on the patent. i’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office."
33292,Raj,"oh, i see you’re reading saga."
33854,Raj,what else are you gonna do with it? put it in your coffee?
30752,Raj,"well, actually, i may have gotten a little tipsy when i talked to her."
32685,Raj,maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
33710,Raj,what’s this button do?
30708,Raj,"oh, leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free."
33842,Raj,under the careful supervision of her godfather.
32713,Raj,"i think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
31587,Raj,"ooh, this is exciting. like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties."
32872,Raj,"so, uh, what game are you… oh. crap."
30472,Raj,and an aquaman action figure.
32541,Raj,like us?
29764,Raj,"they also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. sadly, that’s my home run swing. "
29748,Raj,"i’m not happy, it’s the medication, i can’t stop smiling. "
31319,Raj,"okay, um, how about crash”? howard “crash” wolowitz."
31469,Raj,i believe you two have prepared vows?
30818,Raj,"well, type two diabetes runs in my family. the thought of losing a toe…"
34070,Raj,"actually, i was going to suggest me."
33724,Raj,although it was already under control.
30247,Raj,so you were wrong.
29966,Raj,"well, then why didn’t you say that to her?"
33141,Raj,that’s a fair point. we wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
33246,Raj,"yeah, maybe that is something. how did you find that?"
32183,Raj,"look, i’m sorry you’re upset with me, but i just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
32026,Raj,"uh, can i just say, i’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
30271,Raj,"okay, i get it, he’s a bad guy. sign here."
32073,Raj,"i know. what started as a pap smear turned into a date. which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. two-eyed cyclops."
31424,Raj,you can make him do anything you want.
31304,Raj,"can i pour you some wine? i think you’ll enjoy it. the traditional choice with peking duck is a sauvignon blanc, but siri suggested an off-dry riesling. i wasn’t sure, but i didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of trader joe’s. now, what should we put siri in for dinner? leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase coco chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. siri, play some smooth jazz."
30546,Raj,"yeah, i think we’re getting close."
31006,Raj,"i was when i came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. besides what you might not know is, bernadette is planning on breaking up with howard."
33010,Raj,"you guys don’t have to go to the trouble. i’m back in the money now, i can just buy another helicopter."
33517,Raj,"okay, look, i’m on the air force web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. so maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention."
31567,Raj,dude! i was about to bollywood this bitch.
31450,Raj,"thank you, bernadette."
31441,Raj,"hear, hear."
32347,Raj,great. and?
31142,Raj,penny?
32233,Raj,"yeah, knock it off, howard."
29872,Raj,and a large number of people will believe it never happened.
30440,Raj,sheesh.
30169,Raj,we’re both frauds.
30433,Raj,great. it’s not like i brought it up because i wanted to go.
30636,Raj,"what would a toilet look like in atlantis? how would you flush it? and when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
29893,Raj,"you know, screw it, i’m just gonna eat the dumpling."
29868,Raj,"there’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame."
29579,Raj,he lives with leonard. 
32659,Raj,"so, as hannah montana, miley was a world-famous pop star. but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. which, i don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache."
30857,Raj,where would you go?
30916,Raj,do him first.
33680,Raj,"i love kids, how old is he?"
31002,Raj,"i just felt like drinking alone, because i’m deep and dark."
31359,Raj,we were badass back in the day.
29878,Raj,"i’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?"
30140,Raj,what happened?
32547,Raj,"that is weird. i thought he was, like, 45."
30921,Raj,i forbid it.
33158,Raj,so what’s up?
33365,Raj,"you mean, some guy in a lame suit?"
33733,Raj,thank you.
30096,Raj,he’s right.
34040,Raj,"oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
32457,Raj,"okay. so, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. we’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."
31723,Raj,are they actually arguing about comic books?
33271,Raj,"huh. okay. as long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, i’m in."
32145,Raj,"i think i know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
31865,Raj,"wait, hold on. this is weird."
31676,Raj,not that i can think of.
30027,Raj,do you kind of look like a shiny sheldon?
32577,Raj,"look, i’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship."
30664,Raj,what does hit a reef mean?
33626,Raj,i wonder if this is what it feels like to be bernadette’s baby.
31721,Raj,what? what about the mission? you said we were a real-life landing party.
33031,Raj,"no, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard."
32079,Raj,"oh, uh, on the off chance that bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about mexican food for dinner tonight?"
33886,Raj,"guys, i’m not living in a garage."
29595,Raj,find new friends. 
32064,Raj,"in the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. how many of them have sent us messages?"
30906,Raj,"yeah, okay, so, zombies."
29875,Raj,what do we do now?
33434,Raj,"no, i got it."
32256,Raj,"you know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
30068,Raj,don’t you mean the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste distribution system?
29795,Raj,"oh, okay, how about this. you can go dressed as a star trek science officer exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s."
33083,Raj,"if this was star trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
33007,Raj,"all i know, mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy."
33676,Raj,"no, i grew up with a house full of servants and now i have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who i have great respect for."
33226,Raj,check.
29700,Raj,"ten, nine, eight…"
33165,Raj,"oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner sheldon’s contact information."
31579,Raj,so don’t do it.
30418,Raj,hello.
34035,Raj,"you want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
33414,Raj,i’m an astrophysicist. the stars don’t take a day off.
31412,Raj,"this is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
31405,Raj,"well, you know whenever you and i would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. it’s like that. except this time it’s true."
32206,Raj,"you’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and i’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."
30549,Raj,"ah, the premature i love you."
33556,Raj,my cousin does work in a call centre.
32295,Raj,"oh, uh, let me try. uh, channelis changeroni. this might be my second favorite brown magic wand."
30915,Raj,i think we were misled about the cute girls.
33123,Raj,i feel cool. like puss in boots.
30491,Raj,also my cousin.
32865,Raj,"so, where’s your roommate tonight?"
29618,Raj,"so you’re a dental student? hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning. "
33134,Raj,why do you need kripke? can’t you just go to party city for helium?
32072,Raj,"i think it could be romantic. you know, my parents met at his place of work. "
31327,Raj,upsilon?
31975,Raj,"no, i, i won’t. i’m, i’m unlovable."
31292,Raj,"no need. i’ve already done that. siri, do you have a last name?"
31380,Raj,yes.
33533,Raj,"um, no. "
34050,Raj,why?
30759,Raj,"oh, my god, dude. now you have to forgive him."
31889,Raj,what do you mean?
32479,Raj,should we try to console him?
33853,Raj,"oh, of course we can. uh, you girls have a good time. she said i was in charge."
33717,Raj,"thank you for saying that. next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
30682,Raj,you said i could buy a desk.
32554,Raj,"so, i’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and emily. what do you like better? emippali or koothrapemily?"
29551,Raj,make way for the fastest man alive.  oh no!
32878,Raj,hang on.
33691,Raj,that’s why i already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
33905,Raj,"well, so? so you think bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to san diego for five days and leave her alone?"
33035,Raj,"i don’t know, guys. maybe this relationship isn’t for me. maybe i should break up with her."
33001,Raj,what?
32966,Raj,"okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well."
32000,Raj,"yeah, i can relate to being a single parent. i have a dog."
32068,Raj,"yeah, anything is better than this."
31673,Raj,"well, uh, there was a time when i had a thing for penny, and i thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. but apparently i misread those signals."
30396,Raj,"come on, sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. let’s go outside. outside is good."
30764,Raj,"hey, guys, bad news. i just did a quick calculation. given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats."
32420,Raj,"are you, are you sure? because this is the part of the night where i’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
32155,Raj,"uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?"
30750,Raj,"i love this country! the-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! from california to the new york island, i’m a real yankee doodle boy!"
31586,Raj,"twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for."
29914,Raj,"oh, yeah, like you have a shot with zac ephron."
30981,Raj,she’s curvy and she owns it. i like that.
32922,Raj,"what, and that’s not offensive? where’s the line?"
29823,Raj,"okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why i can’t go, alrighty? koothrappali out. god bless that boy, i don’t know what i’d do without him."
33999,Raj,"wait a minute. hey, let me see your phone."
31538,Raj,so you’re wandering all around by yourself? that’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
33566,Raj,"so, what should we do today?"
33507,Raj,"boy, all this standing’s making me tired. good thing i brought my collapsible stick chair."
33782,Raj,"oh come on, we just need to be more creative. what if you didn’t step on the floor at all? like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
33714,Raj,"he doesn’t just look like c-3po, now he walks like him."
32911,Raj,"no, not at all."
32060,Raj,"three, two, one. "
31523,Raj,"so, what are you guys doing later? stuart and i were thinking of going out for a drink."
34167,Raj,hello?
31748,Raj,aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
29730,Raj,"i can and i did, look up dibs on wikipedia."
30952,Raj,these cards have barcodes on them. the wand is a reader. it’s transmitting to your phone.
32998,Raj,i have to return the helicopter. my father… what did you do?
31879,Raj,why do you have to make everything so filthy? why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
30233,Raj,"okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!"
29852,Raj,why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
30666,Raj,ah.
33530,Raj,hello.
32097,Raj,"got it. now, uh, i have a question about the song. i was thinking at some point i could bust out a little rap."
33560,Raj,and you just let him?
31166,Raj,what’s it thinking about now?
30505,Raj,why don’t we go after your mother?
32077,Raj,as you wish.
31474,Raj,"hey, guys."
30279,Raj,"problem, wil wheaton?"
30721,Raj,"uh, my plans with priya."
31160,Raj,mmmmmm.
33262,Raj,we haven’t settled on anything yet.
29816,Raj,"really, you don’t have to go to any trouble."
30063,Raj,"he’s right. this is an important achievement, for two reasons. number one, and, of course, number two."
30119,Raj,"yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
33336,Raj,i’m gonna all alone on valentine’s day.
33527,Raj,"oh, no."
32027,Raj,"so, couldn’t help but notice none of you rsvp’d to my murder mystery dinner party."
29850,Raj,what right do you have to pick who i can have children with?
30059,Raj,a little baby.
30758,Raj,what’s in the bag?
31766,Raj,"actually, i’m still here."
32643,Raj,so where should we do it?
30561,Raj,"well, i do. next to you, i’ll look like a catch."
31396,Raj,"why me, of all people?"
30398,Raj,"oh, boy."
30464,Raj,"well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision."
30800,Raj,why? you writing a book?
32902,Raj,"okay, i’ll start heating some of this stuff up."
31440,Raj,"yeah, to howard. um, uh, who’s next?"
33981,Raj,you want to go shopping?
30079,Raj,"me, too."
29591,Raj,i don’t believe it.
31778,Raj,"but, howard…"
33896,Raj,are you serious?
34180,Raj,hello.
33837,Raj,"uh, the one at caltech has a crazy wait list. i warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
33416,Raj,"okay. that’s cool. i guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. so, see ya."
31871,Raj,"no, this is creepy."
33548,Raj,"i just read a book about oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  there he is, there’s my happy hebraic homeboy. yeah, that’s the smile i’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and i’m living with your wife."
31785,Raj,except on a date with anybody.
31690,Raj,"oh, my god. you’re loving this."
31290,Raj,you have a beautiful voice.
30942,Raj,i still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
32129,Raj,"so, how are you gonna return the dvd if the store went out of business?"
30686,Raj,now three times fast?
31758,Raj,"i don’t know, maybe drive down to hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if i can get lucky."
33108,Raj,"you can dance to this. um, uh, uh, thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
29574,Raj,what?
32266,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
32059,Raj,"okay, now you’re talking like a winner!"
33085,Raj,i had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
32656,Raj,it’s a little more bleak than i thought.
30110,Raj,i feel bad for the guy.
32809,Raj,"hey, guys. mind if emily joins us for lunch?"
33656,Raj,good point. and you are?
33122,Raj,are you?
29721,Raj,my turn.
32901,Raj,"me, too. oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."
31916,Raj,"you’re right, i should finish the game. i take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. i’m dead, i’ve got a date with a girl. bye."
33713,Raj,then the robot uprising has begun.
32030,Raj,because i’ve got something even better planned.
31943,Raj,yeah. he brought me back a t-shirt that said my friend went to the space station and all i got was this lousy t-shirt
33563,Raj,and right here.
32313,Raj,"howard, i’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts."
33150,Raj,"oh, okay. got it."
30625,Raj,"but it’s true. but we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. her name is amy farrah fowler."
33634,Raj,"though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
34169,Raj,okay. would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
33079,Raj,"here, let me try. you’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way."
31230,Raj,all right.  who do we have here?
32221,Raj,"i don’t know. they’re dressed very stylishly. they’re probably stuck-up. this is ridiculous. the next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. we’re gonna die here."
31385,Raj,"oh, yes. you must be lakshmi. uh, nice to meet you."
33476,Raj,"oh, that’s great. i’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity."
32411,Raj,"oh, no."
30442,Raj,i’m on a cloud. swing me. 
32450,Raj,"i do, but for some reason, emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so i thought if i start with you first, then i could act cool about it with her."
33687,Raj,"okay. i’ll leave. but just know, every time i come in here, i’ll be thinking of you."
29918,Raj,she knows you. she’s tense. we all are. buy a basket!
31814,Raj,really? then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
33063,Raj,now we are done.
32044,Raj,"don’t you see? when we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. oh, look. see? even i’m a winner."
32311,Raj,like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
32475,Raj,"ugh, let’s get this over with."
29647,Raj,"well i’d like to point out, i voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ."
34106,Raj,stairwell.
30691,Raj,"i have three brothers and two sisters, sheldon, i can do this all day."
30573,Raj,what?
33440,Raj,are you sure you can do this?
31277,Raj,he’s got to be doing this on purpose.
31048,Raj,"ooh, fire demon. sheldon’s turning up the heat."
31568,Raj,i’m not finishing your sentence. you pulled the plug on my funk.
33938,Raj,"anyway, thanks again."
31952,Raj,good idea. bernadette?
21790,Raj,fine.
33347,Raj,that’s so amazing.
31833,Raj,"dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party."
33413,Raj,hey. where are the guys?
30958,Raj,"why so glum, chum?"
30974,Raj,"sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude."
33653,Raj,"oh, no, it’s okay. i just found a wobble."
32532,Raj,"we’re here for you, man. whatever you need, okay?"
31642,Raj,just say it.
32335,Raj,"okay, i’m getting some mixed messages here."
31524,Raj,‘cause that’s what we do.
32568,Raj,"so you never played baseball as a kid, not even little league?"
29953,Raj,that’s how we missed it.
30016,Raj,"you heard that, ladies’ night ladies? we’re eventually coming for you!"
31636,Raj,why do you have a parking spot? you don’t have a car. you don’t even drive.
31691,Raj,i both hate you and want to be you. this is ryan gosling all over again.
31609,Raj,"great, what’s your pl… "
31743,Raj,and we made it in only three hours. sounds just like store-bought.
31196,Raj,i’m hammered.
29576,Raj,"may i present, live from new delhi, dr and mrs v. m. koothrappali. "
32302,Raj,it’s pretty exciting that nasa wants to send howard back up.
34138,Raj,"good lord, what have i done?"
33112,Raj,"yeah, so what?"
34036,Raj,"damn it, he’s good at that, too."
29731,Raj,why larry? did larry call dibs? 
30413,Raj,you help me run my game.
33861,Raj,"uh, well, i was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
30521,Raj,"yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. it turned brown while you were talking."
30093,Raj,"if you were standing behind me nagging, i might."
30608,Raj,"that’s disgusting, dude."
31122,Raj,i’m sorry.
32307,Raj,do you think this is cool?
29707,Raj,a time share time machine? i’m in. sheldon?
29657,Raj,"do you know what he did. he watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. "
30526,Raj,do you want to do this or not?
32711,Raj,i’m sorry. this is very sweet. thanks.
31885,Raj,"yeah, well, i wouldn’t get too close. if i give the right command in german, she’ll rip your face off."
30463,Raj,"that’s a great idea, i’m going to get him to sign a batman as well."
33760,Raj,"oh, yay, i have a doctorate in astrophysics and i’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
33415,Raj,"well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. you need any help?"
31099,Raj,it’s not a big thing. just think of me as a brown martha stewart.
30341,Raj,"not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
31365,Raj,"what, you invited your girlfriend? this is supposed to be our weekend."
32884,Raj,you’re not helping.
31832,Raj,"oh, well, i’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if i hadn’t tried your food first."
31477,Raj,"oh, okay. sounds like it’s me and you, sheldon. how about we sic some guppies on those puppies?"
30139,Raj,"oh, i really don’t care anymore"
32571,Raj,is it too late for him to cancel?
29601,Raj,what are you doing?
33974,Raj,paul.
33345,Raj,"hey, bud."
32561,Raj,"ask why not again, i’ve got an answer."
33273,Raj,"yeah, that sounds fun. a party-bus party don’t stop. ooh, when i say party, you say bus."
31963,Raj,"oh, please?"
30094,Raj,"no, it’s not. howard, tell them."
29962,Raj,a successful quest. now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
30320,Raj,"yeah. absolutely. it wouldn’t kill you to take a pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
32900,Raj,"you don’t want to do that. refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. what? i saw a teachable moment. i dropped some culinary science."
30838,Raj,"you crimson coward! oh, leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips."
33447,Raj,"uh, actually i’m seeing both of them."
30298,Raj,"i’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."
31322,Raj,"okay, uh, what if we make rocket man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, i’ll call you and they’ll hear it. plant the seed."
31626,Raj,i don’t know.
31897,Raj,"hey, i just found out i have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. any chance you and bernadette could take care of my dog?"
29817,Raj,"i’d rather have fishbine’s, it’s bigger."
30255,Raj,nobody can.
32196,Raj,"open wide, here comes the happy train."
31717,Raj,"it, it is. it’s not just comic books. they’ve got action figures, toys, a tron-themed dance party."
29671,Raj,"you know, if we were in india this would be simpler. five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done."
29843,Raj,it’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
30883,Raj,"ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their flickr account."
34073,Raj,good to see you.
31024,Raj,what?
33374,Raj,"i hadn’t spoken to emily since i broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
33846,Raj,"yeah, great. um, i’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
32133,Raj,"what is wrong with you, penny? you ruined any chance i had of getting back with lucy. now she knows i’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  it’s lucy. she wants to meet for coffee. i love you, penny."
30873,Raj,"well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? you know, get the word of mouth going."
33627,Raj,"well, it’s getting late. maybe we should head home."
31595,Raj,i’m listening.
34057,Raj,i can’t compete with that. bye.
32162,Raj,stir the gravy. 
30270,Raj,"okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. sign here."
34072,Raj,may i join you?
30466,Raj,"bruce banner, reed richards, sue storm, stephen strange, otto octavius, silver surfer, peter parker, oh, and worst of all, j. jonah jameson, jr."
30342,Raj,"yes, it’s not the same without him. "
33921,Raj,it doesn’t matter. i’m not keeping this. i’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. taking handouts won’t help that.
33461,Raj,"hey, did i say something to upset you?"
32070,Raj,i was wrong. this is worse.
29965,Raj,"nope, i think mocking you is more fun."
29922,Raj,"man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
30481,Raj,who else could it be? it has to be eddie crispo.
30707,Raj,"dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with wolowitz?"
33513,Raj,congratulations.
31188,Raj,"it’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that w-shaped constellation is cassiopeia. and she was the mother of andromeda who’s over there."
30266,Raj,"leonard, help."
34128,Raj,"hey, i’ve got winners."
30135,Raj,"ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
33746,Raj,don’t come to the hospital. we’re headed home.
30198,Raj,thank you.
33109,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it."
32718,Raj,that’s rough.
29537,Raj,what’s the matter.
32800,Raj,"you know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. it’s not strange."
33633,Raj,"though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting."
30035,Raj,what are you going to tell your mother?
32061,Raj,"attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
30993,Raj,"fair enough. now, what’s up with clarinet? bernadette!"
31761,Raj,"that would be lovely. thank you.  mrs. wolowitz, uh, are you okay?"
33541,Raj,"oh, i take it back, don’t mention me."
31959,Raj,"i want to apologize for amy last night. she was completely out of line. are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
31307,Raj,"um, expedition 31 will launch this spring to the international space station. crew members will include commander tom ‘tombo’ johnson, astronaut mike ‘supernova’ novacelik and payload specialist howard wolowitz."
31774,Raj,you were right. i can’t get out of here.
30475,Raj,one ring to find them.
32141,Raj,"hello. oh, it’s so good to see you."
30015,Raj,also a good plan.
32537,Raj,got a hot girlfriend now. i want the haters to know.
32489,Raj,so she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
33697,Raj,uh. 
31961,Raj,"you know, i, i’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so friday night, my friends are having a party."
32523,Raj,"it’s a piercing. so, uh, how many tattoos?"
30514,Raj,the fires of mount doom?
21788,Raj,"okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
33547,Raj,"okay, that’s not so bad. you know what happened to the scientists that worked on the manhattan project? the government forced them to move to the desert. they had to live in secret, and when oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
29706,Raj,"congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
31703,Raj,howard built a sex robot.
30103,Raj,it’s not about that.
29599,Raj,"how can i call her, you know i can’t talk to women. "
31559,Raj,"oh, howard, i’ve got a party to plan. don’t make me pull it out of you."
29880,Raj,"okay, i think i got it. "
34045,Raj,bert has a room for rent.
32512,Raj,i’ll stick with eleven. she liked howard better.
32968,Raj,"we, we can totally do that."
29581,Raj,"papa, please don’t start. "
32892,Raj,thank you for forgiving me.
31418,Raj,why?
29763,Raj,you being the fish.
32207,Raj,what are you doing?
32913,Raj,"oh, yeah? i love ping-pong."
33816,Raj,"okay, that’s enough. write down loving son."
29788,Raj,n-n-n-nothing happened to me.
33699,Raj,"isabella. isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
33021,Raj,"i do. and some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible."
33343,Raj,i’m sorry for bothering you. i’ll hang up now.
30978,Raj,"yeah, we’re coming for you, todd zarnecki. and for the record, legoland is more interactive."
33704,Raj,great. where would you like to go?
33581,Raj,of course it does. didn’t your baby room have a theme?
31429,Raj,i thought he might be a little more excited.
32831,Raj,"don’t say that. i mean, you’re not dame judi dench, but you’re pretty great."
30450,Raj,"no way, dude!"
29668,Raj,"okay, uh, how about her? "
30953,Raj,okay.
33404,Raj,"no, no. please don’t cry."
33340,Raj,"but, amy, when you and sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?"
30996,Raj,"oh, no. i hope everything’s okay."
30669,Raj,"don’t try to change me, dude. i am what i am."
33077,Raj,when did you learn how to change a tyre?
33471,Raj,"well, howard eating that pistachio was like when king joffrey got poisoned."
32614,Raj,cool. i’ll make the popcorn.
32448,Raj,i was thinking we could watch a dvd.
31154,Raj,better?
31053,Raj,"oh, that sounds lovely."
33682,Raj,"that’s wonderful. a lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. look at that, we have something in common."
30917,Raj,it’s koothrappali. i have to tinkle.
31968,Raj,excuse me.
32286,Raj,"there you go. all cozy wozy. here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. hmm. rajesh, i was dreading valentine’s day. thank you for spending it with me. yvette. cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. if i’d known it was that easy, i would have considered poisoning you months ago. oh, what should i say? oh, i know. i’ll point out her name’s yvette, and that she’s a vet. that’s hysterical. she’ll love it."
33472,Raj,okay. but you using sheldon to do your dirty work is like when cersei used the king’s guard to do her bidding.
30637,Raj,you slipped and fell into a robot hand?
32025,Raj,"uh, it wasn’t anything weird. it was just to see how big they were."
29829,Raj,"oh, okay, leonard?"
31384,Raj,"oh, no, no, i get a say in it. but i’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome i’ve been having with aunt jemima and mrs butterworth."
34015,Raj,so how did you two meet?
32866,Raj,"but remember our agreement? you can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
31044,Raj,and what is your name?
30397,Raj,"i don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. please, sheldon, i’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and i need to strut my stuff."
30331,Raj,"oh, my god, you are such a mama’s boy."
31208,Raj,sometimes i put the tv on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. but i can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
30064,Raj,sure you remember. you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
30976,Raj,"hello, priya. what’s up? how would i know if leonard’s at work or not? don’t be suspicious. look, if you want your relationship with leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. okay? yeah, bye-bye. you owe me."
29925,Raj,"i’m not surprised. despite his hard and crusty shell, howard is a very sensitive man. do you know he writes poetry? mostly about men from nantucket and hermits named dave, but he does it with real sensitivity."
30540,Raj,maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
32640,Raj,"well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket."
32042,Raj,"oh, yes, leonard. yes, it was."
31805,Raj,"no, you don’t get it. i want nothing to do with any woman. my heart is stone. from now on, i’m a monk. i renounce all worldly pleasures. except for lobster. and garlic butter."
33522,Raj,i also love the enemies of america.
31340,Raj,i’m glad that men are wearing hats again. they’re so distinguished.
29562,Raj,what do you suppose she meant by that?
31899,Raj,thank you.
29967,Raj,"it’s not always your responsibility. i swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week."
30078,Raj,"that what that’s for? in india, the lid just touches the cheese. of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
29719,Raj,"mrs bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock. "
32631,Raj,"yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
30687,Raj,"that’s for me, ramon, julio, jesus and rodrigo to know and you to find out."
32594,Raj,hey.
29892,Raj,hey.
32822,Raj,our pleasure.
32569,Raj,"come on howard, fire it in."
33505,Raj,"uh, i’d say by three."
29641,Raj,hoo-hoo-hoo. the only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.” 
31250,Raj,annie ogly.
32756,Raj,i’ll do it.
32137,Raj,"well, can i say she looks nice?"
29891,Raj,"okay, who gets the extra dumpling?"
33224,Raj,i can’t believe sheldon gave this up.
30428,Raj,so?
33232,Raj,i don’t think i can walk right now.
33381,Raj,it doesn’t matter. it’s the thought that counts.
31197,Raj,the best one i ever had!
30026,Raj,interesting. are you a droid?
32570,Raj,yup.
30944,Raj,"i’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
30587,Raj,"ooh, ooh. did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
33454,Raj,i feel you. i’ve been dating multiple women.
31280,Raj,i will take that action.
31958,Raj,we might as well go ahead and eat. she’s not coming back anytime soon.
29742,Raj,"the indian sex book. in other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
30218,Raj,then you leave me no choice. i accept the job.
33810,Raj,"okay, uh, let’s get things started. um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. want to kick it off?"
32123,Raj,thank you. it wasn’t easy.
33762,Raj,hey.
31987,Raj,"thanks. oh, sheldon, since amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?"
32210,Raj,"ooh, mark harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
31533,Raj,we’re not kicking him out. stuart and i have become good friends.
31591,Raj,"i don’t know, i’m torn. i want to know where he’s going, but now i kind of want to play with the bunny."
29800,Raj,hey guys.
30181,Raj,wow. what a great night.
33993,Raj,"genius. i was gonna say, why does anyone think sheldon’s a genius? but i didn’t."
32770,Raj,"oh, another two hours to go. the wait is killing me."
30643,Raj,"next time, take your own advice."
32223,Raj,sorry.
30329,Raj,"maybe it means something different in this country. back in india, it means you’re upset with a guy named howard!"
30482,Raj,name one.
30995,Raj,so what’s up?
33442,Raj,wow.
32498,Raj,uh-huh.
32173,Raj,"oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. you’re gonna be great."
32982,Raj,"oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
31738,Raj,"oh, true. they’re practically giving them away. you know, in exchange for money."
32485,Raj,please hurry.
32562,Raj,is that right?
32895,Raj,no. just the drawer.
30524,Raj,what?
31464,Raj,"oh, thanks, man."
33304,Raj,i do. i just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
33604,Raj,flip a coin. you got a fifty-fifty shot.
30618,Raj,"leonard, what are you talking about?"
31669,Raj,what?
33382,Raj,"seriously, guys, i don’t want to know."
33929,Raj,"cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
33730,Raj,why are you being like this?
32408,Raj,"i can’t date two women at once. zero women, that’s my sweet spot."
33813,Raj,"okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. uh, next?"
31542,Raj,which part?
30456,Raj,what the hell is that?
32905,Raj,you got it.
34120,Raj,my heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
31185,Raj,what are you doing?
31708,Raj,i say we begin with a classic star trek fight scene.
29672,Raj,"alright, why don’t we do it your way then? we’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
30309,Raj,you’re impossible.
29743,Raj,"missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
33927,Raj,"i really appreciate it. uh, can you hold on one second? hey, so, howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?"
32273,Raj,i don’t have plans which is why i booked time on the big telescope that night.
31935,Raj,"okay, if i upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?"
33650,Raj,"we can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
30490,Raj,i was afraid of that.  go ahead.
33940,Raj,this means a lot.
31817,Raj,"that’s great. i’m broken, too."
32534,Raj,"well, i can’t take all the credit. she let me do it to her, but, uh, but i can always call her and cancel."
33864,Raj,"what are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? what kind of father gives up on his son?"
32166,Raj,"howard, the poor thing just got home from work. let me get you a glass of wine. i’ll cook dinner."
30598,Raj,"oh, this is like a nightmare. get lost!"
31633,Raj,"no, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. mummies and zombies are the exact same thing."
31448,Raj,"you know, we’re not that far from my apartment. if you stop the car, i can walk from here."
30061,Raj,you’re paying? have you been selling your sperm again?
33840,Raj,"while i’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
30363,Raj,"me, too. but what? "
29900,Raj,can i see your stitches?
31462,Raj,"yes, you made that brutally clear to me. what i was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until sunday morning, the google satellite will be over pasadena. you can have a wedding photograph from space."
33834,Raj,"hey, i was being hypothetical, okay? i would never marry you."
31788,Raj,"then i’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion."
30114,Raj,"yeah, like in the movies i saw growing up in india. you know, uh, four for texas, yellow rose of texas."
32836,Raj,great.
31325,Raj,"oh, yeah. there’s a reason he’s sir elton john. they don’t make you a knight for writing wake me up before you go go."
30543,Raj,"did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
32603,Raj,"hey, i read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking."
31870,Raj,"no, no, i don’t know if i should. if she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. it’s almost like i’m reading her diary."
30146,Raj,i think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
33926,Raj,"oh, my god, that’s so generous."
33652,Raj,"oh, my god, i just got it. fun onions, funyuns. hold on. is that a wobble? yes. that’s definitely a gravitational wobble."
31613,Raj,"really? well, oh, okay, one mystery solved."
29806,Raj,"it’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and ellen page, star of the charming independent film juno."
30138,Raj,what would you name him?
29716,Raj,twice a month.
32031,Raj,just hear me out. i’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at m.i.t.
34087,Raj,"oh dear, i am rightly and truly screwed. "
29972,Raj,we need a plan. how about operation hammer of the gods?
33891,Raj,"dad, i’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief."
32531,Raj,"dude, i’m so sorry."
31624,Raj,how did you get your hands on that?
30845,Raj,no.
31861,Raj,"well, now it’s biguous. what are you gonna do about it?"
30419,Raj,what was that?
30241,Raj,no.
30742,Raj,"it doesn’t matter. they’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to gandhi-ville. by the way, when i say that, it’s not offensive."
29863,Raj,"you might want to slow down a bit, buddy."
31065,Raj,"well, i don’t think you have to worry about penny telling my sister that."
33765,Raj,congratulations.
30175,Raj,"oh, they did. like jasmine and honeysuckle."
33584,Raj,"okay, well, i’m just trying to help you."
33230,Raj,it is.
33539,Raj,can we take a moment to discuss that i just lied to the government for you?
31169,Raj,"okay, i’m going to play it cool. tell her, maybe. whatever, babe."
32208,Raj,"yeah, but why are you fat?"
32154,Raj,"ah, no problem. it wouldn’t be thanksgiving without an indian providing the food. uh, now, where does your mom keep the crisco?"
31499,Raj,"oh, penny. that’s ridiculous. you know you love him. you, you look him in the eyes and you say it. "
29634,Raj,i’m not an alcoholic.
30062,Raj,"oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet."
32087,Raj,of course. i’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
30892,Raj,i say okey-dokey.
34146,Raj,anything i might have seen?
32396,Raj,"yes, rajesh koothrappali. look, uh, i just, i wanted to say i’m sorry. okay? you were, like, the coolest person i ever found online, and i got really nervous and i, i just blew it."
31820,Raj,"you won’t regret it. i’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. and that, boys and girls, is how it’s done."
31547,Raj,would you like me to help? i do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
32710,Raj,hey. what brings you by?
31661,Raj,"my pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. just ask my dog. my vet says if i give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout."
30997,Raj,yeah. good or devastating.
34122,Raj,you are my heart!
32135,Raj,why is the key always confidence? how come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
31377,Raj,"no, i’m not gay. if anything, i’m metrosexual."
30699,Raj,no. see what i did there? i turned it around.
30222,Raj,"sheldon, for god’s sakes, don’t make me beg."
30102,Raj,we have to tell him.
32007,Raj,"i will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only i can give her."
33026,Raj,ooh. hot date?
33199,Raj,"how about, uh, oh, how about, we might be footprints on the moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."
31248,Raj,incredibly so.
29801,Raj,"ah, yes, online gaming addiction. there’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back."
33790,Raj,"don’t do that in socks, i almost broke my neck."
33483,Raj,why would it be too big a step?
30728,Raj,"i… i don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
29586,Raj,"but papa, i’m not supposed…"
31491,Raj,"well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?"
31826,Raj,"i am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people."
32791,Raj,all right. shall we?
33649,Raj,that would be amazing.
32464,Raj,"actually, i have to tell you something. these kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, i watched it just to see what i was getting myself into."
30049,Raj,"oh, i miss her already."
33227,Raj,what is everyone booing at?
32533,Raj,"sure, of course. oh, actually, emily was gonna spend the night."
31427,Raj,bring him to his bony knees.
31848,Raj,it would be nice to have the increased income. stop taking money from my parents.
33500,Raj,"don’t listen to him. he says crazy things all the time. uh, watch. marco."
31564,Raj,is this about the space thing again?
31092,Raj,when did you take my blood?
34116,Raj,"oh, too bad! sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! hey, look, sheldon! birdie, birdie, birdie!"
29652,Raj,"would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
33364,Raj,he’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. maybe we could get him a fossil.
30352,Raj,"that’s beautiful, dude. you should… you should write that down before someone steals it."
32869,Raj,"oh, good."
32705,Raj,"dude, my parents just split up."
32272,Raj,"since you two are gonna be around for valentine’s, would you mind watching cinnamon?"
33390,Raj,"i’m sorry, i don’t think that’s a good idea."
31410,Raj,i can’t believe your attitude. i thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
30746,Raj,"i’m in this country legally, you know."
30605,Raj,"wait a second, the good wife is crying. something’s very wrong."
32127,Raj,"and that’s not even the best part. see? i have one, too. check it out. you can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
31836,Raj,"well, come on, we won’t tell anyone."
33249,Raj,it could be a trans-neptunian object.
33550,Raj,he gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to howard.
32972,Raj,"look, i know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
31223,Raj,"i didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow i feel better."
32298,Raj,wow. what did you tell them?
32973,Raj,"look, we admit it. the idea that you guys came up with was really good, and i’d love your help."
33389,Raj,"i’m sorry, i seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how i feel about this."
33383,Raj,"oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me."
34136,Raj,"hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?"
31459,Raj,"from that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. shh, no one can know."
31397,Raj,i’m not gay.
32716,Raj,"oh, like you and i did at couples therapy."
30307,Raj,"and you do it all the time. last week in the mall at radio shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and i suddenly realize you’re not even there."
30041,Raj,rajesh ramayan koothrappali.
30479,Raj,who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
30417,Raj,"well, i’m a slumdog astrophysicist."
30890,Raj,"aw, i’m gonna miss you. are you going with him?"
31229,Raj,i don’t know. maybe.
31982,Raj,"well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good."
29846,Raj,"no, wait, the evening’s not over."
32858,Raj,"oh, so kind of like what’s happening with penny right now."
33655,Raj,"yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce."
30240,Raj,"i’m not defacing it, i’m fixing it."
33121,Raj,when was the last actual exercise you got?
34046,Raj,"uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. so the only time i’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
33745,Raj,"i’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
32618,Raj,i’ll make the popcorn.
30195,Raj,we believe cows are gods.
33403,Raj,"hey, emily, listen, i’ve been thinking, and i’m not sure it’s a good idea that i come over."
30028,Raj,c3po.
33339,Raj,kripke? is that you?
29798,Raj,it’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
33162,Raj,and you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
31273,Raj,did you forget what penny did to you? it took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
32046,Raj,"okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time."
31995,Raj,"so if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable."
29548,Raj,"nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. "
33967,Raj,"hey, can i ask you a favour? would you mind taking cinnamon for a walk?"
31784,Raj,it’s nice that all the people who are lonely on valentine’s day can come here tonight and be together.
32974,Raj,"it wasn’t, so are you in?"
33388,Raj,"maybe, maybe."
34143,Raj,"as you’re reading, it will help to remember i have an adorable accent."
32860,Raj,"ooh. okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
30011,Raj,so what are we going to do tonight?
31950,Raj,"actually, i was thinking leonard."
31700,Raj,"if you weren’t screwing around with sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening."
30248,Raj,that’s the only logical inference.
31428,Raj,"wow, that’s amazing."
30518,Raj,"my point is, if i were a horse or a bird, i’d be very nervous around james cameron."
33911,Raj,i’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores i could do.
30907,Raj,"hey, don’t bag on sandra bullock! you think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter."
29718,Raj,"also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 pasadena. "
29769,Raj,what did you do? did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
32675,Raj,i would love to see your collection.
29928,Raj,he’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
31151,Raj,how can you be so racist?
31689,Raj,i talk with my eyes.
33047,Raj,didn’t even crack the top ten.
30239,Raj,let me finish.
30531,Raj,"then, put on a sweater."
33651,Raj,do you like living with her?
32600,Raj,great.
32553,Raj,"but half-man, half-owl could fly…"
30805,Raj,thank you. how come you didn’t call me this morning?
32288,Raj,you mean a moo-stache?
33419,Raj,oh. you know what? i’m gonna let them know that i’m here with you and that they’re busted.
31705,Raj,"you know, we’re not that far from vazquez rocks."
30973,Raj,"me, too."
31247,Raj,wild bill witchcock.
29947,Raj,stu the cockatoo?
33795,Raj,can we not play this game?
31389,Raj,"well, i hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
30848,Raj,i don’t want to be aquaman. he sucks. he sucks underwater. he sucks fish pee.
33855,Raj,"nothing to worry about. she’s just been crying for a little while, and i was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
31298,Raj,i haven’t bonded with it.
33366,Raj,"hey, so what was adam west like on the phone?"
30600,Raj,"okay, show of hands. who’s up for this? "
32535,Raj,thanks for the lift.
32379,Raj,"no, i was svelte as a gazelle. a gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."
33402,Raj,any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook?
31078,Raj,"oh, don’t bother. i’ll just sleep in leonard’s room."
33830,Raj,"it was for the girls. they broke up with me, i don’t care if they get fat."
30655,Raj,"ah. nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear rocky mountain spring water. where are the rocky mountains, anyway?"
30045,Raj,"excuse me, i’ll be right back. don’t go anywhere. don’t move. just stay the beautiful unspoiled american flower that you are.  what’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy."
32768,Raj,we hope. the signal has to travel over three billion miles. so it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
32608,Raj,nothing bad happens in the lake house.
32956,Raj,i don’t know. how do you want to start?
29991,Raj,"and that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s venus."
29982,Raj,holy crap! look!
31231,Raj,"oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
31087,Raj,"oh, my god, she’s that mona? why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?"
30009,Raj,i could go for some goat.
32245,Raj,"oh, it all comes down to this."
32201,Raj,ew.
30197,Raj,"me, too. i’m just, i’m a little on edge."
30599,Raj,good?
32987,Raj,it streams hd video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
33459,Raj,i never said that.
32203,Raj,"yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding."
29930,Raj,i can’t watch anymore.
33391,Raj,"good-bye, emily. that was rough, you guys."
33143,Raj,i have that same underwear.
32735,Raj,"anyway, dad’s gonna be here in town, so i won’t be able to do christmas dinner this year."
30038,Raj,"oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
32644,Raj,"uh, sheldon…"
30679,Raj,"yeah, what if i buy my own desk?"
30173,Raj,"i like it, i like it. did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
32198,Raj,"oh, man, that is so us."
31515,Raj,"hey, stuart."
30267,Raj,"hey, stuart, is the wil wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament the wil wheaton from star trek?"
32564,Raj,why didn’t girls like us in high school?
32163,Raj,"well, i couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. martha stewart and rachael ray."
30909,Raj,sounds great!
33880,Raj,my father pays for it. do you know how much your rent is?
32377,Raj,"well, i guess it goes back to when i was a fat kid in india, and didn’t have any friends."
33309,Raj,i’m calling her. and the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
31421,Raj,"that’s incredible. oh, here, break out the math."
33561,Raj,so i guess i won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
31695,Raj,huh. that is so strange. human resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? i have a problem here.
34049,Raj,you could try saying that without smiling.
31571,Raj,"dude, my accent is brilliant.  hey, my snow-white american friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese."
33916,Raj,that’s fine. she and i can cry together.
32658,Raj,okay. how ’bout a little miley cyrus next?
32846,Raj,"yeah, i, i, i saw that article you’re talking about. uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."
32410,Raj,any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
30498,Raj,"there are six seasons, dude."
34048,Raj,"i am, but i’ll miss you guys."
31596,Raj,"i can’t do anything right for you, can i?"
34038,Raj,"well, he is much more attractive than leonard."
30073,Raj,"it’s not superstition. it’s practically newtonian. for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. it’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
29547,Raj,she didn’t take my order.
29681,Raj,good story.  
32078,Raj,amy.
31610,Raj,yeah. huh. forty-three? what the hell does that mean?
30054,Raj,if you’re really a prostitute.
30349,Raj,"yeah, thank you. mmmm."
33987,Raj,i don’t want to speak for leonard.
30796,Raj,"oh, grow up. i was lying. i lie all the time. nobody wants to kiss me."
33520,Raj,"oh, dude. the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. i mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. i love america."
30008,Raj,"great, so i can take them both out with a number-two pencil?"
33893,Raj,"yeah, i’m making a bunch of changes. this morning, i fired my dog walker."
33499,Raj,"yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great claire is."
31749,Raj,here you go.
29905,Raj,"it’s got a big bird on it, dude."
29530,Raj,"well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. then there was something about you and… then she hugged me."
29541,Raj,you could power down.
32175,Raj,i’m just being a good house guest.
30501,Raj,"no, he’s doesn’t! he’s lying to you!"
32021,Raj,"you know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you."
33996,Raj,it’s right here.
33630,Raj,yeah?
29911,Raj,then how?
33757,Raj,"and, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let stuart stay."
33095,Raj,what is it?
29859,Raj,"i love this time of the year. the leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air."
32582,Raj,i told you she exists.
32051,Raj,"well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. i just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. all right, here we go, and smile. okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. how about this? turn away, and then turn back into it. but when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
34163,Raj,you really think so?
31062,Raj,"like, to music?"
31908,Raj,"yes. i picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. and then we got pinkberry."
30767,Raj,indy’s young sidekick from temple of doom.
33758,Raj,"for god’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you."
31992,Raj,"oh, great. there go my chances of being sexually harassed."
31519,Raj,"bye, buddy!"
30351,Raj,huh. mmm. good cookies.
32904,Raj,"one jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup."
33244,Raj,"yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours."
33969,Raj,"okay, and tree pose."
32020,Raj,"oh. sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  i mean, yeah, maybe."
31107,Raj,yeah.
29549,Raj,a little bird told us. apparently you are a magnificent beast. 
29787,Raj,"what happens in costume at comic-con, stays at comic-con."
33153,Raj,i’m sorry. i did what i could.
31392,Raj,i’d like to tell them things are going well.
34179,Raj,"okay, emily. yeah, sounds great. see you then."
33237,Raj,low self-esteem.
32243,Raj,"so we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?"
29890,Raj,what’s plan b?
31630,Raj,and what does forty-three mean?
32328,Raj,"what? you’ve kissed, like, once in three years."
32520,Raj,"well, me, neither."
32402,Raj,"okay. penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are altair and vega. and it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the milky way."
33081,Raj,there’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
29662,Raj,it’s possible she may have misunderstood us. 
32453,Raj,not that one.
32574,Raj,we still on for tomorrow night?
31489,Raj,sweet!
30875,Raj,"oh, my god, i’m crying already."
29997,Raj,what am i looking at?
33184,Raj,do you ever do anything for anyone else?
32134,Raj,"can i ask you guys a question? so, i’m seeing lucy tomorrow night, and i’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. how do you do it?"
30488,Raj,"look, let’s be reasonable. we all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and i want a jet ski."
30060,Raj,"a prostitute, yes."
31546,Raj,"hey, stuart, i see you’re getting ready for your halloween party."
29776,Raj,sixty years. used to be a watch factory. 
29685,Raj,maybe so. but you can’t incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass. 
32076,Raj,"it wasn’t a pyjama party. it was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching princess bride."
34013,Raj,"oh, grow up."
30548,Raj,"ah, beer. the magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy indian boy into the life of the party. oh, yeah."
33000,Raj,"no, you have to put this back together right now, so i can return it."
32940,Raj,"but technically, yes."
32997,Raj,"hey, guys."
33428,Raj,"no, no, you’re pregnant. the only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."
31167,Raj,hi.
29833,Raj,really? cool.
31209,Raj,seriously? i’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
29688,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
32886,Raj,"oh, no. hey."
32583,Raj,"you know, he might not reopen. he didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company."
33283,Raj,that’s very mature of you.
32246,Raj,"oh, i have to go to the bathroom so bad."
31463,Raj,"i keep telling you, if i wasn’t an astrophysicist, i would have been a party planner. it was always a coin flip."
31411,Raj,do you hear how homophobic you sound?
33629,Raj,why?
30455,Raj,no. is he still mad about the supercollider?
32188,Raj,"yeah, if your mom could see her little bar mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack."
31839,Raj,shame on all of you.
32988,Raj,"look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. ooh, do you own a t-shirt cannon?"
30449,Raj,the big-boobed weather girl on channel 2?
29857,Raj,good morning. is there some new kind of casual friday i don’t know about?
32459,Raj,what do you mean?
32928,Raj,"wow, so you’re not curious at all?"
31664,Raj,that’s sweet of you. but what can you do to help?
33118,Raj,with pleasure.
31350,Raj,so?
32935,Raj,you’re in a beatles cover band and you need howard to replace your dad as ringo.
33216,Raj,ooh!
30334,Raj,"stop knocking! it’s open! please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and i can’t come home for my cousin sanjay’s wedding."
32374,Raj,any question but that.
33839,Raj,"no, no. i will take care of it."
33728,Raj,i’m here to put the crib together.
31894,Raj,i do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
33147,Raj,"oh, no. at home. the servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. i wish i knew their names."
29642,Raj,somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. 
32338,Raj,"just tell her what i’m really like. and, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. use your own words."
30588,Raj,did you get a japanese love pillow?
31940,Raj,"i’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
33583,Raj,"well, not now."
33102,Raj,"hey, remember the ark of the covenant?"
31755,Raj,sure.
32944,Raj,"anyway, i’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."
32696,Raj,"hey, here comes stuart and his date."
31649,Raj,"you got this, buddy."
32476,Raj,"you know, i heard of this way of watching the movies called the machete order, where you watch episodes iv and v, then skip episode i, watch ii and iii as a flashback, and then finish with vi."
31759,Raj,"no, thank you, mrs. wolowitz. as it is, i’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like i’m a fireman rescuing an infant."
31186,Raj,"dude, what is she saying?"
31118,Raj,rubbish. he’s talking rubbish.
32701,Raj,"oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and i can’t think of a thing to get them."
32240,Raj,"i guess, uh, i’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, i was wrong. i love you. and then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
30992,Raj,"oh, my god, i think you broke my toe!"
32373,Raj,"great, everyone’s a byomkesh bakshi. now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
31722,Raj,okay. did we at least rent the car from enterprise? get it? enterprise? screw you. that’s funny.
33890,Raj,"yes, that is wonderful. you will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
30406,Raj,"yeah, well i do. and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern, i drink a lot. i’ll have a screwdriver, please. don’t be chintzy with the screw."
31283,Raj,"hey, i let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy.  hello?"
33091,Raj,"oh, we could play filk music."
30047,Raj,maybe i can save her.
30468,Raj,"mine says, to raj, from stan lee."
30448,Raj,it’s okay. i don’t mind hearing about your sex life. it’s his that bugs me.
33242,Raj,now i’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
30502,Raj,"well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. i’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s g-string!"
30214,Raj,shall i wait?
30933,Raj,"penny, you became disenchanted with leonard as a lover. would you please tell my sister why?"
33407,Raj,"emily, listen, i’m sorry, but i can’t come by."
30861,Raj,"hey, why am i in charge of phone support? seems a bit racist."
31219,Raj,of course. mrs. cooper. so nice to see you again.
33575,Raj,"oh, that’s a nice one. was it yours when you were little?"
33487,Raj,"yeah, i know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma."
29924,Raj,what’s going on?
32650,Raj,i’m sweating already.
30990,Raj,is something going on with him and bernadette?
30228,Raj,thank you.
30052,Raj,"it’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. she’s exactly his type. a hooker. you know, i bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up."
29916,Raj,"whoa. humongous man crush, dude."
31881,Raj,"uh, lucy’s coming over. i need some advice."
29738,Raj,"so, missy. have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india? "
32474,Raj,"before you go, at least let me pack you some attack of the scones for the road."
32282,Raj,thank you.
29996,Raj,yes?
33425,Raj,busting you.
33994,Raj,"wait, you don’t remember?"
29903,Raj,of course not. look at her.
30763,Raj,"you know, guys, when facing disappointment, eat, pray, love teaches us–"
31779,Raj,everything okay?
30324,Raj,"oh, dude, i wish you had said something before i pounded that last red bull."
30775,Raj,what… what kind of a kiss?
32192,Raj,i’ve never seen it.
33818,Raj,"well, that’s hard to hear, but i’ll still take you back."
30839,Raj,water demon.
32350,Raj,what’s happening tomorrow night?
32624,Raj,that cannot be true.
33564,Raj,he is so afraid of his feelings.
33937,Raj,it’s the least i can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
32418,Raj,"well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
29836,Raj,"i know, i am resplendent like the noonday sun, am i not?"
30100,Raj,"yeah, it was first come, first served."
31976,Raj,"no, it’s not. i haven’t had a drink since last night."
30211,Raj,no.
33453,Raj,"hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?"
29879,Raj,what?
31735,Raj,"two words, 3-d printer. wait, maybe it’s three words. no, hang on. okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-d printer."
31800,Raj,i went and looked. it was a high and tiny window. she must have been very motivated.
30814,Raj,rat-man is nobody’s sidekick.
32670,Raj,the space probe.
30265,Raj,half of it will be mine.
32409,Raj,"but what if one of them asks me what i was up to the night before and i was with the other one? then, what, do i lie?"
29804,Raj,"or as i called it, planet bollywood. anyway, because of my discovery, people magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch."
29864,Raj,hold on a second. kreplach?
34010,Raj,"oh, quick, sit."
33759,Raj,"well, you’re all thinking it, i’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile."
32185,Raj,"sheldon, i think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. she can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
30729,Raj,how hard did she stomp?
33014,Raj,"it’s my father, you jerks. hello, daddy."
34162,Raj,what is wrong with me? why am i so self-destructive?
32032,Raj,"so, uh, who’s in?"
33228,Raj,"is it bad? did you hear something? oh, my god. it’s bad. somebody kill me."
30234,Raj,"my god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. well, let me tell you something. some of those thoughts are pure caca."
31574,Raj,the guy’s a genius. maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
32870,Raj,"oh, emily ran back to the hospital, so i’m just hanging out at her place. what are you, uh, what are you doing?"
30384,Raj,"and a cow and a penguin. face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive."
33963,Raj,"you know, downward-facing dog comes from the sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
31711,Raj,stop!
30192,Raj,i’m sad.
33138,Raj,"oh, fun. let me see. uh, no, no, uh, definitely not."
32698,Raj,"it was our first date, there was an awkward silence. what was i supposed to say?"
31772,Raj,you’re being silly. i can leave whenever i want.
32864,Raj,"it’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
31222,Raj,i’m so lonely.
33901,Raj,"okay, sheldon. yeah, i’m putting you in charge of my finances. i will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize."
30245,Raj,i’m busy.
31071,Raj,"sorry, i’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. rotting zombie. sheldon’s new facebook photo."
32777,Raj,"i didn’t crash it, okay? my playlist was too up-tempo, i got light-headed and i fell off. okay. it all comes down to this."
31601,Raj,"no, we both have to be the same thing. okay, we’re ninjas."
32361,Raj,"good. sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. we even ordered from the thai place he doesn’t like."
30275,Raj,"you know you keep quoting wrath of khan, but he was in next generation. it’s a totally different set of characters."
32372,Raj,or is sherlock holmes the english byomkesh bakshi?
33321,Raj,he lied about the cream cheese. he ate the whole thing. i saw him.
30424,Raj,so does that mean we can go with the girls again?
34188,Raj,huh. that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. we could take some more simulated instrument readings.
30105,Raj,i thought we were going to be gentle with him.
32158,Raj,"no, no, speak up. i’m about to use the blender, and i don’t want to miss anything."
30576,Raj,i don’t put pepper on salads.
33367,Raj,"you know, adam west is my favourite batman? well, after michael keaton, christian bale and batman from the lego movie."
34061,Raj,"hi. oh, let me bring a chair for you. "
33773,Raj,"she’s tired, that was funny."
32131,Raj,"no. oh, is he anything like, uh, mun-mun the mongoose? he taught us not to play with cobras."
31680,Raj,"sometimes i get so lonely, i sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then i put it in my right hand and pretend i’m holding hands with another person."
31201,Raj,"i have a surprise for you. cover your eyes. open them. it’s a real ruby. it was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. although, the people at cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  oh, mummy, daddy. what a nice surprise."
33619,Raj,so why don’t you get it fixed?
33057,Raj,whatever. it would have been nice to hear it from you.
33811,Raj,"i did do that. i can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. howard, would you write that down?"
33679,Raj,"oh, so, you are unencumbered?"
34019,Raj,"hey. yeah. hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
33638,Raj,yes.
31834,Raj,"well, put your mind at ease. i’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks howard’s dinner party’s ass. now, the first thing we need is a theme. i’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century moulin rouge."
31398,Raj,"that’s unbreakable by khloe and lamar. and for your information, it’s unisex."
33060,Raj,"you don’t have to, you should want to."
30040,Raj,"i’m telling you, leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. disneyland can suck it. this is the real happiest place on earth."
32679,Raj,the gun from hellboy?
31258,Raj,how about that guy? he looks like he’d hate you.
34096,Raj,"wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from india. i want you to meet my parents."
34091,Raj,"hey, guess what. i’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. "
30705,Raj,"two words, deaf chick. it doesn’t matter if i can’t talk, because she can’t hear me."
31097,Raj,"sheldon, dinner!"
29666,Raj,okay. how about that one.
31611,Raj,maybe. it’s a prime number. encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
30153,Raj,"yes, very nice."
33635,Raj,"then again, he did think you were my husband."
31096,Raj,"well, that seems fair."
29674,Raj,unbelievable.
32277,Raj,"owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
32375,Raj,i can’t tell you that. but perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
30781,Raj,how do you know that?
31333,Raj,"oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated."
31368,Raj,"but e-excuse me, i have something to say. none of you may realize it, but i was very much looking forward to this weekend. it was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? even if i get one someday, i’ll still be the guy who got a girl after sheldon cooper!"
29683,Raj,i like it.
31851,Raj,"good day, mrs. davis. this is dr. rajesh koothrappali from the astrophysics department. don’t be alarmed, i’m not really in space. anyhoo, i’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video."
31456,Raj,you weren’t?
31395,Raj,"like, dude on dude, but with women?"
31922,Raj,i like your bangs.
32977,Raj,"so, i’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. when you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it."
30645,Raj,that’s my joke. i told it last night. you can’t just use it.
30145,Raj,enjoy oxnard. i’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
32143,Raj,"well, and i ate all the crumb cake. we both made mistakes."
30111,Raj,"well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
29741,Raj,have you ever heard of the kama sutra? 
30411,Raj,no. i’m looking for a hookup.
31043,Raj,"we’re scientists. we observe everything. here, go buy yourself a scone."
29926,Raj,"oh, snap."
29989,Raj,really? i just made it up. have you seen slumdog millionaire?
30306,Raj,"you’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
30273,Raj,"sheldon, it’s your play. sheldon."
30773,Raj,is that racist? it feels racist.
31504,Raj,you sure?
31948,Raj,okay. i have a request to make.
30822,Raj,"oh, yeah? what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"
29744,Raj,we indians invented them. you’re welcome.
33024,Raj,"face it, dude, bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship."
33579,Raj,i skipped spin class for this.
33753,Raj,you’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
33882,Raj,not really.
30980,Raj,it’s a re-writable cd. just put it in.
29858,Raj,but you finished your experiment a week ago.
30086,Raj,"but if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."
29860,Raj,isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
32414,Raj,"you look, you look really pretty tonight."
33644,Raj,"oh my god, that’s who you look like."
29602,Raj,"for what, making me sound like a simpsons character? "
32829,Raj,"what? the, the guy who plays jon snow was a jerk. we still watch game of thrones."
29724,Raj,"i’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony. "
31866,Raj,"i was googling that girl i’ve been dating, and i found her blog."
30018,Raj,"guys, have you seen stuart all up in penny’s business over there?"
31584,Raj,he probably just goes to the bathroom.
32723,Raj,"wrong, smarty-pants. it’s everything is awesome from the lego movie."
32779,Raj,"hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company."
34063,Raj,so what do you guys think that’s about?
30825,Raj,wait. what the hell is ding?
31218,Raj,"i couldn’t find you guys so i bought six new friends. three, sadly, are dead."
31684,Raj,damn it.
29553,Raj,"what? just because i’m indian i can’t be a norse god? no, no, no, raj has to be an indian god. that’s racism. i mean, look at wolowitz, he’s not english, but he’s dressed like peter pan. sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the doppler effect. "
31900,Raj,uncle howard. cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
32179,Raj,hang on.
33674,Raj,thank you.
31920,Raj,"i, uh, i’m sorry to put you through that."
31163,Raj,you know who i blame for my loneliness? the united states of america. your movies and your tv shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
31198,Raj,"aha. i see what’s going on here. you and i had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman."
32262,Raj,you know i struggle with batman.
30337,Raj,"oh, that is completely below the belt. sheldon, tell my parents that howard and i are just friends. sheldon? howard and i are just friends! fine. i’ll come home for sanjay’s wedding."
32063,Raj,"what? another one. you know, it, it’s weird. when they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? like they see you naked?"
31560,Raj,no.
33877,Raj,"oh, please. look in the mirror. you both look ten years older than i do."
32052,Raj,"okay, uh, let’s try it again. uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you."
30780,Raj,"excuse me. i can’t be drinking, i’m about to make an important scientific discovery here."
29770,Raj,did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
29734,Raj,"okay, leonard, put down the box, let’s talk."
33144,Raj,i had a great time last night.
31383,Raj,it’s different. you’re people don’t worship lox.
31130,Raj,oh. all right.
31039,Raj,"forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful."
30900,Raj,"of course, of course. now when you say look after, you mean…"
33067,Raj,"oh, not just him, you’re coming, too."
33643,Raj,"if we’re all gonna die, why am i eating so much kale?"
31654,Raj,"oh, man, the first monster i see, i’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
33641,Raj,i’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
33474,Raj,i would love to. i do enjoy the complexity of an aged pinot noir.
29627,Raj,"maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, papa. "
30769,Raj,"come on, guys! hurry up! hurry up!"
30568,Raj,you don’t know that. prison changes people.
31994,Raj,"you know, i recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
31853,Raj,where have you been?
31005,Raj,this was nice.
33883,Raj,the housekeeper does the shopping.
30887,Raj,"well, thanks, bernadette. and just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander."
33059,Raj,and i’m just hearing about this now?
32978,Raj,"hang on. building on what leonard said, no one built on what i said."
33094,Raj,really?
31228,Raj,you have a thing of paper clips right there.
29958,Raj,"oh, cool, i got a sword."
32845,Raj,"yeah. mrs. wolowitz was pretty special. when i first moved to america, howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought i was the gardener."
30165,Raj,are you happy now?
33282,Raj,"yeah, i calmed her down, but she’s not going to vegas if he’s going."
29957,Raj,we’re on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown.
31453,Raj,all right. more sailor moon for me.
30665,Raj,pardon?
30118,Raj,"yeah, but since you and penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
33741,Raj,fine. what do one point three billion people know about having babies?
31152,Raj,i’ll try it. like this?
33259,Raj,"yeah, s-so it’s, like, kooper with a k?"
33491,Raj,you can’t let this stop you. almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
32216,Raj,you mean like fatties and uggos?
33903,Raj,"okay, you’re right, i got myself into this, but i’ve never missed a comic-con with you guys."
33253,Raj,i kind of like chicken fingers.
32466,Raj,"then, why do you watch these things?"
33038,Raj,"baloney, okay? you two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as i am."
29532,Raj,oooh.
31840,Raj,"couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?"
33334,Raj,but i just broke up with my girlfriend.
31417,Raj,"i don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
33196,Raj,"so, listen to what he wrote. uh, i saw you play at the comic book store. you guys rock. and then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."
32399,Raj,"and then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from india were exotic and mysterious. so, with my mouth, i said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, i said, straight up, red, hop on my flying carpet."
33155,Raj,"well, it’s easy to find out. just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
30530,Raj,fine. you’re in sheldon square.
31932,Raj,lucy?
30562,Raj,all right. would you mind if i went to your room and downloaded some asian pornography?
32358,Raj,"he’s in texas, he’ll never know."
30731,Raj,dude! i put that thing on my face!
33660,Raj,you’re welcome.
29711,Raj,"if my fingers ever work again, i’ve got a job for the middle one. "
30268,Raj,"oh, what a coincidence. maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. sign here."
31888,Raj,probably because i didn’t read the instructions. no wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. unless his name is jay-z.
34097,Raj,"hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. i’m not drunk."
31436,Raj,"anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. uh, you travel through the vineyards. there’s a tasting on board. and all the wild flowers are in bloom. it’s magic."
32852,Raj,"well, that’s what the bullies at bruce lee’s high school thought. and then, bam. karate."
33930,Raj,"hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with penny? is there hair everywhere? does she use your loofah?"
30827,Raj,"i say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?"
33923,Raj,"that would be amazing. i was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
31019,Raj,"excuse me. i’m going to go wander the streets alone. invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  i forgot my windbreaker. it’s chilly."
31481,Raj,sorry i started without you. i’m a little nervous. it’s been a long time since i’ve been on a date.
31508,Raj,amen to that. sometimes i pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
31009,Raj,what can i do? i can’t stop thinking about her.
31473,Raj,peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
31036,Raj,"i’m a scientist. my ability to think is my bread and butter. i’m afraid if i take this, i might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
32467,Raj,sure.
31234,Raj,"mm, i’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
33477,Raj,funny how that worked out.
33553,Raj,wail till i snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
32001,Raj,"mrs. davis, i, uh, i must confess, i came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead i got to connect with you at a human level. that’s a much better evening. you’re a lovely person."
32470,Raj,"hey, penny. happy star wars day."
32378,Raj,"yeah, i was. i was 200 pounds by the time i was in middle school. kids were mean. cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. anyway, i was pretty lonely, so i had to make up my own stories and games, and i promised myself if i ever made any friends that, that i would play those games with them."
30408,Raj,he’ll have a shirley temple.
33159,Raj,you’re not wrong about fruit stripe. i was always a hubba bubba man.
33659,Raj,"oh, please, allow me. that’s a lot of empty calories."
30936,Raj,all the more shame that will fall upon the house of hofstadter.
30158,Raj,"well, i am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. when there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
29974,Raj,did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
29799,Raj,i always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian?
31727,Raj,"what do you think, sheldon? want an action figure that looks just like you?"
32817,Raj,see? better with the accent.
32235,Raj,prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
33587,Raj,okay. how thelma and louise of us.
33885,Raj,i thought we were best friends?
32934,Raj,"a kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
32043,Raj,"yes, exactly. where is the coin? why don’t you look in your pockets? i slipped them in there earlier today."
31113,Raj,what is it to you?
32028,Raj,"no, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. so, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
33646,Raj,eating cake on the toilet single. 
30402,Raj,what?
33866,Raj,hello.
31905,Raj,hmm. interesting. did they take a walk down liars’ lane?
32833,Raj,thanks.
30935,Raj,"i’m not being a child. leonard, i swear to god, if your sister ever comes to town, i shall have my way with her."
30283,Raj,no! not enchanted bunny!
33955,Raj,wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
31265,Raj,what’s that?
33949,Raj,"well, i texted you, but you didn’t respond. leonard and penny were arguing."
29567,Raj,how about soup?
30738,Raj,"oh, yeah? what’s that look like?"
32239,Raj,yes. arlene. she wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
33303,Raj,i wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
34014,Raj,"oh, hey, guys. come in."
33354,Raj,it’s true. i like my giant ipad and my little ipad almost as much as my regular-sized ipad.
33701,Raj,"well, prepare to be mortified. i let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because i do. also, i know they’re pretty, but i’m scared of butterflies."
29978,Raj,"sheldon, you have two choices. either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town."
33863,Raj,you did?
30224,Raj,"sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
33639,Raj,"you have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride."
33744,Raj,"you see, i was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so i took a peek."
32213,Raj,can we bring anything?
30833,Raj,"oh, yeah? well, i’ve been taking pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a hershey bar."
32832,Raj,"don’t know why he’s so grumpy. i got mistaken for that guy in life of pi once, and i’m still floating."
29658,Raj,"as it turns out, yes."
32947,Raj,hey. thanks for coming by.
33609,Raj,hello.
30167,Raj,what is your mother going to say?
32161,Raj,hmm. wonder what she sees in leonard.
29853,Raj,over what?
33140,Raj,you know he won’t be looking at other girls.
33931,Raj,"okay, well, if i move in, you can’t use mine. hold on a second. hey, howard, uh, how’s the wi-fi in the garage?"
31110,Raj,"hey, you totally got that right! e equals m c squared."
32493,Raj,"emily, hey."
33947,Raj,thank you. i appreciate that.
31146,Raj,"please, penny, let me. we’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower."
32205,Raj,"come on, leonard, dinner."
30928,Raj,"yeah, but you were just sleeping, because i forboded you to have sex."
33683,Raj,"maybe there are other things we have in common. come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
31226,Raj,i had pee his pants.
32776,Raj,yes.
29964,Raj,"yeah, you’re like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family."
30132,Raj,i wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
30050,Raj,why don’t we take him to see the blue man group?
32853,Raj,"hang on. okay. given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
32339,Raj,teams are fun.
30229,Raj,yes.
30616,Raj,since when?
30563,Raj,doesn’t have to be asian.
33558,Raj,is it even possible to get this done in two months?
30644,Raj,now can we have cookies and hawaiian punch?
31903,Raj,"yes. also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it."
31603,Raj,are you sure?
30677,Raj,but i can’t have one.
32908,Raj,i would like to propose a salon topic.
32165,Raj,and the other half licking my face. that’s why i’m brushing her teeth.
29884,Raj,are you joking? star trek v is the standard against which all badness is measured.
29751,Raj,"she’s not hiding. she needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. oh, and then i believe she has to wash her hair. "
29665,Raj,we need a social catalyst.
33464,Raj,"it’s not what i have, it’s how many people i’m having it with."
32003,Raj,good night.
31162,Raj,"no, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. sheldon’s with amy, howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister."
33515,Raj,is there a window around here we don’t know about?
33221,Raj,i don’t know. have you ever seen a movie with stuart before?
33288,Raj,"she built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. you know what i saw you do today? eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."
32144,Raj,"i’m so happy you asked me here, and i hope we can hang out again sometime. you know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
33171,Raj,"maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. you know what they say, opposites attract."
33511,Raj,you sure?
31570,Raj,"because when i use my regular voice, i feel like i’m making fun of them."
34003,Raj,"uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on colorado boulevard."
31777,Raj,"oh, my god. she’s not gonna bathe me, is she?"
33785,Raj,it looks like a map from dungeons and dragons. 
34009,Raj,yeah.
30567,Raj,look at this. do you think she’s really doing that or is it photoshop?
32885,Raj,"you know, it, it’s bad enough that i have to deal with this…"
32993,Raj,"oh, you’re where that bill goes."
30431,Raj,there’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
31483,Raj,"you know, amy, i don’t even think you and i have had a real conversation. let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. you start."
33045,Raj,end things? i’m trying to tell you that i love you.
32771,Raj,"before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"
31540,Raj,"oh, yeah, we hang out all the time."
33042,Raj,i think we should talk.
31007,Raj,my sister told me.
30019,Raj,"may i have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
30859,Raj,"no. you take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. why does everything have to be dirty with you?"
29560,Raj,"we can split it two, two and two."
34034,Raj,"okay. shall we? oh, my god. it’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. you don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
31140,Raj,cool. all right friend.
30437,Raj,screw you. give me back my lima beans.
33006,Raj,"well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. let’s talk about you."
31532,Raj,the fantastic four reunited.
29789,Raj,"h-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking leonard for not moving on. dude, you have totally not moved on."
33970,Raj,"the bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? you didn’t get any food."
33337,Raj,"yes. whenever things are going well, i always find a way to ruin it. you two look happy, how do you do it?"
33212,Raj,i wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
32748,Raj,actually.
34062,Raj,what just happened?
33022,Raj,how old is this jell-o?
32565,Raj,"you suck, wolowitz."
32274,Raj,except i’ll be alone.
30700,Raj,"it’s not gonna work, dude, i grew up in india, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
29940,Raj,really? i once saw him shopping at ralph’s. he was buying tequila.
33053,Raj,and you didn’t think to tell me?
31507,Raj,perfect for the night i’m having. thank you.
30551,Raj,"yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from men in black."
32815,Raj,"guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."
32806,Raj,"thank you. ‘cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
32709,Raj,how can i be okay? i come from a broken home.
33190,Raj,me.
30627,Raj,"okay, how about this. even spock had a date once every seven years."
31189,Raj,"good, good. oh, boy, help me out here. does she want me to kiss her or not?"
31083,Raj,i was sleeping.
33798,Raj,"it’s okay, i’m fine."
29874,Raj,"oh, pause it. that’s it. confirmed. we now have the address of the top model house."
33406,Raj,i don’t think so. she sounded pretty upset.
33308,Raj,"all right. i’ve made up my mind. i’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that i’m in a relationship."
33688,Raj,welcome.
34134,Raj,no!
31819,Raj,"go out with me on one date, and i promise you, you’ll see."
32712,Raj,better. i guess the news just hit me a lot harder than i expected.
29758,Raj,what else? sell it on ebay as slightly used. 
30489,Raj,"gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
31862,Raj,you’re right. this is beneath me. lie your mother was last night.
31030,Raj,"i, uh, i guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down."
32660,Raj,but you’re okay with superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
32780,Raj,"if it’s okay with you, i’d like to go to temple."
31913,Raj,i’m actually glad lucy had to work tonight. saved me the awkward conversation about how i was gonna be hanging with my bros.
30426,Raj,"oh, god! yes, we get it. you have a girlfriend now."
30032,Raj,"is it me, or was that sheldon’s way of saying vegas baby!"
29582,Raj,"okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
31237,Raj,i really don’t get your problem with birds.
31801,Raj,"why not? with online shopping and overnight delivery, i can get anything i want. look, i just ordered a case of dinty moore beef stew and two live lobsters on amazon."
31825,Raj,"excuse me, i thought we were trying to solve my problem?"
33384,Raj,maybe you’re right.
32280,Raj,"oh, is cinnamon gonna be okay?"
33182,Raj,nice try. it only recognizes my voice.
31732,Raj,you! always bet on black.
33252,Raj,a medium-sized asteroid.
30622,Raj,really? us gonna tell him?
30151,Raj,"light beers? well, wiki-how about that?"
31221,Raj,no. 
33250,Raj,"unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet."
32717,Raj,"you know, i thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then i found his dentures and realized it’s also gross."
32591,Raj,"well, i would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list."
30427,Raj,"no, i’m not jealous. all right, i’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. now, can we order?"
32825,Raj,"dude, i, i think that’s nathan fillion."
33203,Raj,"let’s see. uh, his name is trent monaco."
30770,Raj,you know who’s got to be the bravest person in the marvel universe? whoever has to give she-hulk a bikini wax.
31844,Raj,"i agree. that is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before."
31124,Raj,do you think i have a shot with penny?
30725,Raj,what were you doing with priya?
29713,Raj,"oh yeah. the guy who lives next to me is always like, i have a jacuzzi on my balcony, i have a jacuzzi on my balcony. but wait until i tell him, i’ve got a time machine on my balcony. stuff that in your speedos, jacuzzi bob!"
32057,Raj,"well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business."
33833,Raj,you’re such a child.
33279,Raj,"no, come on, please don’t leave."
32543,Raj,so are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
30447,Raj,"fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with penny."
30112,Raj,"boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
34074,Raj,she’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
31672,Raj,it’s true. i’m always attracted to women i can’t have. i do it all the time. i did the same thing with the two of you.
32755,Raj,"what do you mean, not again?"
30389,Raj,i don’t want to do that.
31272,Raj,what’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
33358,Raj,"groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. tell me this isn’t like the best episode of sex and the city."
34037,Raj,why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
30436,Raj,"okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and i’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and i hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
33195,Raj,but someone joined our page. we have an actual fan.
32004,Raj,and then some. i think we had a moment.
21791,Raj,"me, too."
31468,Raj,"guys, when i look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, it fills my, heart, okay, i’m going to need a minute."
34029,Raj,"you know who’s a super-ager? jennifer lopez. like, what is her secret?"
31018,Raj,i have to feel sorry for myself. i’m the only one who cares. just like i’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
32529,Raj,"you know what? that may be it. by the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. like, i fell off a few times."
31098,Raj,this is the difference between eating and dining.
32440,Raj,since when do you go to spin class?
33433,Raj,of course. i’ll give you guys some space. let me just get this out of your way.
32437,Raj,"god, you never listen."
33607,Raj,hello?
29920,Raj,okay. what shall be first to taste the wrath of monte?
31310,Raj,are you not looking at me? i am brown dynamite. why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
32241,Raj,he’ll be so upset. he’ll probably climb up the empire state building and start swatting at planes.
30125,Raj,"yeah, you…"
33869,Raj,"yeah, it was. but it’s my father’s money and i’m mad at him."
31314,Raj,their meatballs are pretty good.
33050,Raj,"yeah. come on, i’ll give you a ride."
33287,Raj,"i’m sorry, and how much money did your version of frozen make?"
33985,Raj,"no, no, penny, don’t dismiss his feelings."
32774,Raj,i know.
32344,Raj,stop that? okay.
31650,Raj,you can do it.
30893,Raj,just that i’m definitely not gay.
31652,Raj,"yeah, okay, howard wins."
33657,Raj,"oh, well, nice to meet you."
31890,Raj,i don’t know. maybe it’s all those steroids i’ve been taking.
31187,Raj,what? why?
32404,Raj,"uh, xbox one."
32595,Raj,thanks for inviting us over.
33243,Raj,"fine, you want something to do? there’s about six months of data on this hard drive. why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."
30751,Raj,"my country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, it’s really great."
30348,Raj,good idea. they’ll be refreshed.
33213,Raj,"and he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from footprints on the moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"
33622,Raj,"it’s okay. it’s by choice. well, their choice, and it’s not okay."
29815,Raj,"actually, 2008 nq sub 17 is a planetary body."
32981,Raj,"well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."
31136,Raj,"oh, good. um, can i tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? kind of a candle in the wind deal?"
29720,Raj,"ooh, how far into the future?"
32008,Raj,"no, not a thing."
32967,Raj,"ooh. ooh, ooh. we could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
33255,Raj,you dream different than me.
31068,Raj,he takes the elf from off the shelf.
34071,Raj,dr. nowitzki. good to see you.
32563,Raj,250 million years.
30263,Raj,what about the money?
34082,Raj,whatever.
32215,Raj,are possums cute?
30001,Raj,go. 
30829,Raj,"no, it’s chilly outside. didn’t bring my jacket."
31482,Raj,you should go to my girl. she’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
32745,Raj,should have put it in the bag first.
33051,Raj,i can’t believe you made out with mandy chao.
32507,Raj,"i don’t understand it. i’m a nice guy, i have a great job, i’m well-educated, come from a good family. why don’t women want to be with me?"
32172,Raj,"good morning, everybody. i picked up coffee while i was out. bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha."
33591,Raj,"happy and well-fed. you see, that’s what i’m taking from that story."
31348,Raj,"well, at least you finally got a window that opens. that’s nice."
33972,Raj,it’s nice to see you taking an interest in amy’s work.
31962,Raj,"a little one. it’s, it’s a farewell for leonard, so all the attention will be on him. if you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
29544,Raj,why don’t you just have robert e. lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh.
32854,Raj,"ooh, uh, emily gets off work soon. why don’t the four of us go out?"
32965,Raj,bees talk to each other by dancing. whales have their songs.
29575,Raj,and this is leonard and sheldon’s apartment. 
31090,Raj,"okay, deal."
33518,Raj,"no, i was just thinking about jurassic world. boy, that was terrible."
30072,Raj,"of course you feel terrible. you completely screwed up your karma, dude."
33727,Raj,"yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local montessori school for the new arrival."
29883,Raj,"yeah, star trek v, worse than i."
31454,Raj,"well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
31207,Raj,"oh, penny, i hurt so bad."
32939,Raj,"listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road."
29774,Raj,i hate trains. 
33827,Raj,"but theoretically, if you and i were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? like, print up announcements?"
30774,Raj,"oh, okay. good. i don’t need more comics. howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and indian monopoly."
30932,Raj,my sister.
31091,Raj,"he’s right. a minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips."
32657,Raj,getting kind of grim.
33194,Raj,"it’s not a big deal. it just took, like, five minutes to set up."
34182,Raj,that’s equally effective.
29791,Raj,why?
31362,Raj,i can never find the tiller. i got a book; it didn’t help.
34152,Raj,"all right, teams. get ready to open your first puzzle. go. do you see what i did? the first puzzle is a puzzle. oh, my god, how adorable is that? i wish i had a friend like me."
31214,Raj,then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
33398,Raj,really? i’m sorry. i swear i know other words.
33719,Raj,"hey, stuart. what are you doing here?"
31628,Raj,aah! it’s eating his face!
33802,Raj,"that’s actually not a bad idea. maybe i could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me."
32363,Raj,stuart?
30564,Raj,"no, i won’t."
33296,Raj,"yeah, i get that. i’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
30989,Raj,what does that mean?
29528,Raj,"also, the pretty girl left."
31729,Raj,they’re here. our action figures have arrived. this is the best five hundred dollars i’ve ever spent.
31620,Raj,"yeah, me, too. we’ve got more important things to do. who cares what stupid forty-three means?"
30350,Raj,"yeah, very tasty. well, so tell me more about these teachers."
31148,Raj,this is fun. i’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
32804,Raj,i don’t think that’s what you want at all.
30553,Raj,"oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again."
33534,Raj,may i ask what this is about?
33417,Raj,i need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
33462,Raj,"really? because usually we walk side by side, and i just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."
29709,Raj,cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
33850,Raj,how is that a t?
30572,Raj,"hey, do you think the elastic woman in the incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
33997,Raj,"nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
30081,Raj,what do you think the problem is?
31707,Raj,"and we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done."
32334,Raj,"i know. powerful stuff, huh?"
32766,Raj,"no, i’m not okay. i feel like i’m gonna jump out of my skin."
29767,Raj,he was a lot more fun when he had no hope. 
32607,Raj,we could go up to big bear and get a house on the lake.
29535,Raj,"oooh, he’s got me."
32237,Raj,megan pincus.
33621,Raj,"actually, i’m single now."
30809,Raj,did he get superpowers?
31343,Raj,how about you decide this with rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock?
32309,Raj,"um, okay. first off, know that we all love you and cherish you."
32931,Raj,"you know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit."
33104,Raj,"runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but i couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder."
30116,Raj,to what? toy story?
33788,Raj,why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
32667,Raj,"if you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable."
31282,Raj,"grab a corner. whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? savour the moment."
32156,Raj,"great. that makes one of you. okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. that’s right, i see you. okay, if you have any questions, i’ll be over here basting my ass off. focus is key."
31590,Raj,we just told you.
29699,Raj,fifteen seconds.
29786,Raj,doesn’t count.
32287,Raj,"oh, actually that’s a van dyke. a goatee is just hair on the chin."
31954,Raj,why? so you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
32365,Raj,he’s been murdered by someone in this room.
32515,Raj,"of course. please, come in."
32665,Raj,"sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop."
30174,Raj,engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
29821,Raj,"it’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and i it. they shot me in front of a starry background where i posed like this.  they’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."
32894,Raj,of course. what?
33590,Raj,"bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? you’re gonna be an amazing mom. even if you don’t believe it, i know you have maternal instincts."
30373,Raj,"i didn’t come to help, i came to mock."
30391,Raj,"dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. look. at the glendale galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to swing music in the center court near macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? a salute to zoot. sounds like a hoot."
29684,Raj,then we can be the bengal tigers.
30301,Raj,fine. paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
30538,Raj,interesting. that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. you know what i’m talking about.
30104,Raj,"for me, it was a bonding moment."
30316,Raj,i’d like that. this is turning out to be a perfect saturday.
32024,Raj,"a little loud, dude."
31750,Raj,"what, you don’t say thank you?"
30520,Raj,no.
32622,Raj,go online and look it up.
31141,Raj,i’ll see you around.
33427,Raj,no spoilers. no spoilers.
32182,Raj,"oh, what did i do?"
31467,Raj,"howard and bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers."
32638,Raj,"it’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."
31021,Raj,"come on, sheldon, open the door."
32096,Raj,"well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
31341,Raj,"would you look at this? i paid twenty five dollars to some kid on ebay for a handcrafted harry potter wand. he sent me a stick. he went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
31704,Raj,that is so cool.
29917,Raj,"sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear."
30695,Raj,no. it’s too brobdingnagian.
30366,Raj,"actually, i’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
33033,Raj,what difference does it make?
34139,Raj,it’s locked.
30207,Raj,"you know, he’s british, i’m indian, ever since gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
33069,Raj,"this van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, richard feynman."
32917,Raj,"we are. we are. oh, no. what a terrible serve. sorry, brother."
31159,Raj,what kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
33107,Raj,just be honest. you don’t like it.
30142,Raj,"yeah, well, i don’t like bugs, okay? they freak me out."
34170,Raj,don’t forgive them. stay mad at them.
33681,Raj,that’s a cute age. they can do so many things.
33686,Raj,"oh, yes. oh, okay. uh, good night. i don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but i feel like something is happening between us."
31382,Raj,"listen, i love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here."
31056,Raj,"your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? oh, yeah, that can only be good for you."
30039,Raj,sounds like a plan.
33037,Raj,you’re one to talk. you’ve been complaining about stuart living here for the past year. i don’t see you showing him the door.
32142,Raj,"please, sit. i, uh, i got you a cappuccino. i remembered it was your favourite. i also got crumb cake, but i remembered it was my favourite and i ate it. anyway, uh, how are you?"
32380,Raj,from the future? how fun and imaginative.
33516,Raj,"yeah, of course. what else could it be? boy, do i love america."
30368,Raj,"in fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
33980,Raj,i thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
31647,Raj,"if you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. do you know how many beef wellingtons i made by myself before i invited you guys over? i’ll give you a hint. you can see them here, here and here."
30390,Raj,what about me?
33145,Raj,what? i thought we were all… never mind.
32417,Raj,"no. i, i have no idea. what would you do?"
32033,Raj,"okay, everybody. who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. the first team that finds it wins."
29571,Raj,i’m all out. 
30043,Raj,"why, yes, i love to party. party is my middle name. or it would be, if it weren’t ramayan."
33115,Raj,that is so not true.
33346,Raj,"if it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in december, congratulations, you’re the first one."
32957,Raj,"okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the golden record on voyager, were heavily criticized."
30601,Raj,"follow my lead. almost. we’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
33129,Raj,"oh, yeah, right. sorry. my name is puss in boots. you killed my father. prepare to die."
33218,Raj,wait. you’re sure they’re star wars tickets?
31191,Raj,i was so smooth on that date.
30251,Raj,i’ll take the job. see you monday.
29638,Raj,go for stereo. 
30947,Raj,okay.
30347,Raj,"so, what are we waiting for?"
34155,Raj,"yes. okay. i, i understand. of course, yes. i’ll call you tomorrow. bye."
31342,Raj,"ooh, limited edition. nice."
33872,Raj,"thank you, penny."
32082,Raj,"no, if i buy those, i just go through them like candy."
33248,Raj,"okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found."
33766,Raj,really?
32539,Raj,i thought stuart was looking after her.
31718,Raj,great. we can still make it to comic-con.
33800,Raj,"now that sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?"
30578,Raj,"guys, help me."
29538,Raj,like who?
29993,Raj,"you mean one of the hopeless geeks? no. those are crazy people. howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. now, him, he’s one of those geeks."
33787,Raj,it’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
29959,Raj,here.
32788,Raj,"well, lots of scientists believe in god. okay? newton, uh, faraday, uh, pascal, all were believers. even einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that god does not play dice with the universe."
31263,Raj,that’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
31539,Raj,"just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots i bought him for his birthday."
30452,Raj,"oh. well, then i anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
33380,Raj,"you know, i have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her."
32150,Raj,"oh, it’s okay. i have no morals and i’m desperately lonely. i’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
30640,Raj,"a-all right, um, how about this. when, when winnie the pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."
32729,Raj,"well, he could have been hit by a bus. you don’t know."
32914,Raj,you could play ping-pong for it.
33418,Raj,leonard and howard don’t have a flat. they went to the movies. look.
32186,Raj,"and, amy, you need to be patient with sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
31622,Raj,what the balls is forty-three?
31059,Raj,"you’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal."
34175,Raj,what fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
33989,Raj,i’m a good listener.
31715,Raj,insurance is gonna buy you a new car. it’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
29835,Raj,"hey, buddy. i’m going to be in people magazine."
31286,Raj,"yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. we hardly know each other. how about a cup of coffee?"
33595,Raj,no.
30632,Raj,whoo-hoo!
32514,Raj,hey.
30565,Raj,you really think so?
31577,Raj,it’ll be okay.
31739,Raj,not to mention malibu koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
30552,Raj,let me ask you a question. do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
30296,Raj,"with a woman you were chasing through a park? that’s not a shot, that’s a felony. what’s worse, it cost me my prized patang fighting kite. sheldon, i don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?"
29773,Raj,"well you can’t stay with me, i have a teeny tiny apartment. "
31585,Raj,it’s sad that you know that.
32496,Raj,"what do you mean, not really?"
29740,Raj,a hog? you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. 
30624,Raj,"right, okay. what are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
31457,Raj,"oh, please. i don’t remember the episode of star trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
30612,Raj,holy crap.
34075,Raj,i could have made her very happy.
31032,Raj,"sheldon, listen to me. i have a big decision to make, and i’m scared."
29667,Raj,are you crying?
31884,Raj,come in.
32932,Raj,enough chitchat. how do we know you are who you say you are?
30101,Raj,thanks.
30560,Raj,"well, i need a wingman. i don’t want to come off like a lonely loser."
29943,Raj,"yeah, he’s a ginormous knob."
31114,Raj,"yeah, right. you’re just jealous because it turns out i’m penny’s number two choice after leonard."
32478,Raj,wow.
31346,Raj,"i’m happy for you, sheldon. but i have to admit i’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
31347,Raj,thank you.
31089,Raj,can i bring girls here?
32392,Raj,thank you. i thought it was inspired.
29921,Raj,"okay. ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the magic eight ball."
33902,Raj,"i can’t believe penny’s gonna get to go, and i’m not."
31712,Raj,"i’ll call 911. what, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants."
30684,Raj,can you say it again for me?
29603,Raj,i didn’t want to make this one.
33734,Raj,"oh, hey, bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. the giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
29543,Raj,"of course, but it’s all indian food. you can’t find a bagel in mumbai to save your life. schmear me."
32368,Raj,"lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?"
31175,Raj,then spell it.
32750,Raj,"no, you’re the one who let him in."
31123,Raj,"i will. hey, bernadette?"
31977,Raj,i am. and now i’m crying for a whole different reason!
33323,Raj,and that’s how mommy and daddy met.
32152,Raj,"hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
31731,Raj,this sucks.
31245,Raj,"stuart, settle an argument for us. who would win, billy the kid or the white wizard?"
30894,Raj,uh-huh.
31271,Raj,"wow, that’s rough. where’d you get that?"
31117,Raj,"he’s the hindu version of cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
30648,Raj,"that’s two, dude. write your own jokes."
31648,Raj,"no. but if you catch anything, i know how to steam it in banana leaves."
33705,Raj,"excuse me, but i’m indian."
29861,Raj,"damn, there’s always a catch."
32816,Raj,"yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. focus on those."
29630,Raj,this has nothing to do with my sperm count.
30889,Raj,"dude, that’s incredible!"
33209,Raj,"from there, it was easy to find him on instagram, snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
31549,Raj,"yeah, you’ll love it. ain’t no party like a koothra-party."
33492,Raj,"hey, claire. good, you’re here. guys, this is my friend claire. we’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it."
33831,Raj,"oh, you want to bet? you never exercise."
31278,Raj,i guess it didn’t go well.
32469,Raj,may the fourth be with you?
32160,Raj,wonder what she saw in that guy.
32366,Raj,welcome to another classic koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
33482,Raj,"hi, yeah. um, i was wondering, if you’re free saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
33965,Raj,"hey, we wrote the kama sutra. if it involves butts, there’s a word for it."
33925,Raj,"uh, yeah. why do you ask?"
29980,Raj,what’s wrong with jiffy lubes?
31915,Raj,"hey, come on, guys, focus. um, uh, oh, mighty nicolas cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  oh, lucy’s free after all. see ya."
31514,Raj,"uh, thank you for the drink."
31220,Raj,"nothing, i’m fine."
33405,Raj,"hey, so, listen, claire, change of plans…"
30483,Raj,"wait, wait. sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. how much is something like this worth?"
32937,Raj,i get it. what do you want to do?
33479,Raj,"they know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions."
29745,Raj,"why should i back off, you back off dude."
30144,Raj,i’m from new delhi. maybe you should find another entomologist.
33906,Raj,but you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
31174,Raj,i worked on it all night. use it.
32054,Raj,"almost. oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
33136,Raj,hello.
31010,Raj,shut your ass!
30843,Raj,a milk dud?
31344,Raj,is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
30808,Raj,"just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies."
30326,Raj,"well, excuse me, i don’t think penny’s out of line at all. you don’t own her. it’s like my girl, beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”"
33570,Raj,you have to get to it eventually.
30902,Raj,"got it. take care. i guess i have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."
32634,Raj,yup.
33154,Raj,that is so generous of you. i’d like to switch sides.
29840,Raj,"okey dokey, let’s roll. alright, it’s time to raise the roof. oo-ooh, oo-ooh."
30253,Raj,so walk home.
30939,Raj,"nope. gates gave a speech at the university. sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in africa, you could have put a little more thought into windows vista.”"
30771,Raj,do you think they gave wolverine an adamantium prostate?
32118,Raj,my name is howard. i can make your hair into diamonds. my mom is morbidly obese. everybody love me.
30999,Raj,"no rush, no rush."
32843,Raj,what can we do?
30783,Raj,your mom creeps the hell out of me.
32074,Raj,hold on. we do that all the time. you and i work together and play together.
33819,Raj,"would you stop writing? wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
31269,Raj,"oh, me, too. you’re so caring. i’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
32714,Raj,"hey, guys. sorry i am so late. i was on the phone with my mother."
32824,Raj,"smart, looks like we’re being helpful."
30422,Raj,"please, sheldon, i’m a lost indian boy far from home, and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring martha."
31254,Raj,please. you’re looking at facebook to find out how their date went.
30949,Raj,how about that!
32412,Raj,did he help you make a decision about the movie?
33497,Raj,"hey, dude, you’re killing me with claire."
29620,Raj,"but you’re a dentist, he’s nuts. "
31769,Raj,"oh, boy. breakfast."
32678,Raj,"hey, we’re going to oliver’s house to see his collection. you want to go with us?"
32238,Raj,"oh, who was that girl from our starbucks?"
31698,Raj,i feel like i’ve been called down to the principal’s office. although i wouldn’t mind if brown sugar suspended me. from a sex swing. this may have been a mistake.
30291,Raj,son of a bitch.
29710,Raj,sheldon?
31659,Raj,"ooh! girls’ night, girls’ night! ooh! ooh!"
32961,Raj,and gertie can’t stop crying.
33269,Raj,"hey, stuart."
31895,Raj,yeah.
31264,Raj,"that was pretty badass, dude."
30672,Raj,"oh, you’re so arrogant. if you were a superhero, your name would be captain arrogant. and you know what your superpower would be? arrogance."
31274,Raj,"i heard you call her brown sugar. in my book, that’s defilement."
30504,Raj,"if you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies."
32293,Raj,magic wand tv remote?
31955,Raj,"oh, lucy, you don’t have to answer that. don’t put her on the spot. she hates that. am i right? tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. go ahead, tell her."
33197,Raj,"yeah, we totally did."
32098,Raj,"come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. leonard, give me a beat."
32604,Raj,easy. sleeping with penny.
30459,Raj,"oh, my goodness, look at this room! champagne! roses! oh, and little chocolates! this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever."
29679,Raj,i’d be more interested in a scene depicting spock’s conception. 
33174,Raj,thirty seconds.
30282,Raj,sure you can. do it! do it!
32387,Raj,"okay, okay, guys, new back stories. uh, penny and leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in new york. uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids."
31757,Raj,"dude, i’m a single man. saturday night is my party night."
31179,Raj,"fine. tell her i have a deep, sexy voice like james earl jones."
29777,Raj,what? 
29912,Raj,i didn’t get a good look. can i go again?
33506,Raj,"yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do."
31965,Raj,"yeah, thank you! this means a lot to me. my friends are like my family. unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me."
32056,Raj,"come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. you’ve got a lot of good stuff going on."
33574,Raj,"well, i think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."
33960,Raj,"but i also upset sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if i’m there."
30077,Raj,"howard, wait. why don’t you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"
34151,Raj,"oh, no."
30213,Raj,"okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but i’d rather swim buck-naked across the ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
30287,Raj,see what?
21786,Raj,hilarious.
32812,Raj,did he respond yet?
31927,Raj,"no, no. uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance."
31287,Raj,i will see you gentlemen later.
33951,Raj,can i just stay in the garage?
33820,Raj,what did she say?
30779,Raj,a romulan battle bagel?
31637,Raj,"okay, here’s another one: if a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? or a zompire?"
32992,Raj,"if you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask."
31939,Raj,it was until i realized the screen had frozen. still one of my top three dates of all time.
32642,Raj,exactly.
30960,Raj,"i should say so, he appears to be a member of the nigerian royal family."
31843,Raj,"yeah,"
32164,Raj,"no, i’m gonna brush cinnamon’s teeth."
32509,Raj,what do you mean?
34159,Raj,"thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one runs from loki, the other runs from stones. so, what do you think?"
33117,Raj,"fine, i quit, too."
33973,Raj,so did you confront jennifer?
33245,Raj,"no, you didn’t. there are millions of data points there."
31928,Raj,don’t be ridiculous. waiter?
30152,Raj,raj.
34115,Raj,"sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid indian music!"
32540,Raj,how so?
30595,Raj,i bought a parrot.
34031,Raj,"if you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak hindi."
32544,Raj,"okay, okay. although many older women lead vibrant, active…"
30414,Raj,how do you do? rajesh ramayan koothrappali. call me raj.
32797,Raj,"oh, good. namaste, grandpa."
31645,Raj,"miss congeniality 2: armed and fabulous. i mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl sandy b can’t save it."
31161,Raj,maybe. why not? who do i have in my life to watch my figure for?
32294,Raj,did bernadette think it was cool?
30943,Raj,come on in.
32421,Raj,"yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you."
30884,Raj,"mmm, i know the feeling. it’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. it-it happened to a friend of mine."
32590,Raj,"well, we were being honest. you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped leonard?"
31479,Raj,really? i can come? thanks.
33966,Raj,it’s my fault. i asked penny to do yoga with me.
31015,Raj,you will?
33338,Raj,"no, sheldon’s right. emily did say i always talk about my feelings too much."
33151,Raj,hey.
21793,Raj,cool. can it break mach 1?
31366,Raj,"got him. when gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, i bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff."
29654,Raj,"no way, jose. "
33793,Raj,she said she didn’t want to see me any more and i found that insulting.
31302,Raj,good timing. dinner’s almost ready.
33251,Raj,"okay, the final image is coming in. and the object we discovered is…"
33319,Raj,"bye. all right. so, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. everybody’s happy. easy peasy."
33215,Raj,"eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?"
33056,Raj,i bet you told bernadette all about how he was screwing around with mandy chao.
34095,Raj,i’m coming up so you better get this party started.
30920,Raj,you can’t come in.
32545,Raj,"i’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious."
32103,Raj,"actually, i’m busy."
32923,Raj,you’re wrong.
33305,Raj,just to help her with her screenplay.
30377,Raj,"oh, sheldon, you remind me of a young lex luthor."
32848,Raj,why don’t you just do the test?
29987,Raj,"sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
30075,Raj,what if we reposition the collection tank?
33217,Raj,"no, never heard of ’em!"
30836,Raj,you’re wrong. it’s only a matter of time before you fall into rat-man’s rat trap.
31702,Raj,"yeah, yeah, me, too. i didn’t do anything."
29569,Raj,i thought she was the whore of omaha?
33961,Raj,"i appreciate it, but i think staying with leonard and penny makes more sense for everyone."
33613,Raj,hmm. they must have left the tub on. good thing i stopped by. ah. aaaaah! what are you doing here?
32994,Raj,"no, daddy, no. there are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. i know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week."
31849,Raj,"you have no idea. they buy me a new bmw for my birthday but can i get seat warmers? no. rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. well, maybe i will, old man."
30662,Raj,i was homesick.
33742,Raj,"i love you, too. we’re good."
33148,Raj,"oh. hey, high five."
31970,Raj,"that’s, that’s very nice of you. uh, come, come. come on in."
32095,Raj,"look, i’m a lonely guy, i watch a lot of movies. look, penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
30756,Raj,"oh, yeah."
31353,Raj,it doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
31369,Raj,"just leave! okay, now. this is the way it’s supposed to be. men together, fighting the forces of evil."
33356,Raj,i hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
32407,Raj,what am i supposed to do? how am i supposed to choose between emily and lucy?
33179,Raj,how could you send her away?
31033,Raj,a friend at the school of pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. he says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
30465,Raj,i can’t wait to ask stan lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
30272,Raj,"no doubt, sign here."
31653,Raj,"so, listen, i know we talked about getting a bite to eat in silver lake, and then seeing the christmas lights in griffith park, but leonard’s talking about a big d and d game at his place."
30529,Raj,whatever you like.
33429,Raj,"bernie, i just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in los angeles. i know my favourite, but i’d love to hear what you think."
32390,Raj,"i’m not pouting, i’m brooding. which is how sexy men pout."
30957,Raj,hi!
32029,Raj,"don’t worry, i can take a hint. no more murder mystery parties."
32303,Raj,course.
29942,Raj,"don’t feel bad leonard, negative results are still results."
31288,Raj,"so, siri, what’s happening? how are you?"
32018,Raj,"okay, yup. see, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. but you know, i bet, i bet when i do it, mine do the same thing."
21785,Raj,"tushie is buttocks, right?"
30461,Raj,what? i’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. people will know i’m awesome and to be feared.
30277,Raj,"dude, you have to stop talking like that. it’s really lame."
32763,Raj,"if you people think this is better than tom hanks-giving, you’re all crazy."
33332,Raj,yeah.
32694,Raj,that sounds like a yes.
31181,Raj,"let’s see, what else can i tell you about me that would make you like me? ooh, i love music. do you love music?"
31022,Raj,"i don’t want to hug you, either. i was just feeling blue."
31506,Raj,what are you drinking?
34190,Raj,is this what i sound like when i talk about india?
29844,Raj,it has more food too.
31534,Raj,"okay, the nasa web site says howard’s final descent has begun."
33971,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
33261,Raj,"wait, what happened to us?"
32930,Raj,"so, bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?"
32168,Raj,"please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. now, tell us all about your day."
31592,Raj,"boy, what i wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."
33623,Raj,nobody does. i was embarrassed so i didn’t say anything.
33812,Raj,"uh, next?"
30586,Raj,she won’t notice they’re missing?
31309,Raj,"oh. if i had one, it would be brown dynamite."
30901,Raj,"excuse me, bernadette. i have to hear it from him."
31803,Raj,i don’t want to celebrate.
33975,Raj,"don’t worry, jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour."
33689,Raj,"oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so i thought we could have one right here."
30811,Raj,"well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero."
31614,Raj,"come on, we’re smart guys. we can figure this out."
31046,Raj,"wait, where are you going? we were doing so well. she never even got to see my penis. ta-da!"
31828,Raj,"she and i are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea."
29653,Raj,the living room appears to be empty. 
30443,Raj,"dude, i’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?"
30674,Raj,it’s one of his best moves.
33034,Raj,"well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?"
33475,Raj,"hey, you think it’d be okay if i brought claire to the wine tasting?"
30647,Raj,i’m a lamb.
33544,Raj,you know that hurts my feelings.
32811,Raj,what does it say?
29526,Raj,smooth.
30656,Raj,really? i thought they were out west someplace.
30313,Raj,i… i do enjoy the la brea tar pits.
29888,Raj,"you could try calling triple-a, but based on nasa’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years."
33873,Raj,my father thinks the reason i can’t make a relationship work is because i’m spoiled.
31149,Raj,"oh, yeah. this is one good-looking panini."
31701,Raj,"oh, of course not. she was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles."
33620,Raj,"if you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place."
33310,Raj,"hi. hi. yeah, it’s raj. rajesh. we met at the comic book store."
33430,Raj,hello.
31293,Raj,"ah, one name. like, uh, cher, madonna, adele. all the women who rock me. my name is rajesh, but you can call me raj."
30698,Raj,"hey, sheldon?"
31891,Raj,"wait, wait. i, i found your blog here you wrote about me."
30541,Raj,"really? because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
31583,Raj,what are you drawing over there?
33545,Raj,okay. 
29649,Raj,"here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. "
31088,Raj,sheldon doesn’t get along with sheldon. it’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
31176,Raj,you’re blowing this for me!
31561,Raj,it’s called being nice.
30714,Raj,oh please. my sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
33397,Raj,"i don’t know. i lost track and i missed my exit. so, uh, so what’s up?"
32549,Raj,"you know what? you’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. i give you my blessing."
32813,Raj,"i’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so i can post positive comments about their paper."
32013,Raj,"no problem. ooh, you made little sandwiches."
30945,Raj,"is the trick making him disappear? sure, let’s see it."
30807,Raj,we’re good.
34064,Raj,do you see the way she’s looking at him?
30177,Raj,i’m sorry. go on.
33661,Raj,okay.
34123,Raj,"dance number aside, i’m so not gay."
30295,Raj,"you always do this, you know? you ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with."
32428,Raj,at least now i can focus all my energies on just one girl.
33468,Raj,"says i was talking too much about dating claire and emily, and i accused him of being jealous."
33805,Raj,"well, i want information in order to improve myself."
31949,Raj,"the only person allowed inside this head is dr. phil. anyway, i, i spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
31537,Raj,"wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"
33004,Raj,"well, i’ve been thinking about you. how are you doing? are you happy, mummy?"
30610,Raj,"no, think about it. we make it an experiment. like when frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife."
30258,Raj,damn.
33357,Raj,they have that. it’s called uber.
32708,Raj,i’m okay.
33912,Raj,"yeah, you’d think. ooh, maybe i could sell my blood and sperm."
29568,Raj,what’s happening to us? we’re falling apart. 
34132,Raj,"hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
32796,Raj,you saw her. she looks like jim carrey from dumb and dumber.
32217,Raj,i’m sure you were great.
31064,Raj,"good, good."
31031,Raj,"i’m going to be 30 years old, and i have no one in my life to love me. i’m such a basket case, i can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
31914,Raj,"painfully so. we have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. so into her."
34135,Raj,"hello mummy, daddy, how are you?"
30259,Raj,"it’s true. i’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing."
33409,Raj,call you right back.
30051,Raj,usa today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
32488,Raj,do you know how to set it up?
30592,Raj,what?
31243,Raj,"they’re not even trying. remember the satanimals pack with the hellephant? why, absurd. what was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? what could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
30507,Raj,think about this. the only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex.
30159,Raj,that sounds really cool.
29981,Raj,"it’s not so bad, really. at least these trains have modern plumbing. in india, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan."
30021,Raj,fine. i’ll have a chocolate martini.
31202,Raj,penny?
33743,Raj,12 minutes.
33789,Raj,"material girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song. "
29950,Raj,what about the multiplex here? the seats are terrific.
29977,Raj,"and plus, you got a rapid prototyper. that’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
30828,Raj,"okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?"
33589,Raj,"well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
33186,Raj,"you know, this reminds me of high school."
31741,Raj,i think this thing was made in china.
31354,Raj,"you could go to my guy. he’s at juan-juan in beverly hills. they bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. it’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like tony danza."
29951,Raj,we could eat after the movie.
33871,Raj,it is. he stopped trying to find indian girls for me to marry. 
31781,Raj,"oh, well, i was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then i had to take her to the vet."
33559,Raj,"so, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
29783,Raj,tag. you’re it.  
30074,Raj,"okay, look. instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?"
31447,Raj,"oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and howard. there was about 200 pounds of sailor moon between us."
30311,Raj,"no, i’m mad at you. i hate myself, but i’m mad at you."
30122,Raj,"oh, yeah."
31080,Raj,"come on, dude, i’m exhausted, and tyra banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep."
30206,Raj,"thank you. would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? so, when do i start?"
32323,Raj,i was there. it was funny.
33578,Raj,"yeah, that’s not worrisome at all."
33276,Raj,"yeah, but he doesn’t mean it."
31409,Raj,because this one wants to marry me. i might never find another one who does.
31582,Raj,when did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
33325,Raj,hey.
31131,Raj,"well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense."
29995,Raj,you got me. now what are you going to do with me?
30123,Raj,disappointed? let down?
32686,Raj,"okay, now you’re messing with me."
29566,Raj,uurgh.
31041,Raj,it’s a beautiful country. you’d love it. may i join you?
31746,Raj,are you sure you want to do this? give up your half of the 3-d printer?
33768,Raj,"guys, she’s my goddaughter, i think i’ll know when i see her. that one."
33156,Raj,"it’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have."
31744,Raj,"oh, i wish i was in better shape."
32761,Raj,"yeah, just leave me out of it. you know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the indian guy."
33625,Raj,"i’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
31119,Raj,"that could have been about anyone. besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now i’m the dusky half of koothrapenny."
33297,Raj,"well, astrophysicist."
33631,Raj,wait till you see the crib we found.
30704,Raj,"when i call him, his phone plays brown eyed girl. which, now that i think about it, is not so good."
33736,Raj,i’ll do it.
33939,Raj,"thank you, sheldon. it’s a blank notebook. "
31164,Raj,that’s cruel. you know it goes straight to my hips.
32400,Raj,"yeah, we have plans this weekend. and if it’s a clear night, i’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."
30626,Raj,"howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but i said no, our sheldon would say hokum."
31988,Raj,"wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. "
29761,Raj,he’s coming. screen saver. 
30850,Raj,looks like someone else is going to have to be wonder woman.
32697,Raj,that’s howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
34047,Raj,congratulations.
32398,Raj,"ah, really? thank you. fate has given me a rare second chance, and i swear to vishnu i’m not gonna blow it. or normal words followed by a charming smile."
30577,Raj,"oh, come on. i don’t want to sit by myself."
31588,Raj,it was tapenade and you guys suck.
32336,Raj,yes. where i can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. or you just write it for me.
30795,Raj,you know it’s been more than a year since i’ve even kissed a girl?
30432,Raj,there are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
31510,Raj,cheers.
30098,Raj,i say double feature.
31734,Raj,"you know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us."
31773,Raj,"they’re on the chair, right over… oy vey."
32504,Raj,"but you don’t have sex with her, either."
32793,Raj,"really? so every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?"
34011,Raj,"well, i’m very happy for you."
31446,Raj,"the only threesome i’ve ever had in my life, and i’m proud to say it was with this man right here."
29558,Raj,"oh, if only i had his confidence. i have such difficulty speaking to women. or around women. or at times, even effeminate men. "
30566,Raj,"but we’ll have sex first, right?"
32275,Raj,"thank you. oh, and i’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room."
32455,Raj,you’re a good son. i don’t know how you do it.
32573,Raj,"hey, guys."
30335,Raj,i didn’t ask you to set me up with lakshmi.
31551,Raj,on sesame seed bunzillas.
29936,Raj,"come on, sheldon, you got this."
30723,Raj,"hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of caprica last night?"
32558,Raj,"hey, sheldon, i’m sorry."
32034,Raj,any questions?
33360,Raj,"even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us."
31713,Raj,what is wrong with people? why don’t they stop?
33870,Raj,it turns out he doesn’t care if i’m married or if i’m single. he’s basically given up on me.
31967,Raj,"uh, go ahead. read it."
31262,Raj,"that sounds amazing. first movie i’m watching, annie."
31719,Raj,"don’t be like that. come on, howard, talk to him."
30716,Raj,did you pinky swear?
33211,Raj,"so, all right, there he is. so, should we introduce ourselves?"
32441,Raj,"mmm, and you know what that means. someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever."
34032,Raj,"could you say that in english? i actually, i never learned hindi."
29907,Raj,"it’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."
30591,Raj,i’m a big fan of your work.
30191,Raj,hello sheldon.
33049,Raj,really?
34067,Raj,can you even eat those things?
30720,Raj,i don’t think we’re going to do that.
30314,Raj,"oh, why can’t i stay mad at you?"
30689,Raj,no.
31300,Raj,"thanks, barry. siri, remind me friday morning to make my famous popovers."
31762,Raj,"i, uh, i suppose i could stay for some dessert."
32430,Raj,you’re really going to do this?
33983,Raj,"yeah. you know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
33032,Raj,"she and i were supposed to watch the new avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. so i said, what else do you want to do? she said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave."
33013,Raj,check.
32341,Raj,do that. see?
32200,Raj,keep going. 
32116,Raj,i didn’t know you were coming again.
29759,Raj,sure. tell us again how you screwed up and got penny back together with her old boyfriend.
30319,Raj,don’t put yourself down. you’re a very attractive man.
31745,Raj,"oh, okay, great. now i can look like val kilmer as batman instead of val kilmer as he looks today."
34002,Raj,"hang on, i can see every place you went."
32463,Raj,"here we go, house of a 1,000 corpses."
34189,Raj,it doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
33385,Raj,"maybe you’re right. wow, i am easy to manipulate.  oh, guys, it’s emily. what should i do?"
32740,Raj,dad.
32530,Raj,"when i’m feeling low, i have sex with a girl. but that’s just me."
32699,Raj,this is so messed up.
33146,Raj,"hmm. i’m doing okay, and i was very popular at 13."
33361,Raj,look at that. you’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
30203,Raj,"that’s very good. jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, i’ll hold off until sunset on titan."
33105,Raj,"right, yeah, right. but, what do you think?"
30885,Raj,"thank you, but cute is for bunnies. i want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle."
30399,Raj,i don’t want to go to flatland.
33909,Raj,really? i’ll do anything.
32862,Raj,"uh, origin of species."
31793,Raj,"thank you. uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?"
29785,Raj,who were you respecting then?
32819,Raj,i’m so sick of people being mean on the internet.
30788,Raj,"and when you go to a chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."
29904,Raj,hey.
33732,Raj,"is this what you do when i’m not here, make really good points?"
31312,Raj,they put you under for a cleaning?
33344,Raj,"because instead of being in the telescope room, i was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays."
31217,Raj,"well, i just met her gynaecologist!"
33137,Raj,what are you guys up to?
32789,Raj,actually there’s no proof of that.
31105,Raj,every night.
29934,Raj,"that’s not overconfidence, that’s observation."
32367,Raj,you can’t leave. you’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of stuart bloom.
29845,Raj,welcome to the raj mahal.
30147,Raj,"oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
33508,Raj,"sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy."
33438,Raj,really? it’s okay if i listen with you?
33799,Raj,"sheldon, when i said i was fine, i meant i didn’t want to talk about it any more."
30736,Raj,i got you a talking thomas the tank engine for thanksgiving.
33775,Raj,so how were your holidays?
32557,Raj,you enjoy giving people grades.
31306,Raj,thank you.  
30276,Raj,"well, if wil wheaton and stuart win their match and we beat lonely larry and captain sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship."
30274,Raj,"sorry, boys. say hi to your mother when she picks you up. or i could just tell her later tonight! we pwned them, dude! up top!"
31276,Raj,because she’s great in everything.
31771,Raj,"oh, howard, stop."
32370,Raj,"actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves."
29825,Raj,"oh, i’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? in india we just call them untouchables."
33922,Raj,"i’ve been plenty of times. if i miss one, it’s fine. i’m a big boy."
31299,Raj,it’s just a phone.
29915,Raj,"trailing badly, wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with sheldon cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68."
32406,Raj,i just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend lucy. she misses me and wants to get together.
30328,Raj,"really! did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, howard, i am upset."
34119,Raj,like the wild elephant i am trumpeting my love for you!
33157,Raj,"fine, i’ll leave. but it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."
29919,Raj,"as with my father, i both love and fear it."
30305,Raj,"wow, you just don’t get it, do you? buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
31505,Raj,all right. great.
30621,Raj,"yes, but him doesn’t even know about her."
29856,Raj,i like comic books.
32088,Raj,fine. i will melt her heart. and her face.
32148,Raj,wow. you’re even prettier than penny said. i can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
31850,Raj,"and i will return to new delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. and you know what will be on that elephant’s back? a seat warmer. no, father, you may not have a ride."
30023,Raj,gotcha. i’ll have a brandy alexander.
32487,Raj,all right. now what?
32722,Raj,"when stuff like this gets me down, you know what i like to do?"
32332,Raj,"well, i was up all night trying to write to her, but i wanted to run it by you first."
31180,Raj,great. then she won’t know i’m lying.
34054,Raj,as soon as i have the place set up i’m gonna have you guys over.
31619,Raj,"hey, hey. feelings."
30246,Raj,"what do you want, sheldon?"
29822,Raj,"excuse me. oh, it’s my assistant trevor. go for koothrappali. uh-huh."
34085,Raj,"hello. sorry i’m late. but i was in the hallway, chatting up penny."
31697,Raj,i did. the guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
31868,Raj,"yes, mummy was right. american girls are sexually voracious devils."
32049,Raj,"stuart and i are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. and thank you, i’d kill for that woman’s bone structure."
32342,Raj,maybe i can go with you guys to houston?
32473,Raj,"hey, uh, sheldon, you want anything?"
31877,Raj,"well, that doesn’t seem fair."
34008,Raj,he took the day off.
33135,Raj,"hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de mayo."
30963,Raj,"sheldon, what if he gets his internet from his cable company? he could lose his hbo and all their delightful original programming."
30030,Raj,aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
29871,Raj,"party with the pretty girls, dude!"
31337,Raj,mr. roper’s dead? you can’t just spring that on a guy.
32669,Raj,"sheldon, you know what i think of when i’m scared? voyager."
31576,Raj,"okay, yeah, that’s pretty good."
32193,Raj,maybe this time he’s going to do it.
32787,Raj,that is so offensive. does everything you know about hinduism come from indiana jones?
32393,Raj,and it’s done.
31172,Raj,"oh, she’s here."
31627,Raj,holy crap!
27888,Penny,yeah.
29355,Penny,hey leonard.
25854,Penny,"all right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins."
22868,Penny,what?
28153,Penny,i’m sorry. i’m not here.
24964,Penny,i-i guess they just figured it out at some point.
24513,Penny,"you know, i could totally rock a hat like that."
26114,Penny,"sorry. spoiler alert. my point is, as much as i want to live with you, i can’t do it knowing how much sheldon needs you."
24086,Penny,"sheldon, congratulations. brought you cheesecake from work. you know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
24213,Penny,"all right, got it. is there anything else?"
27055,Penny,"no, thanks. leonard and i are just going to the funeral."
29359,Penny,"hi guys, my friends and i got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. "
28715,Penny,"oh, i’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap i don’t understand. i mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?"
24143,Penny,"oh, honey, i don’t know. things are a little weird with leonard right now."
24317,Penny,"oh, does that come up much on the space station?"
22431,Penny,"okay, let’s do this, um, i will drive sheldon to get a present, and howard, you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours. "
28740,Penny,"yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall."
25911,Penny,"thank you. now behave yourself and eat your dinner. maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl."
22668,Penny,i thought the blowers were more sanitary?
22615,Penny,sheldor?
27616,Penny,now open your hand and let it go.
27491,Penny,"so, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?"
23326,Penny,"i cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. i mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. you know that just last week, she had howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in orange county to pick up her tv?"
24259,Penny,"uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
28338,Penny,say yes.
28972,Penny,"yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore."
22905,Penny,your pants are ruined.
22112,Penny,i should probably go.
28500,Penny,"sheldon, what did you do?"
28466,Penny,"sweetie, i know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?"
21922,Penny,so?
26597,Penny,i’m gonna go talk to her.
25918,Penny,you changed every word.
23172,Penny,sit on the damn couch.
24137,Penny,"um, ach."
27808,Penny,yeah. i started that rumour.
28624,Penny,i was kind of hoping you would.
28941,Penny,"we’re good, thank you."
24914,Penny,"good-bye, leonard."
22522,Penny,hi.
22424,Penny,"so, what did you get the birthday boy?"
25037,Penny,"okay, priya?"
27670,Penny,"if you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
22778,Penny,"oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me."
22512,Penny,"but on the other hand, if things don’t go well with leonard, i risk losing a really good friend. i mean, i guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, i don’t know, like you would say light years. "
26642,Penny,i can’t believe i felt bad for opening this in the car.
29469,Penny,you should probably drive.
21939,Penny,"yeah, i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter and superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? "
27075,Penny,what’s that?
24545,Penny,so you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
27011,Penny,"‘cause you’re trying too hard. you need to do something else, get your mind off it."
24695,Penny,yay!
26089,Penny,"oh, great. yes. and then you will see, i am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. suck on that."
28348,Penny,"this is ridiculous. you know, i’m gonna go talk to the maître d’."
24112,Penny,do or do not. there is no try.
28529,Penny,"if it’s because you lost a stick, i know where it went."
23176,Penny,thanks for the shoes.
26167,Penny,"yeah, well, whatever, okay? i told you, valentine’s day sucks."
23612,Penny,what?
23083,Penny,he was drunk.
24297,Penny,"yes, he was! he thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
26228,Penny,why do you even care? just tell us what it says.
28783,Penny,so it’s okay for you to joke around?
24632,Penny,it’s not the wig.
27254,Penny,"oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
25371,Penny,look at us. what are we doing?
28187,Penny,"oh, there he is."
24570,Penny,no.
25671,Penny,"well, have fun tonight."
26473,Penny,people run in a marathon.
26123,Penny,it’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
28001,Penny,"no, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe i should."
24431,Penny,"what up, shel-bot?"
25971,Penny,your picture’s on my refrigerator.
26527,Penny,"you know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, mary bernheim. that’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys."
25559,Penny,how’s that?
22217,Penny,what is this?
29216,Penny,"oh, yeah. so, leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day."
28417,Penny,"my point is, there was a time i never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. so, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, i’m happy to do it with you."
28525,Penny,"well, i will still come to your meeting."
23973,Penny,sheldon doesn’t work here.
27923,Penny,why are you telling me this now?
28167,Penny,oh. good for you.
21910,Penny,it’s okay if you say no.
25112,Penny,yello.
23684,Penny,"well, i’m sorry, sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
22454,Penny,"okay, i don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. "
24607,Penny,"okay, we should, we should go."
25607,Penny,yes. on purpose.
23167,Penny,why not?
23654,Penny,he’s not some guy. he’s my friend.
29074,Penny,"oh, i’m gonna throw you so hard, i might actually win a stuffed animal."
22980,Penny,"i am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. it’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” and most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. nothing is ever going to happen between us. ever."
24736,Penny,thank you.
24593,Penny,that’s thinking ahead.
28416,Penny,"that’s fine. you know, i hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. but what i hate even more is, if i was there, i would have tortured you, too."
24435,Penny,"happy kitty, sleepy…"
24178,Penny,really?
27529,Penny,"well, you named it."
25989,Penny,thanks. ah!
25546,Penny,i came to say i’m sorry.
24273,Penny,"oh, yeah, i’m wondering about that. you said it was working when you moved in."
26825,Penny,"i mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?"
26860,Penny,"hi. sorry i’m late, i was at an audition."
25060,Penny,you heard what i did?
24714,Penny,"yeah. why, what happened?"
23921,Penny,"i can’t believe it. if i hadn’t been working the dinner shift, i would’ve run"
25867,Penny,anybody home?
28751,Penny,"do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."
27559,Penny,"now, you just get comfortable."
29130,Penny,"well, it’s no different than when sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
25828,Penny,you’re unbelievable.
23290,Penny,i can see.
27560,Penny,"yeah, you get some sleep."
25950,Penny,"yeah, that she is. here you go."
27284,Penny,how? you can’t force someone to like you.
25056,Penny,"nothing, nothing. you know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, i’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy."
25098,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe teach acting.  oh, sorry. hold on. hello?"
26017,Penny,"of course he is. look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. she’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is slumdog millionaire. i mean."
28543,Penny,i don’t always defend sheldon.
29461,Penny,what do you think?
27943,Penny,"okay, will you relax? you’re not missing anything special."
28040,Penny,"no. all you need is a needle and an ice cube. i’ve done it, like, a dozen times."
24705,Penny,i can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
27550,Penny,what’s up?
25904,Penny,i don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.
27204,Penny,that is not true.
27787,Penny,"okay, look, would it make you feel better if i did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a kevin smith movie?"
23218,Penny,"so, what do you think? i mean, this could be a business, right?"
28043,Penny,"oh, just my parents and my entire family."
26440,Penny,so? that’s my dinner from last night.
23743,Penny,good.
26868,Penny,"yeah. well, sheldon’s not here."
29096,Penny,"oh, that’s gonna make me cry."
22719,Penny,"well, how ’bout when you were 17?"
22015,Penny,120?
29118,Penny,"oh, let me guess. you guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
26410,Penny,what did i do?
29055,Penny,"you don’t have a problem with this, do you?"
25757,Penny,he’s a sweetie.
27988,Penny,i told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
27766,Penny,"okay, well, i’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you."
26936,Penny,"okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. if i become a famous actress, i’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. they just are."
23685,Penny,"yeah, yeah, i’ll be right there. look, sheldon, i have to go."
22158,Penny,yeah.
24511,Penny,"okay, help me out here. how does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?"
24622,Penny,i’m not talking to you.
26714,Penny,"i’m sorry, i have a boyfriend. in fact, there he is now. ready to go, sweetheart?"
28621,Penny,"okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."
22007,Penny,"oh, yay!"
29388,Penny,hi.
22034,Penny,"hi, you guys ready to order?"
26986,Penny,"okay. i get it. i mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but i know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it."
28903,Penny,"you know what, i’ve met bert. isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?"
24164,Penny,really?
25024,Penny,how else is she supposed to take it?
25916,Penny,so let me get this straight. you just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
26180,Penny,will you be my valentine?
28829,Penny,"alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
24074,Penny,that is so sad.
26258,Penny,"uh, sheldon, there are two dumplings left. do you want them?"
29296,Penny,amy’s got some news.
26716,Penny,i just got a part on a tv show.
27416,Penny,"great, how?"
24575,Penny,"no, you’re right. no, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. so what other annoying habits shall we discuss?"
22967,Penny,sheldon! what did you do?!
22345,Penny,"leonard, you said i only had to ask questions. "
24445,Penny,"well, what’d he say?"
23746,Penny,"in a parking lot in hollywood. now, can we please go?"
23795,Penny,you want me to put it back?
24036,Penny,"why, you did, sir. you. dr. sheldon cooper, and may i add, it is a privilege to know you."
24770,Penny,yogurt?
26352,Penny,"okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…"
23267,Penny,"here, this will help."
26026,Penny,fine. ricardo and tondelaya.
23268,Penny,we should have let him go to bed.
29083,Penny,"okay, stop that. no more preschool talk. tonight is about having fun."
24767,Penny,all right.
24950,Penny,you are kidding. raj likes bernadette?
27940,Penny,"uh, actually i’m in vegas. leonard and i are about to get married."
27405,Penny,"aw, that’s sad."
26820,Penny,"let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘cause i am not sure i do."
27723,Penny,"no, no. i’m gonna cheer you up. here we go."
28377,Penny,"oh, that’s all right. all i heard was skinny."
27383,Penny,you were okay with that?
25900,Penny,really? you can’t think of anyone weirder?
24370,Penny,i don’t know. i was just trying something.
24227,Penny,good. i’m glad.
26585,Penny,"sorry, they’re both married."
25745,Penny,"no, we don’t! come on in!"
24115,Penny,"oh, yeah, no, i, i’m, i’m glad."
25487,Penny,and stop apologizing all the time.
27315,Penny,"it means instead of having a week to study, i only have two days."
22221,Penny,"oh, sweetie, i don’t think it even works as one. is this all your clothes?"
28683,Penny,is that really what’s important right now?
28866,Penny,"yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while."
28511,Penny,what good is it if you don’t use it?
26937,Penny,"in 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?"
27944,Penny,"she’s upset. look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. look at you in your little suit."
27172,Penny,nope.
28396,Penny,"well, i am so happy for howard and bernadette."
22019,Penny,"uh, no, no not really. listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs. "
24165,Penny,what are you talking about?
28114,Penny,i think she means not a weirdo.
26485,Penny,what? why me?
24852,Penny,"okay, i’m not upset about leonard and priya."
25699,Penny,"well, i’ve been thinking, and maybe i’m ready to take things a little faster."
27190,Penny,what happened?
26211,Penny,guess it would be fun to be cinderella.
23960,Penny,just answer the phone.
27242,Penny,"that we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me."
29509,Penny,say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
23348,Penny,"ugh, that’s what i was trying to avoid."
25975,Penny,"that’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if i start crying, you’re gonna start crying."
26231,Penny,"yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful."
23762,Penny,"oh, next question."
22546,Penny,no.
24301,Penny,"put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud."
26154,Penny,it’s just this guy i used to date.
24522,Penny,"you know amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts."
22589,Penny,goodnight sheldon.
23430,Penny,i really don’t want to talk about it.
23424,Penny,"okay, well, that’s really cool of you."
22511,Penny,"no. what i’m saying is, leonard might be different in a good way. obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. "
24073,Penny,there a new girlfriend in there? ‘cause you might need one.
23327,Penny,"apples and oranges here, sheldon. i’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. it creams my corn."
25880,Penny,what do you mean? . oh! wow!
23932,Penny,"that’s, like, in 45 minutes."
29392,Penny,"oh, sonofabitch!"
26621,Penny,"yes, it is."
22356,Penny,"alright, singer who sang “oops i did it again.”  okay, tweetie bird, taught he taw a what?"
23269,Penny,"i just want you guys to know i am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar i make, i’m going to give you 20 cents."
23446,Penny,you’re all going?
27230,Penny,so what? why do you even care?
22471,Penny,"you know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."

29484,Penny,"…when i was a very young girl. when i was 16 years old, i made the discovery, love. all at once, and much, much too completely. it was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. that’s how it struck the world for me. but i was unlucky. deluded."
28613,Penny,"no problem. um, so listen, i don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but i kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."
26744,Penny,"and you didn’t get your part cut. yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!"
25061,Penny,"oh, my god, i screwed up everything. i hurt leonard, i hurt raj, i mean, what is wrong with me? i feel like two totally different people, dr. jekyll and mrs. whore."
27462,Penny,"i know she can be a little intense, but, i swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…"
26784,Penny,i didn’t get it.
26956,Penny,"no, i didn’t get it."
25983,Penny,"anyway, to this day, i still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."
21958,Penny,what’s going on?
27844,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it was the best speech i…"
25415,Penny,"okay, uh, let’s see. i’m from nebraska, and ever since i was a little girl, i dreamed of moving to l.a. and becoming a movie star. anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, i’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of anne frank above a bowling alley. so, you know, dreams do come true. your turn."
22786,Penny,"yeah, no, there’s a new policy. no shoes, no shirt, no sheldon."
28166,Penny,"oh, i don’t want credit for that."
24965,Penny,"oh, hey, amy. bernadette just texted me. howard proposed?"
25790,Penny,"look, it’s fine. we’re not getting married, okay? we’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis."

22755,Penny,sisters?
25295,Penny,what am i doing?
29515,Penny,do you really think that’s funny?
27674,Penny,"well, thank you for sharing it with me. i won’t tell anyone."
27725,Penny,"my baby is sad, and i’m gonna make him happy again."
25256,Penny,"oh, amy! get the hell out of here!"
25706,Penny,"why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
22321,Penny,what?
28061,Penny,"well, what is it?"
22092,Penny,"oh, hey guys. you having a good time?"
23693,Penny,"it doesn’t matter why he told me. it’s true, isn’t it?"
23737,Penny,i don’t want you to see me naked.
29060,Penny,what? are you really upset about randall coming?
28423,Penny,is that a pregnancy thing?
28920,Penny,"oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."
25124,Penny,and now me.
23299,Penny,"oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. he said he’d help me set up my printer, but i guess i can wait. what exactly is he doing up there?"
22051,Penny,"oh, come on, you went to college."
23287,Penny,"i tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it."
22997,Penny,"so, i just came by to see how you were doing."
24479,Penny,"okay, fine. look, look, i’m calling her now! see?"
25486,Penny,"okay, bug report. i just complimented you. you should take it and shut up."
29405,Penny,"leonard, congratulations."
22373,Penny,"oh, i’m scared. "
26575,Penny,"yeah, i’m just making a mess."
29245,Penny,"oh, zack. hey."
26197,Penny,okay. do whatever you want.
22479,Penny,yes. you’re right. i should just say i’m done with him. 
23864,Penny,so what did she say when you told her we were going out?
22777,Penny,"well, what a thrill."
27394,Penny,just walk.
27218,Penny,for what?
28875,Penny,why did you tell howard i was hiding leonard’s things?
24467,Penny,"uh, not that i know of. hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?"
26758,Penny,"ooh. leonard hofstadter, will you marry me?"
27695,Penny,hi.
22591,Penny,"okay, where is this coming from?"
25197,Penny,"oh, fine. you know, it’s been a while. i’m getting back out there."
22520,Penny,"sheldon, what’s the point? "
27584,Penny,"oh, my god, it’s about her and sheldon."
28956,Penny,"well, i didn’t until i heard that."
25584,Penny,"okay, what do you think?"
23840,Penny,then i don’t know.
25501,Penny,"ugh. well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now."
24853,Penny,a lot of people think i’m fun to be around.
24411,Penny,it’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
22078,Penny,"as usual, i’m not following."
23731,Penny,one was already in an accident.
29046,Penny,i think this all looks good.
27806,Penny,"yeah, it’s going okay, but i do miss this sometimes."
27901,Penny,"no, it’s okay."
26234,Penny,i know.
27511,Penny,thank you.
28379,Penny,"yeah, yeah, we should go out."
29056,Penny,"okay. thank you, you’re the best. mm."
23347,Penny,leonard?
26037,Penny,because i know she hit on you and i know you liked it.
29382,Penny,i need to use your window.
26955,Penny,"oh. why didn’t i put money on this?  hey, that’s my agent. if i got the part, it’s still the second best thing i’ve heard all day. hello?"
25315,Penny,"i don’t know. up until the last part, i was kind of enjoying take-charge leonard with a little backbone. picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
26696,Penny,"me, too."
23120,Penny,hey.
28701,Penny,why would that make me feel better?
22563,Penny,what are you talking about.
24619,Penny,no. i’m not wearing it. it looks stupid.
23922,Penny,i’m not scared. i would’ve gone all nebraska on their asses.
29272,Penny,‘cause he’s scared of you?
28250,Penny,i’m really happy you and amy are back together.
24308,Penny,"oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
24102,Penny,"no, you’re wrong."
26577,Penny,"hey, guys, what do you think?"

25015,Penny,okay.
24451,Penny,"wow, that is better."
21981,Penny,"ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy."
26488,Penny,"you know, i’m surprised you want to copy my answers since i’m not even smart enough to be on your team. "
26785,Penny,do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
21947,Penny,do you understand how creepy this is.
26721,Penny,"hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on tv tomorrow night."
28099,Penny,"well, it’s not forever. it’s just for a while. if you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog."
25493,Penny,"good night, you."
23995,Penny,i’ll talk to leonard.
29037,Penny,what are you doing here?
22264,Penny,"it’s okay, leonard "
22578,Penny,they have other things.
27785,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you should really get some money."
23805,Penny,"howard, never let her go."
27089,Penny,hi.
26147,Penny,"you know, sometimes i think i’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that."
25701,Penny,"you know, just-just one thing. look, we’re in a really great place right now, and i don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
27007,Penny,"but i realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. so, i asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
22584,Penny,leslie.
26896,Penny,"okay, i don’t think meryl streep ever had to say “must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”"
28005,Penny,what do you think?
26913,Penny,i don’t know what to say.
23889,Penny,leonard?
27438,Penny,"yeah, back off, he’s all mine."
29093,Penny,"pressure. i mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401k. before she talked about it, i just thought that was a race."
23838,Penny,aristotle?
27498,Penny,it’s kind of boring. although it did get exciting for a minute when amy inhaled a wool ball. how much longer do you think you’ll be?
24117,Penny,okay.
27681,Penny,"aw, sweetie, i’m comfortable around you, too."
24518,Penny,yeah?
28486,Penny,"nice hat, sheldon."
26713,Penny,you guys need anything else?
26409,Penny,"okay, you know what? i give up. i’m going to bed."
26853,Penny,"yeah, for future reference, that’s a while."
27765,Penny,"i think i started to suspect it was a bad movie when i looked at the script and saw the title, serial ape-ist 2: monkey see, monkey kill."
26384,Penny,"i wasn’t going to get alcohol. gosh, i wonder what leonard’s doing right now. i miss him so much."
27749,Penny,so when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?
24710,Penny,"um, sure. what do you, what do you got in mind?"
25926,Penny,i don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
27212,Penny,"headaches, dizziness and nausea."
27233,Penny,"well, a relationship is more complicated than a french fry."
26989,Penny,"no. i’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and i know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want."
26397,Penny,"oh, that’s really sweet."
24009,Penny,yes.
26919,Penny,"oh, my god."
26406,Penny,"oh, god."
29491,Penny,"you know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
28840,Penny,"yep, there they are."
26812,Penny,i can’t believe leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. 
26718,Penny,yeah.
26560,Penny,what?
26959,Penny,"okay, it’s not me, right? this script is terrible."
23200,Penny,"okay, i found the box. now what?"
27798,Penny,no.
26369,Penny,what’s the matter?
27613,Penny,"you know, some people try visualization."
27209,Penny,what?
23810,Penny,‘cause i want to surprise him.
26793,Penny,and now we go to reverse warrior.
22675,Penny,shame on you guys. 
23423,Penny,"well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘cause you know, you and me…"
28339,Penny,"so, you really gonna break up with her?"
24635,Penny,you make a cute green arrow.
26771,Penny,"great, because i’ve been thinking, if i really want this acting thing to work, i need to focus all my energy on it. and to do that, i should quit waitressing at the cheesecake factory."
22488,Penny,how could he do that.
29347,Penny,you came into my apartment last night when i was sleeping?
22638,Penny,why not?
27431,Penny,"well, i might not have asked you to dance then, but i will ask you now."
22945,Penny,really? we’re going to do an experiment?
23623,Penny,"oh, my god, no. why would you ask that?"
24528,Penny,not even when you were a kid?
27701,Penny,"well, why?"
26081,Penny,"okay, hang on, what if thor’s hand is on the hammer? i mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean i could lift it?"
25634,Penny,"anyway, i got a little residual cheque from my commercial and i thought, hey, how about i get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. so, sheldon, ta-da!"
22045,Penny,"yeah, you too. leonard, i didn’t know you played the cello?"
24183,Penny,"you’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?"
22245,Penny,is that all?
28953,Penny,"i’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?"
27314,Penny,it’s my boss. they moved my field ride up to monday.
29356,Penny,"oh cool, whose head did i just blow off? "
26792,Penny,"yeah, well, i don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today."
21929,Penny,"yeah, call it whatever you want, i get minimum wage. yeah, anyways, i was wondering if you could help me out with something, i was…."
28306,Penny,you really don’t know why?
23239,Penny,"all right, fine. how are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?"
26378,Penny,"all right, let’s just get this stupid game over with."
24805,Penny,"you’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?"
26000,Penny,"now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. you’re going to have to know how to gut it. so, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  you want me to stop?"
29514,Penny,"oh. it’s bernadette. she says they’re running late. the baby threw up on howard, and then howard threw up on howard."
27035,Penny,"fine, i’ll go. hmm. people turn to you for guidance and wisdom. yeah, that’s a good one."
26720,Penny,"well, yeah. why?"
24236,Penny,"oh, they’re not my friends."
26277,Penny,"ugh, that sounds like a lot of work."
24335,Penny,"look, sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, i don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her."
23393,Penny,what?
22280,Penny,"yeah. hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
25499,Penny,"you know, in girl scouts, tammie dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. boy, was she wrong. anyway, you want to make out?"
23122,Penny,"come on in. wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?"
24598,Penny,oh! okay. wow.
29048,Penny,"no. no, you don’t, you really don’t. i actually can’t say don’t enough."
25002,Penny,don’t you quit on us!
23884,Penny,i’m sleeping with your son.
22846,Penny,what’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
27589,Penny,"“time travel? i don’t understand,” said amelia. cooper stared at her. ‘which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”"
29187,Penny,"oh, right, sorry."
22525,Penny,"okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. "
25308,Penny,"okay. then i’ll return the favour, and i won’t tell…"
24756,Penny,"saturday, nine a.m. bring cash."
29488,Penny,hurry.

23954,Penny,"oh, damn."
28922,Penny,amy wants me to have it.
22760,Penny,they all live in a house together.
25650,Penny,what?
27319,Penny,you guys look like you’re having fun.
26595,Penny,i scraped gum off the bottom of that table. only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
22072,Penny,"okay, um, oh hey, i’m having a party on saturday so if you guys are around you should come by."
22134,Penny,"as usual, nice talking to you raj  "
26030,Penny,"oh, you seem extra happy."
28503,Penny,how?
22661,Penny,"no, no, no, no, i need you now."
27951,Penny,"oh, and the fairy tale continues."
25203,Penny,"okay, um, hey, god. what’s up? um, i’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. but no cops. be cool."
23823,Penny,ancient greece?
28846,Penny,"oh, sure."
26325,Penny,"well, how long?"
22618,Penny,what’s afk?
25997,Penny,just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
27477,Penny,yeah. it comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
29052,Penny,my dad asked if i can get him a job interview at my work.
23905,Penny,"ha-ha, bite me."
29039,Penny,all right. can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
28054,Penny,"hey, daddy."
26681,Penny,"hey, how’s your sister?"
25277,Penny,"okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
23091,Penny,and you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
29494,Penny,"no, mom, it’s the same guy i’ve been going out with for the past two years. yeah, the scientist. well, it’s complicated. i mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. no, i did not see it coming. no, we did not set a date. no, i am not pregnant. yeah, this is a first for our family. all right, tell dad i love him. i gotta go. all right, bye."
22151,Penny,why do you people hate sleep? are you wearing my robe?
27618,Penny,how?
25264,Penny,what do you mean?
24296,Penny,"‘cause in the olden days, i never would’ve known he was so stupid."
29254,Penny,"well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
22527,Penny,"alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner. "
25577,Penny,"oh, leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. i don’t care if richard feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
26623,Penny,"look, i’m telling you i’ve done it, okay? i clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
28987,Penny,okay. then what happened?
24265,Penny,"okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
28510,Penny,"my god, leonard, do you know what i could do with that kind of money?"
24660,Penny,"sheldon, i’m gonna make some cocoa. do you want some?"
22891,Penny,really? what was your first clue?
24146,Penny,"you’re not gonna leave me alone until i do it, are you?"
25894,Penny,"oh, i’ll get that."
28863,Penny,"oh, don’t worry, i won’t."
27263,Penny,thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. i really appreciate it.
27349,Penny,mm.
28968,Penny,– oh.
25592,Penny,an acting choice.
26159,Penny,"what?  oh, you got to be kidding me."
25005,Penny,"oh, please, you’re not that kind of person."
28690,Penny,"hmm. well, i guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
27640,Penny,"whenever i saw her, she’d say i was too skinny and try and feed me."
25771,Penny,"okay, go home, crazy man."
22862,Penny,no.
29028,Penny,"it’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
28524,Penny,"well, why are you fighting him on this?"
23294,Penny,"oh, yeah, be careful."
25395,Penny,"why, you guys going somewhere?"
23951,Penny,shh.
29180,Penny,"all right, so we’ll ask him to come back."
22669,Penny,"gosh, raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  okay, well, i’ll just, um, go eat by myself."
26788,Penny,really?
25237,Penny,"yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the three menstra-teers"
25641,Penny,"why, they’re just toys?"
24980,Penny,"shake it baby, shake it!"
25891,Penny,"oh, my god, you guys look adorable."
23735,Penny,"okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
22532,Penny,got it. 
24617,Penny,"okay, well, forget it. i’m not spending my new year’s eve at a comic book store wearing a wonder woman costume."
23491,Penny,"so, how do you know he ran away?"
28745,Penny,"okay, it won’t be that bad. we wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
25999,Penny,"that’s great. cheerleading, way to man things up."
24649,Penny,oh.
26957,Penny,"i kind of did. the part in that awful horror movie i passed on came back around. apparently, it’s mine if i want it."
24147,Penny,i think we should talk now.
22816,Penny,"oh, no, no, no. it is just beginning."
27603,Penny,"did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?"
23680,Penny,don’t you usually get lemonade?
22073,Penny,yeah.
25803,Penny,maybe i could do it.
26202,Penny,"so, blow off work, go on a weekday."
29092,Penny,"no, of course not. i just, i didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings."
27348,Penny,"well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird."
27996,Penny,can we talk?
24533,Penny,"okay, it’s your game. you go first."
24504,Penny,"you know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. for example, lisa peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend."
23749,Penny,no. the light has been on since i bought the car.
25412,Penny,yeah?
26232,Penny,aw.
21959,Penny,leonard.
25006,Penny,hey.
26960,Penny,"okay.  sometimes i feel like i can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then i see these bananas and i just want to eat them and then kill people. what am i gonna do?"
28257,Penny,wow. you can really arrange that?
29178,Penny,i feel terrible.
25719,Penny,it wasn’t a real proposal.
27250,Penny,can he really throw a ball?
22304,Penny,can you please come get him? 
25654,Penny,mmm.
24248,Penny,you know what? i’m just gonna take the bus to work.
28073,Penny,"okay, just give me that. amy broke up with sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. hang on. she wants to talk to you."
28872,Penny,what? tha… that is not true.
25830,Penny,"once again, unbelievable."
22298,Penny,we have chicken tortilla and potato leek. 
25474,Penny,"well, that’s quite a list you got there."
22700,Penny,"uh, maybe the light’s broken."
29225,Penny,the notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
26374,Penny,no.
24579,Penny,"you’re right. look, from now on, i will tell you the truth."
22286,Penny,"boy, it’s good to be back. "
29436,Penny,hey. is the food here? ooh. what’s that?
25514,Penny,what? that is not true. bernadette wants a pre-nup.
24271,Penny,what does that have to do with joyce kim?
27333,Penny,this is for you.
26591,Penny,"aw, did she hate you?"
24449,Penny,no.
25857,Penny,"i do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. a lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy."
28819,Penny,it doesn’t matter. i’m not doing it.

28101,Penny,"okay, leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing scrabble."
23265,Penny,"leonard, help."
26066,Penny,"mmmm. now i feel bad for picking on all those kids. although, in my defence, if danny biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie."
23627,Penny,"well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists."
28719,Penny,so should we talk to each other or mingle?
22048,Penny,i’m sorry?

28307,Penny,"sheldon, i cooked you breakfast. i made your bed. i checked your mouth for thrush. you can rub your own chest."
29226,Penny,"well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. i mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."

25040,Penny,"wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and howard, you know a lot of doctors."
22748,Penny,"oh, man."
25428,Penny,"yes, you are. you always overthink things."

22266,Penny,uh-huh!
26794,Penny,"i’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
24034,Penny,do i have a choice?
26761,Penny,"no, forget it. i take it back. offer’s off the table."
27869,Penny,mmm. so what do you need help with?
28308,Penny,"oh, that could be fun. but just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?"
24200,Penny,"whatever. ooh, i’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge."
27147,Penny,"oh, i’m sure he’s fine."
23449,Penny,"hey, leonard."

24670,Penny,"oh, yes. he says they are lost without you."
22674,Penny,"of course i would, i would be honoured."
27896,Penny,i doubt it.
27771,Penny,seriously?
29089,Penny,i don’t know. this is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
27946,Penny,"thanks, but i don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs."
25885,Penny,really? never?
25447,Penny,"wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"

25039,Penny,oh!
27158,Penny,he’s a grown man.
26801,Penny,"you keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it."
26626,Penny,howard. cow tipping. real or not?
26828,Penny,"no, i think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
28224,Penny,does it really say that?
26391,Penny,no. yeah. but you know what the second-worst part is? he does not miss me at all.
29153,Penny,"yeah, there’s room in the bed by sheldon’s feet."
22020,Penny,"oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. "
27239,Penny,i said i don’t want you to. i’m getting another drink.
25045,Penny,"woah, leonard and priya are living together? that’s big."
26005,Penny,"okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs."
27215,Penny,"okay, good. she seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."
26271,Penny,"oh. well, that’s like my high school, too. but instead of a curse, it was crabs."
24378,Penny,no.
26018,Penny,"so, how’d it go?"
24957,Penny,"hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
27632,Penny,i don’t want five dollars. i want my dignity.
25032,Penny,"it’s like he’s trying to win a prize. a word of advice, don’t doze off. you will never hear the end of it."
26804,Penny,what’s going on?
24747,Penny,what?
24864,Penny,"okay, let’s go through this one more time. just because leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean i need to go out and hook up with some guy."
27786,Penny,"leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? so our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. this is the way life is. and i’m sure in time they’ll change again."
27697,Penny,this is why i’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
24447,Penny,"well, you defended me, right?"
26225,Penny,"no, we just want information."
26099,Penny,what beverage do you make for that?
28825,Penny,"okay. leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
24725,Penny,the what?
23084,Penny,"anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so i, you know, i paid his fines."
23725,Penny,"okay, can you drive me?"
25754,Penny,"ew, why?"
25941,Penny,it’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
26262,Penny,it’s six thirty in the morning.
27101,Penny,"you know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
24114,Penny,oh. oh. thank you.
25150,Penny,"well, hello? she’s married."
28263,Penny,"well, you’re spending your birthday with sheldon. why not celebrate early?"

28550,Penny,"all right, well, let me know if you guys want to go."
26379,Penny,okay.
24279,Penny,are we ever going to get to the elevator?
27032,Penny,"hey, i don’t understand why you’re not upset with amy."
25580,Penny,"all right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? i’ve taken you to disneyland, i kicked a bully in the nuts for you, i sing you soft kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."
25619,Penny,"all right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
27709,Penny,so what do you think?
29249,Penny,"yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. of course, the first time i say it right, he’s not even here."
25347,Penny,"hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose."
28766,Penny,yeah.
26064,Penny,"oh, this is the best. you have booze with breakfast on a tuesday, you got a problem. you do it on the weekend, you got brunch."
28078,Penny,you win.
22972,Penny,"yeah, well, it almost killed me."
24793,Penny,"well, you’re losing your son."
28958,Penny,"hey, bernadette’s water broke."
27931,Penny,yes.

27137,Penny,no.

25603,Penny,who’s armin the miniature horse breeder?
24989,Penny,"okay, i don’t know you people. i’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my texaco card."
23852,Penny,"oh, sounds festive. did you at least give presents?"
23511,Penny,"you know, i think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. want a glass of wine?"

23335,Penny,"yeah, you know, like in star trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? where the hell did that come from? anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them."
28710,Penny,that’s funny. i learned something totally different.

23509,Penny,"yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. i mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. all right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? for a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. learn what the other person wants and likes."
28118,Penny,"oh, which one? maybe we can get amy to try it."
23646,Penny,"wow, sheldon, i cannot believe you made up your own game."
26354,Penny,"and, uh, extra dramamine? you remember what happened on it’s a small world."

28170,Penny,"come on, amy, show us the dress."
26739,Penny,how could you say that?
26796,Penny,"okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?"
27272,Penny,"well, i wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up."

26765,Penny,"look, i’m sorry i didn’t text you back. i just needed some time to think."
26382,Penny,"so that means i lose, right? it’s over?"
26319,Penny,"ooh, i have an idea. since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?"
26579,Penny,what’s going on with them?
26906,Penny,"how? unlike me, you have a job. i’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like i will be for the rest of my life."
24328,Penny,"ah, du-du-du-du-du. how did they meet?"

28527,Penny,"mm, i think so. dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead."
25406,Penny,what?
26515,Penny,"hey, what’s going on with you?"
25184,Penny,"oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. we all know you’re loaded now."
29393,Penny,hi!

22938,Penny,"you know, i have always wanted to see a big science lab."
25659,Penny,"yeah, yeah, i know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time."
29047,Penny,"hey, boys. how’s it going?"
25702,Penny,"okay. oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, i got a cookie monster tattoo. the acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
28141,Penny,"aw. when he says things like that, i just want to hug him and make everything better."
22282,Penny,"this is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now i get to watch you watch me."
25080,Penny,thank you.
24904,Penny,"sure, anything."
24441,Penny,"so this is the plan? from now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the shamy?"
26214,Penny,"i can explain. i played hooky with the girls, then we all went to disneyland and got… what are you doing?"
22596,Penny,i know. i heard.
22819,Penny,"look, i said i wanted to hurt him, but, but this?"
28000,Penny,really? why is that?
27109,Penny,it was for haemorrhoid cream.
27473,Penny,"oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? they’re just a little intimidated. all you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."
22170,Penny,"well, i finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so i need to practice making drinks."
22099,Penny,"leonard, are you okay."
26061,Penny,"all right. well, you guys have fun. i guess i’ll see you sunday night."
25145,Penny,"oh, god, did he make a move on you?"
22411,Penny,"oh my god, that’s terrible. "
27758,Penny,it’s in your purse. play.
22782,Penny,"yeah, you do that."
26731,Penny,"yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? people were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. more auditions, more parts. now none of that’s gonna happen."
24743,Penny,oh. how’d he do?
27264,Penny,"um, i brought coffee. i wasn’t sure what you like, so i got a regular, a cappuccino and a chai tea. since you like raj, i thought you might be into that."
22079,Penny,sure.
29043,Penny,"yeah. and there are a few things we need to stay on top of. so we thought it would useful, and i can’t believe i’m about to say this, um."
26613,Penny,what are you doing?
28419,Penny,"okay, everybody, sheldon is gonna come back out, but i think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?"
26694,Penny,hey. did you remember to pay the rent?
27318,Penny,yeah.
24012,Penny,"i don’t know what to tell you, sheldon."
26001,Penny,"all right. now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  oh, my god. what is with you guys?"
26647,Penny,"well, you’ll be happy to know i just spoke to zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. he’s on his way here now."
28589,Penny,"well, i’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs."
25664,Penny,"see, there it is, there’s that twinkle."
28039,Penny,why? i can do it right here.
25859,Penny,"yeah, i’m gonna go. it’s just not my idea of a good time."
24536,Penny,truth.
25755,Penny,what about me what?
26155,Penny,"until he cheated on me with my friend gretchen, who’s here with him now."
23689,Penny,my singing?
27381,Penny,"what? no, no, i just put it on the other hand and turn it around. keep that hand in my pocket."
23270,Penny,oh. then never mind.
23979,Penny,we’re going to disney world and ride the matterhorn?
26529,Penny,"yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do."
27908,Penny,"wow, there’s a denny’s in vegas you can actually get married in."
25862,Penny,i guess i could probably try a little harder.
23206,Penny,what?
22485,Penny,"well, i went over to mike’s to make up with him."
26583,Penny,"raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds."
27392,Penny,"okay. nope. that’s it. we are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
23134,Penny,"okay, now this time…"
23035,Penny,just do it!  get inside and shut the door.
22865,Penny,what?
26813,Penny,"yeah, but those tickets only get him into comic-con. that dress gets me into anywhere i want."
23814,Penny,"yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. a lot of the girls threw up, but i gutted that thing like a deer."
24838,Penny,"oh, okay. well, i guess it’s just the two of us, huh?"
28694,Penny,"oh, you know, i also lied about the girl in the bathroom. yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
25140,Penny,"oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. that’s more of a prom thing."
26344,Penny,"it wasn’t me. but she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. she got it. look, i was so jealous. but instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…"
27579,Penny,how could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
28786,Penny,just as challenging as you?
28562,Penny,"oh, yeah."
26127,Penny,what did i do?
22090,Penny,"no you don’t. oh, hey, what’s sheldon supposed to be."
27322,Penny,"all right, guys, look, i would love to go out, but i’ve got to get this done, okay? so have fun at the club. and if you get in trouble, find a policeman. and if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman."
24781,Penny,kmn.
28424,Penny,but now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
26049,Penny,"keep talking about captain kirk, and we’re all gonna stop."
25646,Penny,i dunno. i just think it’s a waste.  relax. i’m just looking at the box.
25684,Penny,amy.
26280,Penny,"no, i’m serious. look, i’ve always had these plans. i was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about."
26250,Penny,"oh, what a jerk."
24858,Penny,no.
22009,Penny,"so you got canned, huh?"
29332,Penny,"pardon. i just need to., yeah."
29421,Penny,freaky.
23833,Penny,"oh, god, sheldon, look i’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. can you just back up a little bit?"
24926,Penny,"you guys should’ve seen leonard when i first met him. there was no eye contact. he was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes."
26502,Penny,"oh, cool. are there pictures?"
28794,Penny,"oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
25896,Penny,"no, it’s not a big deal. just taking a class at the pasadena community college."
23007,Penny,"well, you’d have a terrific chance. i mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. you build stuff that goes into outer space."
24991,Penny,the what?
26650,Penny,"oh, sorry. we’ll keep it down."
22697,Penny,mm-hmm.
23964,Penny,"hey, you know what, leonard, i know i said i could handle your roommate, but i was wrong. we’re going to have to break up."
24192,Penny,he’s been crying?
27460,Penny,i’ll be right there. bernadette’s just parking the car.
27446,Penny,"oh, it’s nice you got him that."
29170,Penny,do you actually pay for that haircut?
25970,Penny,"then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?"
29377,Penny,"hey, sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute, i w…."
28482,Penny,hey. amy’s downstairs.
25807,Penny,what?
22119,Penny,"no, yeah she’s definitely a whore. i mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s howard?"
28373,Penny,"don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. all right, how you want to do this?"
23189,Penny,your dresser? who is this?
22205,Penny,"oh, hey, i didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!"
25779,Penny,that is the last thing i want to do.
25722,Penny,"yeah, i mean, not to the same people but…"
21931,Penny,i’m sorry?
22752,Penny,"yeah, he’s a gift all right."
22562,Penny,"okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it."
26149,Penny,hey.
28815,Penny,"call me crazy, but i found it moving."
27936,Penny,whatever. put us on the internet. i’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
27747,Penny,"sure. oh, we had one of these growing up. i used to play all the time."
28878,Penny,that’s a great idea.
23722,Penny,what?
24454,Penny,"wow. that’s like the worst country song ever. so, how are you doing?"
28838,Penny,okay.
27583,Penny,why? is it about you and sheldon?
29013,Penny,"oh, you always know what not to say. i just, i can’t believe you did all this."
26090,Penny,"okay, hang on. if i go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did i pick up the girl?"
24826,Penny,i’m fine.
28418,Penny,"sweetie, you are weird. everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much."
29231,Penny,"hey, i already set up howard and bernadette. it’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life."
22880,Penny,"nice to finally meet you, too."
23029,Penny,"sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, i don’t know, pleasant?"
27377,Penny,really? why?
28199,Penny,mm-hmm.
24341,Penny,"yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time."
27927,Penny,okay.
23452,Penny,"oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. there’s no reason you have to tell me. i was just, you know, surprised."
22369,Penny,"pathetic. all of you, completely pathetic.  "
27008,Penny,"oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. i have to go to the gas station across the street. i mean, i was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."
29330,Penny,sure.
22057,Penny,"so, do you know who’s in there?"
25783,Penny,mmm.
26326,Penny,whoa. when would you leave?
23077,Penny,tv star.
24241,Penny,"nice to meet you, too. are you enjoying your stay?"
26532,Penny,why’d you get that? you hate lamb.
23094,Penny,maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
26169,Penny,night.
26315,Penny,"fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. sixteen! yes! oh, please tell me we’re playing for money."
24827,Penny,"oh, yeah, yeah. it’s real great. today i drove to van nuys for an audition i thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. turned out to be porn."
23357,Penny,hi. what would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
25704,Penny,"okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that."
23458,Penny,"oh, i’m gonna miss you.  see you later."
24243,Penny,hang on.
26419,Penny,i won’t.
28030,Penny,"oh, it’s good. i just wish leonard would work up the courage to tell sheldon he’s moving in here."
26038,Penny,"don’t play dumb with me, ricardo shilly-shally!"
29352,Penny,"oh, hey guys."
29079,Penny,"okay, that’s the one to beat."
24815,Penny,sheldon!
28885,Penny,"uhbubububuh, i can make do with just the candle."
27293,Penny,hi.
26582,Penny,"oh, that’s amazing,"
27608,Penny,"i don’t know what to tell you. i mean, why don’t you talk to her?"
23144,Penny,would it help?
26305,Penny,"i got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these."
23702,Penny,what do you mean?
22530,Penny,do you want some.
25274,Penny,you pick plenty of movies.
28573,Penny,yes.
27309,Penny,no.
27915,Penny,what?
24996,Penny,"um, okay. tell bernadette to tell priya that i’m on my way to prague to shoot a movie with angelina jolie."
23638,Penny,"sheldon, come in."
27145,Penny,"well, leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
25259,Penny,yeah. i’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. do you know how to cook it?
22570,Penny,"yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. we should really go."
29489,Penny,it was not funny.
27330,Penny,you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
28970,Penny,"mm, that one kind of looks like bernadette."
24345,Penny,"well, go ask leonard."
29018,Penny,"well, leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants."
28994,Penny,"ugh. it’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens."
23993,Penny,"okay, show’s over."
22281,Penny,"i have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? "
28779,Penny,"yeah. you tell him, babe."
25670,Penny,really? what is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? and the time you and i had sex in the ocean does not count.
28670,Penny,oh.
29190,Penny,"yeah, yeah, bye, leonard."
24140,Penny,"again, i’m sorry."
28177,Penny,good luck. i threw out all my tall ones when i married leonard.
23463,Penny,that wasn’t a long hug.
22932,Penny,"ha-ha. no, you’re not."
28742,Penny,don’t be proud of that.
23808,Penny,"thanks, raj. okay, so here’s the thing, i was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?"
24089,Penny,i just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
25601,Penny,"amy, what’s wrong?"
28183,Penny,you’re not curious who she’s out with?
26774,Penny,"oh. hey, sheldon."
22382,Penny,"oh, stop it! bye guys. "
29263,Penny,"well, maybe, i mean, it seems kind of perfect. i have sales experience, and i’ve been a waitress, so i have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
25038,Penny,"yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. do not believe it."
23616,Penny,"oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, i’ve got some friends coming over. not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the nebraska game."
25311,Penny,a… s… take me home.
27711,Penny,"okay, come on. we are not old boring people. we can do better than this."
23492,Penny,"well, leonard, aren’t you going to do something?"
27495,Penny,"certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?"
21900,Penny,"you want to know the most pathetic part? even though i hate his lying, cheating guts, i still love him. is that crazy?"
28508,Penny,how long have you had this secret account?
28879,Penny,"sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours."
28928,Penny,"yeah, i don’t need anything around that i can stab myself with."
25808,Penny,maybe he didn’t notice.
21994,Penny,"wow, centrifugal force!"
26903,Penny,not great. can i talk to you for a sec?
21919,Penny,"really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. why don’t you put some clothes on, i’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
22842,Penny,no.
24130,Penny,"okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. i didn’t know what to say."
24946,Penny,amy’s right. i do want to fling my poop at her.
25091,Penny,"okay. raj, wait. thank you for being my friend. "
26448,Penny,"ooh, now we’re talking."
23297,Penny,"well, sort of."
27121,Penny,you know what? forget it. i never should’ve brought it up.
25089,Penny,yeah.
22792,Penny,"that’s strike one, leonard."
23036,Penny,is leonard around?
26316,Penny,"more potion, please."
22088,Penny,"oh, sheldon, i’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. "
23379,Penny,"have fun, sheldon."
27587,Penny,"amelia and the time-trav… found it. it was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, amelia prepared to do her chores. except something about this morning felt different."
24503,Penny,i drink.
22042,Penny,because you are not at big boy!
27845,Penny,"leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?"
24761,Penny,"so i just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. you know, just do whatever feels natural. sheldon?"
27947,Penny,"me, too."
25279,Penny,"okay, we were going out. you were going to get sex anyway."
25117,Penny,"what’s up, buttercup?"
25565,Penny,"you know, sheldon, i used to cut my brother’s hair. i could do it for you."
28876,Penny,and what? your wizard robes are next to go.
28847,Penny,leonard…
24947,Penny,hey! how’s it going?
24631,Penny,"i’m not going to that party, leonard."
23280,Penny,"okay, new topic, please. hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out?"
22463,Penny,"oh, i’ll tell you what’s going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. "
27525,Penny,do i really force you to do things you don’t want to?
25031,Penny,it makes him desperate to please women. that’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
26138,Penny,"come on, amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are."
27214,Penny,"uh, no. i can keep going."
22241,Penny,"uh, he… . "
28207,Penny,may.
22464,Penny,go away!
21886,Penny,"so, sit next to me. "
25527,Penny,do i like it? wow.
24973,Penny,that’s too many s’s for kissing.
23405,Penny,"oh, alright. i will give you my bed on one condition. that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."
29442,Penny,would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
28478,Penny,she.
29218,Penny,"well, you’re pretty delicate. maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard."
23110,Penny,"okay. you know, i’ve always been curious. what was leonard like when he was little?"
22540,Penny,"alright, i heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. "
23962,Penny,okay. have fun.
25122,Penny,"pretty cool, huh? probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store."
24305,Penny,"oh, god."
27624,Penny,it’s not interesting. it’s incredibly insulting.
23387,Penny,"alright, sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting."
27986,Penny,i’m with leonard.

23513,Penny,"don’t talk, just drink."
24783,Penny,"okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so i’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and i will bring life to mr. spock."
28753,Penny,"well, here’s your key."
28305,Penny,"oh, i love me some leo."

25903,Penny,"okay, listen, there’s something i need to tell you. i’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. so a couple months ago, i started taking a history class at the community college."
25058,Penny,"oh. it’s, it’s not what it looks like."
24491,Penny,"hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says i can’t actually give nachos away. so, just take that when you’re ready."
28532,Penny,"all right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night."
22660,Penny,"yeah, hi, listen, as long as i’m here, i’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank."

22414,Penny,"okay, can you just let me in."
21928,Penny,"well, you know, it’s the cheesecake factory. people order cheesecake, and i bring it to them."

28605,Penny,"thank you. so if we would have asked you to come to vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?"
25850,Penny,"yes, we win again."
25225,Penny,"all right, then break it off with the new girl."
23853,Penny,"sheldon, what about you? did you have a christmas tree?"

22607,Penny,i can’t get the damned key out.
29113,Penny,yeah.
26095,Penny,i hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
25623,Penny,"sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? look at this adorable, smushy face. smush, smush, smush, smush."
23444,Penny,"now, honey, i already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."
21996,Penny,no.
22041,Penny,the barbecue burger is like the big boy. 
29315,Penny,"all right, then we agree. he’s not making any moves, it’s this dr. ramona chick."
28086,Penny,how about thai food?
25219,Penny,"i’m sorry, go ahead."
27914,Penny,what?
28109,Penny,"well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
26503,Penny,"oh, come on. why? how bad could it be?"

24010,Penny,"why don’t i pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
22689,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and i’m going to leave so, namaste.  and fyi, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
28687,Penny,great.

22965,Penny,"yeah, and i checked. not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."
22985,Penny,get out.
22393,Penny,"what do you want, howard?"
27651,Penny,"question one. given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
25374,Penny,"so, are we celebrating anything special tonight?"
24362,Penny,"um, what is that scent you’re wearing? it smells great."
23504,Penny,"okay, yeah, well, i’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
26949,Penny,"i know. next time i get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks."
27843,Penny,"i’ll, i’ll tell you later."
25245,Penny,"yeah, we feel awful."
22728,Penny,dr. sheldon cooper?
28961,Penny,"okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. you can just say actress."
24735,Penny,right. still mad at me about that?
23526,Penny,"no, no. you may be right about me and leonard."
27485,Penny,"me, too."
23682,Penny,anything else?
27686,Penny,i can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
23343,Penny,"you got me. while you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
22939,Penny,since always.
22514,Penny,"right, thanks."
28642,Penny,"yeah, i’m gonna call bernadette and see what’s keeping them."
22405,Penny,"shuddup, yeah you do. "

25812,Penny,"amy, this is crazy. you have nothing to be suspicious about."
25698,Penny,"oh, mm. hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
23824,Penny,"um, does this have anything to do with leonard’s work?"
25744,Penny,thank you. 
24158,Penny,yeah.
24560,Penny,"curtis, and i’m pretty sure he was joking."
22295,Penny,"shhh! sheldon, what do you want."
28246,Penny,why?
22213,Penny,"oh, are you shy? "
24836,Penny,oh. where’s raj?
28147,Penny,"oh, what’s that ring box?"
24268,Penny,"oh, my god."
23460,Penny,okay.

24492,Penny,sheldon?
25956,Penny,relax. he’s just a friend. we’re doing an oral report together. he’s really nice.
22407,Penny,"what was it called, “i hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?” "
26404,Penny,how about i go first?
21863,Penny,i said not now. 
27471,Penny,"yeah, you did. i felt so self-conscious, i had to return them."
27519,Penny,how come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
28160,Penny,definitely.
23566,Penny,okay. what do you watch on thanksgiving?
26125,Penny,"well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings."
28129,Penny,"look, it’s stuart."
24889,Penny,"you know, i gotta tell you, i think you got a real winner with priya."
25113,Penny,"okay, relax. i took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions."
26525,Penny,"awkward silence, sheldon on his phone, no touching. somebody’s having date night."
25336,Penny,"look, sheldon, all i’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to amy."
28409,Penny,"okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"
25774,Penny,of course not.
25307,Penny,yeah. wears them. not just for halloween.
22261,Penny,well imagine how i’m feeling. 
26850,Penny,it wasn’t cheap. it was free.
25805,Penny,"okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. you just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."
22528,Penny,"oh, that’s very interesting."
26464,Penny,thank you. do you want to be on my team?
23180,Penny,"when i go, i usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars."
22824,Penny,understood.
23813,Penny,sure. i did the one with the frogs.
27638,Penny,i really thought he was gonna say let it go.
29250,Penny,"uh, yeah, sure, i’ll check with leonard."
22768,Penny,i don’t know. i was hungry? what’s the big deal?
23530,Penny,"i don’t know. i mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."
25822,Penny,wow. anything else?
27429,Penny,"what, that already happened?"
26174,Penny,"as long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually i’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out."
24337,Penny,why not?
22368,Penny,"oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something elton john would drive through the everglades."
26373,Penny,you know what? that would make me feel better. thank you.
24365,Penny,"guys, how ’bout some music?"
27612,Penny,sure.
22857,Penny,i could think about you.
28481,Penny,i’ll see if it’s available.
28645,Penny,"um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that."
24330,Penny,"okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
22836,Penny,"so, who is she?"
23243,Penny,ew.
27850,Penny,"hey, sorry, got caught up at work. hi, beverly."
27228,Penny,"yeah, and actually, i drink sauvignon blanc."
27282,Penny,almost everyone has a past.
26930,Penny,"hey, i’m a famous actress living in london."
27226,Penny,"sheldon, i’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub."
27858,Penny,mm-hmm.
27389,Penny,"doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy."
28995,Penny,"yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. it’s like i’m married to an old piece of fruit."
28564,Penny,"ah, there’s definitely some oak."
26426,Penny,"oh.  oh, that’s the pizza."
23510,Penny,no.
22604,Penny,"yes, i can’t get my stupid door open."
22871,Penny,"well, thank you."
28233,Penny,public nudity?
28957,Penny,"maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away."
24752,Penny,"okay, just to be clear. you are asking me for help because i know something that the brilliant dr. sheldon cooper doesn’t."
27501,Penny,"oh, sheldon, we didn’t bring any."
24984,Penny,"yeah, i said i’m fine. stop talking to me."
22333,Penny,"wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys. "
23022,Penny,"oh come on, really? "
26013,Penny,"wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. and not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of pabst."
27669,Penny,and the wave is gone.
25889,Penny,"getting a little less cool, leonard."
23383,Penny,oh-oh. i just remembered where the emergency key is.
29098,Penny,what is happening?
29175,Penny,now you’re taking her side?
26674,Penny,"wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
22162,Penny,"well, for penny it’s dancing night. "
22314,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i’ll take care of you, what do you need?"
27248,Penny,leonard.
29023,Penny,some wine.
25554,Penny,"okay, look, i didn’t want to say this, but the real reason i took the painting down was because it made bernadette very jealous."
24022,Penny,"oh. so, is this bruce lee’s nerdy brother, stan?"
25381,Penny,"oh, my god, now i know what i sound like to you when i say stupid stuff."
23386,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, i was making coffee and i ran out of milk."
25866,Penny,"yeah, you’re really just making it worse."
23848,Penny,"oh, i always tear up when the grinch’s heart grows three sizes."
26922,Penny,"you’re right, i’m sorry. sounds like fun."
26293,Penny,i think i know.
24627,Penny,"good-bye, sheldon."
28299,Penny,"okay, if you think it’ll help. oh, just don’t make it placinex. i do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage."
24403,Penny,"no, it won’t. um, how does he know i jog?"
22707,Penny,no.
28214,Penny,damn it.
28457,Penny,"i mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? i moved here from nebraska to be an actress, and now i’m sitting in an engineering lab at caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
23881,Penny,"as long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine."
23283,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sure it’s going to be fine."
25538,Penny,bye.
27364,Penny,"well, if i do well in sales, i could end up making a lot more money than you."
28725,Penny,now sheldon’s popular? what is happening?
24379,Penny,oh.
28679,Penny,how did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
24732,Penny,i really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
28514,Penny,"because i don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. i mean, i know i make a lot of money. but i haven’t been happy for a while."
24505,Penny,exactly. sometimes you can’t win.
26678,Penny,okay.
27743,Penny,shut up.
27671,Penny,today’s your birthday?
28210,Penny,"oh, look at us. our last thanksgiving as husband and wife."
27207,Penny,i’m sorry. i just need a little break from her.
24132,Penny,"okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
26256,Penny,"absolutely not. help me out here, i can’t afford another demerit."
24659,Penny,and leonard didn’t want to work with you? imagine that.
28399,Penny,"w, wait a minute. you mention his birthday and he vanishes?"
22564,Penny,he told you?
27879,Penny,still haven’t heard from her?
24318,Penny,all right. pass the soy sauce.
27510,Penny,"yeah, today amy and i are deciding what we’re all gonna do."
23096,Penny,no.
28955,Penny,"oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
28593,Penny,"oh. sorry. didn’t know you made those. hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"
22289,Penny,maybe friday.
23199,Penny,"what up, moon pie?"
28620,Penny,"well, then it’s settled. yay. so funny. i never thought my second marriage would be to you."
22579,Penny,"i don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…"
28662,Penny,i thought it was really funny.
23604,Penny,the problem isn’t what’s on the inside. it’s the creepy candy coating.
23216,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? i just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
27022,Penny,why would they lie to us?
22171,Penny,"so leonard, how about it?"
23872,Penny,"yeah, i gotta put a sticker over that. so, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
28023,Penny,that’s so great.
23708,Penny,"leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? look, let’s just… sheldon, please,"
23307,Penny,"yeah, i know, tell me about it."
24406,Penny,oh. and the flash shirt is what? because you’re gonna run really fast?
24262,Penny,"oh, i do not believe that."
25137,Penny,you’re a brain scientist. can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
22006,Penny,"okay, one more time?"
25071,Penny,"you know, i don’t even know what the point of me staying in l.a. is. i haven’t gotten a single acting job since i moved out here. the closest i came was last month, i got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
28393,Penny,"so, you gonna get up there later?"
25255,Penny,"oh! bernadette, you look beautiful!"
25818,Penny,"well, of course he’s desirable. i mean, he’s great. he’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries."
29454,Penny,damn.
29410,Penny,"oh, good morning."
24859,Penny,"oh. gee, thanks, but i’m not really in the mood."
25216,Penny,it’s okay.
29169,Penny,"so, relax. we’re happy to have you."
27072,Penny,what would you regret?
28479,Penny,but i could get her.
23190,Penny,"oh, hey, sheldon! how is san francisco?"
24364,Penny,"no, no, i was just giving you a compliment."
22766,Penny,"oh, giselle’s not getting kicked off. it’s totally going to be summer.  what?"
29155,Penny,"ooh, how about white-water rafting?"
29462,Penny,give me a minute.
27738,Penny,"wait, who’s tor?"
25594,Penny,"sorry, stallion. your weird friend giraffe is here."
25414,Penny,it’s penny.
27470,Penny,"no. that’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper."
24220,Penny,"you’re welcome, sweetie."
27463,Penny,oh. we were just talking about how much we love working with you. isn’t that right? dan?
26279,Penny,"see, that’s the kind of passion i didn’t think i had. but then i realized i’m passionate about you."
22749,Penny,"really? well, then will you explain it to me?"
28608,Penny,she would find it perfectly acceptable. you guys saw it. we bonded.
26363,Penny,"i know how you feel. i miss leonard, too."
26243,Penny,you can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
25133,Penny,"ooh, me."
23473,Penny,it’s great to see you too. come on in.
23333,Penny,"well, you know, it’s just that leonard and howard and raj, they aren’t like other guys. they’re special."
27825,Penny,"well, that sucks."
27401,Penny,"well, with all the new stuff i bought for work, i needed to make room in my closet."
28737,Penny,"of course. you can stay in leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
29453,Penny,"hey, sheldon, did you change your wi-fi password again?"
22720,Penny,"sheldon, it’s c, just put down c."
26294,Penny,"okay, i didn’t know."
22214,Penny,"don’t worry, i won’t look. "
26625,Penny,that would explain why the sky was also on its side.
24974,Penny,"sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?"
28060,Penny,it is. you’re the best dad ever.
27573,Penny,"fine, but i’m telling you, it’s terrible."
25242,Penny,"well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
27370,Penny,"okay, if it’s sometimes howie wears yours, leonard already told us."
23279,Penny,"not with a thousand condoms, howard."
23139,Penny,"so you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?"
28261,Penny,"sheldon, being physical with amy is a huge step for you."
22233,Penny,wait… what? 
22380,Penny,hi mike.
27447,Penny,"okay, listen, when leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time."

25154,Penny,"um, raj, there’s someone i want you to meet. this is my friend emily. i know her from my spin class. raj, relax. she can’t hear you. she’s deaf."
22762,Penny,"yeah, i guess."
25712,Penny,"okay, you, too."
22022,Penny,"no, i mean what you find enjoyable. "
21989,Penny,"okay, well, you know, it’s just me. i’m still getting over this break-up with kurt, and this thing with doug would be just rebound sex."
26194,Penny,what?
25236,Penny,"okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it."
24446,Penny,"kinda, sorta had to?"
26335,Penny,"bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
24400,Penny,so you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
24566,Penny,shut up. you know what i’ve been doing for the last hour?
24032,Penny,"all right, let’s go."

22363,Penny,"damn, okay, i’ll just take the roof. "
23065,Penny,"you’re damn right it’s okay. i’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and i wanted something different. so sue me."
23518,Penny,"oh, sweetie. you really can’t hold your liquor, can you?"
28380,Penny,"uh, i don’t know, a bar?"
27399,Penny,"oh, great. i don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper."
26184,Penny,"i just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. it’s something we work on in my acting class."
27736,Penny,"oh, so it’s like the view."
23799,Penny,"oh, thanks. they are cute, aren’t they?"

25804,Penny,"a proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. i’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t i?"
23776,Penny,"yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. i thought you liked her?"
23868,Penny,"no, it sounded like a compliment."
25886,Penny,whoa! that’s heavy.
26535,Penny,"okay, fine, sheldon. what is your side?"
23955,Penny,do i look okay?
26247,Penny,that’s great. that shows a lot of integrity.

23090,Penny,"oh, leonard, honey, if we started living together, i wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you."

27614,Penny,"okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
22375,Penny,what?
25967,Penny,"if it makes you uncomfortable, i’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and i’ll probably end up failing the class."
26599,Penny,"yeah, well, you’re short."
24293,Penny,"no, just keep walking."
25548,Penny,i know.
22211,Penny,"here, why don’t you put these on while i find a shirt and sport-coat to match. "
25128,Penny,"my god, amy, that’s really crappy of you."
22856,Penny,really?
28976,Penny,"so, what happened in texas that was so bad? "

23877,Penny,you know what? i could use a drink. do you want to stop for a drink?
26304,Penny,no.
27753,Penny,"sorry, he’s really good."
23839,Penny,five?
28313,Penny,leonard.
24065,Penny,"right, right. anyway, sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail."
24851,Penny,"look, sheldon, leonard is dating priya. she is staying with raj. that means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more."
23792,Penny,"are you sure? he’s small. i bet i can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
26334,Penny,"sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
23529,Penny,not a lot. just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
25491,Penny,"well, thank you for a really cool evening."

22169,Penny,"i swear to god, sheldon, one day i’m going to get the hang of talking to you. "
25017,Penny,"oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs."
24162,Penny,tell me about it.
25815,Penny,"come on, amy. that is not gonna work."

26400,Penny,come on. it’s still early. let’s do something.
22046,Penny,"really?  i’m actually not that into music. so hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two. "
24764,Penny,okay. one of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. so why don’t we try some improvisation?
27122,Penny,"okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? i finally realize i don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy."
22398,Penny,"yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…"
26693,Penny,why? 
27629,Penny,i know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
25469,Penny,"uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?"
24833,Penny,okay.
25500,Penny,okay. do you want to make out slow?

23606,Penny,"she’s adorable, howard. i think you’ll like her."
25865,Penny,"yeah, i’m not really clear on what that means."
25662,Penny,"i know what it means. and yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
25383,Penny,"still saying stupid stuff. ooh, does she like bracelets?"
28810,Penny,okay.
24209,Penny,"oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to disneyland next saturday and sheldon wants to come."
28854,Penny,"i can’t believe i’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?"
24651,Penny,"oh, honey, i’m sorry."
22063,Penny,"just pretty good, i’d think you were doing very good. "
22179,Penny,then swim to cuba.
21916,Penny,"oh, i don’t think i’ll be able to stop thinking about it."

25118,Penny,nope.  
24260,Penny,"apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
27404,Penny,the word is popular.
22657,Penny,thank you.
22911,Penny,"come on, leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to."
26832,Penny,"hey, same goes for the two of you with amy."
28870,Penny,okay. that’s enough. you know what? what is going on?
23650,Penny,"um, yeah, if you want. i mean, there may not be room. he’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
22263,Penny,"you know, i got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to. "
26996,Penny,"oh, leonard was telling me about dark matter, but i didn’t really understand it."
28678,Penny,would they really do that?
22014,Penny,"oh, sure i am."
23187,Penny,"yeah, we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. can you come? oh, great. do you know 98 other people that might want to come? oh, hang on.  hello?"

22554,Penny,"oh sheldon, please, look, i’m asking you as a friend. "
25834,Penny,"oh, my god, we’re gonna kill them."
22143,Penny,i’ll risk it.
26790,Penny,"yeah, i need to start cracking the window when i leave you in the car."
22526,Penny,"actually, i’ve heard far too much about schrodinger’s cat. "
24790,Penny,just keep going!
27136,Penny,not a chance.
26910,Penny,it’s just so humiliating.
24099,Penny,"yeah, that’s when i buy shoes. now, let’s see what we’ve got. ooh! this is nice."
25422,Penny,"leonard, you know i will always have feelings for you."
28520,Penny,"i love you, too."
23583,Penny,do something.
22930,Penny,"oh, is it okay?"
23340,Penny,thank you.
26458,Penny,"me, too."
26874,Penny,"well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot."
24673,Penny,say you’re sorry.
22840,Penny,screw him. you’re fine.
23676,Penny,yes.
22912,Penny,"yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants."
27679,Penny,sorry.
27831,Penny,just open it.
27388,Penny,"so, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
22961,Penny,"yeah, he came into the restaurant. sorry the napkin’s dirty. he wiped his mouth with it."
24541,Penny,"you know what, i don’t want to play anymore."
24193,Penny,"oh, god, i feel terrible."
29519,Penny,"yeah, sure, why not?"
24857,Penny,i kind of figured that.
28425,Penny,"oh, sure. let me see it."
24502,Penny,"oh, right, that. yes, leonard told me. sorry, honey."
23191,Penny,"uh, no, i was talking to my friend, but what’s up?"
23301,Penny,"okay, now i see the giant squid head. "
29481,Penny,how could red hulk be worthy?
25254,Penny,"okay, yeah."
29239,Penny,oh.
22234,Penny,"you should just talk to him, i’m sure you guys can work this out. "
28780,Penny,"sheldon, what do you say to that?"
24568,Penny,why are you making this so difficult?
25945,Penny,you might want to pace yourself.
27997,Penny,"all right, look, i’m sorry i said i was okay with everything before we got married. i hate that we’re going through this, but i don’t know what to do."
24100,Penny,"yeah, so?"
29243,Penny,i didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.
24983,Penny,i’m fine.
28342,Penny,"no, i, i really didn’t."
24359,Penny,fair point.
22197,Penny,"yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. "
23470,Penny,i missed you so much.
24321,Penny,"oh ha-ha, oh. that’s amazing."
24742,Penny,thanks. what are you guys doing?
22885,Penny,"well, let’s find out."
26327,Penny,"wow. oh, okay, well, i’ll just come visit you."
27938,Penny,what’s going on?
26589,Penny,what window?
27922,Penny,"you know, can i ask you a question?"
26077,Penny,stupid?
24874,Penny,seven of clubs! that is amazing!
27830,Penny,i got you a little something to cheer you up.
24776,Penny,"so, did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you?"
29236,Penny,"you know, on our first date, leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
25761,Penny,it means he is special and smart and nice and…
23102,Penny,what’s that about?
25049,Penny,when a suitcase just won’t do.
24706,Penny,should i ask?
22992,Penny,"and say what? that i didn’t mean it, because i meant it."
29181,Penny,don’t you want to get dressed first?
24901,Penny,"oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! whoo! it really sneaks up on ya, huh? all right, i gotta go."
24289,Penny,"hey, guys, this is my friend zack."
26094,Penny,"honey, if you want one, just get one."
23657,Penny,do you have a problem with justin staying with me?
29363,Penny,"howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “me and my girlfriend?”"
22810,Penny,get them down.
25912,Penny,leonard. it’s eight a.m. it’s like the middle of the night.
27815,Penny,all right.
23779,Penny,are you high?
28276,Penny,"well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know."
28537,Penny,"leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here."
29312,Penny,i cannot believe leonard mentioned the toblerone but left that part out.
28834,Penny,okay. who do i make it out to?
27598,Penny,you want me to stop reading?
25068,Penny,"yeah, sure. yay!"
24107,Penny,"here, drink this. it’ll relax you."
22614,Penny,for god’s sake! 
28474,Penny,what am i smelling?
22973,Penny,"so, who exactly does it want to kill?"
24004,Penny,did that sound okay to you? do not come in here!
24750,Penny,"okay, where is this coming from?"
25643,Penny,"yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
21924,Penny,that sounds like fun.
25932,Penny,"no, i’m a terrible waitress, remember?"
29211,Penny,"oh, are you sure? we’re celebrating our new add drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
28134,Penny,i can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
28407,Penny,no music it is.
24972,Penny,pantsuits suck.
27255,Penny,i don’t know. i kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
28597,Penny,"um, it has seat warmers."
27702,Penny,you went to the dirty store without me?
27609,Penny,"well, you could shove them somewhere."
22499,Penny,i was just wondering if i could talk to you? it’s about leonard.
24751,Penny,"yeah, i saw those. they were funny. i printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge."
29207,Penny,"yeah, you’re right. you know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
27746,Penny,you still worried some berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
25604,Penny,i would have thought at a miniature horse show.
23427,Penny,really?
21984,Penny,"really, nothing?"
25320,Penny,"okay, don’t judge me. so, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
28859,Penny,wet wall?
27019,Penny,"come on, anything can happen. we can push him down the stairs."
27047,Penny,"oh, he does. he so does. what should he do?"
27898,Penny,fine. i want to release butterflies.
24899,Penny,"he was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his spiderman underwear. that’s our lenny, huh?"
28336,Penny,hi. sorry. sheldon would like to say something to you.
27425,Penny,"well, who’d you go with?"
23712,Penny,"yes, you can."
29295,Penny,what?
28320,Penny,"if we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
26945,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
22184,Penny,"okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
23163,Penny,thank you.
24360,Penny,"so, um, amy, sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other."
27224,Penny,that’s so hot.
26920,Penny,are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
28988,Penny,"so tell me, how did sheldon look with an earring?"
28666,Penny,aw.
26229,Penny,"come on. look, the letter was found in bernadette’s closet. doesn’t that count for something?"
24266,Penny,why on earth did you agree to all that?
24550,Penny,"get over yourself. i whistled, you came running."
27774,Penny,i don’t think i asked you.
27852,Penny,"oh, yes. hi, mary."
28841,Penny,here you go. 
27125,Penny,okay. leonard: cool.
28052,Penny,you’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about sheldon?
24113,Penny,i believe i quoted empire strikes back.
28176,Penny,"all right, where is tall british dave taking you?"
23751,Penny,"oh, god, i’m gonna lose the arm."
26722,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet of you, but i was gonna steal food from here. you know, my treat."
26757,Penny,you’re right. i do have you. mm. let’s get married.
29005,Penny,so things started to turn around?
25933,Penny,"yeah, right."
25182,Penny,what? no!
23635,Penny,oh. i was just kind of hoping you were drunk. now we’re back live.
22347,Penny,"yeah, and the bag it came in. "
29166,Penny,hi.
29240,Penny,"bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money."
27452,Penny,"come on, smile. this is gonna be my christmas card."
28542,Penny,"ugh. amy, why did you tell him that?"
25636,Penny,"yeah, it was fun, i walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. felt pretty good."
29428,Penny,"hey, sheldon, can i talk to you for a second?"
28795,Penny,you kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘cause it’s fine.
25820,Penny,"so, how was work today?"
26224,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
25888,Penny,whoa! that is very cool.
26388,Penny,"uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you."
24088,Penny,"that’s no reason to back out. you know, i once got a pretty big honour in high school, and i was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but i went through with it, and you know what? the world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a ford f-150 as a member of the corn queen’s court."
26434,Penny,"no. no, no, no. you know what? the toilet’s been doing that. i called the building manager, so…"
21926,Penny,am i interrupting.
28627,Penny,"yeah, i’m also doing it for leonard. i think this could really help their relationship."
28346,Penny,do people like money? is that what you’re asking?
25732,Penny,just a couple of minutes. you’ve really never done this before?
22117,Penny,he really needs to dial it down.
26509,Penny,"okay, okay. but you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, i think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
22610,Penny,"i know what it means, sheldon! god, you know, i have been in l.a. for almost two years now, and i haven’t got a single acting job, i have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when i was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and i ate it."
27366,Penny,it won’t. let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
23605,Penny,"oh, great thing about ernie, was he never asked me for anything. he just gave."
26914,Penny,"oh, my god."
23231,Penny,"no, sorry. wait! please come back!"
27793,Penny,"okay, look, here’s the thing. i like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but i have an audition for a movie, and if i get it, it could screw everything up."
25176,Penny,"okay, come on. you know you can do better."
29309,Penny,"okay, i’m good now."
25354,Penny,what? i was not a bully.
29471,Penny,"well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?"
26050,Penny,what did you do?
25924,Penny,"that’s right. on my paper. not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf."
28391,Penny,what’s it say?
23783,Penny,"all right, you know what, i will tell you why it’s wrong…"
25799,Penny,sorry!
22796,Penny,"no, just try."
29154,Penny,really?
27164,Penny,i really think this is gonna be for the best.
23447,Penny,for three months?
22535,Penny,"oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
24543,Penny,"oh, hey, leonard. i see you met my dad."
24409,Penny,"uh, no."
28996,Penny,fine.
26421,Penny,"oh, my god. you weren’t supposed to be here till sunday."
25825,Penny,in a way. we’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
28125,Penny,hey.
25121,Penny,"what’s the gist, physicist?"
25234,Penny,thank you. where’s sheldon?
27713,Penny,"yeah, is it a comedy? is it a drama? nobody knows. now, come on. we are gonna do this."
25019,Penny,"hang on a second, you picked up your mother? her own legs are barely able to do that."
28232,Penny,"i told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself."
26021,Penny,"oh, come on, raj, not even a little bit?"
29038,Penny,"okay. leonard, i really appreciate that, but i need a little time to myself."
25617,Penny,"all right. let me give you a little girlfriend 101. usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after sheldon hits puberty. so, i’d say give him the silent treatment."
25111,Penny,i went into this marriage with so much hope.
24845,Penny,"well, i was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. what’s troubling you, buddy?"
24843,Penny,where are all your friends?
26656,Penny,"yeah, we could’ve waited till monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
26338,Penny,"oh, yeah."
27039,Penny,"oh, try again."
28580,Penny,no problem.
27256,Penny,of course not. no one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
24344,Penny,what?
22445,Penny,no? 
25525,Penny,okay. 
29084,Penny,"okay, give. can you guys handle this or not?"
26516,Penny,"all right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?"
27836,Penny,what’s taking so long?
27731,Penny,and that’s why you get an ipad helicopter.
23910,Penny,"well, the fact is, you can’t."
27186,Penny,"okay, thanks. um, i’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell bernadette how badly i blew this interview? she’ll get upset. and honestly i’m a, a little terrified of her."
26807,Penny,"yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
22104,Penny,"well, i ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and i believed him, and i’m an idiot because i always believe guys like that and… i can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and i know you don’t want to hear this and i’m upset and i’m really drunk and i just want to… "
21957,Penny,hi.
26710,Penny,"amy, what about you? what do you think you’d be doing if you never met sheldon?"
26777,Penny,"oh. well, good boy."
27866,Penny,"oh, my god."
25238,Penny,"i know. me, too. we’ll talk to her. hey, wait, how did she find out?"
24707,Penny,"red leader, i’m really sorry."
24986,Penny,"oh, that’s nice."
26576,Penny,when did i have pistachios?
24796,Penny,that’s good. that’s good. that’s good.
27775,Penny,what is the harm if i audition?
22256,Penny,"oh, too bad, well, i got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. "
26143,Penny,"yeah, that was the point of the story."
25794,Penny,"aw, how cute. is this like a diary?"
26394,Penny,this is ridiculous. why am i upset just because he’s off having a good time?
25973,Penny,"leonard, why do you always do this? listen to me, you’re the one i’m with. you know i love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy."
26203,Penny,it’s more like how girls end up at a best western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named luther.
26998,Penny,doesn’t it?
26078,Penny,i don’t know how leonard can get so caught up in this.
26063,Penny,what was that for?
23068,Penny,"oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? yeah. you would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills."
27000,Penny,wait. what’s wrong with geology?
26402,Penny,"no. come on, let’s talk about our lives. tell me something about you i don’t know."
27094,Penny,what gave you the right to mix my dna with that of a killer gorilla?
25667,Penny,"so, i hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
25668,Penny,why should i worry?
23093,Penny,nice hat.
24320,Penny,really? they’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
29429,Penny,hi. sorry i’m late.
24480,Penny,"hey, how are we doing over here? can i get you something to drink?"
28974,Penny,"well, you’re home now."
28535,Penny,you don’t know?
25172,Penny,"okay, um, gosh, how do i start? um, see, raj is kind of naive. i mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. and i’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. you know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.and i.. i… howard, focus. tell her what i’m saying."
27942,Penny,"amy, don’t be like that."
25832,Penny,"okay. ready, set, go."
24375,Penny,what? where did you get 171 men?
28452,Penny,oh.
25253,Penny,sorry.
22270,Penny,"hah, yeah! because he didn’t want sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in america has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
25782,Penny,really?
29125,Penny,"come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
22124,Penny,"okay, i got this, lock and load boys. "
23802,Penny,womenfolk?
25920,Penny,"right, because me being in school is so important to you. that way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress."
27823,Penny,"well, can we get on another airline?"
23637,Penny,i know. i just need you stop talking.
26447,Penny,it was fine.
25201,Penny,this is like the worst hollywood tour ever.
27861,Penny,"of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
26829,Penny,that would really piss me off if i didn’t have a buzz going on.
26266,Penny,i liked it. i’m excited.
28754,Penny,"now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional."
28243,Penny,"come on, sheldon. there are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems."
23581,Penny,"oh, kill me."
27339,Penny,"well, good, because that’s what i did."
23368,Penny,"um, you know, it’s kind of early. do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
28323,Penny,yeah.
24423,Penny,"yeah, to be honest, i don’t see much difference."
24031,Penny,"oh, balls."
22790,Penny,"leonard, don’t you get it? if you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him."
24758,Penny,you were acting?
26909,Penny,i know. thank you.
28711,Penny,"oh, that’s so beautiful."
25968,Penny,"hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"
29422,Penny,"yeah, freaky."
22495,Penny,yes. 
27754,Penny,wow.
25442,Penny,"well, we don’t really have to pretend."
28839,Penny,been hearing that a lot today.
23318,Penny,yes.
27432,Penny,i don’t care. we’ll make our own music.
24596,Penny,just going to skip over that insult.
27991,Penny,sure.
27199,Penny,"okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?"
26809,Penny,"oh, guys, this is really sad. and in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
26145,Penny,"oh, right. yeah, we can do something."
25856,Penny,it’s not getting any better.  ugh. it’s leonard. he wants to go costume shopping later.
26387,Penny,"wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time."
25298,Penny,"yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically."
28776,Penny,"believe me, we know what you’re going through."
25910,Penny,thank you.
28727,Penny,"okay, okay, so amy’s cool, sheldon’s cool. tell me about leonard."
24777,Penny,"okay, cat on a hot tin roof is an american classic."
23369,Penny,"oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. come on, i think i have decaf."
22366,Penny,"not done. by the time i finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. yeah, that’s right, i’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…"
27052,Penny,"oh, no. this face wasn’t because i didn’t get it."
27105,Penny,"you were on set, you saw what it was like."
29159,Penny,"hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
26376,Penny,mmm.
22126,Penny,"cover this, suckers. ha-ha-ha!"
22861,Penny,"sheldon, would you like to come in?"
28279,Penny,that’s interesting.
27687,Penny,that’s it. that wasn’t so bad.
23551,Penny,"uh, yeah, i think we’ll pass."
25382,Penny,"okay, i don’t think amy wants a pocket watch."
28677,Penny,no. you told me not to.
29071,Penny,"yes, we’re fine."
22785,Penny,"well, you have three strikes. one, coming in. two, sitting down. and three, i don’t like your attitude."
29041,Penny,hey.
21974,Penny,"you know, sheldon, howard, raj, who all’s coming?"
28962,Penny,"you know, raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. when i first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. i mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room."
22161,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet. but i’m going out dancing with a girlfriend. "
23203,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
25519,Penny,no and no. everything okay with you and bernadette?
26684,Penny,"oh, you weren’t joking."
25275,Penny,"but come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
26142,Penny,"no. i said, oh, my god, i think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys heimlich’ed him."
22017,Penny,"let’s say 4,390. "
24978,Penny,"oh, we are so taking you dancing."
25581,Penny,"it was a long story. anyway, sheldon, i promise i know what i’m doing. please let me cut your hair."
24298,Penny,he spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
25325,Penny,"okay, look, sweetie, we all love sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. if it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
27409,Penny,"yeah, let’s see. uh, four under the seas, two enchanted evenings, and one night to remember that i cannot remember for the life of me."
26450,Penny,"he’s still mad at leonard, huh?"
24917,Penny,"okay, well, anyways, i brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"
25421,Penny,whoa. not so fast.
29426,Penny,leonard!

24988,Penny,wait. what are you talking about?
23159,Penny,"okay, okay, how about this? we tell him somebody broke in."
26092,Penny,it’s hot when sheldon talks dirty.
24794,Penny,"all right, come on, just try it my way. pretend you’re sad to see him go. i’m gonna lead you in. his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. that’s your cue."

24150,Penny,"i’m sorry. you know what i’m talking about, though."

22620,Penny,"oh, i see?"
22809,Penny,how the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
27064,Penny,i feel like i want to cry.
26199,Penny,"i think you have a great capacity for devotion. you’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? i understand what that is."
25069,Penny,sounds great.
25588,Penny,you don’t have to check with me. do whatever you want.
27275,Penny,no. yeah.
25389,Penny,"i said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"

25710,Penny,hey.
22761,Penny,i don’t know. somewhere in l.a.
23362,Penny,"okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture."
27918,Penny,what did you do?
25365,Penny,"yeah, well, i bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. you know, giving really is better than receiving. i used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
26573,Penny,"good, i’m just having little trouble with the glue."
22416,Penny,he just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one. 
28292,Penny,i don’t wanna.
24292,Penny,"okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun."
28663,Penny,"okay. listen, mom, i know you’re nervous, but i promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
22129,Penny,"this plasma grenade.  ha! look, it’s raining you! "
24288,Penny,"oh, right."
28658,Penny,what?
26128,Penny,"okay. listen, the truth is i don’t want him living with me."
28293,Penny,"you know, i used to wear tank tops a lot. that was a big selling point."
21871,Penny,"thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime."
27087,Penny,thank you.
22864,Penny,he’s having problems with stephanie?
25691,Penny,"no, you’re not."
24191,Penny,"well, good."
22708,Penny,how about we just have a little quiet time now?
24715,Penny,"oh, yeah, that. come on in."
25498,Penny,i’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
24405,Penny,"coming, coming. hey, nice knees."
27494,Penny,"sorry. she’s taken, too."
28274,Penny,"oh, not good. still couldn’t get in to see dr. gallo."
25943,Penny,"yeah, amy told me what happened. look, just apologize. it’ll warm her twaddle."
24867,Penny,"i don’t know. it’s fun while you’re doing it. and then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret."
28201,Penny,"sweetie, you are grown up."
27585,Penny,please show us?
25142,Penny,"ames, hi. how was the wedding?"
22538,Penny,goodnight leonard.
26116,Penny,"no. no, no, i do. i do. it’s just, i mean, it’s a really big step."
23275,Penny,"yes, yes, i know that, okay? i’m tired, i’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. the point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. who’s with me?"
24934,Penny,so you lied to her. also interesting.
22771,Penny,a sports metaphor?
28412,Penny,"okay, this is ridiculous.  sheldon? can i come in?"
22392,Penny,of course.
23887,Penny,"actually, i’ve only had the cheesecake. one more time. you know, leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
27036,Penny,how is that not good?
24387,Penny,really? your deeply religious born-again christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
29333,Penny,we need to talk.
25797,Penny,"oh, disgusting."
24078,Penny,what ring?
26541,Penny,"aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
21979,Penny,why?
25547,Penny,"oh, amy, please."
22642,Penny,"really? boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of hungarian barbarians."
27848,Penny,"you know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. maybe i should get her something so she warms up to me."
27344,Penny,"okay, i don’t want this to turn into a fight."
28761,Penny,"inevitable, you say?"
23181,Penny,"oh, my god, the george smoot?"
22650,Penny,got it.
29134,Penny,"you know, maybe it won’t be that bad. leonard says it’s really mainstream now. comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. i mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
26882,Penny,"of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life."
23647,Penny,"all right, five. one, two, three, four, five. oh, wow, look at that, my department of defence research grant is renewed."
27454,Penny,"who are you kidding? you were so panicked leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him."
26398,Penny,"well, now i miss him even more."
23278,Penny,"okay, it’s done. look, guys, for the future, i don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
22815,Penny,"telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?"
25444,Penny,"yeah, i was gonna throw it away, but i just couldn’t."
27421,Penny,"thank you, so do you."
28015,Penny,"you know what i mean. and, you know, maybe the way i’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too."
25768,Penny,"what do you want, sheldon?"
24555,Penny,oh.
21893,Penny,"oh, yeah, i’m a waitress at the cheesecake factory."
28512,Penny,"well, i have a secret i’ve been keeping from you, too."
23169,Penny,no. not at all.
28004,Penny,i guess my big problem is i never saw leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
26895,Penny,"well, i don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career."
24534,Penny,"wait. no, amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing."
23401,Penny,"i’m uncomfortable, sheldon!"
25440,Penny,"come on, be serious."
23021,Penny,"well yeah, sure. when you put it that way. but it all worked out, right?"
25020,Penny,"yeah, i’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car."
23801,Penny,"oh, great selection, great prices."
23003,Penny,"oh, it’s cute."
22364,Penny,"zzz-zz-zz-zz! second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so i had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family, who insisted i stay for lunch. "
28495,Penny,"hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?"
21872,Penny,great. 
26113,Penny,"um, well, um, all right. you, you know how in harry potter and the half-blood prince, ron didn’t abandon harry just because harry started dating ron’s sister?"
28369,Penny,midnight.
24217,Penny,"i know, i know."
23793,Penny,"oh, i am so sorry."
28877,Penny,ubamy bube cubool.
26314,Penny,"yeah, well i’m supposed to be in vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. now give it. all right, what do i need?"
24875,Penny,"oh, big deal. not knowing is part of the fun."
22683,Penny,"yes, it’s very nice, goodnight raj."
25144,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry, what exactly happened?"
22343,Penny,okay. what artificial satellite has seen glimpses of einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
25053,Penny,"yeah. sorry, sorry. can i tell you a secret?"
28886,Penny,we turned your room into a sex dungeon.
23389,Penny,"are you trying to make small talk? oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to."
24346,Penny,leonard said cockamamie?
23780,Penny,"howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
23690,Penny,"okay, if leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?"
24741,Penny,"hey, leonard, is your wi-fi down? i can’t get on."
23484,Penny,"well, no, but when i was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard i was going to be named head cheerleader. oh, i was so excited. my mom even made me a celebration pie. then they named stupid valerie mossbacher head cheerleader. big ol’ slutbag."
25976,Penny,"yeah. so, how you doing?"
28858,Penny,"oh, no, what happened?"
24992,Penny,hey. seriously? didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
27245,Penny,"hey, sorry about that."
25764,Penny,"amy, you?"
27906,Penny,vegas isn’t that far away.
23681,Penny,do you want lemonade?
28692,Penny,"okay, all right, honey, you know what? there was something i was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now i’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t barbara chen, it was me. i’m the reason everyone knows."
28860,Penny,mm. so why don’t they just get more drywall?
28055,Penny,"uh, good. is mom around?"
28278,Penny,"yeah, they already know i’m a pharmaceutical sales rep."
24798,Penny,there you go.
24516,Penny,"yeah, i think i’ll pass. but you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds."
28083,Penny,what’s the matter?
27422,Penny,"sheldon, doesn’t amy look hot? that’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
28349,Penny,"i don’t know. i’m, i’m gonna flirt with him."
26295,Penny,"see, i’m not a scientist like them."
22149,Penny,i slept all day?
23981,Penny,we’re going skiing in switzerland?!
23356,Penny,excuse me.
25082,Penny,"oh, you did, didn’t you?"
27809,Penny,"i mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much i hated about that world. you, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. i don’t want to feel those things. i want to sell drugs to people who feel those things."
23806,Penny,it’s not about shoes.
25272,Penny,"okay, but the jennifer aniston movie has jennifer aniston, and she’s not building a dam."
28108,Penny,"okay. don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?"
27472,Penny,you’re doing it again.
26839,Penny,that is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
29258,Penny,"uh, it’s okay, i’m still in pharmaceutical sales."
22451,Penny,"sheldon, we have to go."
23704,Penny,"all right, what’s going on?"
25174,Penny,"we didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. and hey, since when are you so chatty?"
27599,Penny,as he stood for amelia to dry him…
26688,Penny,yeah?
27838,Penny,"oh. well, you do."
25158,Penny,"wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
22210,Penny,"oh, nice. "

26161,Penny,"oh, i can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with."
26472,Penny,"ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up."
24024,Penny,"no, it isn’t."

25438,Penny,"okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and i panicked."
27347,Penny,"oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
27482,Penny,see? you don’t have to be mean to get what you want.

24634,Penny,i don’t know. i only started seeing zack again so i wouldn’t be alone on new year’s eve. how pathetic is that?

22817,Penny,what’s this?
25384,Penny," trust me, we are not a couple."
22944,Penny,"oh, shut up!"
22548,Penny,"well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and i didn’t want him to think i was some stupid loser. "

28570,Penny,"uh, you know, i’m not really around that much. amy knows much more than i do."
24029,Penny,"yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
24546,Penny,"yeah, okay. the thing is, i kind of told my father we got back together again."
22549,Penny,"you know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. "
23928,Penny,"sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
25590,Penny,"okay, i’m an actress. ask me again."
26918,Penny,"oh, my god, you guys need to do something!"
24340,Penny,you do realize i stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
24860,Penny,"okay, look, if i agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about leonard and priya?"
27044,Penny,"okay, i can answer that one, i’ll be bored."

23236,Penny,"no, sorry."
28074,Penny,what? what are you doing back?
23718,Penny,"i slipped in the shower, and i think i dislocated my shoulder."
28773,Penny,"okay, i’m confused. which one is mr. robot?"
27524,Penny,"uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. hey, can i ask you something?"
21971,Penny,supper?
27200,Penny,hey. ready to go to lunch?
25899,Penny,"because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can i help?” and “i’m so proud of you.” ugh!"
28574,Penny,yes. pi.
27926,Penny,"uh, keep your mouth off other women."
23358,Penny,"oh, hellblazer. what’s this about?"
22481,Penny,"no, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. "
24095,Penny,"oh. i say a lot of things, sweetie. so, how about it, sheldon?"
28636,Penny,"well, why is he turning here? the restaurant’s the other way."
27252,Penny,hi.

28038,Penny,"okay, well, you’re a grown woman now."
22571,Penny,bye guys.

26002,Penny,"what, never?"
27305,Penny,bernadette? girl’s weekend. vegas. you in?
23632,Penny,"oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. they just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen."
25593,Penny,"choo got a problem with that, papi?"
27184,Penny,people.
27308,Penny,nah.
26622,Penny,"oh, stop it. i’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
24729,Penny,we are not having coitus.
27382,Penny,"well, what do you mean why? look, i make more sales if these doctors think i’m single. i did the same kind of thing as a waitress. the real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?"
22847,Penny,please don’t do that.
24923,Penny,"i am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. and he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, i had to carry him to the water."
24896,Penny,"uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"
28689,Penny,"sure, sure. uh, did you ever figure out who told?"
28322,Penny,"shake it, baby."
25180,Penny,"i know, i know."
28802,Penny,not relating. go on.
27128,Penny,"yeah, it kind of does, huh?"
23001,Penny,"okay. well, bye. "
23302,Penny,"hey, i just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift."
26682,Penny,"yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, i’ll give you ten dollars."
25460,Penny,that was a really nice dinner. i’m glad you asked me out again.
24198,Penny,i’m so glad you like it.
28609,Penny,"hi, how was the screening?"
25427,Penny,you’re overthinking this.
27539,Penny,and you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
23593,Penny,"really? oh, great. i mean, aw. okay, i gotta go."
28157,Penny,"sweetie, you’re yelling."
27484,Penny,"you know what? that was almost on topic. i’m gonna say good job, sheldon."
28837,Penny,what’s your name?
26572,Penny,"oh, yeah, just the first one. i didn’t save them all."
22132,Penny,or we could just have a life. 
26968,Penny,wow.
28498,Penny,"okay. calm down. i’ll go first. all right, let’s see. never have i ever…"
26057,Penny,"damn, you’ve got more makeup than i do. you’ve got better makeup than i do. yeah, i’m borrowing this."
29456,Penny,you don’t know the half of it.
24658,Penny,why not?
24686,Penny,"oh. oh, okay, well, you know, like i said, i have plans, so."
25723,Penny,"well, that’s easy. anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. i know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want."
23477,Penny,"oh, the poor thing."
26218,Penny,really? you couldn’t just say that? you had to tell the scrotum story?
22191,Penny,"oh, i’ll wedge it right in there. "
26690,Penny,what’s that?
23671,Penny,is leonard coming?
27054,Penny,okay.
22575,Penny,"yeah, why not?"
25578,Penny,where are you going?
26443,Penny,no.
26975,Penny,i wouldn’t exactly call star trek embarrassing.
27551,Penny,what exactly do you think goes on here?
27903,Penny,here we go again. why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? we’re committed to each other. we’re happy. a ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
27568,Penny,"hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, i’d keep it moving."
26848,Penny,do you know how much gas is?
26403,Penny,"okay, that, that’s a good start, but i was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
25062,Penny,no.
28080,Penny,"uh, well, honey, you know, now that leonard and i are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
29320,Penny,come on. looks don’t matter to sheldon. because he only has eyes for you.
29057,Penny,"hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? i’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
26601,Penny,"okay. um, you’re lucy, right? i’m a friend of raj koothrappali’s. actually amy recognized you."
25633,Penny,"well, i was thinking about sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
23391,Penny,"oh, god, i don’t know sheldon, are you star wars?"
26857,Penny,"oh, good."
28041,Penny,"oh, come on. i’ll be gentle. let me take your ear virginity."
25419,Penny,you are so funny.
23541,Penny,"sorry. okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
29351,Penny,"oh, hey sheldon, what’s going on?"
29401,Penny,"hey, guys, what’d i miss? what’d i miss?"
23925,Penny,who is it?
24170,Penny,"yeah, you are! just back off!"
24693,Penny,"boy, this is great. i haven’t had a vacation in ages."
26333,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. remember what happened when i took care of your goldfish?"
27131,Penny,you’re right! yay!
29203,Penny,"mm. well, we’ve loved having you around. right, sweetie? leonard?"
27776,Penny,"i don’t know, i make a movie, become rich and famous, win an oscar, a golden globe and live an incredibly wonderful life."
26198,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake, just come to the play."
26360,Penny,"can’t stay long. i left sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. he’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… are you okay?"
22148,Penny,"uh, what time is it?"
26637,Penny,i will. why are you making this such a big deal?
26052,Penny,"i can’t help it. but, look, i figured i could sit around and feel insecure, or i could do something about it. so i got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes."
23672,Penny,"well, that’s not gonna happen."
25003,Penny,"hey, do me a favour and take table seven."
26414,Penny,come on.
25842,Penny,"i wonder if it’s from, like, ancient rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. you know, to appease loseroneous, the god of losers."
26947,Penny,hi.
26862,Penny,just shut up.
25179,Penny,he is cuter now that i know he’s rich.
27385,Penny,"okay. whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. you got to get rid of him."
24847,Penny,ugh!
23130,Penny,"yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. your mother told me."
27658,Penny,"yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? what’s yours?"
25408,Penny,screw it. i’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. it’s just dinner.
28617,Penny,"hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. we could keep it small and informal. this time we can invite our families."
24501,Penny,"all right. sheldon, what’s on your mind?"
24049,Penny,"oh, nice."
21906,Penny,i’m sorry?
25870,Penny,you’re kidding.
23033,Penny,penny.
28821,Penny,i don’t know.
23098,Penny,"yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
24726,Penny,"oh, okay. just like old times."
28548,Penny,"oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, i won a night of wine tasting from work."
29163,Penny,"well, it’s like that science thing. for every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
24521,Penny,"uh, just wear something comfortable."
27816,Penny,"i, uh, huh."
24103,Penny,where the hell d’you find that?
29120,Penny,"wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? because look."
28259,Penny,"okay, well, what’s the third option?"
28575,Penny,more specific.
22702,Penny,do you have any alcohol?
23548,Penny,"um, yeah, sure, thanks."
22519,Penny,"i’m sorry, i don’t get the point. "
22593,Penny,"okay, i get it, i get it, i get it."
27195,Penny,next monday.
27833,Penny,i called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over skype.
29049,Penny,"wow, i find that hard to believe."
23917,Penny,"you know, i believe in ghosts, too."
28226,Penny,hey. where’d you go? i can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
25816,Penny,there’s nothing to be brave about. everything’s fine.
29117,Penny,hi.
24176,Penny,"god, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?"
24269,Penny,"a little bit. okay. let me get this straight. you move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this joyce kim, and you still stay?"
24872,Penny,"let me see that. oh, screw it. i can deal with a little self-loathing. let’s go find me a heinie to bite."
27034,Penny,"come on, open it. i bet it says something great."
28989,Penny,"actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight."
24488,Penny,not where i can hear you guys.
24561,Penny,"yeah, okay, i think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."
26141,Penny,"this old guy was choking on his food, and i saved his life."
27588,Penny,"maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. a man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
23975,Penny,"okay, what’s the big surprise?"
26296,Penny,what’s that?
27660,Penny,"well, not to steal from the bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
25379,Penny,"honey, she’s upset. you’re her boyfriend. you have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by."
23428,Penny,morning. what’s up?
22268,Penny,"there’s no symposium, leonard lied to me, isn’t that right leonard. "
24769,Penny,"okay. uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and i really need those shoes. they are my biggest seller. yes, ladies sizes six through ten. thank you. oh, sorry, i have to go, i have a customer. bye-bye. hi. can i help you?"
24514,Penny,"well, i’m watching it now. why would i want to see it again on friday?"
24722,Penny,"well, i’m not getting in bed with him."
24785,Penny,all right.
28817,Penny,i got asked to sign autographs there.
24250,Penny,"oh, leonard?"
23532,Penny,"so, we’ll just be friends."
24663,Penny,"no, sorry."
25994,Penny,"okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. it’s right up there with icky and get it away. now pick one up."
22026,Penny,what?
24969,Penny,"okay, suit yourself. we’ll probably be trashing priya a little."
29008,Penny,"what, what’s all this?"
24519,Penny,"oh. um, it was, it was just going to be me and bernadette. besides, i thought you were going to the movies with sheldon and the guys."
29161,Penny,"yeah, it’s yours."
24420,Penny,"okay, can i get you after friday when i get paid?"
23490,Penny,"oh, my god. that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that i didn’t understand."
29036,Penny,"well, yeah."
23039,Penny,well the “check engine” light is fine. it’s still blinking away. it’s the stupid engine that stopped working. it cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
29242,Penny,all that and he’s shorter than me.
28981,Penny,that’s too loud.
22037,Penny,a shower. 
24557,Penny,"oh, will you please let it go?"
27567,Penny,"no, i do. i didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing."
23994,Penny,"sheldon, this is leonard’s decision. he invited me to switzerland, and i intend to go."
28828,Penny,really? i feel like i’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
24840,Penny,not really.
28398,Penny,"on the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
25639,Penny,"mmm. and, i got you a transporter too!"
29213,Penny,uh-oh. someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.
27362,Penny,it really bothers him?
23285,Penny,"well, i’m sure the new people will be just as quiet."
28757,Penny,wow. i cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
28823,Penny,"oh, yeah."
29300,Penny,sorry.
29321,Penny,thanks. i was scrambling.

22437,Penny,"well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print. "
22394,Penny,missy?

29182,Penny,we’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. we really weren’t fighting about you.
23575,Penny,"mm-hmm. hey, want to get a little crazy?"
25978,Penny,"hey, anybody want a drink?"

25897,Penny,"it’s just one history class. look, i didn’t finish college, so i thought i would give it a try."
25452,Penny,"no, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. that’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag."

29310,Penny,"not only did they eat together, leonard said he made her laugh."
28705,Penny,"oh, hi."

22926,Penny,"sheldon, i am very, very sorry."
23403,Penny,"well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one i’m going with."

27504,Penny,"sweetie, you really thought i’d want to do this?"

27744,Penny,"you know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than sheldon."
22439,Penny,exactly.
28852,Penny,"you know, once, i proposed to him."

25318,Penny,"good night, leonard."
23309,Penny,"uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, i read the best science joke on the internet. alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. this goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. the man says, “well, i’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” the owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” and the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”"
26062,Penny,okay.
23205,Penny,"oh, great, my rhinestones. thank you."
24398,Penny,"sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
24322,Penny,does nasa know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
28302,Penny,"no, no, no, no, no. i’ve seen that movie. it’s called iron man."
24315,Penny,are you out of your mind?!
26636,Penny,"ugh, would you stop? we just did it as a goof."
25606,Penny,"sure, i get that. i mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all."
22983,Penny,hey.
28935,Penny,"well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but i kind of feel like i’m already doing that."
26263,Penny,it was cute.
22556,Penny,"oh, um, you know, i think i have the dinner shift on friday."
26638,Penny,so how do i undo this?
22508,Penny,"okay. um, here’s the thing. so, i’ve known for a while now that leonard has had a little crush on me…"
28491,Penny,"you know, we could still go. a little rain isn’t gonna kill us."
28900,Penny,"ooh, sheldon gonna get some."
26974,Penny,"well, i’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and i got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and i just don’t know if i should take it."
24968,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry, honey, i’m meeting amy and bernadette for dinner. but you’re welcome to tag along."
23707,Penny,"oh, my god, would you let this go?!"
23095,Penny,"sheldon, here is your money. thank you very much. it helped a lot."

24665,Penny,"hi. i’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your sheldon back."
25515,Penny,"so you’re saying if i became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
25164,Penny,"well, so how much is that?"
29286,Penny,"and for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice."
23494,Penny,"well, wait a second, leonard, come on, how can you not go? he’s your best friend."

26135,Penny,"sheldon, what did you say?"
26753,Penny,"oh. sorry, i meant to. anyway, um, i was just upset with myself. i wasn’t mad at you. i just feel like everything is falling apart."
24006,Penny,yep. ‘cause i’m gonna be dead.
22851,Penny,"yeah, leonard told me."
22860,Penny,this is a door knob.
22480,Penny,but i never gave the man a chance to explain. 
23512,Penny,"okay. see, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off."
23429,Penny,"oh, no, thanks. i have coffee."

23968,Penny,"no, wait, wait, no, wait. wh.. what are you doing here?"
24961,Penny,"okay, listen, just because howard and bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around."

24966,Penny,what?
26826,Penny,"i’m serious. who wants to do all that stuff? have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
27867,Penny,"well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables."

23032,Penny,eww.

26104,Penny,"maybe you don’t, i do. what’s the deal?"
24698,Penny,hey.
26308,Penny,"oh, it’s not so bad. you lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. i mean, that’s vegas, you nailed it."

23860,Penny,why were you keeping this a secret?
23907,Penny,"right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact."
28691,Penny,"uh, you know, when i was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
29140,Penny,hey.
28477,Penny,"you know, there’s a cabin in big bear that a doctor i work with keeps offering me."

25391,Penny,"okay, he wants to talk to you."
23284,Penny,"okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
25669,Penny,"oh, come on leonard, it’s you. what’s going to happen? i mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
29221,Penny,it’s nine o’clock. 
23396,Penny,why are you asking?
27279,Penny,yes.
22870,Penny,no.

25960,Penny,what am i supposed to say?
27571,Penny,"what, no, why?"
27467,Penny,"okay, look, i know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."
26668,Penny,"you know, if it makes you feel any better…"
26237,Penny,"it was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave."
27558,Penny,okay.
25361,Penny,"okay, come on, i don’t even have my own house, i’m going to build one for someone else?"
27721,Penny,"if it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"

22341,Penny,"good for you, sweetie. okay, next question. what is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? howard."
28430,Penny,"well, never hurts to have a spare."
28149,Penny,"okay, back to the ring. does amy even know about this?"
23331,Penny,"um, i don’t know, i don’t think a lot."
28633,Penny,"no, of course not."
25925,Penny,"hmm, how about, gee, penny, you’re smarter than i thought. you may be the one in school, but i’m the one who learned a lesson. i’m so stupid, penny. duh."

27258,Penny,"yeah. you’re probably right. i used to think my high school p.e. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much."
25648,Penny,"leonard, i bought you this because i wanted you to have fun with it. i don’t want it to just sit in this box."
24457,Penny,okay. good.
24531,Penny,"okay, there you go, sultry sunrise red. what do you think?"
28010,Penny,"so, you said you had something to tell me."

27884,Penny,"well, we will. we’re just not in a rush."
24433,Penny,"really, you want me to sing soft kitty to a computer monitor?"
23649,Penny,"actually, i have to pick up my friend justin from the airport."
24774,Penny,"okay, you know what? let’s just try a different improv. uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass."

29368,Penny,"here you go, good luck, bye."
26545,Penny,"oh. i know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
27030,Penny,think i’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
24830,Penny,why?
27337,Penny,"oh, come on, leonard, i know the car was a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both."
22450,Penny,"here, buy this one. look, it’s the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available. "
23953,Penny,"oh, what a gentleman. hey, sheldon. "

24772,Penny,"yes. look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes."
21937,Penny,yeah?
23941,Penny,"sheldon, i can’t believe i’m saying this, but i’m going to miss you."
25733,Penny,"oh, my gosh, that’s awful. the other kids make fun of you?"
28168,Penny,and you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
27229,Penny,relax.
26420,Penny,"yeah, i didn’t stay for the detention, i’m not gonna read the report card."

25610,Penny,that’s hilarious. no.
27390,Penny,"okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you."
23592,Penny,"sheldon, that is incredible."

24397,Penny,for what?
28916,Penny,"you know, how come nobody’s talking about howard’s dopey haircut?"
24002,Penny,"no, no, it’s probably just allergies."
21932,Penny,"no, i haven’t."
23415,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
27057,Penny,"sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?"
29398,Penny,get out.
22269,Penny,"it’s okay, i do, look, leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with dr farmin..farm…ian"
24822,Penny,"ooh, i thought i smelled pizza."
27824,Penny,"so, that’s it? we’re not going?"
23185,Penny,"oh, cool."
27526,Penny,how is it okay?
27338,Penny,what should i have done? taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
27080,Penny,"oh, my. it’s not a contest."
22339,Penny,"okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. what is the shortest light pulse ever produced? dr cooper."
23519,Penny,"oh, hey, sheldon. what you got there? a new comic book?"
25034,Penny,we were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
22625,Penny,"okay.  wait, wait, where are you going?"
26291,Penny,hello.
24581,Penny,okay.
25163,Penny,"what do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
25018,Penny,"okay, you know what? you are unbelievable. you buy all these superhero t-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room."
26639,Penny,"great, well, what do i have to do?"
24574,Penny,"okay, sheldon, you don’t have to do this because leonard and i are not…"
23837,Penny,squared?
24440,Penny,"okay, i’m just gonna walk away, ’cause i don’t want to be here."
25957,Penny,"would you stop? look, he just moved here from london, okay? he doesn’t really know anybody."
22803,Penny,"oh, no, are all the machines taken? what are you gonna do?"
25147,Penny,"so, um, what are you gonna do? do you want me to talk to leonard, let him down easy?"
28440,Penny,"if you guys would shut up, i could tell you. oh. be cool, be cool, be cool."
25930,Penny,that’s better.
25742,Penny,great.
26751,Penny,hey.
27708,Penny,"yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. hey, when you got back to this store, i want to go with you."
27129,Penny,where did you get a ring?
22812,Penny,"look, wait, sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? i’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?"
27294,Penny,"oh, thank you for coming."
22123,Penny,"oh, what, what, what? "
23413,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, um…"
25027,Penny,"yeah, tell me about it."
26611,Penny,what do you mean how? what’s the big deal?
22230,Penny,"anyway, i was talking to leonard this morning and i think he feels really bad about it. "
25729,Penny,"i can’t believe it. this whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying."
29109,Penny,"all right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
28730,Penny,"you know, i had no idea caltech is exactly like my high school."
22800,Penny,"time to do your laundry, huh?"
23747,Penny,could you please drive a little faster?
23571,Penny,"raj, what about you?"
27534,Penny,"uh, bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada."
24559,Penny,"yeah, that’s great. it’s a funny story. moving on."
24610,Penny,no.
23574,Penny,"ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?"
27570,Penny,"oh, god. probably nothing. i think i saw the director twirling a sign outside the verizon store."
25183,Penny,"here you go, boys. i’ll pick it up when you’re ready."
22337,Penny,"you know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
24071,Penny,"yeah, sometimes i don’t listen, sometimes i just watch your jaw go up and down."
27531,Penny,"sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready."
24448,Penny,what?
25638,Penny,"you’re welcome. don’t worry, i didn’t forget about you. leonard, i got you a label maker."
25157,Penny,is raj out with emily again?
23668,Penny,"oh, there it is again! you think i’m stupid!"
22542,Penny,how is that not a braniac? 
23409,Penny,your home is twenty feet from here.
23399,Penny,"sheldon, i really don’t want to talk about this with you."
26952,Penny,i’m gonna go with monster. what do you got?
26130,Penny,"yeah, and i’ve seen those legs. you might want to get some drano."
27056,Penny,"oh, i get it, like c3po. what happened to me?"
26827,Penny,"oh, come on, it wasn’t me. anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
28934,Penny,what a jerk.
28429,Penny,"come on, just open it."
26106,Penny,then what’s the problem?
26011,Penny,come on.
22139,Penny,how am i supposed to plan my bodily functions?
29406,Penny,out of coffee. need coffee.
22389,Penny,you’re welcome. 
22415,Penny,"okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday."
24325,Penny,sheldon has a girlfriend?
25321,Penny,"hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and i turned out just fine. hey, look, i have peach schnapps. thank god."
24916,Penny,"oh, i know. bernadette told me. sorry, sheldon. i know that game meant a lot to you."
29338,Penny,right.
27302,Penny,bye.
23497,Penny,go.
28924,Penny,but you commissioned it.
26257,Penny,"well, hang on. maybe the chinese haven’t finished watching it yet."
22024,Penny,"well, maybe that’s what i was going for. "
29112,Penny,you don’t how much your rent is?
28431,Penny,"see, she’s trying to get you back. now, that is exactly what i would’ve gotten you if i had any idea what it is or what you do."
27764,Penny,what? a few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
26562,Penny,"oh, i am. maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why."
27171,Penny,"besides, i don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? i’m holding my breath until your hair grows back."
22395,Penny,missy?
27100,Penny,what? you can’t fire me. i’m the star. i’m the girl that goes bananas. it says so on the poster.
22472,Penny,"yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the michigan state penitentiary found it. "
29045,Penny,"article 8, subsection b, leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours penny is not home. this includes boxers, briefs, thongs, g-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
27444,Penny,he’s gonna be all right. that is sticky.
24460,Penny,you want the fruit platter?
27296,Penny,"okay, sit down. listen, emily, what happened between me and raj was a long time ago."
25021,Penny,what’s the difference?
23005,Penny,"oh, it’s fun."
24784,Penny,it’s only logical.
23540,Penny,"oh, you’re my little homunculus."
24142,Penny,"all right, sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
22052,Penny,"alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy. "
27778,Penny,"okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?"
23557,Penny,yes please.  you’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
22096,Penny,"okay, kurt, please."
22324,Penny,you deliberately stuck me with sheldon. 
22588,Penny,"third floor tonight. mixing it up?  oh. you know, i still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something."
26728,Penny,they must’ve cut it.
24800,Penny,"oh, howard, i can’t believe bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
22094,Penny,kurt!
23609,Penny,"right. oh, and i told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother."
24765,Penny,this is all about listening and responding.
25393,Penny,"okay, look, he bought you this."
21978,Penny,"no, six thirty’s great."
22913,Penny,what?
27352,Penny,"oh, thank you so much. it feels so good to hear you say that. and i want you to know that i get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and i’m trying to be sensitive to that."
24717,Penny,"oh, right, right, the blog."
22890,Penny,you have a bat signal?
25109,Penny,what is wrong?
28321,Penny,and now you see the problem.
29195,Penny,"well, i hope not. i just hate when people play those kinds of games."
29508,Penny,"are we an item? girl, quit playin’."
23140,Penny,that is the sickest thing i’ve ever heard.
28639,Penny,"you know what, flash your lights. let him know it’s you."
25280,Penny,no. no woman would.
23945,Penny,yes.
25526,Penny,wow. i-i don’t know what to s… wow.
25095,Penny,"hey, what you doing, quick draw?"
27630,Penny,open the door now.
25455,Penny,what do you mean?
25407,Penny,"okay, he is not dying."
28245,Penny,do you even like the beach boys?
29302,Penny,"well, what’s wrong with that?"
22049,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not. "
23679,Penny,great.
25694,Penny,"for the record, not your worst opening line."
26522,Penny,"oh, just a little treat. i know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
28997,Penny,leonard?
26852,Penny,i think there’s something going on between the two of them.
27509,Penny,"yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary."
23906,Penny,"oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
28588,Penny,"wow. didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. uh, you know what, enough about leonard. let’s talk about you. what would you like to do while you’re here?"
23055,Penny,"okay, whatever. it’s not like i’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. i bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?"
22652,Penny,"oh, here come the mummies, which spell do i use? the hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?"
23847,Penny,"actually, that’s not true, leonard. in fact, recently i’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands. their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the aharonov-bohm quantum-interference effect. that’s it. that’s all i know. oh, wait! fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts, not the scientist."
27533,Penny,i know. i’m really proud of sheldon.
23257,Penny,"okay, well, i’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order."
21899,Penny,"i just, i can’t believe i trusted him."
23891,Penny,you’re in trouble.
24970,Penny,"okay, i’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out."
26590,Penny,"ooh, what are you gonna get?"
24655,Penny,"seriously, i have a great idea for one."
27138,Penny,"okay, then, yeah."
29100,Penny,"okay, i want in. ten bucks says i’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
22521,Penny,"okay, so you’re saying i should go out with leonard. "
25645,Penny,i cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
22384,Penny,"wow, you don’t look that much alike."
28374,Penny,"oh, my god, i can’t believe it."
26136,Penny,"oh, don’t get all huffy. you’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if i was ready."
26370,Penny,"sweetie, did you have a bad dream?"
24059,Penny,can i bring leonard?
28760,Penny,ugh. can we just have sex?
24477,Penny,"okay, i will think about it."
26603,Penny,"yeah, this is none of my business. but why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
29458,Penny,sittin’ pretty.
28799,Penny,thank you.
26215,Penny,"ooh, it smells good."
26787,Penny,because leonard just pissed me off. am i being an idiot or not?
28980,Penny,what?
22598,Penny,"sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…"
22262,Penny,thanks. i just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. 
25357,Penny,that’s easy for you to say. you weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
27569,Penny,"okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you."
28229,Penny,oh.
22196,Penny,"okay, thanks."
23025,Penny,"yes. well, that is a good question. but is this really the best way to figure it out?"
27562,Penny,mmmm.
28660,Penny,"so, uh, randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in california."
26924,Penny,"got it. hey, who’s the murderer?"
28664,Penny,pretty good. i actually just got assigned a much better territory.
22717,Penny,"yeah, and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts. you know, i gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?"
27605,Penny,i’m sorry i didn’t have a camera.
22853,Penny,"well, what about me?"
26842,Penny,"no, cinnamon ate the chocolates. that’s really bad for dogs."
25724,Penny,"okay, i’ll, i’ll go. howard and bernadette, i know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. it just matters that you have each other."
27720,Penny,"i mean, who even reads scientific american?"
23611,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s your fault."
27590,Penny,"it stung amelia when he spoke to her this way. in her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."
21969,Penny,"okay, well, thank you, again."
25462,Penny,"i have. you are not wrong. i just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow."
27716,Penny,"sweetie, i beat you at this, too."
25685,Penny,hey.
26120,Penny,"oh, please let some of it be xanax."
24372,Penny,"no, no. my point is, uh, tonight is sheldon’s first official date. discuss."
27705,Penny,"okay, did you go to the dirty store or michaels?"
25564,Penny,"you’re talking about the painting, right?"
27563,Penny,"so, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?"
29031,Penny,"all right, we’re heading out."
24771,Penny,"um, okay, sure. luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
26887,Penny,"you know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…"
26830,Penny,"you have valentine’s plans? which came out sounding way more surprised than i meant. here, let me try that again. you have valent… see? i can’t do it."
23775,Penny,"yo, raj, talk to me. i’m sorry, just screwing with you. hey, howard, why haven’t you called bernadette?"
27652,Penny,just says anyone in the world. i guess that means living.
25609,Penny,"mm. you know, amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
23305,Penny,yeah.
22845,Penny,i’m sorry?
22218,Penny,"oh, why didn’t you wear it at halloween?"
23963,Penny,"sheldon, what do you want?"
23944,Penny,interesting. i usually just have coffee. you’ve been up all night?
23923,Penny,"it won’t happen again, what’s up?"
27740,Penny,guys.
23584,Penny,that’s great.
28516,Penny,"okay, really? so you’d be fine if i went back to acting and waiting tables again?"
23028,Penny,thanks pal.
24795,Penny,"all right, come on, come on. put some real emotion into it. blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. go."
22312,Penny,again?
27518,Penny,is there any part of your body that’s normal?
24929,Penny,"no, but i can name all the kardashians."
25143,Penny,"come in, let’s talk. do you want a glass of wine?"
28907,Penny,"well, and what happened to you?"
26348,Penny,cheers.
26441,Penny,"okay. look, honey, i promise there’s no one’s here. i‘ve had a long day. i just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
26524,Penny,bernadette told me everything. now you don’t get the left or the right.
25012,Penny,"alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber."
28037,Penny,oh.
22490,Penny,"you know, just once, i would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. "
26528,Penny,"sheldon, i don’t understand. i thought you said you were fine with it."
28067,Penny,"thanks a lot, guys."
22901,Penny,sure.
25249,Penny,i never gave you a friendship bracelet.
28493,Penny,"hey, let’s light a fire."
27818,Penny,"oh, i pack light. once, i got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long t-shirt and a belt."
28329,Penny,yeah.
25211,Penny,glass of wine?
24050,Penny,"oh, okay. well, i was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
26494,Penny,"well, where the hell’s the coin?"
25959,Penny,it didn’t come up.
24676,Penny,"oh. good for you. so all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to leonard, but say it sarcastically."
28555,Penny,you actually smell the wine?
28445,Penny,"hey, guys."
22200,Penny,no.
24876,Penny,"hey, you look great. good for you, priya. i could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great."
25626,Penny,"sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…"
23483,Penny,"well, you know, i do understand what you’re going through."
25780,Penny,get out.
28929,Penny,so if it breaks there’d be none of it?
27260,Penny,"yeah, i hope you’re right."
25836,Penny,"relax, we got time, this is so fun."
25993,Penny,"step one, worms."
23121,Penny,your mom still here?
22934,Penny,"so, are you and leonard working on an experiment together?"
23952,Penny,"oh, poor baby."
25544,Penny,"no, come on, you’re not an idiot. look, just help me put it back up."
22468,Penny,"okay, so i pick good guys, but turn them into losers. "
24001,Penny,oh!
25207,Penny,what’s with him?
26451,Penny,"i don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good."
23784,Penny,what?
26088,Penny,"oh, yeah? then how does the sun come up every day?"
29076,Penny,"so, all we need to do is get sheldon knocked up."
28791,Penny,"you know, one night, leonard’s nose whistled so loud, i swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
27262,Penny,hey.
27576,Penny,"okay, well, i’ve been poking around the internet, and i think i found something we’ll enjoy watching even more."
25433,Penny,no talking.
28438,Penny,ooh. you’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
22474,Penny,oh god!
22409,Penny,so you’ve really never had a birthday party? 
27341,Penny,why?
25436,Penny,so what do you want to do now?
22747,Penny,hide you?
22082,Penny,"anything you want, okay? any costume you want. bye. "
23062,Penny,"‘cause let me tell you something, buddy, i pay my own way in this world, okay? i don’t rely on anybody!  what was that about?"
28862,Penny,but is sheldon really believing all this crap?
26661,Penny,"mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at mardi gras."
25120,Penny,no. 
22027,Penny,you want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
24190,Penny,"so, um, was leonard okay with you coming over?"
26983,Penny,i told you those walking dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
24664,Penny,what does that mean?
27641,Penny,don’t take this away from me.
24437,Penny,"hey, look, it’s shamy."
26486,Penny,"okay, the clue must be in the bag."
22441,Penny,"oh, okay then this one. "
23006,Penny,"howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"
28070,Penny,it’s not funny. you’re up. call your mother.
26717,Penny,"um, nc… ii… or, you know, ncstd… i don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and i’m gonna be on it!"
27376,Penny,"dr. lorvis, what are you doing here?"
22025,Penny,"oh, i don’t know sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today. "
28051,Penny,yeah? how did it go? did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
27877,Penny,thanks for cooking.
26980,Penny,yes.
22858,Penny,"always nice talking to you, sheldon."
28020,Penny,okay.
24699,Penny,oh. thanks.
25193,Penny,are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry howard wolowitz?
29054,Penny,"i, i’m not sure. maybe a few days. unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
24185,Penny,i’ll pretend i didn’t hear it.
26035,Penny,"oh, and who’s that?"
22623,Penny,"yeah yeah yeah, shhh!"
22111,Penny,"leonard, you are so great. why can’t all guys be like you? "
27578,Penny,you look like a talking cupcake.
28301,Penny,"hey, so i saw a movie trailer the other day. how could batman possibly fight superman? i mean, isn’t that dumb?"
27006,Penny,"so, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape dna is slowly taking over my body."
22390,Penny,goodbye leonard! 
22098,Penny,"i don’t care, i’m finishing it, put him down. "
25863,Penny,"yeah, that’s kind of a problem."
26730,Penny,"ugh, this is such a disaster. my parents had all my relatives over. they got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in mexico by now. so humiliating."
29217,Penny,are you getting sick?
22301,Penny,you sound funny.
22981,Penny,"flirting? you think i’m flirting with you? i am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone."
29174,Penny,are you kidding me?
22118,Penny,"well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family. "
24082,Penny,whatcha doin’?
29284,Penny,"okay, thanks anyway. bye. well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. you were right, i was wrong. aren’t you gonna say anything?"
22855,Penny,"yeah, i think she’s pretty safe."
27948,Penny,yes.
27748,Penny,"oh, i meant beer pong."
24577,Penny,oh.
27750,Penny,"bernadette, for every episode of doctor who leonard has made me sit through, i will play on your behalf and send that tardis back to gallifrey, where i hate that i know it belongs."
22237,Penny,"yeah, i mean he tried to explain it to me, i didn’t really understand it but…"
26648,Penny,yeah. 
22250,Penny,you’ll never guess what just happened.
29283,Penny,"oh, so there’s no job?"
25030,Penny,"you want to talk about crazy mothers, leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up."
28006,Penny,"you know, i fell in love with leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys i was used to dating. i mean, i knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met."
28792,Penny,is it? oh. it’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
22545,Penny,no.
28190,Penny,fine.
22438,Penny,"okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. "
22793,Penny,"there you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
29438,Penny,thank you.
27801,Penny,i’m sorry. what was i thinking?
22896,Penny,are you guys having problems?
24134,Penny,you are. you don’t get to decide when i’m ready to say i love you!
29372,Penny,"oh, hey guys."
23291,Penny,"oh, yeah, i don’t usually dress like this. i’m going jogging."
23820,Penny,i have to take notes?
22159,Penny,yeah. okay. so?
28388,Penny,no.
27043,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake. look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
24611,Penny,"wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?"
26550,Penny,"okay, good, ’cause i’ve been really struggling with this."
23197,Penny,"hey, leonard. how’s the train ride?"
23089,Penny,"well, do you know anybody?"
26134,Penny,"hey, ames."
24202,Penny,"yeah, i guess you’re right."
28631,Penny,thank you.
29150,Penny,"hold on, i’m trying to decide if i’m mad at you. no, i’m happy i don’t have to go."
24000,Penny,"think it through, leonard."
23004,Penny,that’s great.
28628,Penny,"whew, chilly."
25299,Penny,you should.
23991,Penny,"oh, for god’s sakes."
25726,Penny,"oh, grow up."
29256,Penny,"hi. hey, where’s your fiancée?"
28223,Penny,"oh, god. stop. i don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. i want to hear the most recent thing you wrote."
28736,Penny,"well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
28944,Penny,"yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
23873,Penny,"come on, i mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?"
27968,Penny,yeah. i guess.
23380,Penny,"what’s wrong, superman? locked out of your big ice thingy?"
25331,Penny,"okay, listen to me. playing games is not gonna help get amy back."
22061,Penny,"oh, hey leonard."
28098,Penny,sure.
23894,Penny,what the hell happened to lovely and charming?
23498,Penny,uh-huh.
24936,Penny,so did you at least get sheldon’s fake stuff back?
22927,Penny,"oh, hey, leonard. ooh, are you okay?"
24818,Penny,what?
23980,Penny,"okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but i’m over it."
27503,Penny,hi. ready to go?
26756,Penny,"no, it’s not, okay? i’ve been out here for, like, ten years. i’ve nothing to show for it."
23252,Penny,how are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
24672,Penny,"no, no, no. you know, they have suffered enough. everybody’s suffered enough. the thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this."
24060,Penny,deal.
22181,Penny,"okay, you’re cut off. anybody need a refill?"
25155,Penny,oh! look at you guys just hitting it off. i am so good.
28650,Penny,"okay, i’m gonna go pick up my family. like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic."
29369,Penny,"oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
27208,Penny,"so, what are you saying?"
28314,Penny,"so, was the fight really bad?"
29331,Penny,we’ll all go.
23248,Penny,"uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. i mean, it kind of looks like the myspace page of a 13-year-old girl."
27907,Penny,"oh, thank you."
22943,Penny,i never said that.
28851,Penny,i think it’s hot.
24042,Penny,"i’m going to write you a cheque for that. as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
24944,Penny,fine. you?
24133,Penny,"don’t push it, leonard."
25846,Penny,why not?
25551,Penny,"amy, come on…"
22811,Penny,never.
26496,Penny,that is the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard. 
22863,Penny,"sheldon, what do you want?"
23373,Penny,"hello, sheldon."
28076,Penny,"if it makes you feel any better, i pierced amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet."
27890,Penny,you know why.
22933,Penny,"uh, well, it’s just that the physicists i know are indoorsy and pale."
28749,Penny,"mm. well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
21935,Penny,"yeah, yeah, if it gets here and i’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
26452,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
23759,Penny,getting one.
22712,Penny,"all right, come on sheldon."
28594,Penny,"or i invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine."
29466,Penny,who do we love?
22613,Penny,"no sheldon, i’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."
26967,Penny,"oh, that’s sad."
23193,Penny,"oh, hang on, sheldon, getting another call."
24708,Penny,"you know what? i missed you, too."
22203,Penny,"what?  ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. "
25410,Penny,"i know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. and what if something goes wrong? then what?"
28673,Penny,is he? i never noticed.
25083,Penny,"so, we didn’t actually…"
28062,Penny,no.
23788,Penny,wow.
24466,Penny,"oh, no, not at first. right after i pointed it out."
25418,Penny,what does that mean?
28164,Penny,i think it’s so adorable you’re making sheldon breakfast.
23756,Penny,you ready know that.
24829,Penny,"oh, hey. what’s up?"
23601,Penny,"okay, i don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."
27001,Penny,like you could get a brown bear.
25470,Penny,"bug report: when a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching tv."
22698,Penny,"it’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month."
27928,Penny,"look, i’m not happy this happened, but i think i can get past it. i mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing."
21967,Penny,"is, is everything okay."
24689,Penny,"no, i really, i’m sorry, free what? sorry, what, what?"
29389,Penny,hi guys. looks like you’ve been to the renaissance fair. i’m hoping.

22645,Penny,i don’t work on mondays.
24075,Penny,"okay, i’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eharmony."
26471,Penny,"it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store."
27602,Penny,what’s going on?
22561,Penny,"look, just forget i told you about me not graduating from community college. okay?"
23384,Penny,in your apartment.
21869,Penny,hi.
23175,Penny,"you did make that up, right?"
27479,Penny,that was supposed to be for the whole floor.
25048,Penny,monkeys.

26727,Penny,"no, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and mark harmon, but it’s gone."
26551,Penny,"pants, but leonard says sex doesn’t count."
24677,Penny,"yeah. yeah, that was my plan. all right. come on. let’s go."
26390,Penny,i can’t believe it. all this time i’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. and you know what the worst part is?
22583,Penny,"no, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. oh, hey leonard."
23196,Penny,"oh, look, she calls you moon pie. that is so cute."
29354,Penny,"oh hey, when did you get here, hi!"

27176,Penny,"oh, i really appreciate this. i just hope i’m not in over my head."
23957,Penny,toad of truth? is that a physics thing?
29280,Penny,"you don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
23082,Penny,yeah. he got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
25875,Penny,wow. high-techie-techie. what’s this little box?
25178,Penny,i don’t have feelings.
25543,Penny,"no. no, no. it’s just, it’s a little big."
22153,Penny,y-you used my loofah?
26705,Penny,to take me.
22807,Penny,"yes, i left them in the washers and when i went down to get them, they were gone."

24493,Penny,what are you doing here?
28702,Penny,okay. never mind.
24295,Penny,"zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"
29068,Penny,"it still counts. you know, how is this any different from you making me live with sheldon?"
23151,Penny,fine.   happy?
26843,Penny,we gotta get her to a vet right now.
23420,Penny,"fine. oh, hey, can i ask you something?"
24171,Penny,i didn’t mean shut up.
27953,Penny,yeah.
28755,Penny,"yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
28077,Penny,my dad killed my pig with his tractor.
23063,Penny,"here, leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
24046,Penny,"hey, stuart."
23713,Penny,"he’s a musician. he’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
22867,Penny,"oh, okay, all right, you know what? i’ll tell you what happened. we were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house."
24628,Penny,"go away, sheldon."
27225,Penny,aw.
25736,Penny,that is so sweet.

26754,Penny,"no, it’s not okay. look at me, okay? i took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and i’m still doing it. i can’t quit, because guess what? i can’t do anything else. and i finally get my big break, and it goes away. i’m such a mess."

27790,Penny,"uh, no, i actually came to talk to you."
26916,Penny,sheldon didn’t heckle him?
27065,Penny,i can’t do it with you staring at me.
24495,Penny,"okay, sheldon. what can i get you?"
26574,Penny,"yeah, but only because i was dating a second grader."
23013,Penny,"sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? i mean, it’s just a toy robot."
26491,Penny,oh.
28790,Penny,agreed. thank you.
24104,Penny,it’s ridiculous.
23489,Penny,are you serious?
25258,Penny,hey.
26377,Penny,"okay, i get it, i get it. you are an emotionless robot."
28219,Penny,how can reading my journal be an accident?
25475,Penny,oh.
24304,Penny,"yeah, sorry about that."
22236,Penny,"okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, i know leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
23695,Penny,"oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
25979,Penny,i’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at comic-con?
25942,Penny,"oh. so, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?"
27864,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
22903,Penny,go! wow.

27117,Penny,"well, yeah."
24438,Penny,all righty. what’s new?
24870,Penny,"oh, it’s a snowflake from the north pole. leonard gave it to me last year."
22547,Penny,"okay, okay, you know, i get it, leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. "
24949,Penny,"oh, damn it. i told amy that in the strictest confidence. boy, some people are such blabbermouths. well, whatever, i’m sure bernadette can do better."
28750,Penny,"i know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key. "
28954,Penny,"all right, well, you two go have fun."
25847,Penny,"okay. just for the record, i have never entered a wet t-shirt contest. i’ve won a few, but that’s just because i spill when i’m drunk, so…"
22918,Penny,"okay, let me check."
27227,Penny,isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
28975,Penny,i told him to take it down. he would not listen to me.
27941,Penny,"well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."
24633,Penny,"okay, look. we’re not really me and him."
28298,Penny,"i do. you know, leonard’s right. talking to you is really helping."
22400,Penny,"okay, he can have carrot cake."
28258,Penny,sorry. i was waiting for the bazinga.
27520,Penny,"all right, keep thinking."
24281,Penny,"excuse me, i was in high school. studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. "
29205,Penny,"well, sweetie, that’s crazy."
25473,Penny,what’s this?
25431,Penny,do not overthink this.  
29000,Penny,there’s no shame in asking for a break.
28453,Penny,how can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
29133,Penny,"i can’t, it’ll break his heart. you know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside."
23395,Penny,"no, just mail, no benefits."
27426,Penny,aw.
27755,Penny,hey.
27481,Penny,because this company needs you.
25302,Penny,"oh, no, no. we said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out."
22504,Penny,"okay, so, here’s the thing. i guess you’re aware that leonard asked me out. "
25107,Penny,"oh, all right, well, i’m glad you like it. i mean, i still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away."
26223,Penny,okay.
22352,Penny,"okay. marsha, jan and cindy were the three daughters of what tv family?  the brady bunch. okay, sammy hagar replaced david lee roth as the lead singer in what group?"
27564,Penny,"yeah, i listen to what you say. you’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium."
26677,Penny,"honey, i’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for christmas i was thinking of giving you this."
25146,Penny,"yeah, i’m sure he’ll be okay."
27046,Penny,"yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire."
27041,Penny,"no, come on, tonight we are trying new things."
26587,Penny,"hey, can i ask you a question?"

24108,Penny,"fine, faint."
22458,Penny,"well, for one thing, we’re late for leonard’s birthday party. and for another, i told him to call security. "

23888,Penny,"well, let’s go find out who."
24709,Penny,will do.
21920,Penny,sure.

25819,Penny,"fine, it bothers me a little. no. you know what? this is stupid. it doesn’t bother me. okay, it bothers me. but only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. leonard is not that funny."
22303,Penny,"he won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
29350,Penny,"hi, hey. i’m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?"

23934,Penny,"he doesn’t need to know what we were doing, leonard."
28304,Penny,"ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night."
22130,Penny,"gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?"

28239,Penny,once? who got the gum out of his hair?
25004,Penny,"nah, i prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless okie."
24483,Penny,that’s what i told him when he asked me. i hope that’s not out of line.
26321,Penny,"so, then, during my afternoon shift, i spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
23667,Penny,"e-e-e-e-eh! wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
27092,Penny,thanks. there’s no reason why i shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
27332,Penny,"yeah, that’s when i started thinking about work. uh, listen, i’ve got some good news."
23825,Penny,twenty six hundred years?
25508,Penny,why wouldn’t you?
22432,Penny,"and then raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up."
21952,Penny,"hey raj.  hey, listen, i don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with leonard and sheldon, but i’m really upset about it, i mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, i mean can you even believe that? how weird is that?"
24962,Penny,"all right, try thinking about this. sheldon and amy had sex."
28857,Penny,"so, what’s the deal with your apartment? why’s it taking so long?"
25423,Penny,what?
22971,Penny,what the hell?
24979,Penny,take us to a place we can waltz.
29415,Penny,"oh, hey, guys."
22873,Penny,what?
23558,Penny,thank you.
25226,Penny,"if you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with priya?"
25621,Penny,"yeah, you pick that bone. you pick that bone clean!"
27761,Penny,i only figured that out because i’ve never heard of any of them.
24604,Penny,"hey, your copy of science magazine was in my mailbox."
21865,Penny,"oh, hi!"
24283,Penny,"i’m sorry, what?"
29267,Penny,you okay? you kind of look like zack trying to figure out that tip.
23214,Penny,i don’t know.
27552,Penny,"sheldon, we are just people. we talk about the same things you guys talk about."
23626,Penny,"leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. i just, you know, i didn’t want you to be bored."
29123,Penny,"so, do you want to come?"
28519,Penny,i guess.
25676,Penny,"nice. you know, you should totally get bernadettemaryannrostenkowskiwolowitz.com before someone snaps it up."
24823,Penny,"oh, yes. hi, hi. i’m sorry. i didn’t know you had company. i don’t want to impose."
26904,Penny,"i don’t know what to do. my car threw a rod and it’s totaled. i can’t afford a new one, i have no job, and now i can’t drive to auditions."
23345,Penny,"i don’t know, he’s 13. just pick out anything."
28131,Penny,chug.
29090,Penny,"okay, maybe i’m the one who’s sad."
25022,Penny,thanks for clearing that up.
28744,Penny,"wait. why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
27151,Penny,what?
24746,Penny,"oh, please let me tell him."
25405,Penny,"absolutely not. look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
24834,Penny,i smell chinese food.
28768,Penny,was it a good one?
26281,Penny,"oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. anyway, what i meant was, i shouldn’t wait, you know? i’ve got you, i’ve got sheldon, all these wonderful friends. my life is exciting right now."
23072,Penny,"i used sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then i had like fourteen dollars left over."
22334,Penny,zod?
28158,Penny,i can’t believe sheldon was gonna ask amy to marry him.
28209,Penny,"well, you don’t know everything about me."
24221,Penny,"oh, um, i should probably get going."
27415,Penny,"okay, what’s up?"
22043,Penny,"howard, i’ve asked you not to do that. "
28382,Penny,"okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. we can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
28881,Penny,"okay, but you may feel some discomfort."
25644,Penny,that was weird.
22469,Penny,"well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?"
28489,Penny,"well, she is taking me to an indigo girls concert, so hold that thought."
26549,Penny,thank you so much for coming.
26736,Penny,do you think i have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
28873,Penny,"oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? wow."
26401,Penny,how about we just talk?
23537,Penny,"all right, want some french toast?"
22619,Penny,oic.
25563,Penny,"yeah, good call."
25033,Penny,"yeah, i know, right?"
23576,Penny,let’s slide over to sheldon’s spot a make out.
22223,Penny,"okay, well, i guess we’re back to the corduroy suit. "
22682,Penny,"alright, come on, come on."
23353,Penny,thanks. he seems like a nice guy.
28777,Penny,mm-hmm.
26079,Penny,i know. a hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
28144,Penny,"oh, my god. we’ve done things on that couch."
22963,Penny,"okay, all i’m giving you is the napkin, sheldon."
24691,Penny,"you know, it is going to be difficult, but i’m going to cancel my plans so i can do this for my bestie."
25882,Penny,sometimes i forget how smart you are.
25108,Penny,"yeah, it was just sitting on the street. i paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
28587,Penny,"ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
27283,Penny,it’s not.
27762,Penny,sorry.
25616,Penny,there’s absolutely no difference.
23869,Penny,nothing. not a damn thing.
25861,Penny,letting him make me happy.
21999,Penny,okay.
28485,Penny,"well, we’ll be in the woods."
21907,Penny,okay. thanks. 
26124,Penny,"yes. that is a real thing. and it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine."
29364,Penny,let’s go-oh-oh ou-oooo-ut tonight. i have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. 
26236,Penny,"yeah. and i said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it."
23212,Penny,"sheldon, don’t you get it? if this takes off, i won’t have to be a waitress anymore."
22606,Penny,"dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
22753,Penny,"um, sure, sisters.  holy crap on a cracker."
25929,Penny,believable? you saying i’m not smart?
25344,Penny,hmm. that’s too bad. we could have spent new year’s eve waiting for the ball to drop.
29259,Penny,"yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. actually, i’m not crazy about a lot of it."
28603,Penny,"to be honest, i’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
23546,Penny,"ooh, sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think i’ll punch you."
23895,Penny,that’s the del taco.
28089,Penny,are you doing okay?
27819,Penny,it’s called an evening look. i’ve never been to new jersey before.
22285,Penny,"oh, better than north dakota!  i guess that joke’s only funny in nebraska."
27667,Penny,"well, now i wish i had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
21941,Penny,i’m just going to go wash up.
26028,Penny,"we know what’s going on, sheldon!"
24351,Penny,let me get my cockamamie keys.
27797,Penny,"if i was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should i get on?"
25507,Penny,i’m so glad you talked howard out of having your wedding invitations in klingon.
25081,Penny,"oh, god. did you pull some weird indian crap on me?"
22313,Penny,what does that mean?
23754,Penny,how did you see it? you said you wouldn’t look.
23765,Penny,"hey, sheldon, sheldon, look, i am scared and in a lot of pain. could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, i don’t know, comforting?"
24230,Penny,"what? what are you doing with, what?"
22354,Penny,"i go outside and i talk to people. alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?"
24782,Penny,"okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone."
28827,Penny,"oh, there’s so much i want to change."
25355,Penny,"anyway, i’m really sorry i made fun of your stutter in high school."
29017,Penny,"hey, can i ask you a question? you’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
25078,Penny,"look, honey, i was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. we should’ve never slept together. it’s what ruins friendships."
29032,Penny,thanks. are you ready?
26442,Penny,what?
27648,Penny,"you know what? i can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will i drive you there, i will buy you all the dragon t-shirts you want."
22820,Penny,"can i sit wherever i want? no, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. sheldon, this was big of you. thank you. i really appreciate it."
28569,Penny,"oh, leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."
26750,Penny,"really, let it go."
23966,Penny,"okay, i’ll get those drinks started for you."
28534,Penny,"don’t worry, he’ll come around."
26729,Penny,"this doesn’t make any sense. i mean, i, i thought i did a, a really good job, i… excuse me."
22133,Penny,"good night, leonard."
25964,Penny,did your boyfriend make you type that?
27767,Penny,really?
26926,Penny,"ooh, i’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
24719,Penny,"well, howard’s a complete and total ass, bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke amy’s hair, she bites."
22358,Penny,what are you doing?
29196,Penny,mm.
26060,Penny,"well, then why are you going?"
27615,Penny,now imagine you’re holding that pen.
23211,Penny,"no, i’m making flower barrettes. see? i call them penny blossoms. i made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. then i showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town. she sells cards and homemade jewellery. she said she wanted to sell them. i said okay, and in one week, i made a $156."
23480,Penny,hey. do you want to talk?
29434,Penny,"oh, it’s about time, i’m starving."
27802,Penny,"‘cause i already know what he’ll say. wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it."
26453,Penny,"come on, don’t be like that. we had so much fun together the last couple of months."
23038,Penny,it’s no big deal. i’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
22320,Penny,sorry. 
27300,Penny,"oh, we would love that."
22503,Penny,no.
23757,Penny,no.
24499,Penny,a what?
25741,Penny,"oh, come on. i just told you i had a hard day."
22327,Penny,"i’m confused, did sheldon stop giving milk? "
24136,Penny,ice cream?
26172,Penny,i don’t know. maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and i’ve been really happy.
26946,Penny,"yup, we’re all in."
24014,Penny,hi!
26385,Penny,i’m calling him.

23067,Penny,she needed money. you seem under pressure. did i not lend you a sufficient amount? because i can give you more.
23112,Penny,"oh, um, okay, like, five or six. five."
24547,Penny,"well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? you’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby."
27289,Penny,what’s up?
24425,Penny,"oh, great. hi, i’m penny, i’ll be your waitress."

23867,Penny,"well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for christmas, so i’m going to say no."
26220,Penny,"sure. just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? not, like, capes and tights and crap?"
27955,Penny,"i love you, too."
24897,Penny,"it’s fun talking to you, leonard, i always learn stuff."
25524,Penny,"oh, no, amy, i haven’t done anything."
27859,Penny,"why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little chinese babies are."
24063,Penny,are you stan lee?
28789,Penny,"you know, so does leonard. can’t i just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? hey-hey-hey."
28330,Penny,"yeah, yeah, yeah. you go ahead. i’ll catch up with you."
23643,Penny,and you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
28909,Penny,"i do, your life is fine you big baby. "
25477,Penny,yep.
25587,Penny,"you are welcome. yeah, i’m gonna have to move."
28247,Penny,"okay, look, i know amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
23434,Penny,"leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?"
23103,Penny,it’s out of order.
24552,Penny,"oh, okay, whatever. will you please just play along until my dad leaves?"
22936,Penny,"since always. call me a geek, but i am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
23698,Penny,"really? why not? you’re so smart, and i’m so dumb!"
25969,Penny,i just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
22307,Penny,"um, home, to write some bad cheques."
24817,Penny,"amy, i’m fine."
27960,Penny,wow.
29323,Penny,"all right, well, that doesn’t prove anything."

24982,Penny,glad you’re enjoying yourself.
28559,Penny,"no honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it."
28732,Penny,"well, so are you. in fact, you know what? we will never take you for granite. did you get that? granite? a little geology joke."
23834,Penny,not that far back!
25388,Penny,"eight o’clock.  sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
23658,Penny,you know what? don’t talk to me like i’m an idiot.
29505,Penny,hi.
27135,Penny,"well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but i figure at some point, i’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me."
28729,Penny,"that’s me, i’m her. you know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down."
25175,Penny,"raj, come here. this girl is trouble. i mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
26459,Penny,i love scavenger hunts. my friends and i had them all the time.
25915,Penny,"okay. an examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the old south, 1619 to 1865. what the hell is this?"
25372,Penny,"you know, this is wrong. let’s put everything back. here."
26617,Penny,"sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins."
27627,Penny,what?
23261,Penny,so?
28014,Penny,"yeah. yeah, sometimes i worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you."
24098,Penny,"it’ll give you confidence. you know, sometimes when i’m feeling all stressed out about something, i go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and i have a whole new outlook on life."
26103,Penny,you ever going to sleep with amy?
21880,Penny,"this looks like some serious stuff, leonard, did you do this?"
26493,Penny,sheldon’s spot. the coin is in your spot.
22274,Penny,"well, based on what you told me, i’m not surprised. "
22727,Penny,"oh, are you here to see leonard?"
26662,Penny,"hey, what’s with all the yelling?"

28018,Penny,"it’s getting kind of cheesy, leonard."

28785,Penny,as you?
26396,Penny,he did?
25464,Penny,"you know, just for fun, let’s say i’m not."

28656,Penny,"oh, i can’t wait for you to meet everyone. i told them all about you."
24754,Penny,probably. i’m just enjoying the foreplay. does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
26695,Penny,"hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself."
22292,Penny,"okay, well, thank you for getting my mail."
28655,Penny,"yeah, plus if you leave, alfred will know he got under your skin."

26096,Penny,"yeah, but i don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the holocaust."
27234,Penny,"oh, what did those rascals do now?"
29091,Penny,maybe the fact that you went and had a baby. 
28046,Penny,"well, not necessarily. you know, dad’s not getting any younger, so if i wait long enough, i’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."
25088,Penny,also no.
26711,Penny,aw.
26110,Penny,oh.
23930,Penny,"look, sheldon, sweetie, i know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep."
23745,Penny,it’s right there.
25181,Penny,"oh, i’m so sorry. i wish i could make you feel better."
27673,Penny,"so, why did you finally tell me?"
23235,Penny,that just can’t be right.
29212,Penny,"hey, raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
27213,Penny,those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
25772,Penny,"okay, what did amy tell you?"
29261,Penny,"right, ’cause it spells menu."
25425,Penny,how would you say it?
28634,Penny,"you know, beverly, i know you and alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no leonard. so that’s good, right?"
25103,Penny,i don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
29127,Penny,"wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
27636,Penny,"eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings."
28938,Penny,"all right, sheldon, this is over the line."
26469,Penny,"but, it, it doesn’t matter. we know the answer, come on."
26671,Penny,how you doing over there?
28638,Penny,"well, go faster. you’re losing him."
27456,Penny,"okay, that’s morbid. send it back."
25567,Penny,"well, is it or isn’t it?"
25556,Penny,"huh, i try."
22160,Penny,she’s not my friend. friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. 
24804,Penny,"okay, we can’t keep explaining everything. read that book we got you."
24985,Penny,screw it. i’ll go later.
24778,Penny,fine. what would you rather do as a scene study?
25612,Penny,"wow. yeah, b-beginner’s luck. so, now i will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. so, yeah, okay, now i’m gonna drink this entire cup and then i’m going to drink another one… okay, seriously, stop. what the hell?"
29459,Penny,"yeah, sure!"
29197,Penny,"okay, how is that?"
22830,Penny,"oh, hey."
27625,Penny,"oh, my, that’s it. get out."
29337,Penny,"well, then you get it."
25884,Penny,yeah. you got a problem with that?
29102,Penny,"you know, we could’ve come to you guys. you didn’t have to bring the baby here."
28496,Penny,"not the drinking game, a drinking game."
22107,Penny,"you really think so, don’t you? "
28695,Penny,hi.
23607,Penny,"no, i thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
28668,Penny,hey. is everyone getting to know each other?
27049,Penny,"wow, you really struck a nerve. i’ve never heard him use the m word before."
29253,Penny,"what? he loves you, okay? and he’s interested in your work. you could talk about the infinite perspective… i swear i know it."
28025,Penny,"oh, no, no, i just, i said, whee."
22147,Penny,thanks. 
25649,Penny,yes.
27784,Penny,don’t you have a guy?
27752,Penny,"no, no, i like that show. it’s got dragons and people doing it."
27789,Penny,"yeah, i kind of want to do it again."
22372,Penny,"but, what about your time machine."
25672,Penny,"yeah, there is."
24786,Penny,"okay, okay. we get it. you set the scene."
27912,Penny,"and you know what the best part is? we took our time. i mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets."
27406,Penny,doesn’t matter. prom is silly anyways.
23865,Penny,"you didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?"
24704,Penny,i don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. someone should stand up to him. what’s he going to do?
27496,Penny,"oh, i guess that’s where raj gets it from."
27958,Penny,"well, i don’t have any. you’re kind of making me look bad."
25792,Penny,m-hmm.
24069,Penny,why not?
24802,Penny,"yes, sheldon. keep watching."
28311,Penny,can this wait?
27391,Penny,"okay, so how do they unstick it?"
22646,Penny,"uh, queen penelope afk. what?"
23194,Penny,"okay, i got a box, but there’s no key in here. just letters."
22550,Penny,"right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell leonard any of this. "
26893,Penny,because it was crap. it’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie i was in.
28526,Penny,"because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
25553,Penny,grab your hammer.
28318,Penny,here’s some champagne.
24015,Penny,"um, can you give me a hint?"
22636,Penny,yeah. leonard gave me an emergency key.
23349,Penny,"oh, what a cute, little store. everybody’s staring at me."
23673,Penny,which is?
28345,Penny,"all right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?"
26719,Penny,"um, i play a customer in a diner and i flirt with mark harmon."
28230,Penny,"well, i’ve never been friends with any of my exes."
26566,Penny,what?
24553,Penny,"come on, honey, not in front of my dad."
26034,Penny,"hmm. well, i’m glad you’re having such a great day."
25892,Penny,"no, sexy cop. slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges."
26164,Penny,"we were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? they’re bad people. it’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me."
23133,Penny,what?
28618,Penny,"thanks to overcrowding, yeah."
27626,Penny,get out.
25801,Penny,"yeah, that’s basically what i said."
24429,Penny,"yeah, i know who he is. i watch dancing with the stars."
22071,Penny,"so, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
27538,Penny,"yeah, have fun."
23701,Penny,yeah?
25893,Penny,"i thought we said in the car, no accents?"
22047,Penny,"oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. "
25955,Penny,"oh, just this guy i met at school."
29279,Penny,"no, i know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and i’m just gonna stay where i’m at for now."
26961,Penny,"no, come on. this is serious."
22421,Penny,"okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw leonard a birthday party or, so help me god, i will go into your bedroom and i will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. and on one of them, you won’t know which, i’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. "
25195,Penny,"sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming."
23045,Penny,but what if you need it?
25327,Penny,"hello, sheldon. come on in."
22544,Penny,on what? 
26519,Penny,okay.
24720,Penny,never mind. can i stay here or not?
27565,Penny,"and you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. so, how’s the detector going?"
24938,Penny,all right. hang on.
27276,Penny,you told emily we hooked up?
24680,Penny,"look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy."
21982,Penny,how?
28159,Penny,yeah.
23375,Penny,really? are you drunk?
27536,Penny,so what do you need the headphones for?
22552,Penny,what? 
28696,Penny,what are you doing?

23503,Penny,what are they talking about?
24181,Penny,great.
22125,Penny,"ha-ha, there goes your head again."
23241,Penny,"well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in old town."
24837,Penny,how about howard?
26675,Penny,"yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template."
24994,Penny,wh… what the hell did she say?
25189,Penny,"oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
23276,Penny,leonard?
21873,Penny,bye.
27386,Penny,"i can’t do it, he’s my best client."
28616,Penny,"leonard, come on, she’s your mom. if we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?"
22305,Penny,"oh, it’s okay, i didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like i have rent or car payments or anything."
25730,Penny,"hey, this is my natural hair colour. now. so, does sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?"
26511,Penny,"sweetie, i’m so sorry. i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better."
22713,Penny,what?
28653,Penny,why?
26482,Penny,"okay. oh, it’s a bowling alley."
24548,Penny,"just guys. anyway, when i told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s leonard? why can’t you get back together with leonard? i bet leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. so to get him off my back, i told him we worked things out."
29011,Penny,"oh. hey, what smells so good?"
27544,Penny,"the exercise, sheldon. shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?"
22397,Penny,"hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something."
25399,Penny,"okay, just hang on."
27895,Penny,"okay, indoor it is. big or small?"
24583,Penny,"oh, so i spent seventh grade dotting my i’s with little asses? cool."
23425,Penny,"well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?"
26273,Penny,"yippee, it’s backwards. i get it."
27211,Penny,"no, i think she was just trying to help. plus, i really want to do well at this job. so…"
26568,Penny,"oh, my god, i am the worst."
26212,Penny,yeah.

26925,Penny,"sorry. hey, who’s not the murderer?"
27768,Penny,"hey, kevin. it’s really exciting to talk to you."
24937,Penny,how come?
22814,Penny,"leonard, remember when i said it was on? well, now it’s junior rodeo on."
22639,Penny,"well, wear different pyjamas."
27058,Penny,"no, he blew up the death star. why do i know this?"
25162,Penny,"wait, hang on. doubles. roll again."
25046,Penny,"oh, no, no, no. i’ve had way too much already."
26966,Penny,"okay, like what? show me."
25397,Penny,"um, o-okay. sure."
26408,Penny,that’s your big revelation?
22954,Penny,it’s just rum. it stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
28092,Penny,"well, so do i, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"
24392,Penny,"yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. i’m a little low on cash."
21968,Penny,"thank you, i’ve got to talk to that mailman."
25725,Penny,problem?
29391,Penny,"okay, goodnight."
28625,Penny,"okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?"
23600,Penny,"the heart wants what the heart wants, leonard."
24844,Penny,okay.
24017,Penny,"oh, oh, stan lee! cool!"
23544,Penny,"okay, so kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is sandy, right? so get this, her replacement is a woman named sandy whose husband’s name is kim."
24151,Penny,"so, we’re good?"
28612,Penny,"yeah, and when i dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug."
24302,Penny,"what, do you have eyes in the back of your head?"
22841,Penny,"well, have you slept with her yet? you dog! good for you."
25996,Penny,what are you waiting for?
28289,Penny,"uh, do you have any questions?"
27295,Penny,"no, no. no need to apologise."
22923,Penny,i don’t know. ‘cause it’s christmas?
27154,Penny,we were worried about you.
22671,Penny,what are you guys talking about?
26259,Penny,"as a rule, no."
28048,Penny,i’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
29305,Penny,"okay, listen to me. your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. it’s not like you two are very physical."
24234,Penny,"oh, no, no, no, no. i’m not flabbergasted. i’m puzzled. yeah, let’s go with puzzled."
25366,Penny,"yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
25570,Penny,"oh, hey. sorry, sheldon, i’ll move."
22979,Penny,"yeah, you might be right. but back to you. i know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy."
29518,Penny,"you love her very much, don’t you?"
28707,Penny,"oh, thank you, and i’m sorry i lied about it. "
25536,Penny,i cannot believe you’ve never seen grease.
27042,Penny,"all right, sheldon, just ask your question."
26779,Penny,okay. you want to come with me?
23761,Penny,change migraine to yes.
22599,Penny,are you going to let me talk?
22408,Penny,"yeah, see, that’s what kids should have. "
23314,Penny,"what are you saying, that i’m threatened by alicia? that i’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?"
23831,Penny,hey! you don’t have to be so mean!
22165,Penny,"alright, now sheldon, you and i are about to have a problem. "
22990,Penny,what does that mean?
26624,Penny,i was 16 in nebraska. what do you think?
23874,Penny,"sure, sure."
21862,Penny,"leonard, i said not now."
27985,Penny,that’s ridiculous.
24573,Penny,"oh, my god. what personal habits?"
23926,Penny,yes?
26526,Penny,how do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
23815,Penny,"oh, come on! a smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. you can make it like an experiment."
29146,Penny,"it’s not complicated. amy’s driving, that’s it."
29374,Penny,"oh, hey guys."
24246,Penny,"you know what? it’s, it’s none of my business. if you want to sleep with sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
23531,Penny,it would take the pressure off.
23056,Penny,"oh, my god, would you just get off my case?"
26007,Penny,of course you did. your hands are softer than veal.
27607,Penny,"all right, well, if i’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, i’m thinking you might have to let this one go."
23313,Penny,"i don’t even know why i care. i don’t care. all right, i cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all i care."
22199,Penny,"boy, that’s brilliant, but i’ll see you."
24816,Penny,okay. why?
23213,Penny,another waitress.
27516,Penny,you walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. i went so you didn’t get beat up.
29365,Penny,hi guys.
23835,Penny,i don’t know. where were we looking up at the night sky?
27210,Penny,"uh, thanks, but i think i’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff bernadette gave me."
27020,Penny,yep.
23986,Penny,"okay, i know i shouldn’t ask, but what is…?"
22947,Penny,"yeah. oh, can i drive the motorcycle?"
22586,Penny,"had a great time, ciao "
27657,Penny,he’s there.
24888,Penny,"no, that’s silk. seriously, what would you do without me?"
25358,Penny,both.
24690,Penny,"wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?"
23209,Penny,"it means nothing to anybody. come here, let me show you what i’m doing."
25313,Penny,"all right. thank you. i’m sorry, too."
26109,Penny,wow. where are you going to go?
25585,Penny,"ha, told you. okay, i’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
24637,Penny,"whatever. look, if zack and i had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you."
22167,Penny,told yah! . 
24791,Penny,"we have been monitoring your son sheldon from the 23rd century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy."
25759,Penny,"well, i do."
23182,Penny,of course i haven’t.
27556,Penny,yes.
28221,Penny,all right. let’s just finish cooking.
28718,Penny,i suddenly wish sheldon was here.
24624,Penny,"okay. what do you want, sheldon?"
26988,Penny,no.
27359,Penny,"well, do you guys ever fight over money?"
23845,Penny,thank you.
25102,Penny,"oh, it’s no problem. it’s actually kind of nice. you reading, me reading. we’re like an old married couple."
23501,Penny,leonard?
26208,Penny,"i work at the cheesecake factory, i said bye."
25129,Penny,yeah! letting sheldon use you to manipulate me? i thought you were my friend.
26298,Penny,i’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
29015,Penny,oh. 
26183,Penny,"uh, i’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?"
24419,Penny,"hey, what’s my share?"
25631,Penny,he’s bringing me. who are you bringing?
29361,Penny,hey guys. 
22834,Penny,"well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
23863,Penny,"okay, you know what? it’s lame when i say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on."
22664,Penny,i’m the dumplings.
29419,Penny,"hey, leonard, can i talk to you for a sec?"
27594,Penny,"what? no, i really want to know what happens, and bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens."
25786,Penny,i don’t really know how to say this.
22399,Penny,"so leonard, will we be seeing you on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?"
27387,Penny,dr. lorvis?
26055,Penny,where are we going?
23232,Penny,there. done.
23943,Penny,whatcha doing?
25010,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, sheldon. it’s just, ever since leonard’s been dating raj’s sister, i’ve had to keep my distance. i don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber."
24027,Penny,"okay, look, they sent me the ticket. i told them i wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?"
28521,Penny,"well, guess i gotta drink."
29404,Penny,"howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. aw, did you get pinkeye again?"
22603,Penny,okay. goodnight sheldon.
25205,Penny,"hey, guys."
25958,Penny,"no. that’s not true. there’s french, there’s italian. no, you’re right, it’s the best."
27604,Penny,"oh, that sounds like a good thing."
27270,Penny,"oh, my god. tell me, what did i do?"
21894,Penny,"oh, anyways, i’m also writing a screenplay. it’s about this sensitive girl who comes to l.a. from lincoln nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory."
25791,Penny,"ugh. hey, sheldon? hi. this came for you today. it’s from your mom."
22391,Penny,"uh, pretty much, why?"
25136,Penny,"okay, i’m not driving him."
24697,Penny,"so, amy, i’ve been wondering, are you and sheldon going to be sharing a room?"
22742,Penny,"you know, the only way i could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls."
21895,Penny,"no, i’m from omaha. "
26811,Penny,and we’re back to the first kind of sad.
22957,Penny,merry christmas.
23901,Penny,"well, promise you won’t make fun of me."
26901,Penny,"yeah, i know it’s on, sheldon. oh, no, no, no, no, no. i cannot afford this right now."
28899,Penny,"yeah, but that’s just his earth parents. we don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here."
27297,Penny,"yeah, and leonard and i are engaged now, and i’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us."
29472,Penny,"oh, good, your power’s out, too."
28467,Penny,"yeah, that’s pretty good."
27378,Penny,"oh, this is very embarrassing. dr. lorvis, i am so sorry. i did not mean to lead you on."
29220,Penny,you also got a nosebleed watching up.
22736,Penny,"okay, well, thanks for the nightmares."
26935,Penny,really? you think i’m putting this body through three kids?
28888,Penny,i know i went a little overboard. we can always dial it back.
22649,Penny,"okay, i’m at the gate to the treasury of the ancients, i’m going in."
28778,Penny,she’s right. that’s reasonable.
27655,Penny,"uh, well, i’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
24921,Penny,"yeah, well, sadly, i do."
27930,Penny,"okay, that’s enough. stop talking."
26428,Penny,hey.
25472,Penny,"well, thank you. i’ll see you tomorrow."
22340,Penny,that is correct.
24618,Penny,all right. let’s get this thing over with.
25269,Penny,"great. i’ll see you later. and remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him."
26878,Penny,me?
24645,Penny,"hey, wait a minute."
28234,Penny,"hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?"
24464,Penny,"oh, absolutely."
26954,Penny,no.
23328,Penny,please.
22686,Penny,"wait, meet them."
27807,Penny,mmm.
26477,Penny,"oh. okay. sheldon, i, i’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"
22246,Penny,"oh, well, then good!"
27231,Penny,"uh, we’re not sure. but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother i’m not pregnant."
25535,Penny,"well, i guess i could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy."
23976,Penny,"oh. wow. okay. let’s see. we’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, swiss cheese, fondue. my lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then i’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
22648,Penny,"yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, queen penelope’s back online."
22008,Penny,how come you didn’t go into work today.
29064,Penny,"if you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when i told you?"
22908,Penny,"good, good. and then what?"
25292,Penny,so have you written anything i might have seen?
21877,Penny,"oh, that’s so nice, i’d love to."
28034,Penny,"you know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
26823,Penny,"okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
28441,Penny,"you know what, hang on. what if sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?"
28365,Penny,won’t make us any younger.
25661,Penny,well…
24558,Penny,"oh, see?"
25191,Penny,"okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
22894,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. they’ll be ruined."
23742,Penny,"you have your learner’s permit, right?"
24540,Penny,you can only ask one question.
23057,Penny,"thank you, leonard. what’s my share?"
25244,Penny,"with-with loofah mitts, no hands."
29349,Penny,"ah, hey leonard."
23351,Penny,"oh, great."
22978,Penny,"look, normally i can just ignore you. i mean, i get it, you’re a little peculiar. you know, like sheldon."
21956,Penny,that’s exactly what i thought. thank you for listening. you’re a doll. 
25448,Penny,is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
21913,Penny,"really, why?"
29504,Penny,hi.
28894,Penny,bam. thank you. what’s her name?
26770,Penny,"look, you did the right thing last night. i was a mess. i was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
28963,Penny,anyone else want to try?
26463,Penny,"no, no. let’s mix things up. i choose sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!"
27853,Penny,"ah, yeah, now that’s what i’m talking about."
21963,Penny,"guys, this is actually really simple."

26474,Penny,riddle me this…
25651,Penny,"i didn’t break it. i, i guess stuart sold it to me like this."
27266,Penny,"so, femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure."

26643,Penny,fine.
22183,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i think that’s the grasshopper talking. "
26148,Penny,this place is really beautiful.
29439,Penny,"oh, my god, are you okay?"
26969,Penny,huh?

26318,Penny,"no, it’s not."
22516,Penny,"sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what i’m talking about. "
27905,Penny,"um, i’m free tonight."
24286,Penny,"yeah, maybe."
24389,Penny,what?
28064,Penny,you killed my pig?
26342,Penny,"oh, my god, sheldon the genius is jealous of leonard."
26943,Penny,definitely.
26608,Penny,"hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?"
23448,Penny,excuse me.
26209,Penny,"you’re kidding, right? we’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?"
22377,Penny,"no you didn’t. look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. "
23579,Penny,"hey, i happen to love this movie."
23303,Penny,great.

28831,Penny,i don’t know. be cool. he’s coming. he’s coming. hi. 
27606,Penny,"well, i’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
28394,Penny,that was such a fun night.
21965,Penny,"okay, this place does look pretty good."
28499,Penny,"very funny. okay, never have i ever… yeah, you know what? let’s just circle back."
28582,Penny,or a way for you to avoid her?
28254,Penny,"well, find out."
29204,Penny,"yeah, that’s rude."
26760,Penny,"okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?"
29390,Penny,"no, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named schrodinger."
26791,Penny,"and hold three, two, one. very good. now let’s try warrior 2. and hold."
23410,Penny,damn it. what do you want me to do
24737,Penny,good for you.
26594,Penny,"yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
28844,Penny,thank you.
24369,Penny,"i myself grew up in nebraska. small town outside of omaha. you know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs."
28112,Penny,i told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
28104,Penny,"hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?"
22402,Penny,"i did your horoscope, remember, i was going to do everybody’s until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."
25503,Penny,but he’s sad.
24471,Penny,"oh, god. i think i see where this is going."
26176,Penny,really?
22192,Penny,i know the reason. 
24623,Penny,what the hell is wrong with you?
27287,Penny,it’s stupid.
27685,Penny,can you believe it’s been eight years?
25887,Penny,no. why?
22029,Penny,are we so sure that’s a bad thing?
22950,Penny,because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
25628,Penny,i’ll let you hold my hair while i throw up.
24020,Penny,star wars?
29078,Penny,"all right, you know what you need? a night away from all of this. you know, where you can just kind of relax and, i’m just gonna turn this off. much better. seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. we could go dancing."
26505,Penny,"oh, my god, you still go left."
24589,Penny,"no, it was great. he just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level."
23687,Penny,"i’m coming. goodbye, sheldon. what do you mean, transgressions i’ve committed?"
27549,Penny,come in.
22808,Penny,"sheldon, where are my clothes?"
25972,Penny,what is your problem? do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
24948,Penny,‘course i heard about it. how did you hear about it?
27619,Penny,what? she didn’t give me any puzzles.
23081,Penny,"well, remember kurt?"
26592,Penny,"no, if it was a spider, lenny would’ve flipped out."
27206,Penny,"well, you saw her the other night. am i wrong?"
27081,Penny,okay. fine. would you feel better if i propose so you could turn me down again?
22935,Penny,"uh, sweetie, sweetie, dave was talking. you know, i love science."
26289,Penny,"aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. like when kids say pasghetti."
24595,Penny,"oh, no. why?"
25985,Penny,"no, leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  oh, i’ll get it."
22916,Penny,"yeah, that’ll slow it down."
26963,Penny,she’s thinking of taking a job at the cheesecake factory.
27267,Penny,"it has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive."
25378,Penny,"okay, amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
27434,Penny,want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
27992,Penny,you couldn’t sleep either?
28536,Penny,"come on, sheldon, we’ll watch game of thrones over here."
24500,Penny,"oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. why don’t you give it a try."
26343,Penny,"look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? but just because good things are happening to leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. you know what? let me tell you a little story. once there was a girl who worked at the cheesecake factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job."
23342,Penny,"oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?"
23990,Penny,better acoustics for your throat singing?
24997,Penny,what? i don’t know. it doesn’t matter.
22892,Penny,oh hey.
29317,Penny,we thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
24813,Penny,hey!
26260,Penny,"well, why don’t you make up your own ending?"
27342,Penny,"and i really appreciate it, but now i don’t need it, so here you go."
25647,Penny,what is your problem?
28530,Penny,you know you’re gonna make up with him. can we just skip to that part?
29498,Penny,ugh!
22100,Penny,"oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. "
28818,Penny,"well, it could be for the monkey movie. it could be my haemorrhoid commercial. the list does not go on."
28361,Penny,kind of. when was the first time someone called you sir?
29512,Penny,"guys, wake up. bernadette’s having her baby."
29460,Penny,mrs. cooper. hi!
22336,Penny,"good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. i’m penny, and i’ll be your host, because apparently i didn’t have anything else to do on a saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? gentlemen, are you ready?"
22741,Penny,"hi. you know, you probably don’t want to go in there."
26859,Penny,no.
21889,Penny,"so, klingon boggle?"
27203,Penny,"well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me."
24993,Penny,none?
28581,Penny,you really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
27876,Penny,"okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat."
23198,Penny,"okay, yeah, i kind of crossed a line. put him back on."
25434,Penny,"well, that was fun."
22531,Penny,right.
23849,Penny,"you really didn’t like it, sheldon?"
25545,Penny,"oh, amy, come on."
25086,Penny,sure.
24685,Penny,the what?
25167,Penny,no. i’m the one that introduced him to her. i’ve got to say something.
26855,Penny,oh. okay. oh. oh. hey.
23109,Penny,"yeah, sure, i guess."
22315,Penny,"okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. "
22487,Penny,that’s what i said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. 
27592,Penny,"so instead she asked if, in the future, montana ever became a state."
28946,Penny,"oh, that was fast. did she sneeze the baby out?"
28602,Penny,"okay, good example."
25829,Penny,how about boys versus girls?
29483,Penny,"oh, my god!"
29306,Penny,a lot of lectures?
23367,Penny,oh come on. i think it’s nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
26454,Penny,sheldon.
25965,Penny,don’t be like that.
23781,Penny,"hey, i did not settle for leonard. i mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with, you know, physically."
28652,Penny,"what? oh. hi. okay, hey there, i got, i’m sorry, i got to go now."
22367,Penny,"no! i don’t want to try it, my god, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…"
27012,Penny,"hey, that’s good. why’d you guys stop doing that?"
27849,Penny,really? it didn’t work for you.
27668,Penny,"wow, i just felt this wave of affection for you."
27437,Penny,"yeah, i watched. it was like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka."
25066,Penny,somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. we may have to drive awhile. 
25663,Penny,"come on, you do it to feel superior. i see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."
25278,Penny,you’re kidding.
26697,Penny,"oh, come on. childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half."
23846,Penny,"oh, balls."
22910,Penny,"nothing. okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out."
22287,Penny,"ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
28571,Penny,we didn’t.
25909,Penny,"no, leonard, this is my thing."
25625,Penny,oh.
27445,Penny,i think she meant something a little happier.
22257,Penny,do you have any idea what time it is? 
25874,Penny,"ah. danger. sure, sure. yeah. what’s, what’s that?"
28748,Penny,"that was a cute story. so, um, what did you want to ask me?"
27257,Penny,it’s just this vibe i got.
28915,Penny,"seriously, none of you liked it?"
22448,Penny,"okay, so we’re getting this one?"
28807,Penny,and you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
27265,Penny,"oh, yeah, sure. let me just get out my materials. leonard gave me this briefcase. he used to carry it around in high school. you can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. okay, i would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, femevra."
21925,Penny,hey leonard.
23890,Penny,get out here! your mommy wants to talk to you!
27009,Penny,"sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?"
28392,Penny,"hey, guys. congratulations."
23332,Penny,"um, hey, hey, can i talk to you about that for a second?"
27840,Penny,add a belt and i’ll take you some place nice.
24621,Penny,okay. you know what? i changed my mind. i’m not going.
28198,Penny,but we can’t.
23046,Penny,"really? i mean, are you sure?"
26783,Penny,yeah. i’m just returning my uniform.
25713,Penny,"yeah, i’ve been thinking about it, too."
22883,Penny,roommate? you guys are living together?
25063,Penny,i’m… i’m sorry. what does this have to do with me?
27411,Penny,"well, who cares what i think? what do you think?"
22709,Penny,"i said, get out."
27633,Penny,"i know, it’s so insulting. at one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box."
27310,Penny,oh. okay.
25696,Penny,"okay.  what’s it supposed to… oh, my god, this is so freaky!"
26153,Penny,nothing. nothing.
29206,Penny,"well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? i mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
22982,Penny,"well, someone had to say it.  what?"
24650,Penny,"something got you down, there, sheldon?"
27051,Penny,"so, when is it?"
23174,Penny,it’s exactly the same…
27271,Penny,"what? oh, why would he say that?"
22672,Penny,"and you guys aren’t going? i can’t believe you, raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?"
24316,Penny,"ah, cool."
22676,Penny,"oh, raj, look at you!"
24129,Penny,do you really want to get into this right now?
29179,Penny,"well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
22152,Penny,"that’s okay, keep it. where’s christie."
23936,Penny,"ugh, what can you do? here. "
23398,Penny,excuse me?
24033,Penny,what is this?
26938,Penny,you do?
25185,Penny,"wait, what is going on?"
25689,Penny,"oh, what the hell. "
26019,Penny,ooh!
25429,Penny,"see, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
28071,Penny,"phone, now."
27159,Penny,"leonard, we can’t protect him forever."
22838,Penny,"well, that depends."
25749,Penny,"okay, hold on…"
27063,Penny,"i didn’t know him very well, but i still really liked him. it’s weird that he’s just gone."
25881,Penny,hmm.
24371,Penny,"hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. this is a big night for sheldon. right, sheldon?"
28775,Penny,didn’t.
23406,Penny,only if it doesn’t rhyme.
27487,Penny,"oh, that’s rough."
26879,Penny,are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
24599,Penny,are you sure?
24582,Penny,"i love your little heart locket, bernadette."
25202,Penny,"hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
28820,Penny,"you just said yourself, it’s sad."
23723,Penny,uh-huh.
27910,Penny,yeah. this is crazy.
28110,Penny,and sometimes we marry them anyway.
26047,Penny,what’s that?
23352,Penny,what’s a multiverse?
27448,Penny,"okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
23221,Penny,that’s all?
22769,Penny,"all right. look, i didn’t know, i’m sorry."
22937,Penny,"ha. well, that’s what i am, queen of the nerds."
28007,Penny,i want to believe you. i really do. am i being naive?
25855,Penny,i hope so.
27346,Penny,hi. sure.
27796,Penny,"okay. sheldon, let me ask you a question."
26219,Penny,it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
23597,Penny,"you mean, like a pinky swear?"
29293,Penny,"once again, you got me."
26072,Penny,as evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
23281,Penny,the people upstairs are moving out.
25496,Penny,"because last month, i sent the electric company a starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
22774,Penny,"oh, come on, everybody loves lolcats. they’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats."
23075,Penny,"yeah, i know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way."
25778,Penny,what?
22157,Penny,"look, howard, i know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. "
26290,Penny,"relax, sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late."
23736,Penny,but don’t look.
26282,Penny,"it is, isn’t it?"
22750,Penny,"uh, yeah, no, that’s not it."
24291,Penny,sheldon! play nice.
27369,Penny,"same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear."
22557,Penny,"you know, i’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about i let you know."
26734,Penny,i think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
24683,Penny,"okay. so, the usual, with extra spit on sheldon’s hamburger."
25251,Penny,"we are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
23288,Penny,the horror!
26932,Penny,"of course not. if i became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me."
23772,Penny,why are you back from your date so early?
28722,Penny,"wait, what do you mean she’s her?"
27423,Penny,"oh, it’s beautiful."
28011,Penny,uh-huh.
23565,Penny,"so, what are you guys doing?"
29371,Penny,"okay, new contest. "
26900,Penny,yes.
26093,Penny,"yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one."
25420,Penny,"leonard, this is nice. i’m so glad we did this."
23192,Penny,"hey, leonard. what’s going on with dr. wackadoodle?"
26543,Penny,"yeah. hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
21914,Penny,"wow, cool tiger."
25766,Penny,what are you doing in my bedroom?
27398,Penny,hey.
27201,Penny,what happens if you don’t?
27451,Penny,"sheldon, it was just a little tremor."
21934,Penny,"hey raj!  still not talking to me, huh?"
26755,Penny,"really? ‘cause this morning at starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. and it wasn’t the only one in there."
23008,Penny,"look, i’m telling you, i’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time i feel like i’m talking to a real person. and you know what? i like him, he’s a nice guy."
27040,Penny,"oh, i think i see our next stop."
26806,Penny,this is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
26051,Penny,"so, hey, i was thinking about that stuff with alex."
25746,Penny,"yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?"
21875,Penny,hi. 
22388,Penny,"missy, i’m going to go get my nails done. do you want to come?"
26372,Penny,good night.
24284,Penny,um…
23262,Penny,nicely done.
25506,Penny,leonard’s day?
29424,Penny,why doesn’t he just get another job?
26351,Penny,"i’m gonna miss you, too."
23066,Penny,"sheldon, look, i will pay you back as soon as i can. you just have to give me more time."
26908,Penny,"yeah. why wouldn’t i want to get my old job back? it’ll be fun to see everyone. i haven’t talked to them since i said i quit, see you at the oscars, bitches. come on, let’s just get this over with."
26152,Penny,"oh, son of a bitch."
26864,Penny,"yeah, you guys never use that space up there. why not get a table?"
27021,Penny,what the hell? what? she’s not working late.
26564,Penny,"okay, i gave this a lot of thought, and i finally found something to show you how much i love you."
26046,Penny,good.
23692,Penny,"i hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
23009,Penny,yes.
29464,Penny,"so it is an amazing documentary. they need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
27480,Penny,"well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her wheelchair kathy."
21912,Penny,"uh, i’m sorry, do you speak english?"
27690,Penny,i just want to make sure you get there safe.
23577,Penny,"yeah, maybe."
21948,Penny,"in my apartment, while i was sleeping."
24444,Penny,i thought you were going to talk to sheldon.
27730,Penny,"well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?"
23431,Penny,i said i don’t want to talk about it.
27327,Penny,yeah. it’s all very professional.
25409,Penny,"amy, stop it. oh, god, i’m so nervous."
23131,Penny,a hugging machine?
28902,Penny,"oh, i heard him interviewed on the radio. you know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. it was so funny."
24721,Penny,all right.
24299,Penny,"you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. now, come with me."
27280,Penny,"well, good job. now she hates me. ugh."
28376,Penny,"no, no, come on. come on, you’re not gonna get fat. you’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
29006,Penny,i can’t believe you fit in the crib.
28154,Penny,um.
26156,Penny,"and it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it."
28340,Penny,"well, i have broken up with my fair share of guys. i mean, how many times did i break up with leonard?"
23031,Penny,okay. you know what? i see where this is going. i’m not one of you guys. i’m not a scientist. so just…
22332,Penny,nothing. diet coke. and yoghurt. a little nail polish. 
23317,Penny,yes.
26802,Penny,"well, it’s scary for me, too."
24544,Penny,"oh, gee, dad, leonard can’t stay. he just dropped by to say hello. thanks for stopping by, sweetie. i’ll see you later.  bye."
23528,Penny,"oh, hey."
22818,Penny,"oh, my god."
26245,Penny,"she’d be proud, huh?"
28626,Penny,"okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?"
26436,Penny,"yeah, no, no, no. you know what, sheldon, it’s okay. you don’t have to go into the bathroom."
23471,Penny,i couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
24608,Penny,"you know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. shame on all of you. "
24563,Penny,"no, no, no, you can’t. your career is far too important."
29070,Penny,"look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
28904,Penny,it’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
22311,Penny,and there was no-one there to take care of you?
26654,Penny,"okay, look, zack, come on. you know neither of us thought this was real. i mean, we were married by an elvis impersonator."
24159,Penny,mm-hmm.
23128,Penny,"i mean, do you know where i was all morning? auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. and for what? so i’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?"
22765,Penny,thank you.
24846,Penny,"oh, the horror."
26150,Penny,no problem. we just sat down.
27591,Penny,"cooper told amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. he asked her if she had any questions. all she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
23412,Penny,"come on, do i really have to?"
22889,Penny,"you’re going to go down swinging, huh? all right, well, we got your body lotion, your instyle magazine, your jewellery box."
28284,Penny,"yeah, no one cares. did you help me out or not?"
25987,Penny,"you idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!"
27676,Penny,all that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
22631,Penny,is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
28925,Penny,but you like it so much.
24083,Penny,"no, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. nothing you do is silly to me."
24030,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sorry. i’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. you know, as soon as i get a part in a movie or my own tv series."
27924,Penny,"really? because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it."
29376,Penny,"hey, leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. "
27893,Penny,"oh, my god. yes. why would you even ask that?"
29165,Penny,"raj, you don’t have to serve us."
27981,Penny,"you know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."
23324,Penny,"oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…"
28178,Penny,we don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
22805,Penny,"yeah, well, your ken can kiss my barbie."
25789,Penny,he looked at me like this.
27956,Penny,"no, thank you."
25914,Penny,"elves? come on, leonard. it’s too early for lord of the rings."
22999,Penny,"okay, look. howard, i just want to apologize for some things that i have said. about you. i’ve been informed that you have feelings. and apparently, i have hurt them. so, i’m sorry. howard."
27957,Penny,no. you wrote vows?
29507,Penny,leonard says you’re pregnant.
22462,Penny,happy birthday anyways. 
26899,Penny,"remember the old days when i would’ve said something dumb like why? uh, that doesn’t sound good."
26082,Penny,"well, which is it?"
23978,Penny,we’re going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn?
26939,Penny,that’s so sweet.
26888,Penny,"sheldon, amy, will you please come join us?"
26911,Penny,"sweetie, i know you’re trying to make me feel better, and i love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and i kind of hate you. this isn’t your car."
29059,Penny,"no, it’s my brother’s. i’m trying to help him get a job out here."
29029,Penny,this is exactly why i didn’t want to talk about it.
23798,Penny,"oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. in the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. it faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
29077,Penny,i can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
25769,Penny,talk about what?
26658,Penny,i’m about to. sign the paper.
24915,Penny,hey.
23397,Penny,"well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship."
26003,Penny,"great. here you go. what you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull."
29314,Penny,yeah. do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite?
28056,Penny,"okay, i’ll talk to her later. uh, dad, there’s something i need to tell you. leonard and i got married."
29274,Penny,hey.
23827,Penny,not for twenty six hundred years.
27856,Penny,we’re not in a rush. we’ll set a date when the time is right.
28950,Penny,"oh, my god. it’s your birthday. let’s do something fun."
25843,Penny,"all right, fine, pick another game. amy and i will beat you at anything."
24616,Penny,"okay, what about your friend amy?"
22323,Penny,you rat bastard. 
24701,Penny,"uh, i don’t know. are you food?"
25329,Penny,"i’m sorry, what?"
28798,Penny,is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
24960,Penny,"oh, that gossipy bitch! no offense."
25767,Penny,"how did you even get in, you weirdo?"
24238,Penny,"no, mr. smarty-pants. i ignored the fill gas tank light."
28590,Penny,"um, does pottery barn, spring count?"
24605,Penny,mm-hmm.
28484,Penny,i can see that. what team did you get?
26264,Penny,what’s wrong with cute?
25665,Penny,"what do you want me to tell you, sheldon?"
23422,Penny,"well, he asked me out again and i said yes, and then i started thinking maybe i should talk to you first."
26311,Penny,"oh, this isn’t alcohol. it’s a magic potion that makes me like you."
23588,Penny,"um, i have a question."
28390,Penny,"okay, it’s not like she’s got the christ child in there, all right?  oh. it’s leonard. he says sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them."
26628,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
22091,Penny,"oh, sure, i see it now, the doppler effect. alright, i’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. "
29360,Penny,hi guys.
22396,Penny,"oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  "
26655,Penny,"hang on. you know what? you have been a jerk about this all day. you always do this, whenever i mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it."
27025,Penny,"well you know what? maybe i need a break from all of you. come on, sheldon."
23533,Penny,come here. 
27004,Penny,"okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
26439,Penny,"um, what?"
29308,Penny,"i want to, but i don’t think i can."
22422,Penny,"sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?"
23516,Penny,"because i like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. hey, leonard?"
29326,Penny,"okay, correct me if i’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
22417,Penny,"howard, here’s the difference. the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. "
29087,Penny,maybe we should just call it a night.
23117,Penny,"oh, well, i had a wonderful childhood."
24482,Penny,okay.
29273,Penny,yeah.
28908,Penny,"this is getting old fast, dolores, knock it off."
25642,Penny,c’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
22558,Penny,"also today we have a fresh caught alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. our soup of the day…"
24124,Penny,thinly veiled contempt.
24366,Penny,"okay. uncomfortable silence it is. hey, sheldon, have you told amy what it was like for you growing up in texas?"
25998,Penny,"hey, don’t name him. just jab a hook in his face."
27146,Penny,"amy, get out."
28455,Penny,"yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."
26115,Penny,"well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke."
24674,Penny,"okay. um, how about this? you know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?"
24038,Penny,sheldon’s in jail.
22470,Penny,"i really thought mike was different, i thought he was sensitive and smart. i mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. "
24407,Penny,i don’t have one.
23334,Penny,"oh, let’s see, how can i explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields."
26709,Penny,"what do you mean, not exactly?"
23538,Penny,"tell you what, next french toast day, i will make you oatmeal."
27535,Penny,"yeah, once i was too lazy to walk across the hall, so i used your toothbrush."
24152,Penny,the wesley crushers?

27689,Penny,like what?
25883,Penny,take off your clothes.
29413,Penny,"here you go. fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
29496,Penny,ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!

25655,Penny,hey.
25528,Penny,"oh, my god. hang it. wow. um, you know, i’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…"
23703,Penny,"oh, yeah, kind of. it’s, it’s no big thing."
29478,Penny,"hey, guys. i don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but i thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. so, bernadette? bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from forever 21. and there’s amy, showing all kinds of ankle. in an outfit i’m assuming is from forever 63. and i, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty."
27929,Penny,just kissing.
26849,Penny,sorry.
27379,Penny,oh. that’s why you were mumbling mississippi.
27358,Penny,"well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple."
28401,Penny,"oh, my god."
27639,Penny,how’s howard holding up?
26324,Penny,"wow, hawking. good for you."

29395,Penny,"here you go, raj, you might want to drink this one slowly."
29342,Penny,"so, you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university?"
24644,Penny,bored.
23253,Penny,"wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth?"
25776,Penny,"okay, honey, i have a lot to figure out, and until i do, you are not to say a word to leonard. do you understand?"
22064,Penny,"well, a little bird told me that you and lesley hooked up last night. "
27507,Penny,i don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
22555,Penny,"well, yeah. "

28068,Penny,"before i made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother."
22000,Penny,"oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window. "
23119,Penny,"uh-huh, he called me slugger until i got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. i wasn’t slugger anymore. your mother’s here!"
24909,Penny,"no, she doesn’t."
23937,Penny,"sheldon, are you okay?"
26446,Penny,"no, he doesn’t."
28734,Penny,"ugh, did you lose anything valuable?"
25751,Penny,raj.
28397,Penny,"babies? well, i’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. what about you?"
26994,Penny,or i don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
25050,Penny,"okay, explain something to me. you watch leonard put up with that guy for years and years. what has to break inside your brain for you to think, oh, krishna, i’ve got to get me some of that?"
23940,Penny,born and raised. 
27112,Penny,"oh, my god. what a day."
24474,Penny,"well, what was your side?"
24959,Penny,"well, i know that. how do you know that?"

29379,Penny,"um, that one. "
26313,Penny,"you know what? give me the dice, i want to roll."
23573,Penny,"ugh, fine. but the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
22349,Penny,"oh, no, no, i want to. it sounds really interesting. "
22215,Penny,"sweetie, put the pants on."
24958,Penny,"what the hell are you doing? howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. you should be ashamed of yourself."
27810,Penny,"i did. i mean, i walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then i walked right out."
22739,Penny,"hey, guys, this package came for y…"
25637,Penny,"ooh, am i about to get a rare sheldon cooper hug?"
24538,Penny,"okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. i mean, leonard’s a great guy."

23080,Penny,"oh, that’s nothing."
22188,Penny,"yeah, that. uh, why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when i’m tending the bar so i can keep an eye on you?"
22801,Penny,"i know. every saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate."
28752,Penny,"you’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
22010,Penny,"well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know i always say, when one door closes, another one opens. "
24738,Penny,"good night. you know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the neutral zone for just one night. oh!"
25831,Penny,"all right, round one. here."
23789,Penny,"hey, here’s your tip from table seven."
24434,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur."

21884,Penny,holy smokes.
28743,Penny,"well, where would you go?"
28675,Penny,"you know, when leonard’s feeling anxious i make him take a long walk."
26990,Penny,i’m talking about other guys.
24620,Penny,forget it. i’m not wearing the wig.
22629,Penny,"no, no, i’ve a bronze dagger."
22440,Penny,sure.
23913,Penny,thank you. would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
25072,Penny,"i know, right? maybe i should just move back to nebraska."
28456,Penny,"okay, so what is solder?"
27973,Penny,"what do you mean, every time you see her?"
23160,Penny,"i’m sorry, i buy it. all those people are on drugs."
28347,Penny,"now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?"
22467,Penny,tell me the truth. am i just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
25802,Penny,you really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
26270,Penny,"yeah, it was fun. kind of reminded me of my high school. but instead of vampires, we had meth heads. but both came out at night and had messed up teeth."
23568,Penny,"oh, just a big misunderstanding. you know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. anyway, i was thinking i’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
26854,Penny,i don’t know. i’m kind of hungry.
26764,Penny,hi.
28463,Penny,no. you know what? don’t. don’t. let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
22685,Penny,"oh, wow, is the evening over."
21911,Penny,it’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.
24571,Penny,i don’t know.
25288,Penny,i hope alex gets crabs: the movie.
24586,Penny,"yeah, you, too."
27393,Penny,move it.
25261,Penny,"haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
23621,Penny,it was pretty good. we won.
28541,Penny,where’d you get that from?
22711,Penny,"you’re hurting the people around you, sweetie."
26838,Penny,"oh, that’s true. "
29152,Penny,"hey, if you’re still looking to make money, i will pay you to burn that jacket."
25795,Penny,"really, your potty training journal?"
22893,Penny,"yeah, sure. what are you washing? a crocodile?"
26470,Penny,"okay, it’s not gonna say that."
28850,Penny,"yeah, except the river kept showing me his pokémon cards."

22690,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it’s okay. "
25007,Penny,haven’t seen you in a while. how’s it going?
25293,Penny,"oh, yeah. sure. just one sec?"
24148,Penny,"really? so, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause i said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
29085,Penny,"sorry, guys. this club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? i thought we got rid of all those."
24035,Penny,"the reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that i had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts i’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
26054,Penny,"i know, right? watch this. molecules."
27759,Penny,"oh, it’s cool, i’ve never been on a podcast before."
26664,Penny,"he’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"
26462,Penny,"mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think i’m smart enough. you think i’m gonna be a liability. even though i totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. yeah."
24313,Penny,"oh. hey, leonard."
26923,Penny,that kind of actress. this sucks.
26425,Penny,ah.
28116,Penny,"oh, good for him."
24602,Penny,exactly.
23741,Penny,"then, maybe you should let it go."
24058,Penny,you’re extorting a date out of me?
29400,Penny,"hey, guys, i need to use your tv."
22208,Penny,"seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. what’s this."
29497,Penny,ugh!
22513,Penny,thank you for the clarification. 
26489,Penny,what are you talking about?
24910,Penny,"it doesn’t matter. look, i promise from now on i will keep my distance from you."
22410,Penny,and?
26610,Penny,"well, i was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, i want to say salmon."
22673,Penny,"come on, this is huge, raj is going to be in people magazine. and he didn’t even have to knock up one of the spears sisters."
24662,Penny,that’s what it says on the packet.
29487,Penny,think of sheldon when you apply it.
24323,Penny,you stole it?
25403,Penny,how about this?
28093,Penny,"trust me, this is the right thing."
28676,Penny,"well, for a while. then he comes back."
28554,Penny,what are you doing?
22745,Penny,excuse me?
29287,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry to hear that."
24354,Penny,can i ask you a question?
23440,Penny, sheldon.
23408,Penny,maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
25171,Penny,"um, can we talk to you about raj?"
23970,Penny,"sheldon, this is ridiculous."
27408,Penny,"okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
23719,Penny,what?
28965,Penny,here.
25549,Penny,you’re right. you’re absolutely right. i should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
28771,Penny,damn. 
25001,Penny,"look, just find out what’s up with this trip to india."
25370,Penny,"wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
23897,Penny,agreed.
27062,Penny,"i just never knew anyone that died. i had a pet pig when i was a kid. i mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue."
26747,Penny,are you serious? for what?
23794,Penny,"hey, leonard, check this out. "
29265,Penny,"okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with zack?"
22328,Penny,"so, you’ve got a bit of competition, i really don’t see what the big deal is. "
23959,Penny,"well, it creeps me out."
26347,Penny,like this. i am so happy for you.
29373,Penny,"okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, i slipped and skinned my knee."
26618,Penny,smile.
23711,Penny,"buy him the robot, leonard."
27490,Penny,you’re just gonna leave him here?
22131,Penny,"well, it’s been fun."
23563,Penny,"yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."
23786,Penny,"yes, but i don’t think she wants to see you."
29344,Penny,son of a bitch!
23758,Penny,no.
27707,Penny,"no. no, come on, i want to do it."
23184,Penny,"okay, now that i’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight."
22523,Penny,come on in.
22953,Penny,"nice save, genius. eggnog?"
24955,Penny,in confidence!
26170,Penny,"yeah, i know. i’m a total bitch."
23433,Penny,what’s classified?
28204,Penny,nope.
26912,Penny,i don’t understand.
28686,Penny,"oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill."
26073,Penny,"ooh, thor! he’s hot."
24953,Penny,"priya told you. what a little gossip. you know, not an attractive quality in a woman, leonard. not judging, just my opinion."
28504,Penny,"fine, is that how you want to play this? all right, never have i ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals."
29353,Penny,"oh, hey guys. "
23336,Penny,"come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on."
24338,Penny,"okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child."
23164,Penny,"you know, i gotta go home and wash my hair."
22828,Penny,"no. yeah, i remember specifically. you started by asking if i was from mars because my ass was out of this world."
27455,Penny,"yeah, once he figures out how to work a door."
22887,Penny,"okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?"
22574,Penny,"oh. oh, well, good for him. yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?"
27038,Penny,not with money. read.
22904,Penny,"hey. oh, i put your clothes in the dryer."
23158,Penny,why do we have to tell him i did it?
28283,Penny,"hey, how’d it go?"
22222,Penny,the… the eighth grade?
24912,Penny,"leonard, i get it. you’re in a new relationship now. and i’m happy for you. so why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?"
25550,Penny,i don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
24512,Penny,"and i can’t believe you’ve never read eat, pray, love."
26146,Penny,"no, i’m into it, i’m into it. just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out."
28081,Penny,"sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this."
24636,Penny,like there’s a difference.
26683,Penny,"hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? not being born?"
26355,Penny,okay.
28169,Penny,don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
22344,Penny,because it’s polite.
26479,Penny,wow. i can drink a beer underwater.
23136,Penny,"neck, shot, lime.  okay, shot, lime."
25948,Penny,sorry.
29069,Penny,you gave me a bill at the end of every month. 
27732,Penny,"i know, i know."
26846,Penny,so the point is i may have saved her life.
26284,Penny,"sheldon, you big weirdo, i want you to know that i love that you’re in my life."
22060,Penny,"gee, sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. i’m usually on the other side of the tie. "
24688,Penny,"oh, don’t feel bad. i never read leonard’s, and i used to sleep with him."
25161,Penny,"handicapped people are nice, leonard. everyone knows that."
23053,Penny,yes.
22355,Penny,no.
26427,Penny,thank you.
26497,Penny,run.
22187,Penny,"okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it. "
28563,Penny,"uh, i don’t know."
28281,Penny,"i don’t know. you could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug."
27891,Penny,"not in a rush, busy with work…"
29194,Penny,"i bet jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because i work twice as hard as she does."
26824,Penny,really? is that how you talk to your mother?
27751,Penny,"yeah, it’s also like when the mountain fought the red viper in game of thrones."
29101,Penny,"yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. my god, how long does this thing spin for?"
29186,Penny,"yeah, i guess they don’t have sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
25541,Penny,it’s right over there.
24682,Penny,hey. so you guys ready to order?
27450,Penny,"obviously, i care about leonard. i’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him."
29325,Penny,"so, sheldon, have you talked to amy?"
23706,Penny,"okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting."
29168,Penny,you didn’t do anything. it’s sheldon.
21885,Penny,"uh, do you guys mind if i start?"
23260,Penny,going online to buy shoes!
23363,Penny,"all right. so, um, just give me a call."
27244,Penny,"well, that’s not good. you being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."
27221,Penny,i know. watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
27870,Penny,okay. were you talking before she got upset?
26483,Penny,let’s go.
24711,Penny,"um, i never really thought about it. why?"
25796,Penny,"august 7, 8:42 a.m. this is humiliating. what was wrong with diapers?"
24215,Penny,we’re home.
27424,Penny,"aw, i know i wasn’t into this before, but i’m so glad i get to take you to your first prom."
27343,Penny,"sweetie, i can buy my own stuff. i have a good job now."
26708,Penny,great.
23924,Penny,"good night. that was weird, even for him."
29409,Penny,hey.
26302,Penny,we’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
27892,Penny,really good.
22155,Penny,"uh, so christie, what are your plans?"
27515,Penny,"three words, doctor who convention."
23125,Penny,"hey, i talked to her for five minutes yesterday and i’ve been half bombed ever since."
28724,Penny,"what? you tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?"
27643,Penny,"raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with emily?"
22062,Penny,"so, how’s it going?"
24327,Penny,"are you telling me, for the past four months i have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with sheldon has a girlfriend?"
27976,Penny,"oh, okay. so you’re saying this is my fault?"
29214,Penny,"hey, since when do you do laundry on a thursday?"
28836,Penny,that did not clear things up.
22795,Penny,here. try and go online.
26973,Penny,"come on, really?"
29042,Penny,we’re not getting divorced.
26833,Penny,happy valentine’s day.
28926,Penny,i seem to be losing.
24455,Penny,amy.
25707,Penny,"you can’t take something like that back. i mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
28404,Penny,"you know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come."
26858,Penny,yeah. i’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. we love animals.
24358,Penny,"my point is, i know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
22630,Penny,"alright, alright, how do i get the sword?"
24121,Penny,"oh, right, bowling."
27169,Penny,oh.
23438,Penny, sheldon.
23727,Penny,ow.
23147,Penny,"hello, sheldon."
28680,Penny,"yeah, drive safe. we love you. and give us a call… oh, my god, it was me, it was me. i’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
24416,Penny,"oh, let me help you up."
23950,Penny,"for me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them."
22035,Penny,i’ll be back.
27821,Penny,you think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
26031,Penny,any particular reason why?
22813,Penny,"look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here."
26024,Penny,you’re talking about leonard.
25821,Penny,oh! you’re kidding.
25200,Penny,"ooh, maybe a little rodeo drive."
26822,Penny,"i know. one of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. i mean, i, i almost wet myself. i guess you had to be there."
28647,Penny,really? ‘cause i love it.
26931,Penny,hmm.
25928,Penny,"now, ladies, we got a b-minus on this paper. i think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an a."
28189,Penny,"what, now you’re interested? you didn’t even want to come."
23696,Penny,"no, i’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
23000,Penny,"so, you’re okay?"
26687,Penny,a few minutes it is.
21898,Penny,"oh god, you know, four years i lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as high school. "
27152,Penny,so? he loves trains.
26666,Penny,"it’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
25454,Penny,"yeah, kind of, yeah."
25044,Penny,"all right, let me try this again. where’s leonard?"
21890,Penny,"um, me, okay, i’m sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
23570,Penny,tur-briska-fil?
28172,Penny,no one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
22291,Penny,"oh, it’s okay, i understand."
24580,Penny,"daddy, he had nothing to do…"
25105,Penny,"it’s great, isn’t it?"
28044,Penny,"well, i don’t want to hurt my dad. you know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."
26412,Penny,"sheldon, you are right. i’m really sorry. i should’ve known better."
29285,Penny,"champagne, champagne."
25598,Penny,yesterday. you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
24885,Penny,"hey, you. what happened with the contacts?"
25502,Penny,aw.
27181,Penny,"well, i’m a people person. people like me. some of my favourite people are people. i feel like i’m saying people a lot. people, people, people. okay, i’m done."
24244,Penny,we just broke up.
29431,Penny,oh.
22067,Penny,"so, how’s everything. "
29238,Penny,i think it’s bert.
28746,Penny,"you know, i’m very proud of you for trying to live with amy."
23250,Penny,no kidding. two?
21988,Penny,i’d like a drink.
24212,Penny,"okay, whatever."
26934,Penny,"so, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?"
21960,Penny,"guys, seriously, i grew up on a farm, okay, i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was like twelve, i think i can put together a cheap swedish media centre. "
22255,Penny,"it’s this friday at eight, you guys want to come?"
25936,Penny,"wow, excuse me."
24952,Penny,"well, then who?"
27306,Penny,yes. i’ll check flights.
22404,Penny,why not?
28890,Penny,"you’re dating somebody, who is it?"
28999,Penny,you need a break?
28945,Penny,"sheldon, what took you so long?"
26676,Penny,ah.
26706,Penny,"come on, sheldon. you and me right here."
28133,Penny,you went on a date last night? are you seeing someone?
28731,Penny,"wow, you popular girls are mean."
23482,Penny,oh. sorry. i don’t know your sad song.
27111,Penny,"hmm. you think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny."
29328,Penny,"all right, this is making me crazy. somebody’s got to go over there."
22457,Penny,"sheldon, we have to go."
23312,Penny,"well, they’re all still up there."
27572,Penny,it would be humiliating.
25868,Penny,i just thought i’d stop by and say hello.
28327,Penny,"constance, are you sure i can’t pour you some wine?"
29316,Penny,really? all i got from leonard was the toblerone bar had nuts.
28269,Penny,"have fun, guys."
27069,Penny,yeah.
28442,Penny,no. what i’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of howard.
24807,Penny,"he still won’t shag the old lady, huh?"
29151,Penny,okay.
22501,Penny,"all i’m saying is, you know leonard the best. "
26580,Penny,"hey, guys."
27967,Penny,"well, the night is still young."
25827,Penny,my limbic system wants to take your pants off.
27728,Penny,"you know, for an extra four bucks, i can have this thing here tomorrow."
26084,Penny,"wait, i thought we were reading."
23295,Penny,okay.
22330,Penny,"you know, i’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
25319,Penny,"well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
23274,Penny,come on. what about the living organism of the workforce and the american spirit and jiminy crockett at the alamo?
21975,Penny,"okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
22053,Penny,"well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into bryan adams. "
26512,Penny,really? are you sure about that?
28747,Penny,mm. 
24535,Penny,what the hell was that?
24258,Penny,hang on.
22166,Penny,"alright fellas, i gotta go. good luck. "
28864,Penny,the woman at the wall store?
25130,Penny,"i can’t even believe this. you know, maybe you should just go."
26951,Penny,"yeah, sure."
27959,Penny,"no, no, no, go ahead. i’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this."
25100,Penny,"oh, hell with nebraska. i’m gonna be a star!"
26074,Penny,"hmm, okay, i’m done. how did you guys finish so fast?"
27860,Penny,"yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love."
28121,Penny,"well, so how does it work?"
24141,Penny,you’re kidding.
26112,Penny,"yeah, he does, but it’s not the same."

22306,Penny,"okay, well, you feel better."
23437,Penny, sheldon.
28357,Penny,"just shut up, glen. come on, let’s get out of here."
25156,Penny,"mustache is looking good there, sheldon."
24118,Penny,hmm.
28155,Penny,"all right, fine. well, sheldon, i’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of spock? i mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human."
26593,Penny,"yeah, it’s freaking me out. i’m gonna go."
25611,Penny,"oh, come on. they’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. then you get to go again…"
25678,Penny,"amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?"
27281,Penny,"i don’t know what emily’s so upset about anyway. even if i had slept with him, so what? everyone has a past."
27236,Penny,"no, don’t."
22832,Penny,nice.
29468,Penny,"yeah, i heard you. i got red."
26748,Penny,what? how did you manage that?
28237,Penny,"oh, my god, he won’t stop."
26162,Penny,"what, so i’m the wrong person? maybe you want to be with gretchen, too."
27104,Penny,"god, what am i doing with my life?"
26701,Penny,"oh, my inference is justified. sheldon, you are so funny. anyway, i need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them."
25810,Penny,"oh, amy, really? she is not going to come on to sheldon."
29188,Penny,"if you want, i can get ready in five minutes."
27663,Penny,sheldon.
23245,Penny,"well, what’s wrong with my apartment?"
23738,Penny,"yeah, great."

24391,Penny,"no, no, no, no. you’re right. we’re not going out anymore, i should pay for myself.  what?"
27441,Penny,"‘cause i’m a liar, liar?"
26869,Penny,"all right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too."
24841,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it’s okay. i don’t want tea."
22922,Penny,uh-huh.
24206,Penny,"oh, well, then you, you do it."
29375,Penny,what the hell’s going on? 
28721,Penny,"oh, it’s funny, i was just thinking the same thing about you."

24567,Penny,listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
25338,Penny,"okay. if you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your wi-fi?"

28402,Penny,"yeah, what is the problem? is it about getting older?"
26982,Penny,"hey, you’re up early."
22365,Penny,"it was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."

26249,Penny,"oh, not really. i was out shopping with amy. she wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing."
23479,Penny,"no, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. i will."
28395,Penny,"yeah, yeah. i was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box."
26510,Penny,"well, why were you so angry?"

23002,Penny,"aw, that sounds sweet."

29414,Penny,"here you go, leonard. is this going to be big enough?"
23402,Penny,"i don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here."
24051,Penny,"well, i’m kind of responsible for sheldon missing stan lee, and i really want to make it up to him. so i was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe i can arrange for them to meet."
27557,Penny,date night.
24809,Penny,"oh, please, i recognize the walk of shame when i see it. all you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it."
24839,Penny,great.
23394,Penny,"where did that even come from, did he say we were?"

27989,Penny,"okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
24527,Penny,"oh, gosh, amy. i don’t know if i would call this an actual slumber party."
28952,Penny,"oh, of course. the annual birthday booty spectacular!"
26818,Penny,"well, there’s a bar in the lobby."

25835,Penny,it’s a chocolate chip cookie.
23520,Penny,what do you have a safe deposit box for?
27653,Penny,you sure that’s your choice? ‘cause i’ve had that dinner.
23629,Penny,"okay, great. well, then why don’t you come over next saturday and watch the game with us."
25217,Penny,"okay, good, because there’s this one guy i used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point."
22993,Penny,"oh, pthththth."
22011,Penny,"no, no, i meant…"

24090,Penny,"oh, my god."
25346,Penny,"oh, terrific. high school quarterback against four mathletes."
23633,Penny,"sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
24749,Penny,you want an acting lesson?
29366,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty…"
26244,Penny,"wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the cheesecake factory."
25271,Penny,"oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new jennifer aniston movie."
27654,Penny,"robert downey, jr."
24172,Penny,"no, this isn’t fair to you, leonard. i’m sorry."
23085,Penny,"no, but he will."
26132,Penny,"well, i don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth."
27149,Penny,you do that?
26740,Penny,oh.
27060,Penny,i have a confession to make.
29340,Penny,all right. what do you think is happening?
29115,Penny,"raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
28400,Penny,"well, where is he?"
27617,Penny,"sheldon, this isn’t that hard."
23087,Penny,"i don’t know, but i may have to find a cheaper place to live."
25674,Penny,"okay, show’s over."
27683,Penny,it’s getting creepy again.

28893,Penny,all right.
28240,Penny,fine.
26881,Penny,"oh, please. when i first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train."
27885,Penny,"yeah, it’s just, things are good right now."
24154,Penny,still don’t get it.
28435,Penny,"i know, but you did it. i’m so proud of you."
24404,Penny,"oh, my god, that is so creepy!"
27285,Penny,"no, that won’t work."
26119,Penny,"yeah. okay, all right, don’t freak out. you can make this work."
25437,Penny,"i don’t know, it’s complicated."
27921,Penny,"nope, never."
21901,Penny,"oh, i’m so sorry, i’m such a mess, and on top of everything else i’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work."
26630,Penny,"yeah, back when i was dating zack. it was actually more fun than i thought. we gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."

28843,Penny,hello.
23044,Penny,"well, yeah, but…"

25951,Penny,"no, she won’t."
26457,Penny,fifty cents off vagisil.
23514,Penny,hit me.
22182,Penny,a… are you talking to me?
25446,Penny,"no, that’s okay, bernadette. sometimes these things just don’t work out."
22002,Penny,was this supposed to be a date?
27863,Penny,"well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
27742,Penny,i don’t think i’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
27900,Penny,stay out of it.
27017,Penny,"uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
23809,Penny,"yeah, okay, cool. i don’t need the pbs special, i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job. you know, like bernadette does."
28267,Penny,yes. he said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
26189,Penny,you need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
23145,Penny,the whole thing froze. i don’t know what happened.
25823,Penny,"oh, is that it?"
22628,Penny,"okay, look, i bought the game, and i’ve been exploring the island of tordage but i can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain."
25231,Penny,"okay, that time you looked at me."
29164,Penny,mm-hmm.
25296,Penny,"no, i’m talking to him because he’s cute."
28215,Penny,"hang on. wait, wait. why don’t i like the lingerie you got me?"
24047,Penny,what’s going on?
27945,Penny,okay.
23965,Penny,leonard doesn’t snore.
25057,Penny,"i listen. i have no idea what it means, but i listen. to friendship."
25453,Penny,the hell do you think you’re going?
25064,Penny,"you know, i’ve done this before. in kindergarten, i was supposed to marry jason sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to chelsea himmelfarb. so what did i do? hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
21876,Penny,"oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?"
27993,Penny,i don’t know.
27324,Penny,yep. shake that thing.
27118,Penny,"what? no, that’s not what i’m saying."
29172,Penny,"yeah, this is a special circumstance."
26570,Penny,of course i did. it’s you.
24945,Penny,"alright, well great seeing you."
24653,Penny,aw.
25170,Penny,hi.
29106,Penny,"and if you really want to hurt him, i look great in chanel."
28420,Penny,"oh, wait, wait, wait. stuart didn’t get to speak."
24940,Penny,give my friend his stuff back.
25982,Penny,damn.
26157,Penny,"no, you’re totally right. she could be skinny ’cause she’s dying."
23641,Penny,"you know, leonard, honey, i wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with sheldon."
27987,Penny,right? i can’t believe amy actually went through with it.
24895,Penny,okay.
23097,Penny,"well, i cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."
23782,Penny,"my point is, i do not judge a book by its cover. i am interested in the person underneath."
23854,Penny,so i take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
27139,Penny,"no, keep your money."
25435,Penny,"you hung in there, though."
26340,Penny,"well, i’m his girlfriend, of course i’m gonna support him."
22956,Penny,"okay, merry christmas."
29448,Penny,"yeah, i have a question. is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to los angeles tonight?"
25070,Penny,"yeah, i’m gonna go pack a bag."
28029,Penny,"oh, yeah, right. lock up your daughters or sheldon might lecture them about the north american free trade agreement."
28450,Penny,"hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, i’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? he doesn’t think that’s funny."
28601,Penny,you’ve been doing it all day. do you even know what an insult is?
26492,Penny,but wait. so does this one.
22988,Penny,"yeah, probably with a blow-up doll."
22103,Penny,"yes it is. that’s why i broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. "
27182,Penny,people. yes.
21868,Penny,"oh, okay, well, guess i’m your new neighbour, penny."
27331,Penny,"i’m sorry, i was thinking about work."
21953,Penny,"you know, where i come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? and you don’t shoot to wound. i mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. what was i saying?"
28351,Penny,hi there. what’s your name?
27547,Penny,"yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector."
22232,Penny,well i’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend. 
27323,Penny,to the walk-in closet? sure.
27427,Penny,"well, if i would have been there and saw you alone, i would’ve asked you to dance."
27543,Penny,"i don’t know, i guess i like that i hate it. it makes me work harder."
23037,Penny,"the building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and i haven’t paid my rent."
22580,Penny,"yeah, sure."
26644,Penny,are you done?
22135,Penny,"um, well, howard and christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom. "
22426,Penny,"uh, sheldon, i didn’t see your present."
25376,Penny,"so, are we ready to order?"
22128,Penny,"wait, wait, sheldon, come back, you forgot something. "
22346,Penny,what did he say? 
23855,Penny,what is it?
22581,Penny,"well, they have a lot in common. i mean they’re both scientists."
27360,Penny,i see it.
23608,Penny,"i just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…"
26056,Penny,hi. here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
24331,Penny,"okay, i have a question."
21943,Penny,"oh, great, thank you again ."
22835,Penny,"well, yeah, we did have a date."
26366,Penny,you’re talking to me.
27530,Penny,how are you guys getting along? what? why are there tears?
27356,Penny,you know what? i’m sorry. it’s stupid to fight over money.
25240,Penny,no. all your little secrets are fine.
26175,Penny,"what, what do you mean? are you breaking up with me?"
28897,Penny,"now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of legos?"
29192,Penny,paul.
23016,Penny,what’s up with ichabod?
24525,Penny,"all right, time to open bachelor number two."
26405,Penny,"okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. when i first moved out to l.a., i did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. ugh! after i did it, i felt so ashamed. thankfully, that thing never came out."
28353,Penny,"yes. oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and i just…"
23664,Penny,hey.
27259,Penny,"yeah. it was fine. we went to a melissa etheridge concert, i got an a, it all worked out."
24253,Penny,"well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
29201,Penny,"ooh, yes. fun."
22322,Penny,"i’m sorry, honey, i don’t know it."
26399,Penny,thanks.
28137,Penny,in school?
28506,Penny,i can’t believe this. you realize i make more money than you?
25206,Penny,oh. yeah. that’s gone. it’s a rough month when halloween and pms hit at the same time.
23880,Penny,i’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. another round for me and my homegirl.
28713,Penny,"oh, i’ll go. i like a party."
23724,Penny,"oh, my god. i got to go to the emergency room."
26745,Penny,"we can, but the part of penny might get cut."
27329,Penny,"wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?"
28547,Penny,is he still wearing the batman suit under the man-bat suit?
28856,Penny,"well, you’ve lied to sheldon."
26058,Penny,i feel like you guys just went to comic-con.
22378,Penny,really?
24380,Penny,"okay, sheldon, i think you’ve made your point."
23752,Penny,what?
25043,Penny,"what do you mean, new roommate? what happened to leonard?"
23042,Penny,don’t be silly.
28641,Penny,"so, what did we miss?"
27177,Penny,i wish i felt more confident.
24228,Penny,"good night, leonard."
25303,Penny,"oh, he had to leave."
22419,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw leonard a birthday party. "
23488,Penny,"oh, leonard, you shouldn’t have. oh, boy! what is it?"
24332,Penny,you don’t even like people touching you. how are you going to have sex?
23350,Penny,"unlikely. here, what about this one for my nephew?"
24755,Penny,forget it.
21985,Penny,ah. well i’m sure things will pick up. 
23486,Penny,"look, sheldon, i just don’t think that the guys and leonard really meant to hurt you. you know? they just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. okay, you know what it’s like? remember that scene in the new star trek movie when kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying spock didn’t care his mom died?"
26870,Penny,no buts. you got to stop letting him boss you around.
28378,Penny,"yeah, i’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
24472,Penny,"oh, you’re right. that is so embarrassing."
22239,Penny,"um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s "
26834,Penny,don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. it came that way when i bought it.
22622,Penny,"leonard, guess what, i’m a level three warrior."
24376,Penny,"whoa, wait, wait, wait. i did not start dating at 15."
29513,Penny,hey.
22455,Penny,"okay, how about this. you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i’ll point out which of my friends are easy. "
26831,Penny,yeah.
24657,Penny,"well, you don’t like it?"
28095,Penny,"no, no, they’re really not."
27191,Penny,"oh, my god, no."
29490,Penny,what is wrong with you?
24724,Penny,sleep.
27933,Penny,"ha-ha, don’t push it."
28936,Penny,"i think i’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
21997,Penny,are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?
24277,Penny,"so, why was it his lucky day?"
23255,Penny,"wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? since when do we offer a one-day rush?"
25517,Penny,"well, tell you one thing, if i ever do get married, no klingon invitations."
23376,Penny,"that’s superman’s big ice thing, right?"
24878,Penny,oopsy.
23730,Penny,"i don’t need panties, i just need shorts and a shirt."
26743,Penny,you didn’t get your part cut.
27783,Penny,"no, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. i’m not overly conservative. i’m young, so my guy said i can afford to take some risks."
29289,Penny,and when? but also where?
23931,Penny,"wait, wait, what’s 0400?"
23677,Penny,"no, no, sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
24067,Penny,i’m sorry. he doesn’t really understand sarcasm.
26204,Penny,i can laugh about it now.
29260,Penny,"oh, that’s a nice offer."
28699,Penny,and you talked?
23304,Penny,"oh, this? i’m dressed like a slob today."
23207,Penny,what is it?
26004,Penny,"oh, look, it’s a female. you can see all the eggs. "
23146,Penny,how can i calm down? i’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. that’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
23166,Penny,"sheldon, i am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. can’t you be a little bit flexible? yeah, sorry. i didn’t really think that through."
26670,Penny,"wow, you’re really good at this."
26275,Penny,"see? i wish i had some of that fire in my life. i mean, i want to care about things and get excited like you guys."
24087,Penny,why not?
24854,Penny,"ooh, i got one. if you guys were a band, you’d be called leonard and the leonards."
27857,Penny,"hey, look at that. you both believe in jewish bearded guys."
26312,Penny,i drink my potion.
23660,Penny,"hey, if i want to invite the entire line up of lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, i will, and it’s none of your business!"
24300,Penny,we’re gonna have sex.
21892,Penny,"oh, yeah, a lot of people think i’m a water sign. okay, let’s see, what else, oh, i’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, i love steak. "
29244,Penny,ooh. i’m gonna get another. you want food?
29021,Penny,"oh, it was fine."
23456,Penny,"well, i got you a little going away present."
28123,Penny,"okay, let me see. nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute."
25441,Penny,so we don’t tell people we’re back together?
23841,Penny,because i’m stupid!
23183,Penny,"it’s kind of a funny name, though, smoot."
22844,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
26725,Penny,are you kidding me?
25304,Penny,"huh? i’m sorry, get what?"
37056,Sheldon,"i’ll put, in progress. okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
35043,Sheldon,"okay, i don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because i’m on the team and i wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet. "
43007,Sheldon,"if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
38084,Sheldon,correct.
41973,Sheldon,"well, truth be told, as a child, i did dream of going to space. those astronauts were my heroes. and when you got to go, it was hard for me."
35875,Sheldon,"it took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. wait here, i’ll find us seats."
38705,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i just love that line. even the way you do it.
37201,Sheldon,i don’t understand. what other kind of women are there?
43196,Sheldon,you’re just saying that to make me feel better.
39911,Sheldon,who’s unsatisfactory in p.e. now?
45180,Sheldon,he’s not gonna make it.
34773,Sheldon,huh.
39053,Sheldon,"priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
36580,Sheldon,i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
41665,Sheldon,"oh, yes, nine. welcome back, buddy."
41805,Sheldon,"don’t get soft on me, hofstadter. i will slap those glasses right off your face."
39146,Sheldon,disagree.
38765,Sheldon,"no, no. i’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you."
42065,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll try."
36802,Sheldon,"forgive me, as you know, i’m no adept at reading facial cues, but i’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
41771,Sheldon,please. what if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and i’m not there to see it?
44750,Sheldon,"thank you for your services, gentlemen. now, i’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music."
45803,Sheldon,would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
40356,Sheldon,"oh, that hardly seems fair. but i guess any team that i’m not on has a decided disadvantage."
39110,Sheldon,all right.
35245,Sheldon,how am i supposed to know that? as the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. 
35213,Sheldon,"let’s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because i have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. now i can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. and i ask you, is it worth it? "
35225,Sheldon,why? 
40384,Sheldon,how could you not find him?
41990,Sheldon,i saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
42577,Sheldon,"uh, extra peanut sauce?"
37322,Sheldon,i can’t see it! it just won’t coalesce.
40430,Sheldon,it’s been three days. why hasn’t stephen hawking played a word?
34887,Sheldon,"obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. "
37912,Sheldon,"given your community college education, i encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
34517,Sheldon,just come with me.
39047,Sheldon,thank you. is someone smoking?
37175,Sheldon,august 16th. right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
44295,Sheldon,"oh. well, suit yourself. who wants to check me?"
42396,Sheldon,are you sure? it just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
42025,Sheldon,"mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then i should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. you know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore."
41628,Sheldon,this is a jewish house. i don’t think they have pigskin.
44884,Sheldon,"well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
36197,Sheldon,"that is my spot. in an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. if my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment i first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
45184,Sheldon,"if the judge couldn’t explain it to me, i don’t see how you will."
44868,Sheldon,"you’re happy with who you are. you don’t get jealous of other people. instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
43392,Sheldon,"well, gollum, you’re an expert on rings. what do i do with this one?"
36196,Sheldon,what difference does it make?
45624,Sheldon,"don’t worry, i’ve got this. ladies and gentlemen, honoured daughters. while mr kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. thank you. "
40013,Sheldon,is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
38817,Sheldon,"i didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did i, nosy rosie?"
39205,Sheldon,"if i could, i would, but i can’t, so i shan’t. now, knowing penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. but, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?  yes, just like that. penny could have been inspecting raj’s anal region for parasites. oh, boy. that’s a true blue friend."
40575,Sheldon,"oh, yes, they are. i mean, what?"
36363,Sheldon,the horror!
40546,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. that’s my spot.
44369,Sheldon,"oh, but i won’t be there."
43468,Sheldon,i’m here to return your belongings. that’s what people who’ve broken up do.
43801,Sheldon,very well done.
38162,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m a physicist, not a hippie."
42664,Sheldon,"no, but last year, at magic mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it."
42704,Sheldon,it was so good.
35253,Sheldon,"twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. you’d also have to be knighted for that to apply. "
45622,Sheldon,"ah, la-la-la, hava nagila. they’ll come, they’ll settle and i’ll win the prize…"
42988,Sheldon,"so, you can experiment on all the apes you want. but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly i’m the monster."
36504,Sheldon,"i can’t sleep on your couch. i sleep in a bed. and given it’s dimensions i have no intention of living out e.m. snickering’s beloved children’s book , the tall man from cornwall."
43301,Sheldon,wrong. obesity.
42244,Sheldon,"so, who’s watching her now?"
42318,Sheldon,or had a single piece of fruit.
41625,Sheldon,"perhaps you’re right. i’m sorry for my behaviour. i’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate."
40229,Sheldon,attaboy!
36840,Sheldon,"oh! if i’m wrong, prove it."
38823,Sheldon,but change is a part of life.
40975,Sheldon,"oh, hello. what can i do for you ladies?"
37838,Sheldon,i was wrong. penny can do better.
41561,Sheldon,"none of your business. but when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
36003,Sheldon,"now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, i withdraw that comment."
35158,Sheldon,"oh. okay. you know, i don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought. "
38376,Sheldon,i informed you thusly.
41371,Sheldon,to the planetarium.
36959,Sheldon,leonard! stop the car!
37907,Sheldon,i’m sorry. do you have other plans?
43145,Sheldon,i don’t want to play anymore.
45513,Sheldon,"no, i sat and i sat, but to no avail."
41546,Sheldon,"because as it just so happens, i’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. isn’t that right, new friend and colleague bill nye the science guy. sorry, i replaced you with a newer model."
36165,Sheldon,"it’s totally understandable. in bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location."
38068,Sheldon,"that’s a peculiar conclusion. by any standard, amy is more similar to me than anyone i’ve ever met."
36754,Sheldon,"it’s an ical download, she can put it right in her phone. and i thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
45736,Sheldon,i’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
41395,Sheldon,i’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
34673,Sheldon,"no, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree. "
41761,Sheldon,"no. you’re my friend, and, i’m sorry."
36127,Sheldon,did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? another fascinating example is the epaulet.
42729,Sheldon,"oh, no, i’m not going to drink it. i just wanted to hear the pop. yeah, i knew it was coming. still scary."
39366,Sheldon,"fighting for our friendship. as peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. i’m not going to let that end here tonight. now put down that drink, let’s meet brent spiner and go home."
45408,Sheldon,thank you for making me tea.
35188,Sheldon,you tell people i’m a rocket scientist?
38661,Sheldon,perhaps two. i’d like to master the craft.
37347,Sheldon,your cell phone was off.
42810,Sheldon,when i’m not home.
44659,Sheldon,what are you doing down there?
37004,Sheldon,"i need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  penny.."
40147,Sheldon,"clever, but also wrong. no, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. that way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. triple threat. like three-bean salad."
39675,Sheldon,"well, that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it."
41013,Sheldon,"well put. you know, i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running."
35890,Sheldon,because?
43242,Sheldon,"oh, wait. no. how about we split the difference and discuss why austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
39314,Sheldon,"yeah, i actually have information about raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
45089,Sheldon,"oh, that’s a paradox. i mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
42037,Sheldon,get? hang on. i don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
36805,Sheldon,"not technically. in hinduism, cattle are thought to be like god."
38420,Sheldon,hello.
39631,Sheldon,"seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
41927,Sheldon,how do i know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
40476,Sheldon,could you? that would solve everything. you are the best. i’ll see you at dinner tonight?
36570,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43529,Sheldon,we blew up feynman’s van.
40701,Sheldon,"so does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup."
43315,Sheldon,"maybe they’ll be best friends. one of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. sound familiar?"
41582,Sheldon,"hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
35862,Sheldon,"well, stephanie, since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, i guess i’ll just have to pick it up. have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
35333,Sheldon,until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends. 
37380,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i don’t work here.
41807,Sheldon,"every year. i told you, wear a diaper."
39161,Sheldon,"i must say, amy, i was very impressed to see that bernadette got her phd."
34193,Sheldon,"well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves. "
45619,Sheldon,"penny! penny, i’m hungry. "
38549,Sheldon,does it? a happy accident.
36350,Sheldon,"thank you. you hear any union talk, you let me know."
40037,Sheldon,"look, it was actually designed for my vintage mr spock action figure."
34216,Sheldon,"two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
41210,Sheldon,no!
41780,Sheldon,where are you going?
45132,Sheldon,"oh, it’s fine. you needed a suitcase, i wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase."
41421,Sheldon,"mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
44324,Sheldon,you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
38129,Sheldon,"is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
42334,Sheldon,your hair is different. you changed your hair. i can’t take this. i’m out.
41687,Sheldon,texas.
44720,Sheldon,don’t get me all randy. guests are on the way.
35126,Sheldon,what’s the exchange rate.
38034,Sheldon,there being no objections…
44857,Sheldon,"well, aren’t you a peach."
39679,Sheldon,"no, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
37126,Sheldon,"research journal, entry one. i’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching penny physics. i’m calling it project gorilla."
40637,Sheldon,a christmas gift? you know i don’t enjoy christmas.
34350,Sheldon,"granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny’s quality of life."
42079,Sheldon,"no, that’s not it."
39542,Sheldon,"nonsense. no. lovey-dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. no. lovey-dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which i’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. isn’t that right, ld?  no. where are you going? come back, lovey-dovey! this is your home now! i already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of amazon! he’s gone."
40375,Sheldon,"bueno, mi amigo."
42168,Sheldon,"you know what this is? yeah, and i reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. this is malarkey."
43702,Sheldon,yeah. you don’t have to tell me.
38143,Sheldon,"as per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. quite frankly, i don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. go on, amy."
41838,Sheldon,"bring it home, mufasa. eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
39119,Sheldon,"well, that’s it then. i’m dead."
41075,Sheldon,the same way any normal person would. i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldon-face confetti.
45433,Sheldon,she’s younger and far more attractive than he is. they’re copying you two.
41092,Sheldon,"well, whatever we want. hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
44456,Sheldon,"they work for shield, which is a sanctioned department of the u.s. government. do you work for a sanctioned department of the u.s. government?"
36411,Sheldon,"oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed."
41519,Sheldon,"so, what prescription are you getting filled?"
40602,Sheldon,"sadly, yes. amy’s taking me to a memorial service. it’s for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to china."
45267,Sheldon,roofing.
35995,Sheldon,did it when i was four. it’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
34305,Sheldon,hi.
45737,Sheldon,do you have cufflinks?
36470,Sheldon,"you know, i’m given to understand that there is an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems. where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
44219,Sheldon,"so, is that a yes?"
45354,Sheldon,"yeah, that list is strong. like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
38904,Sheldon,can we trust him?
42346,Sheldon," that’s right, good job. hello. uh, you wanted to see me?"
38082,Sheldon,hello. i see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
35235,Sheldon,it depends on what bus you have.
21813,Sheldon,why don’t you let me do this.
35554,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white?"
38818,Sheldon,"yes. must be killing you wondering who. fine, i’ll tell you. stuart from the comic bookstore, barry kripke from the university, penny’s ex-boyfriend zack and tv’s levar burton."
36085,Sheldon,"maintaining five friendships promises to be a herculean task. so, i’m going to have to let one of you go."
44599,Sheldon,"leonard, can i ask you a question?"
37294,Sheldon,wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
40952,Sheldon,how do i get 12-year-old girls excited.
39192,Sheldon,"man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. can you guess what the other is? hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
42213,Sheldon,wow. a death star cake.
39385,Sheldon,"and that reminds me of another saying. you can lead a chicken to crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
37222,Sheldon,i would like a root beer float.
37722,Sheldon,i do. leonard never cooks for me.
42869,Sheldon,he is getting a lot of work done. he had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
44527,Sheldon,"what, you’re not my mother."
40516,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, star trek. and to help us, i’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, mr. levar burton."
34279,Sheldon,hello.
34427,Sheldon,"you know what’s interesting about caves, leonard?"
43614,Sheldon,you don’t have to leave.
38968,Sheldon,"mm, it’s hard to say. i can only speculate based on the data i collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. in that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. oop! out of arrows."
45077,Sheldon,"interesting. the world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh. "
40625,Sheldon,"it pains me to say it, but i think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
43880,Sheldon,you’re back.
42265,Sheldon,how dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
36133,Sheldon,okay.
44433,Sheldon,"well, i suppose turnabout is fair play."
34692,Sheldon,my point.
34988,Sheldon,"pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
29523,Sheldon,"i am a mobile virtual presence device. recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. until such time as i am able to transfer my consciousness, i shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner."
40201,Sheldon,"i’m in hell, leonard. don’t stop."
44210,Sheldon,"i’ll add it right now. oh, baby, it’s addendum time."
44642,Sheldon,oh. bye.
36038,Sheldon,"only 211. don’t worry, in deference to you, i’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
41539,Sheldon,"no, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, i wanted to discuss another matter with you."
36444,Sheldon,"oh, i disagree. stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
36589,Sheldon, penny.
37929,Sheldon,"my mistake. now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. plus or minus eight men."
41933,Sheldon,"which is stronger than ever. this is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was."
36074,Sheldon,"little kid hominids, perhaps.  is this your entire job? your parents must be so proud."
42273,Sheldon,no. the syrup tastes better and i don’t like it.
43426,Sheldon,she broke up with me.
40962,Sheldon,"howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"
39452,Sheldon,science. you wouldn’t understand.
37561,Sheldon,what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
36380,Sheldon,i’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
39437,Sheldon,"please, fright depends on an element of surprise. the simple fact is, because i am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. "
36776,Sheldon,"actually, it turns out i can."
43688,Sheldon,listen to this. i just received an e-mail from wil wheaton. leonard nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. it’s about mr. spock and his impact on our culture.
43117,Sheldon,is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
44051,Sheldon,are you comfortable?
35617,Sheldon,you want to go to pottery barn first?
35477,Sheldon,"i can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my monday pyjamas. penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
35040,Sheldon,"oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
35014,Sheldon,"oh, please. for vulcans, mating, or, if you will, pon farr, it’s an extremely private matter."
38282,Sheldon,"no, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
38932,Sheldon,so my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
38684,Sheldon,it’s the only explanation i can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
41986,Sheldon,"despite what her bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the old testament, they didn’t exist in the middle east until hundreds of years later."
34774,Sheldon,i don’t understand the question.
34490,Sheldon,no.
40683,Sheldon,"i want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. uh, in the past, i’ve reached out to each of you individually, but i believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative t-shirts i have dubbed sheldon cooper’s council of ladies."
41914,Sheldon,that’s not true.
37079,Sheldon,"a requirement for string theory, or m-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. i, myself, led an expedition to the arctic circle in search of said particles. kripke, i found the nozzle! i’m going to kill you!"
41497,Sheldon,no.
41250,Sheldon,i own nine pairs of pants.
35249,Sheldon,i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them. 
35124,Sheldon,dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war. 
35783,Sheldon,"when you understand the laws of physics, penny, anything is possible. and may i add, mwah-ha-ha!"
35918,Sheldon,"oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, kal-el."
45151,Sheldon,"oh, no. it’s not just me. no. the railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
36866,Sheldon,that would probably save us some time.
41532,Sheldon,"no, go ahead, say it. i know what it is. i’ve heard it my whole life. the word’s annoying. go ahead, say it. say it. say i’m annoying."
41118,Sheldon,"but, um, i did have you. and every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on channel 68, and we’d do science together. if it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? you know? instead of a world-class physicist, i could’ve wound up as a hobo. or a surgeon."
39049,Sheldon,what’s he doing here?
39516,Sheldon,"good idea. attention is what birds want.  make a pot of tea, leonard. it’s going to be a long night."
38137,Sheldon,leonard? are you sleeping?
38348,Sheldon,"no, you can’t reprogram people. to james tiberius kirk. "
40875,Sheldon,"okay. amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. dazzle me. go."
42402,Sheldon,oh! it’s not even easter time. this is crazy.
41361,Sheldon,got it.
45698,Sheldon,"i must confess i don’t understand you, president siebert. first you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. here we go again. if there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? i’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. cooper-hofstadter residence. go for cooper."
41427,Sheldon,hmm. you sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
40287,Sheldon,nan
40123,Sheldon,i knew it.
41775,Sheldon,too bad. i’m coming with you.
36630,Sheldon,did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
43476,Sheldon,"oh, of course. wouldn’t want to intrude. this is yours."
35546,Sheldon,"right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.  "
37439,Sheldon,did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? i’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
43355,Sheldon,"oh, good. you’re here. i need your assistance."
44953,Sheldon,amy? wake up.
38900,Sheldon,"this act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. it is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
37637,Sheldon,and let me tell you sleep did not come easily with leonard in the next room singing along with alanis morrisette.
42684,Sheldon,"the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him, and no one else was."
36654,Sheldon,"what’s going on is i was led to believe i was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, i was being fed false data at the hands of wolowitz, koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
39410,Sheldon,"we appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, mother."
37210,Sheldon,that’s a semantically null sentence.
39632,Sheldon,one for good luck. must be the kind of math they do at princeton.
35347,Sheldon,meh. that poster of halle berry’s a little unnerving. 
37100,Sheldon,no. it upsets sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. this is essentially why you have famine in india.
36832,Sheldon,good.
44574,Sheldon,"ow, it does hurt."
38907,Sheldon,stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
35503,Sheldon,right. 22. 
39332,Sheldon,"take it, take it."
40042,Sheldon,fascinating. the only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
42599,Sheldon,"true. sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon."
40647,Sheldon,"wait, wait. svaty vaclav is better known as good king wenceslas from the beloved victorian christmas carol."
38951,Sheldon,ba-dum-bump.
43826,Sheldon,"sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. and he does more things for you than i can even begin to list."
38611,Sheldon,"algorithm. you see, penny, alan turing defined an algorithm…"
43150,Sheldon,"so they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
42661,Sheldon,18 parts per million. and he’s still doing it.
36779,Sheldon,"are you saying that i’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
38222,Sheldon,my sympathies. i am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. can i interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
38123,Sheldon,may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
43667,Sheldon,she said buenas noches. what was he supposed to do?
37792,Sheldon,"oh, let me just get one thing. it’s my backup emergency supply kit. the living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. now, good night. and if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
39567,Sheldon,and unfriend leonard hofstadter.
44400,Sheldon,the hell prawn lunges out of the hot spring. you block it with your shield. do you attack?
35345,Sheldon,"no, that’s fine. i’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. "
40487,Sheldon,"hmm. eat one of your luna bars. very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry."
35257,Sheldon,"i’d love to, but i don’t have tangerine chicken. "
38608,Sheldon,you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
35299,Sheldon,"oh, good lord. why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? "
45584,Sheldon,"oh, hello, amy."
40864,Sheldon,"yeah, i think we should talk about that."
39840,Sheldon,"one time they tried to make richard feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. he went to work in his friend’s biology lab. richard feynman was a famous american physicist, part of the manhattan project."
39671,Sheldon,i’ll say.
43501,Sheldon,it runs on syphilis?
40105,Sheldon,"oh. by all means. when i was a boy, i would polish my mee-maw’s silver. and she would entertain me with stories about growing up in oklahoma. interesting woman. you know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
35679,Sheldon,my hypotheses tend to have that effect.
21824,Sheldon,your room. you may want to repaint. 
41763,Sheldon,it’s an outrage.
42463,Sheldon,if only penny had said that once in a while.
38931,Sheldon,no weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a klingon bat’leth.
39063,Sheldon,"that was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
43595,Sheldon,"yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb."
44787,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
38780,Sheldon,"actually, it’s the three of us."
35460,Sheldon,"it doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure."
42344,Sheldon,it was like the rest of the class wanted ms. mcdonald to forget the quiz.
39703,Sheldon,"and now that i have some wood, i’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
41255,Sheldon,"hmm. a while back, youtube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. i tell people i’m okay with it, but i’m really not."
36324,Sheldon,"that wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and i do not agree to it now."
39349,Sheldon,that was a lovely toast. kudos.
42560,Sheldon,we’re not stopping.
42700,Sheldon,"but the truth is i can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular internet show, and a girlfriend."
36340,Sheldon,camouflaging bald spots. that’s primarily a male concern. perhaps we could expand our market.
34264,Sheldon,"oh, good. then you won’t be disappointed."
42433,Sheldon,or a one. a one is possible.
39989,Sheldon,do you supply the the tennis ball?
34829,Sheldon,is that a relevant factor? 
36999,Sheldon,i want that one.
42097,Sheldon,"oh, how about bill gates meets nikola tesla?"
34968,Sheldon,leonard.
40889,Sheldon,really?
38888,Sheldon,"why hast thou forsaken me, o deity whose existence i doubt?"
42621,Sheldon,i don’t think that’s a good idea.
34403,Sheldon,why would i join you?
35747,Sheldon,what did they say?
39565,Sheldon,"really? you think i care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
38922,Sheldon,"one moment.  i’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
37577,Sheldon,"hang on. it’s a cardigan. i have to button it. oh, no."
41028,Sheldon,"first of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. second, the reason i’m cancelling is because i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman."
36846,Sheldon,i am in every way.
40345,Sheldon,i believe alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the nobel prize. behold.
37692,Sheldon,"well, of course i’m hungry. and as i have no plans to eat with any other team, i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. mm, mm, mm!"
21840,Sheldon,"oh, you did, did you? oh, drat! hoisted by my own spam filter."
39913,Sheldon,"oh, of course you are. feel free to drop by any time."
44602,Sheldon,you don’t shove them. they come with an easy-glide applicator.
34618,Sheldon,coming. 
41009,Sheldon,"raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of leonard like that."
42553,Sheldon,this is a simulation. we have to survive on the supplies we brought.
35845,Sheldon,i’m striking up a casual conversation with you. s’u’up?
43518,Sheldon,"right. archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and i shall move the world."
34407,Sheldon,is the sex starting now?
41004,Sheldon,"well, now, did you also have a dog? because i found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy."
37032,Sheldon,it doesn’t feel like an arm.
42978,Sheldon,that sounds like us. i still don’t understand why you’re upset. you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
42702,Sheldon,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
35356,Sheldon,i can’t tell you.
42822,Sheldon,like a big old baby.
43420,Sheldon,"i see what’s happening. sides are forming. well, if bernadette’s on amy’s team, i pick howard."
37846,Sheldon,"when one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. i’m making english muffins. would you like an english muffin?"
40512,Sheldon,you insulted my woman. i’m here to defend her honour. two! it was two.  wil wheaton! now prepare yourself for what may come.
38878,Sheldon,bippity-boppity-boo.
36094,Sheldon,"oh. this entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. raj, you’re back in. he likes monkeys."
40474,Sheldon,i’ll be right back. feel free to play with yourself.
35531,Sheldon,"here, look, look, i found my missing neutrino."
45491,Sheldon,"it’s okay, i stopped being upset about that. and no, the irony is not lost on me."
37225,Sheldon,all right. there’s a female.
39193,Sheldon,when does a monkey have a trunk?
37825,Sheldon,"one of my best, don’t you think?"
40529,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. i mean, statistically speaking, i’m sure you have something to worry about."
36108,Sheldon,"you know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
38577,Sheldon,"so, your project is more important than mine?"
36874,Sheldon,"thank you. you know, i can buy all these things online. i come here for the personal service."
36766,Sheldon,you said be nice to penny. i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
34919,Sheldon,"howard, i’m sick. "
40981,Sheldon,"control over the information contained in that letter belongs to howard. by happenstance, i came to know it. that doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely."
39181,Sheldon,"as your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. please sign."
44972,Sheldon,intriguing. is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
34529,Sheldon,"my equations, someone’s tampered with my equations. "
41293,Sheldon,i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard.
36276,Sheldon,"yes, i’m still here. where am i going? i’m on a train. now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. hoberman’s sphere. it’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. no, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
42790,Sheldon,"oh, that’s true. i suppose it’s only fair we make compromises."
39921,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
36436,Sheldon,"once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
44367,Sheldon,"oh, come on. roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, i’ve been avoiding these things all my life. and now, because you’re pregnant, you have to."
35902,Sheldon,"oh, hi stephanie."
36449,Sheldon,what are you doing?
37620,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43959,Sheldon,i miss you as well.
44914,Sheldon,what happened to them?
43744,Sheldon,"off the top of my head? uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while i watch daredevil."
40844,Sheldon,"hello, home wrecker."
43650,Sheldon,i’m skippy. skippy cavanaugh.
40754,Sheldon,there’s only one logical explanation. somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
36247,Sheldon,"of course, if skynet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send terminators back posing as actors who have played terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s summer glau from the sarah connor chronicles. no, summer, don’t kill me! i’m pro-robot! ahh!"
42286,Sheldon,don’t be melodramatic. i’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
35854,Sheldon,"you say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth."
34579,Sheldon,"see, people get it. "
43933,Sheldon,"oh. i guess i’m a special boy. you know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a fudgsicle. which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light."
43164,Sheldon,i want more than a picture. i want to go in.
37924,Sheldon,thank you.
43963,Sheldon,"well, why isn’t everyone happy? your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."
36903,Sheldon,"well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. on the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger."
37799,Sheldon,did you once again ignore your check engine light?
44991,Sheldon,hello.
43292,Sheldon,not very.
38490,Sheldon,"to that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare best group costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly leonard as superman."
44502,Sheldon,"oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately."
43367,Sheldon,"no, and i’m confused. it’s been nearly 24 hours. amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now."
38960,Sheldon,"i know. what an elf i would have made. whoo, what do you think you’re doing?"
43210,Sheldon,wonderful. i just finished hanging the lights.
34500,Sheldon,"alright, i’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings, we flank the tennessee volunteers, and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg."
37766,Sheldon,"when i’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. you know the drill. all right, if you’ll excuse me, i am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
35097,Sheldon,then no. 
37530,Sheldon,stop it!
44846,Sheldon,who’s trying to seduce you? after a long day i always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
44506,Sheldon,hello.
37631,Sheldon, penny.
34299,Sheldon,they’re both curry based cuisines.
39487,Sheldon,"leonard, i was just mentioning an interesting local news item. now, thanks to you, i’m worried amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
42594,Sheldon,"no, i’d look silly in that helmet."
41063,Sheldon,dumplings? don’t you understand what’s going on here?
35481,Sheldon,no she doesn’t.
43993,Sheldon,"i have empathy. watch. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him."
37984,Sheldon,we’ll never know.
34283,Sheldon,it’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
42092,Sheldon,"oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface."
38791,Sheldon,wait! leonard! wait! what am i going to do for dinner?
35432,Sheldon,balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
42094,Sheldon,"i know. as hard as this is, i have to move on. i can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. i have needs, too."
41297,Sheldon,i hear a woman’s voice.
42595,Sheldon,"oh, this day just keeps getting better."
43006,Sheldon,who do you think made the french toast with butter and syrup?
34962,Sheldon,"you can count on us, we’re on it. what the hell do you mean, dead end. "
43311,Sheldon,"yes, it’s a robot uprising. call the police."
39930,Sheldon,hello. i’m here for my haircut with mr. d’onofrio.
35436,Sheldon,"captain, i’m getting an unusual reading."
43985,Sheldon,very well. stuart.
44313,Sheldon,"oh, uh, never have i ever put my foot in the ocean."
45795,Sheldon,perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
42543,Sheldon,miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
45334,Sheldon,"ooh, that sounds fun. now, we’re talking about real treats, right? not bible verses like my mother used to give me."
43090,Sheldon,but it wasn’t my fault. i didn’t exclude him. and i didn’t write the article.
35756,Sheldon,why would you do that?
40815,Sheldon,"there you go again, nag, nag, nag. you’re only proving my point, little lady."
45630,Sheldon,none shall pass. 
43209,Sheldon,i’ll get the blankets. you google how to have childlike fun.
41672,Sheldon,"you’re right, that was uncalled for. i take it back."
39015,Sheldon,"do so, do so."
42319,Sheldon,"at the hot dog stand in the denver train station, heinz ketchup. at the hot dog stand in the salt lake city train station, heinz ketchup. at the hot dog stand in the indianapolis train station?"
34555,Sheldon,"you know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. "
42292,Sheldon,"leonard, i am overwhelmed. everything is changing and it’s simply too much. i need to get away and think."
38157,Sheldon,wait. what?
44494,Sheldon,okay. do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
44007,Sheldon,"all right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. and to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative t-shirts."
45670,Sheldon,"i have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, i will wait for you to finish your current conversation. what are you talking about?"
40622,Sheldon,"i’m surprised to hear that. see, the other day, i was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, i took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
36043,Sheldon,how could i not?
43131,Sheldon,"hey, you already ruined thor, give it a rest."
37540,Sheldon,"it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. for example, why wasn’t william shatner in the new star trek movie?"
37003,Sheldon,"and good evening to you, siam palace. this is sheldon cooper. yeah, i’m going to be dining alone this evening, so i’ll be reducing my usual order. i’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, king rama iv of siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of europe in order to preserve his throne. surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
40814,Sheldon,"yes, and i have a theory why. because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. i think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman."
44471,Sheldon,"wu-wu, what? that’s what i called you till i got to know you better."
36400,Sheldon,"did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
38050,Sheldon,clowder.
44423,Sheldon,"oh, easy, bill nye the science guy."
45276,Sheldon,"well, that’s been my room since before i met leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. and that someone else is not me. and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me. "
45525,Sheldon,"yes. i may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but i still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, i’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too."
45170,Sheldon,i apologize that it’s so warm in here.
34819,Sheldon,"so, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. "
38591,Sheldon,do you make it with milk or water?
34489,Sheldon,what for?
42361,Sheldon,no one signed up.
37688,Sheldon,i was talking with penny.
43491,Sheldon,she watched it. i’m gonna get that girl back.
42370,Sheldon,"okay. um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
35529,Sheldon,"in general, yes."
44163,Sheldon,how do you know i’m not using the facilities?
44510,Sheldon,a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa. you’re kind of a sucker.
44340,Sheldon,"apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more."
34562,Sheldon,a halloween party?
36897,Sheldon,"no, no, i understand. anything happened to my mee-maw, i’d be one inconsolable moon pie. i should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
36862,Sheldon,you had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
37115,Sheldon,then speak.
44777,Sheldon,"oh, wait, stop that."
45083,Sheldon,mm. you seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
42754,Sheldon,if you like raisins.
36080,Sheldon,"no, that doesn’t seem any more likely."
35894,Sheldon,"well, why not?"
44134,Sheldon,"nah, she’s a good kid."
40841,Sheldon,"feelings? what am i, a hippie at a love-in? no. the problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that i couldn’t refute."
42150,Sheldon,my mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
41335,Sheldon,"and then leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the los angeles bureau of weights and measures. "
37076,Sheldon,"now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
37714,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, he said, i’m fine, i don’t care. and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
35226,Sheldon,"penny! if i’m going to buy leonard a gift, i’m going to do it right. i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did. "
40590,Sheldon,"a naked man sat on it. now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. what test do you have to detect lipid residue?"
34210,Sheldon,are you still mad about the sperm bank?
43009,Sheldon,i believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
38049,Sheldon,about what?
39594,Sheldon,mutual indemnification always is. why don’t you start perusing while i set up my notary stamp.
35236,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord."
41275,Sheldon,oh.
34542,Sheldon,she’s not that intelligent.
36947,Sheldon,"roll the dice, leonard."
38456,Sheldon,"the supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. if this one under or over-softens, i’ll need time to make things right."
44042,Sheldon,"oh, you are going to love her. she is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. in that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel."
45659,Sheldon,‘cause i sold my soul to the company store.
41154,Sheldon,wait. wait. and says?
43940,Sheldon,i suppose it could end up on a collision course with earth and destroy life as we know it.
37565,Sheldon,"and yet, you can’t speak to women."
40338,Sheldon,half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
39133,Sheldon,"oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  did i say something amusing?"
35342,Sheldon,"sorry, i didn’t mean to offend you. obviously you’re not that familiar with indian cinema. "
35368,Sheldon,bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. if anything they would have said “huzzah!”
38156,Sheldon,uh-huh.
36459,Sheldon,"so, i win."
43107,Sheldon,i spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
41517,Sheldon,"arthur? arthur, it’s me, sheldon cooper. you may not remember because of your advanced age."
40140,Sheldon,"thank you. it just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
35764,Sheldon,"and then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."
45163,Sheldon,"oh. well, i guess it’s fixed."
45625,Sheldon,gentlemen.
45539,Sheldon,"of course. here, here, let me. i’ve been doing a little research on new jersey, and i was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
42004,Sheldon,who was he?
35137,Sheldon,"oh, alright, this is missy, missy this is leonard and rajesh and you’ve already met howard. "
21816,Sheldon,the second barrier. don’t get cocky. this is the bathroom. are you fairly regular?
41022,Sheldon,it’s too late. get ready to like me.
37500,Sheldon,"well, i’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
45791,Sheldon,because i called shotgun. remember?
40223,Sheldon,"whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same."
36495,Sheldon,"no, leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
38829,Sheldon,of course. barry?
43168,Sheldon,"you pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
43170,Sheldon,"all right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
44648,Sheldon,"fine. okay. now, on this side, i am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
44523,Sheldon,"leonard, you and i have our ups and downs. but i have always considered you my family. even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. i don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. both of you. "
44586,Sheldon,"no, i can do this. i just, i just need another energy drink. oh, no."
43358,Sheldon,"amy’s mad at me, and i’m not clear why."
34898,Sheldon,"i need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. here, swab my throat."
35001,Sheldon,curiouser and curiouser. 
41589,Sheldon,"well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
35785,Sheldon,"well, then may i suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."
41524,Sheldon,"that’s strange. that he would come to you for that and not me. oh, i got two emails from him. do you have leonard’s email address? and. never mind, i found it. i can’t believe he picked you over me."
40264,Sheldon,this insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
36056,Sheldon,"too bad. if it’d been a friend, i’m available to fill the void.  it’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
37992,Sheldon,"no, you’re not. pay no attention to that man in the bed."
36619,Sheldon,"comforting is a part of leadership. it’s not a part i care for, but such is my burden."
43216,Sheldon,"wait, no. we haven’t picked a winner."
45509,Sheldon,"i feel so betrayed. you know, all my life i thought uncle sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. turns out he’s the other kind."
34979,Sheldon,"yes. that’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent asian wunderkind. he ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. "
37296,Sheldon,"sheldon’s journal. security system in place. however, sleep continues to elude me. i’ve seen the underbelly of pasadena, this so-called city of roses, and it haunts me. ah, the injustice, i lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing donkey kong on my classic nintendo.  leonard and penny."
43473,Sheldon,"it’s not yours? oh, my. how embarrassing for both of us."
44325,Sheldon,"and yet you get to weigh in. democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?"
38500,Sheldon,i’m not sheldon. i’m the flash. and now i’m going to the grand canyon to scream in frustration. i’m back.
35567,Sheldon,"please, no, nothing so pedestrian. i wanted a griffin."
35641,Sheldon,"is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored humvee?"
41406,Sheldon,that’s true. he collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
35362,Sheldon,penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for leonard. 
41229,Sheldon,my queen can now take your rook from below.
41677,Sheldon,"thank you. ira, if i may, i’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
36345,Sheldon,"excuse me, but was this not your goal? financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? my brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
39321,Sheldon,"should i use the rest room or wait until we get home? come on, papa needs to void his bladder. oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
40620,Sheldon,"uh, i’m going to draw you a soothing bath. where’s your bath thermometer?"
38080,Sheldon,"oh, penny? penny?"
44068,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t think i could do that."
36116,Sheldon,i sincerely hope so.
40974,Sheldon,bleuch. like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
39460,Sheldon,is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
44853,Sheldon,"oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
41142,Sheldon,"ah, that’s my girl."
40716,Sheldon,"actually, i came to speak to mrs. davis."
35239,Sheldon,"yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. "
39143,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll go. just for the record, my aunt ruth died in a hospital. she went in to visit my uncle roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. the two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel."
35377,Sheldon,you’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. mud.
37216,Sheldon,"is that you, raj? i don’t recognize your edge."
36558,Sheldon,perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science.
35709,Sheldon,it’s very simple. this is a  this is c…
40087,Sheldon,oh!
37491,Sheldon,"i also now have three points on a driver’s licence i do not yet possess, and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
38423,Sheldon,"what is the best number? by the way, there’s only one correct answer."
45613,Sheldon,this is very awkward.
41205,Sheldon,"don’t worry, officer. they just love each other. we’re not smuggling drugs."
37847,Sheldon,"fyi, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
39668,Sheldon,no. i think i’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
44971,Sheldon,"no, and also, i don’t want to disappoint you. i, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. i can soldier through this."
39709,Sheldon,i was using the bathroom.
40995,Sheldon,it was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate one-eyed willy.
39377,Sheldon,"good, ’cause i got you everything you need to make it. you are in for a treat. my mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
36692,Sheldon,"you’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
41508,Sheldon,"is it me, or does she not look so good?"
40235,Sheldon,tell him yourself.
43562,Sheldon,"no, what i’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me."
45450,Sheldon,"oh, so many things. her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
43384,Sheldon,it’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
36975,Sheldon,"where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
37945,Sheldon,what i’m doing here is trying to determine when i’m going to die.
36435,Sheldon,"leonard, we need a ruling."
40846,Sheldon,great. kick him out. break his heart. everybody wins.
39461,Sheldon,"great. tropicana, no pulp."
34499,Sheldon,is dr gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
36304,Sheldon,maybe i’d be better off with nancy.
39497,Sheldon,always.
45475,Sheldon,"howard, i’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
42225,Sheldon,"well, until they invent nose condoms, i’m not finding out."
44569,Sheldon,one o’clock? i’m not a raccoon.
44790,Sheldon,"of course there’s, there’s always your apartment."
36494,Sheldon,are you and leonard friends with benefits?
43118,Sheldon,is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist i didn’t correct him?
36839,Sheldon,"in this context, with me means for me."
41922,Sheldon,it doesn’t?
34308,Sheldon,you realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
39645,Sheldon,don’t answer that. it’s a trick question. i speak from experience.
39539,Sheldon,"it’s remarkable. all that time spent in fear. and for what? he’s magnificent. oh, dear. i just realized i haven’t offered you a beverage."
43040,Sheldon,"oh, good. you’re back."
35346,Sheldon,"now, only if you want to."
41855,Sheldon,"look, i appreciate the effort, but i’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
45444,Sheldon,"that’s a good one. okay, now, leonard, you tell a joke."
37513,Sheldon,"other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
34652,Sheldon,"hmmph, wrong. "
43729,Sheldon,they’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
41436,Sheldon,"yeah, you make a good point. it would appear i was worried for nothing. look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. don’t worry, little moth. the flame will come to you."
34680,Sheldon,it’s halo night.
45297,Sheldon,"i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. boy, you’re good."
39123,Sheldon,"oh, this is a nightmare!"
43451,Sheldon,"yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. all you hear women say is, i’ll just have a salad. you know? where’s my lip gloss? i think this element should be called radium. that last one was madame curie."
44190,Sheldon,couple of questions about the plaque.
40322,Sheldon,"well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. there’s a good deal more to come. i didn’t really hit my academic stride until i cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors."
37467,Sheldon, penny.
43780,Sheldon,mm. your aunt in modesto?
41114,Sheldon,"well, how can you say that? professor proton’s the best."
34238,Sheldon,"in all of them, that is the point."
44410,Sheldon,of course.
44412,Sheldon,"leonard, friends are like toilet paper. it’s good to have extras under the sink."
42243,Sheldon,"i was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. good night."
36491,Sheldon,"okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess."
39472,Sheldon,"oh, god! one, two, three!"
44676,Sheldon,"oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married leonard hofstadter."
38638,Sheldon,excuse me. we’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
39356,Sheldon,"as a child, i loved wesley crusher, wil wheaton’s character on star trek. so, i drove for hours by bus to a star trek convention at which wil wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that i could get my wesley crusher action figure signed. but he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on hollywood squares. oh, damn! the floppy failed. well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the verbatim corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
44873,Sheldon,i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
42868,Sheldon,i know. it’s replaced godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
38435,Sheldon,who?
36319,Sheldon,"that’s 4.9 penny blossoms per hour. based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day."
40572,Sheldon,"oh. you said i’m not using my space, so i’m using it."
35151,Sheldon,"fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
35884,Sheldon,it’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
36378,Sheldon,"hang on. are you now or have you ever been a salsa, irish folk or break-dancer?"
38008,Sheldon,"leonard, be serious. we’re playing a game here."
45531,Sheldon,"no, but you are, so i got you this as a present."
37290,Sheldon, leonard and penny!
39866,Sheldon,"oh, dear. "
36027,Sheldon,"it is also indigenous to brazil, as is the cocoa bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. and you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
38115,Sheldon,"well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
34293,Sheldon,"don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone."
45301,Sheldon,"beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy, in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship."
36293,Sheldon,excuse me.
34672,Sheldon,"he’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
40579,Sheldon,"oh, preposterous. i have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, i have changed the way we think about bose-einstein condensates, and i am also the one who got nutter butters in the cafeteria vending machine. maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have work to do."
41350,Sheldon,really? the only time i’m ever picked first for a team and i’m stuck with the liability?
40737,Sheldon,mr. data’s weapon is his mind. i’m wielding it.
34751,Sheldon,"no, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. "
45662,Sheldon,"you set it on dts, didn’t you?"
21859,Sheldon,not correctly.
41432,Sheldon,"if it makes you feel any better, amy and i are fine. i mean, really good."
36036,Sheldon,"yeah, i agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. but, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best i can do."
40111,Sheldon,what are you all staring at? didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with stephen hawking before?
41494,Sheldon,there’s nothing happy about it. i’m being given credit that i don’t deserve. 
36747,Sheldon,"hmm. oh, who cares?"
43059,Sheldon,so you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
35730,Sheldon,just one more bite.
43435,Sheldon,"yeah. i know. turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. i blame madonna."
40298,Sheldon,"my point is i don’t like when things change. so, regardless of your feelings, i would like you to continue dating leonard. and also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. i’m not comfortable with the new scent. please stop this madness and go back to green apple."
38269,Sheldon,you used my toothbrush?
42835,Sheldon,done.
39941,Sheldon,i’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
34631,Sheldon,"why? oh, penny, penny, penny."
43437,Sheldon,he does? who is it?
39755,Sheldon,und dis is sheldon cooper presents fun…
35395,Sheldon,alone?
43162,Sheldon,there it is. it’s just a gate. on a road.
37517,Sheldon,i found it. the ring is mine. i don’t understand why in this group i never get my way.
34624,Sheldon,"oh, what fresh hell is this?"
39891,Sheldon,"oh, my. president siebert, i don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. if you’re interested, i can send you a link to a youtube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
41977,Sheldon,i take it back. i’m scared of turbulence!
39914,Sheldon,yeah. call first. 
36058,Sheldon,i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
44203,Sheldon,i wonder what they’re talking about.
45372,Sheldon,"well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
34344,Sheldon,"no,  that’s ridiculous."
36651,Sheldon, penny.
42401,Sheldon,laminate the core material.
44671,Sheldon,fine.
39334,Sheldon,"oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, leonard. i’m so sorry."
36266,Sheldon,penny would have to go into my room.
38921,Sheldon,fine. leonard?
41968,Sheldon,i have to go to the bathroom.
45757,Sheldon,"i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and i’d like to tell you why i should be chosen to go to mars. i’m exceedingly smart. i graduated college at 14. while my brother was getting an std i was getting a phd. penicillin can’t take this away. being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. in fact, animals don’t trust me because i smell like nothing. literally nothing. during the seven-month space flight, i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. hey, leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
41638,Sheldon,but none of you know what this is like. being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
41338,Sheldon,think of me when you apply it.
44096,Sheldon,"yeah, you know what’s not normal? blubbering about emotions during a flag show. unless that emotion is excitement over new zealand changing their flag. yeah, good luck, you crazy kiwis, we’re rooting for you."
35594,Sheldon,"typically that’s an indicator. to, you know, check your engine."
44213,Sheldon,you’re tying my hands here.
42446,Sheldon,hello.
34987,Sheldon,are you sure? 
34893,Sheldon,"think woman, who blew their nose and when? "
36508,Sheldon,penny.
34543,Sheldon,she got lucky.
45776,Sheldon,"land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
35960,Sheldon,it is a big whoop. it made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
36149,Sheldon,darn. i can’t seem to get the hang of that.
40595,Sheldon,is anyone else troubled by the spider-man theme song?
37940,Sheldon,curses.
44761,Sheldon,"why would she keep something from me, you know? i shared my body with that woman. and my netflix password. they recommended stella got her groove back because of her."
40242,Sheldon,w-where are you going?
37776,Sheldon,hello.
41701,Sheldon,doesn’t matter. this is no way to make new humans. people coming out of people. it’s some kind of dirty magic show.
41152,Sheldon,"yeah, uh, wait. doesn’t he say something first? you know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
38797,Sheldon,"and be a social pariah? oh, you know that’s not my style."
39365,Sheldon,"yeah, even that. you look like a dork."
39102,Sheldon,"the fun thing about prince joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself."
38453,Sheldon,i think i’ll eat my lunch at home.
37983,Sheldon,i am doing it.
37599,Sheldon,i’m getting dizzy.
43718,Sheldon,no. you went pfft. what does pfft mean?
39036,Sheldon,"no, thank you, but for the record, i’m an excellent dancer. proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
35624,Sheldon,we have to stop at pottery barn.
40802,Sheldon,fine.
40309,Sheldon,do you remember how upset i was when they replaced edward norton as the hulk?
44993,Sheldon,"yeah. it is good to be home. oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
39124,Sheldon,"to the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. gang way! dead man walking!"
35185,Sheldon,"well, she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. "
40191,Sheldon,"no, i’m having a relationship problem with amy. and by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
40827,Sheldon,"uh, suppose i’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. what a task that will be. do you know how uncivilized leonard was when i took him in?"
37161,Sheldon,"oh, yes. we had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable santa claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. and to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
34677,Sheldon,no.
34242,Sheldon,"in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, i could go on, but i think i’ve made my point. "
42768,Sheldon,"oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play lord of the rings risk."
37404,Sheldon,"round two, leonard hofstadter, darth vader, rupert murdoch."
39757,Sheldon,emergency preparedness drill.
43307,Sheldon,that’s what my train used to do.
35588,Sheldon,"but i don’t drive, and i can’t take the bus."
43044,Sheldon,"okay. that was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
39959,Sheldon,you’re right. i should embrace the chaos.
43659,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. see, you’re getting it."
36424,Sheldon,"amazing spider-man, ultimate spider-man, spectacular spider-man, the marvelous adventures of spider-man, spider-man 2099?"
44338,Sheldon,"meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting."
40336,Sheldon,"oh, in fact, she has. uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?"
39456,Sheldon,"all right. so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. probably won’t be relying on seuss here. although one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish might be surprisingly applicable. go on."
38610,Sheldon,bored.
42415,Sheldon,"i wasn’t making a joke, i was merely stating fact. amy and i have a superior relationship to yours."
44840,Sheldon,i don’t understand. i thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
37652,Sheldon,"oh, yes? well, before i respond, let me ask you a question. is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
40463,Sheldon,"yes, congratulations. you won fair and square. uh, very impressive, sir."
21838,Sheldon,did it occur to you that was by design?
35584,Sheldon,"don’t talk to me like i’m a child. now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
36641,Sheldon,"you fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
40110,Sheldon,and you want me to return it for you?
45308,Sheldon,"penny would be the entree. then leonard’s basically a cheese course. and because i love you, you’re dessert."
41383,Sheldon,"story problem? you, oh, amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. raiders of the lost ark is the love child of steven spielberg and george lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. i’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which i can only watch when it’s still light out, but, i defy you to find a story problem. here’s my jaw, drop it."
41018,Sheldon,well…
35117,Sheldon,"in addition, your premise is flawed. in the original film, rod taylor got yvette mimeaux with that very time machine. in back to the future, marty mcfly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. "
45769,Sheldon,who lives in a pineapple. nope.
36069,Sheldon,"mmhmm. mmhmm. it’s interesting. but isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? yeah? tell me another interest of yours. hmmm. is there any chance you like monkeys? what is wrong with you? everybody likes monkeys. hang on, kripke.  a loop counter? and an escape to the least objectionable activity! howard, that’s brilliant! i’m surprised you saw that."
45420,Sheldon,"oh, and do you remember what you said?"
35933,Sheldon,"at least take this with you. look, and have stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. this states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
45403,Sheldon,"oh, thank goodness."
42376,Sheldon,"oh, i’m working on my lesson plan for wolowitz. he is going to be so lost. look at this section over here. even i don’t really understand it."
44780,Sheldon,how could you lie to me?
38836,Sheldon,"of course it did. it’s said that archimedes, the ancient greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
45291,Sheldon,how come he can say it and i can’t?
21799,Sheldon,are you asking me or telling me?
37522,Sheldon,you mean this ring? next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
34408,Sheldon,"oh, okay, well then, calm down."
42252,Sheldon,you’re right. i’ll take that out.
43092,Sheldon,"for the record, that kid was a terrible choice. if you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule england."
45381,Sheldon,"what? you hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? what happened to our love?"
35860,Sheldon,"you know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb. a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
43909,Sheldon,"oh. uh, uh, she liked it fine. but she doesn’t have the history with the franchise i do."
40715,Sheldon,"well, hello."
44343,Sheldon,wait. you were pretending?
40267,Sheldon,sweaty? unhygienic? looks dumb? take your pick.
37860,Sheldon,"i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
36103,Sheldon,why?
41996,Sheldon,"yeah, maybe you better, i took a pretty big sip."
41695,Sheldon,that’s so thoughtful. you guys are the best.
42085,Sheldon,"i said leonard, you said no."
34734,Sheldon,the resemblance is remarkable. i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. 
44653,Sheldon,although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
39747,Sheldon,"careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s who con."
37311,Sheldon,i am moving on. i’m going to be a bozite.
34386,Sheldon,"uh, let me ask you this. when i learn that i’m a robot, would i be bound by asimov’s three laws of robotics?"
35020,Sheldon,"i don’t. teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
44600,Sheldon,"howard, can i ask you a question?"
44759,Sheldon,"her behaviour. no, i have the feeling that she’s hiding something."
44807,Sheldon,exactly.
44609,Sheldon,"we, we really appreciate it."
35274,Sheldon,"draft. you see people hear the word year and they think duration. foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
39022,Sheldon,no.
45362,Sheldon,run down the pros and cons of each for me.
39065,Sheldon,20 seconds.
43606,Sheldon,you’re forgetting something. ladies love jocks.
43252,Sheldon,"uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask leonard for advice about this?"
43787,Sheldon,all right.
40423,Sheldon,"hold that thought! professor hawking has made a move. boy, oh, boy. oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. i’ll be coop. he’ll be wheels. if he’s okay with that. "
35288,Sheldon,"ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. "
44240,Sheldon,"oh. uh, no, no, no, thank you."
41624,Sheldon,she’s so tiny. it’s funny when she’s mad.
43171,Sheldon,"i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. so what’s the plan?"
40369,Sheldon,ah. so it is. i guess we both share blame on this one.
44148,Sheldon,"when i was six, they told me batman was coming to my party. i waited by the door for hours. closest thing to batman i saw was when a robin flew into the window."
42162,Sheldon,"i don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, i’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. again, no offence."
40217,Sheldon,i think the reverend hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
40700,Sheldon,"yeah, you and me both, sister. now, please understand, i don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. but during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may i suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? let’s see here. oh, yes. check out this oozy doozy."
38703,Sheldon,why?
38783,Sheldon,"buona sera, luigi’s pizza. buona sera. it means good evening in italian. may i say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
39772,Sheldon,"think carefully here. clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘sup?"
42747,Sheldon,"yes. maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
41329,Sheldon,yes. you’re either with me or against me.
36084,Sheldon,"oh yes, i pass out all the time. but, it was worth it. i’ve made substantial progress in bonding with kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
43510,Sheldon,you can never be too careful. i got one last year before i went to epcot.
37896,Sheldon,huh. it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
42012,Sheldon,i’m a grown man.
36982,Sheldon,irrelevant. the disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
37726,Sheldon,i got lost.
42939,Sheldon,"uh, barry, uh, how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
38720,Sheldon,"don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
39805,Sheldon,"really? huh! okay. in that case, i will have a s’more by myself. and then i’m gonna have s’more. by myself."
35889,Sheldon,"again, urban slang. in which, i believe i’m gaining remarkable fluency. so, what is the down and the low? and don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
34425,Sheldon,"no, congratulations will have been in order. you know, i’m not going to enjoy this party."
35523,Sheldon,hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
38804,Sheldon,"wonderful. dinner, some assembly required."
45082,Sheldon,"oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting leonard in as is condition."
42076,Sheldon,why would you do that? you’re a string theorist as well.
42020,Sheldon,hello.
36226,Sheldon,she can’t shoot me. she’s dead.
43886,Sheldon,"thank you, arthur. you are the wisest of the wise."
36288,Sheldon,– because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
39364,Sheldon,"i did, but i think i’ve kind of outgrown star trek. you know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. what a load of hooey."
42260,Sheldon,move across the hall? did you take a marijuana?
42226,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. i went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. do you see anything on my forehead that i should be concerned about?"
40078,Sheldon,and you never answered me. so who owes whom an apology now?
37281,Sheldon,i see you’re drinking wine.
34594,Sheldon,neeeeeooooowwwwww!
40415,Sheldon,i should’ve picked hickey.
43589,Sheldon,"you know, when my honour is insulted, and i need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
39864,Sheldon,"it’s not. i’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
41918,Sheldon,excuse me. i have to break up with my girlfriend.
41235,Sheldon,are you in danger?
34687,Sheldon,"okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
37938,Sheldon,"in these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?"
44391,Sheldon,"and last but not least, this is one that i like to call star wars toast because it has a light side and a dark side. all righty, it’s time for dungeons & dragons."
40046,Sheldon,to be played with.
37023,Sheldon,"that doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if i’m driving."
41644,Sheldon,"oh, nonsense, wil. your endless tweets are not that bad."
34702,Sheldon,it says keep this on your person at all times.  it’s right here under batman’s signature.
35671,Sheldon,i do eat dinner.
45592,Sheldon,bye.
44370,Sheldon,"you know, it’s like how i play warlords of ka’a with you and elder sign with frank and alicia."
39227,Sheldon,what are you doing?
37718,Sheldon,no.
40019,Sheldon,"i think i understand. you’re the one person who can say sheldon cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. i forget what i bring to the party and what i take away when i leave. please accept these valuable cooper coupons as restitution."
38094,Sheldon,one question.
35275,Sheldon,it’s a common mistake.
43199,Sheldon,"i don’t know the future. do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth, destroying feynman’s house and everyone in it?"
42585,Sheldon,"oh, god. don’t make it so hard on her. look, the first someone is the deceitful you. the second someone is the delightful dr. lorvis."
42105,Sheldon,"let me put this in a way you’ll understand, penny. you remember how you explained to me that the kardashians aren’t real celebrities? well, geology is the kardashians of science."
35329,Sheldon,"not necessarily. this is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., i’m moving out because i’m moving out. "
35606,Sheldon,"well, i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, i’m not sure i’m capable of performing diagnostics."
34660,Sheldon,"okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
44396,Sheldon,"i think you’re gonna like a lot of things i have in store. for example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs."
40825,Sheldon,one star trek: the next generation phaser. that’s leonard’s.
36974,Sheldon,"i have a few questions. first, i notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
35712,Sheldon,"never, that’s the problem. i need your help."
38284,Sheldon,i suppose i could if i were asked.
37695,Sheldon,"certainly. it’s not like i have to moderate my food intake because i’m planning on eating again very shortly. mm, mm, mm!"
37997,Sheldon,section 74.c. the various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
44563,Sheldon,why? it clearly doesn’t work.
40848,Sheldon,"hold on. if you don’t want to live with leonard, why don’t you just tell him?"
38707,Sheldon,"mommy, why are you crying? ‘cause i’m gonna miss you, shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
41499,Sheldon,"and no woos. oh, not you, dr. woo. you’re fine. i want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. my so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. it was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. so please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
36530,Sheldon,you’re not going to answer it?
45229,Sheldon,he sounds like a sociopath.
35908,Sheldon,"no, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. this is something i long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. open it. "
43441,Sheldon,"oh, you’re right. i could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with leonard."
39354,Sheldon,you just got off the list. would you like back on it? this’ll just take a moment. it’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
44598,Sheldon,i thought i didn’t have a problem.
35929,Sheldon,"that being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
21801,Sheldon,correct. you’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. you may enter.
42854,Sheldon,"you guys are the worst. thank you, i think that was helpful."
34766,Sheldon,and i forbid it. 
35722,Sheldon,who’s nowitzki?
43971,Sheldon,i asked for chicken noodle. this is chicken and stars. it’s killing me.
38064,Sheldon,aw. what is she doing here?
44794,Sheldon,"i’m not a child, don’t do that."
39753,Sheldon,kripke.
41868,Sheldon,how many trains have you been on?
38433,Sheldon,localized to what region?
34261,Sheldon,point taken. it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. 
44589,Sheldon,"no, i know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. i mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, pringles. you know once one pops one just can’t stop."
45225,Sheldon,"well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. you couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
42062,Sheldon,you know i only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
39663,Sheldon,what if they simply don’t excite me?
41629,Sheldon,i just vomited on a lot of clowns.
39553,Sheldon,where’s stuart?
41171,Sheldon,i erotically caress your  nose.
43464,Sheldon,why not?
34842,Sheldon,remember how leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
40135,Sheldon,"what, why not?"
35104,Sheldon,"again, time machine. "
43278,Sheldon,all i see is a black screen. and my own reflection. i look sad.
45392,Sheldon,that’s it. i’m in breach of my security clearance. i’m going to prison. and you know what happens to people like me in prison. i’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
35068,Sheldon,i don’t understand the question. 
37246,Sheldon,"you know, i had never considered that. wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. well, it’s late."
45412,Sheldon,great. now mandarin.
44785,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
44651,Sheldon,"now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
36277,Sheldon,that’s the wrong box. put it back.
42380,Sheldon,leonard?
38288,Sheldon,and here is my justice league membership card. but that doesn’t prove i know batman.
35510,Sheldon,"oh yes, it’s quite extensive. but if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
43327,Sheldon,tell her about the uranium. tell her about the uranium.
43000,Sheldon,"oh, i didn’t think of iron man. you know, maybe after myself and i have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert."
38581,Sheldon,leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. and his app team.
42879,Sheldon,"i knew you’d understand, armadillo isaac newton."
45455,Sheldon,i’m trying to shoot.
37906,Sheldon,hurry. we’re going to be late.
36207,Sheldon,"you claim it’s going to be a week, but i have no faith in your dry cleaner."
37700,Sheldon,i can’t think of a reason why not.
40666,Sheldon,"you can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. i get right up in santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old saint nick, we meet again. yeah, i believe the last time we spoke was in the baybrook mall in galveston, texas, when i was five years old, isn’t that right?"
38095,Sheldon,why on earth are you telling me all this?
40639,Sheldon,"actually that helps, thank you."
39202,Sheldon,what does it look like?
42121,Sheldon,not really. i had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
45743,Sheldon,"penny, it’s your lucky day. three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. grab your keys."
38447,Sheldon,star trek. did you see star trek: the motion picture?
36450,Sheldon,isn’t it a little late for coffee?
44982,Sheldon,five minutes? we must be doing it wrong. it took us hours.
44940,Sheldon,this is the level you’re stooping to.
41570,Sheldon,i said i would.
37187,Sheldon,i didn’t make tea for you. this is my tea.
36581,Sheldon,yes.
37185,Sheldon, leonard?
45218,Sheldon,"oh. oh, i’m sorry. correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – that better?"
42339,Sheldon,"i recently read that during world war two, joseph stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas."
45811,Sheldon,"raj, be a lamb and open the door for me."
42104,Sheldon,"oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. why do we have a geology book? leonard, did you throw a children’s party while i was in texas?"
44673,Sheldon,does stephen hawking roll through the quad?
42556,Sheldon,"some york peppermint patties, a couple of dr. peppers, and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show called hannah montana."
36335,Sheldon,"oh, great. raj, why don’t you and howard go get the charcoal? leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary web site designs. i’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
38565,Sheldon,"except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex."
45565,Sheldon,"and get this, i saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
35193,Sheldon,"he can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant. "
34569,Sheldon,"i don’t care if anybody gets it, i’m going as the doppler effect. "
43588,Sheldon,i’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
44675,Sheldon,i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
37511,Sheldon,"if you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by sauron in mount doom, i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
45183,Sheldon,i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
40060,Sheldon,"my problem is that i don’t want you to break leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. she shook it. we all saw her."
43126,Sheldon,"well said, old chap. i thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. starting today, it’ll go gettysburg address, i have a dream, and what he just said."
45486,Sheldon,"oh, i stopped that, it was dumb. uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
40977,Sheldon,"oh. oh, i’ve got that in spades. ravage me."
42842,Sheldon,thank you.
45273,Sheldon,"if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. raj is in a difficult financial situation, and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it."
43238,Sheldon,"i bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
45375,Sheldon,i’m fine.
44907,Sheldon,let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
40757,Sheldon,"i’ll eat later. right now, i’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics."
39929,Sheldon,"okay. i like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
37394,Sheldon,"rabeliechtli. it means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals. which you will not be celebrating because, a, these festivals occur in the fall, and b, you will not be going to switzerland."
44349,Sheldon,"well, i’ll catch you up. uh, penny is angry at leonard, leonard’s angry at me and penny, i’m angry at leonard and amy, raj is angry at howard, and i’m angry at george r.r. martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for leonard."
39906,Sheldon,five what?
43368,Sheldon,too slow?
40154,Sheldon,"i’m confused. i thought since our reconciliation, i was your friend in this group."
39276,Sheldon,"no. i dislike the sound of the harp. its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think i’m going to experience an episode from my past.  i’m sorry, mommy. don’t be mad at me. don’t do that!"
35961,Sheldon,there are no do-overs in wii bowling.
36803,Sheldon,i was going to say sad. i don’t know why i hedged.
40582,Sheldon,you know what they say? revenge is a dish best served nude.
39386,Sheldon,i don’t know. lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
35130,Sheldon,"it worked. it really worked. they said i was mad, but it worked.  "
42053,Sheldon,bernadette?
34871,Sheldon,"great, what is it?"
43114,Sheldon,"oh, please. i have ideas all day long. reverse seaworld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. a new clothing size between medium and large called marge. snow white retold from the point of view of sneezy. why won’t doc prescribe him something? we finally find out."
45073,Sheldon,"you know what? if you’d like, i could whip up a quick relationship agreement. well, i’m at a spa, i might as well do something relaxing. "
43817,Sheldon,"i feel like i know what song that is, but i can’t put my finger on it.  my country, ’tis of thee. no."
36004,Sheldon,there are boundaries.
37581,Sheldon,it’s only one colour.
37597,Sheldon,"if someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, i think i can face a simple award ceremony."
34730,Sheldon,"forgive me your highness, for i am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
41640,Sheldon,do you have cookies?
44736,Sheldon,do you know what else i love about you?
42711,Sheldon,don’t ask me. i’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
21819,Sheldon,i can’t give you eight. i can give you seven thirty.
39114,Sheldon,my catapult flings my bishop to howard’s queen’s gorilla two.
40351,Sheldon,"welcome aboard, old chum."
39707,Sheldon,leonard?
34390,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve seen that look before. this is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. i don’t know if i can take it. "
40659,Sheldon,since when is eggnog a christmas drink? eggs are available all year ’round. i’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
40112,Sheldon,hello.
37960,Sheldon,it’s a small price to pay.
36206,Sheldon,"excuse me, but the problem is not solved. if your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?"
45472,Sheldon,"for the last time, i am not having a tickle fight with you."
34634,Sheldon,"yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. "
37292,Sheldon,what if someone steals my keys?
36591,Sheldon, penny.
41789,Sheldon,why do you ask?
36917,Sheldon,"if you’re interested, i also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
45460,Sheldon,yay.
35696,Sheldon,he does on wednesdays.
39104,Sheldon,fascinating. what’s in it?
36941,Sheldon,"oh, research lab is more than a game. it’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
35145,Sheldon,so what? i don’t issue invitations to your mother.
45664,Sheldon,"right here. all right, team, open up your practice kits. as the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the cheesecake factory, because apparently i’m “ridiculous,” i’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage casio model 1175 calculator watch i received when i won the earth science medal in 3rd grade. treat it with respect. raj, you will be painting sideburns and a van dyke on a six-inch figurine of legolas the elf. now, remember, a van dyke is a goatee without a moustache. wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, operation. to begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars."
37008,Sheldon,hello.
42375,Sheldon,not now.
34954,Sheldon,"under the sink, yellow tupperware bowl. "
34426,Sheldon,"at the last department party, dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
37238,Sheldon,the dog… koira. the roof… katto. grapes… ryp leet.  one minute. sis  n.
44150,Sheldon,"very well. you may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. but then you owe me big-time."
45004,Sheldon,"all right. this is on you. amy and i are living together in sin, like a couple of new yorkers. now, while you scold us, i’m going to get a knife and a fork. joe may be sloppy, but sheldon’s not."
41105,Sheldon,i am.
38305,Sheldon,who knows? i haven’t watched any scary movies recently. i’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. and it’s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull.
39698,Sheldon,sarcasm?
45138,Sheldon,"hey, uh, bernadette, let’s test this theory. what do you think i’m feeling right now?"
35262,Sheldon,"not necessarily. i’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard. just the other day i discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but i don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  "
45612,Sheldon,okay.
36521,Sheldon,"well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then i spent the night. oh, you’ll be happy to know that i now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
41798,Sheldon,"y, no. i’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and i think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. for example, where is this going? are you two ever getting married? and, if so, where will we all live? have you thought about that?"
37125,Sheldon,"not likely. koko learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
44318,Sheldon,"oh, i haven’t asked it yet."
42945,Sheldon,"i’m being petty? you know barry and i have a professional rivalry. you heard him, he told me to suck eggs. if we were friends, he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant. why are you laughing? did you learn something?"
37141,Sheldon,how can you not know? i just told you. have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
42843,Sheldon,"only do solid research? i come to you for help, and you insult me? i thought the least that you would do would be…"
37431,Sheldon,"i don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, leonard."
35618,Sheldon,"can you drive me to pottery barn?  maybe if i turn off the night-light, i can keep the sheets."
44474,Sheldon,"yeah, and leonard’s mother’s already here."
37941,Sheldon,"well, it’s not that late. you could still go out and look for number 32. good night."
41192,Sheldon,you ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
37775,Sheldon,"oh, good grief. this isn’t about you. coming! now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. so pay attention. years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
34857,Sheldon,"yes, but, he can relapse if penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
38563,Sheldon,"well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? all right, i suppose i’ll go put on my bus pants."
36507,Sheldon,alright. goodnight.
42687,Sheldon,"a little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. oh, i don’t care for this at all. oh, i need to see he’s okay."
38604,Sheldon,"oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
45327,Sheldon,"oh, of course. i’ll get that back. like all my underwear, that notebook says property of sheldon cooper."
40250,Sheldon,copy that. over. 
42780,Sheldon,"well, then, it’s settled?"
34565,Sheldon,anime?
42512,Sheldon,ow. we didn’t vote!
38097,Sheldon,it’s actually british.
44072,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
40525,Sheldon,i just told you.
35623,Sheldon,"hold on, i have one condition."
39688,Sheldon,"thank you. amy, i’d like to apologize. your accomplishment was impressive. and i’m proud of you."
34419,Sheldon,"so, how was your date?"
35689,Sheldon,"yes, i’m close to a breakthrough. ooh, it tickles"
45300,Sheldon,"no, i can’t take all the credit. i spoke with leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
36686,Sheldon,i’m not crazy. my mother had me tested.
35899,Sheldon,"so, have you and i returned to a social equilibrium?"
41180,Sheldon,"i’m not afraid to be alone. on land. on the sea, it would be terrifying. because of all the drowning."
42455,Sheldon,yes.
39433,Sheldon,"and reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative i comma zero, and there we have it. conclusive proof that i am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
38801,Sheldon,"excuse me. before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
35402,Sheldon,"leslie winkle. of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be leslie winkle?"
35380,Sheldon,"hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
34821,Sheldon, leonard…
36432,Sheldon,why would i gamble? it’s mine. let go.
34644,Sheldon,where do i begin? 
42451,Sheldon,"for starters, they shed and bite."
35660,Sheldon,homo novus doesn’t know.
38525,Sheldon,"no. the two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, i’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. i’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. i agree to be part of your project. congratulations."
37376,Sheldon,of course.
21800,Sheldon,"all right, next question. kirk or picard?"
42178,Sheldon,"your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t."
44128,Sheldon,"excuse me. hey, how you doin’?"
43248,Sheldon,are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
38511,Sheldon,"obviously, we’re no longer a justice league. we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes."
35530,Sheldon,"oh, there’s my missing neutrino. you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic dickens?"
37573,Sheldon,really? this time of year? it’s a bit nippy.
45245,Sheldon,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comic-con. he’s just doing it to make her happy.
40668,Sheldon,"pop-pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. but you didn’t bring him back, did you? no, instead, i got lincoln logs. well, you can build a lot of neat things out of lincoln logs, but pop-pop ain’t one of ’em. and now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. well, sorry, mr. kringle, but today’s not your day. i’m leaving you here to rot, and i hope the ogres feast on your bones. i take the skeleton key, and i toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, i give santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!"
37463,Sheldon,are you saying that you will not stand beside me as i plead my case?
41808,Sheldon,"it’s live. go, go, go, go, go."
34666,Sheldon,i imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers. 
45651,Sheldon,"i have a bone to pick with you, sir."
43742,Sheldon,"are you sure? i’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person."
34881,Sheldon,don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
36490,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat."
38429,Sheldon,thank you.
37190,Sheldon,what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule known as sheldon alpha five.
38419,Sheldon,that sounds rehearsed. we are not alone.
37660,Sheldon,"thank you, jesus! as my mother would say."
39856,Sheldon,"how’s counting going? when i was in kindergarten, i recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. i think i got this."
40337,Sheldon,"half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?"
38136,Sheldon,thank you.
45779,Sheldon,no.
42649,Sheldon,i suppose that’s true. you’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. i’m going to miss that.
40007,Sheldon,yes. i decided to find a way that i could have this experience and enjoy it.
36216,Sheldon,yes. from szechuan palace.
43125,Sheldon,"yeah, good for you, leonard. that’s a lovely little notion. kind of like, i wish i could talk to my uncle in chicago. yeah, now stand back while i invent the telephone. hello? oh, hold on. leonard, it’s your uncle. he says you just got burned."
34209,Sheldon,bye-bye
34451,Sheldon,"slow down. slow down, please slow down."
42277,Sheldon,so when will you reopen?
44156,Sheldon,oh. thank you.
37104,Sheldon,"don’t sheldon me. we ordered for five people, not six."
35895,Sheldon,"yes, i’m aware of the math, y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
43808,Sheldon,did you have a nice time?
45383,Sheldon,home from work? what time is it?
41088,Sheldon,"very mature. you’re lucky i’m out of silly string. as i was saying, leonard, you’ll never guess who i just found online. professor proton."
34486,Sheldon,it’s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon based life form. 
43723,Sheldon,do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
39798,Sheldon,"but candles? during a blackout? are you mad? that’s a fire hazard. no, pasadena water and power recommends the far safer glow stick."
42671,Sheldon,i do. and i wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and i wasn’t at his bedside to say i told you so.
41058,Sheldon,answer honestly. this is not a trial. that’ll come later.
34995,Sheldon,"uh, huh. so it’s a shelf? "
34318,Sheldon,exactly half.
41062,Sheldon,"well, they can’t cancel it. it ended on a cliffhanger."
42478,Sheldon,"well, don’t feel bad. i think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
42875,Sheldon,"amy, i have gotten more done in the last few days than i have since i made the switch to dark matter. what if i stop doing this, and it all goes away?"
41935,Sheldon,i don’t need to explain myself to you!
36051,Sheldon,"the ice caps are melting leonard. in the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. but you do bring up an interesting point. i don’t have to break new ground here, i’m sure much of the research already exists."
41339,Sheldon,yeah.
38667,Sheldon,i’ll pay you 40 dollars.
44250,Sheldon,just wait.
44170,Sheldon,"aw, amy, that was lovely. you know, this is fun. let’s do more. someone else say something wonderful about me."
37325,Sheldon,unit cell contains two carbon atoms. interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
39793,Sheldon,are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
41340,Sheldon,"i don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
34598,Sheldon,what do you suppose he’s doing here? besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
40606,Sheldon,"you’re sick? you poor kid. well, see ya."
37464,Sheldon,howard?
38777,Sheldon,they went to catalina for the weekend.
37901,Sheldon,wait. you have to drive me.
44143,Sheldon,surprise.
34685,Sheldon,"tonight is halo night, it’s like talking to a wall. "
38188,Sheldon,"excuse me. i object. you propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. for the record, i was going to say your sister priya."
39305,Sheldon,"yes. from here on in, i’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. page 14, item seven."
45350,Sheldon,"name calling, that is perfect. now, when i get to this equation here, really let me have it. you know? if it helps, i’m not the sharpest dresser."
44687,Sheldon,i know. sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
39371,Sheldon,"brent spiner, what have you done? that was an original mint-in-package wesley crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, wil wheaton."
37974,Sheldon,good night. appendicitis. what a nervous nelly.
41174,Sheldon,"yes, he does. he caters to my every whim."
38946,Sheldon,no. we failed in our noble quest.
39039,Sheldon,"no, you most certainly are not."
39041,Sheldon,"waltz. it’s a social dance from austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. "
36242,Sheldon,no.
42387,Sheldon,"ha! i knew it. all right. we have a lot of information to cover before your first test. which, by the way, is in eight minutes. the good news is i’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a c."
37255,Sheldon,"perhaps. perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. for all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
44070,Sheldon,"all right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. now, i realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?"
36032,Sheldon,well i think we’re off to a terrific start.
36960,Sheldon,i can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
38964,Sheldon,she was attempting to engage me in gossip.
39652,Sheldon,"coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. when i was five, billy sparks put a mexican peso up my nose."
45344,Sheldon,"just because i am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive."
34743,Sheldon,what did i do? 
37189,Sheldon,"oh, is it? we’re conversing. checkmate."
37957,Sheldon,a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. no one can hate that.
43960,Sheldon,"oh, hello, everyone. i am happy to report i’m feeling much better."
40506,Sheldon,i’m a callous egomaniac. she’s gonna leave me.
41346,Sheldon,"well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? they might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
36292,Sheldon,this package came while you were at work.
37768,Sheldon,the stock boy at walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
42727,Sheldon,"too bad your show is done. i kind of liked it. leonard, did you hear that? oh, the people are heartbroken. i can’t take this away from the world. fun with flags is back."
44320,Sheldon,"well, we’re only watching game of thrones. a party sub implies it’s a party."
41299,Sheldon,"there’s kissing in star trek, smarty-pants."
42933,Sheldon,then why are you attacking us?
44491,Sheldon,leonard? leonard?
35742,Sheldon,is my hamburger medium well?
34928,Sheldon,then surprise me.  would you call that moss green or forest green? 
45718,Sheldon,i’m not sure how to do this.
39647,Sheldon,"i don’t need to outrun him, i just need to outrun you."
45105,Sheldon,"yes. now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time."
36305,Sheldon,how many of these can you make a day?
35475,Sheldon,i’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
39724,Sheldon,"you have a keen insight into the human heart, amy farrah fowler."
37529,Sheldon,never.
40167,Sheldon,you’re kidding. shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
37233,Sheldon,i thought your father was a gynaecologist. i’m sorry. 
41842,Sheldon,oh. how much does it cost to get them off my lap?
34536,Sheldon,i don’t come into your house and touch your board.
37587,Sheldon,"that’s how you start a psychotherapy session? how am i doing? i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. instead, i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph’s."
42410,Sheldon,"oh. well, then come or don’t. i don’t care."
35717,Sheldon,now! do it!
43299,Sheldon,"very impressive. you know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? it doesn’t make smoke anymore."
35217,Sheldon,"yes, but they have dvd burners over here. leonard needs a dvd burner. "
40331,Sheldon,"hearing unimpaired, good."
44222,Sheldon,the sound is cutting out. i can’t read that. the video is failing.
44231,Sheldon,yeah? did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
37066,Sheldon,"thank you, kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
37425,Sheldon,"oh, but i am. didn’t penny tell you the good news?"
40254,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
45501,Sheldon,"i hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer."
42047,Sheldon,"oh, of course.  did i mention the ps4 controllers light up?"
44344,Sheldon,no. i don’t believe you. i could tell.
38747,Sheldon,"oh, come on! why not?"
42021,Sheldon,i am.
36081,Sheldon,"well, it’s not exactly a plan but i think i’m going to pass out."
43321,Sheldon,"oh, doctor hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again."
35084,Sheldon,i understand why no-one else bid. 
44583,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i am ready to work. to quote the martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. that’s the martian the book and the martian the movie, not marvin the martian. although to quote marvin the martian, i claim this planet in the name of mars."
35757,Sheldon,the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
37979,Sheldon,do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an ipod?
41244,Sheldon,"plus, if i do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
43068,Sheldon,"afterwards, leonard blew his nose, and pie came out."
37789,Sheldon,"well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. it ended as inexplicably as it began. they had very little in common, except for carnal activity. that’s why i acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. if you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the wet wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. they’re in the drawer labelled wet wipes."
36105,Sheldon,"he went to the movies without me. it was the only option. i’m sorry, i don’t understand which social situation this is. could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
45508,Sheldon,"it’s okay, everything’s here."
34516,Sheldon,"semiotics. the study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
35197,Sheldon,"it was obviously effective, leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. perhaps if she’d also denied him christmas he’d be a little better at it. "
41559,Sheldon,"leonard, where are the skee-ball tickets?"
38483,Sheldon,you’re embarrassing yourself.
37408,Sheldon,"yeah, i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. if you need to void your bladder before eating, i can keep them warm with this beret that i thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
38255,Sheldon,and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
38146,Sheldon,"wise decision. you see, amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. leonard has none of these attributes, right, leonard?"
45061,Sheldon,yes.
38155,Sheldon,what does that mean?
39501,Sheldon,"very well. oh, boy. "
36636,Sheldon,"oh, hi mom. no, i told you i’d call you when i got home, i’m not home yet.  alright, i’m home. the arctic expedition was a remarkable success, i’m all but certain there’s a nobel prize in my future. actually, i shouldn’t say that. i’m entirely certain. no, mother, i could not feel your church group praying for my safety. the fact that i’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc. no, i’m not sassing you in eskimo talk."
39158,Sheldon,"bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on leonard’s faulty digestive system?"
35192,Sheldon,"we might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. you’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf."
45452,Sheldon,"based on the glowing reception of our recent behind the flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together. "
37027,Sheldon,all right.
34530,Sheldon,"of course i’m sure. look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed. "
34382,Sheldon,"well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
43256,Sheldon,"well, well, well, did you hear that, howard?"
45238,Sheldon,that’s probably my fault. she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume.
37086,Sheldon,"however, on an unrelated topic, i am never getting out of this bed again."
42174,Sheldon,"yes. actually, i’m glad you’re here. i’m working on the star wars day schedule. now, i have a window built in after phantom menace for complaining, but i’m worried an hour won’t be enough time."
39395,Sheldon,"i’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
39447,Sheldon,be a lamb and check.
41502,Sheldon,i know. when will this nightmare end?
37373,Sheldon,"you’re right. that is more menial. hello, i’m sheldon. i’ll be your server today. i don’t recommend the salmon. i saw it in the kitchen."
38463,Sheldon,what are you suggesting?
37694,Sheldon,"just making dinner conversation. go, team leonard!"
43644,Sheldon,"well, but where does he get the helium?"
42725,Sheldon,it’s not the same thing. i don’t think you know how i feel at all.
39900,Sheldon,rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock was created by internet pioneer sam kass as an improvement on the classic game rock-paper-scissors. all hail sam kass.
42910,Sheldon,"i do, indeed, mr. box-thinking."
38750,Sheldon,what’s going on?
36161,Sheldon,i envy you your childhood.
43184,Sheldon,are you still mad at me?
42039,Sheldon,"yeah, well, it’s true. but the larger size of the xbox one may keep it from overheating."
41917,Sheldon,"no. no, i’ve changed. like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death."
43497,Sheldon,you’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
34836,Sheldon,….. 
34444,Sheldon,i need eggs. four dozen should suffice.
36841,Sheldon,"no, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
40324,Sheldon,"well, if i didn’t think you could handle it, i wouldn’t be asking."
42281,Sheldon,really? it’s soaking wet.
41954,Sheldon,i’m glad because i would not have seen that coming.
43233,Sheldon,hello.
44314,Sheldon,"oh, uh, never have i ever thrown, caught or touched a frisbee."
38568,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i typed that into the label maker, but i just couldn’t press enter. now down to business. what would it take for you to abandon leonard and join me in a rival company? unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
36929,Sheldon,how would you put it?
43369,Sheldon,that’s right. it’s called foreplay. and i could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
37891,Sheldon,"yes, exactly. consequently, if amy and i choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. is your womb available for rental?"
42731,Sheldon,"you told me not to call, and i didn’t know how else to give you the good news. fun with flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
42077,Sheldon,do you think he’s right? am i wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
39006,Sheldon,what?
38081,Sheldon,nothing. i just wanted to make raj stop talking.
45018,Sheldon,i knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
41659,Sheldon,"by taking away my only claim to fame? well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
35166,Sheldon,"you’re out too, by the way."
40400,Sheldon,r2-d2 and c-3po. dibs on threepio.
36977,Sheldon,of course not. i’ll have my usual.
38706,Sheldon,"oh, shelly? a man’s here to take you away to the future. be sure to pack clean underwear."
42426,Sheldon,"no, i’m not. french fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. which is why a curly fry only gets a two. if i wanted curls for dinner, i’d order a clown wig."
40306,Sheldon,"fairy god monster, i win. your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."
36738,Sheldon,"well, i wish i could."
38101,Sheldon,"all right, you’ve made your point. a fine prank, very amusing. now get it out."
42302,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m at the police station. i was robbed. they took my phone, my wallet, my ipad, everything."
45676,Sheldon,i’d be much further along if i’d been allowed to practice.
35735,Sheldon,"excuse me, penny, but we’re…"
40928,Sheldon,"oh, brilliant. i’ve been itching to pull that trigger."
35311,Sheldon,you’re asking me to keep a secret?
35128,Sheldon,you hypocrite!
36650,Sheldon,whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
44137,Sheldon,"wonderful. i’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. if i knew what that meant, i might just do it."
36691,Sheldon,tandoori palace?
36493,Sheldon,fine. i was spock. are you and leonard friends with benefits.
38894,Sheldon,wait a minute! you’re not going to do anything?
44960,Sheldon,"yeah. i’m afraid so. childbirth, looming coitus? this is a banner night for female genitals."
40990,Sheldon,"if i say yes, can we turn off that latin orgy music?"
43324,Sheldon,"beverly, would you like to see the math i worked out to support our hypothesis?"
38414,Sheldon,"uh, we don’t discuss anything. leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement. as such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
36588,Sheldon, penny.
35083,Sheldon,need you ask? but i still don’t understand why no-one else bid. 
39644,Sheldon,"well said, boy wonder."
42011,Sheldon,but i’m a professional scientist.
34534,Sheldon,"uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
44012,Sheldon,"and i want you to know that i mean it, you know? this isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to las vegas."
35994,Sheldon,is it wrong to say i love our killer robot?
42657,Sheldon,you don’t know that.
36736,Sheldon,"yes, yes, the disappointing sex. that’s an inexact parallel. you and leonard can always return to being friends, whereas i can never return to a state in which wolowitz has not bested me like mrs. riley’s chicken."
44625,Sheldon,"of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys. one pair that was neither dating nor living together. one pair that was dating but not living together. one pair that was living together but not dating. and then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. although, with that many sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
43753,Sheldon,someone will show.
44851,Sheldon,everything is stupid and i want to go home.
41723,Sheldon,"looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything i was saying? basically just another day at the office."
43349,Sheldon,"well, one of the things."
43389,Sheldon,strongly disagree. go on.
41043,Sheldon,"okay, because that was not clear."
34910,Sheldon,why? 
40867,Sheldon,do you want to catch up on some walking dead?
39915,Sheldon,professor rothman. this isn’t your office any more. you’re retired.
45076,Sheldon,"do they know it’s there? i mean, should i tell somebody? "
39523,Sheldon,"really? a blazer? all right.  yes, hello. this is dr. sheldon cooper. yeah, i’m at 2311 north robles avenue. yeah, i’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. a blue jay. i’m sorry, this is animal control. i don’t understand the laughter. no, the bird is not in my home. if he was in my home, i obviously would have called 911. sir, i have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. being stuck in a dead-end public service job? or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? or spiders? don’t you think i tried making cat noises?"
41201,Sheldon,"all right, you have to get out of the car right now. i’m not going to jail for you."
36548,Sheldon,you’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
34729,Sheldon,that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess punchali in the book. how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
40300,Sheldon,penny?
34335,Sheldon,no?
41890,Sheldon,"i made a new friend who likes trains as much as i do, uh, i kissed amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. good night."
36704,Sheldon,"i’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. in fact, when i was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
36062,Sheldon,"somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. say, maybe sometime you and i can go see monkeys together. would you like that?"
34783,Sheldon,don’t you ever speak to me again. 
21821,Sheldon,"no, this is my room. people don’t go in my room."
42083,Sheldon,your relationship with leonard?
41452,Sheldon,"well, i do now. they’re a lovely people. although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. if you’re hungry, i brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
36598,Sheldon,is that a yes or a no on the freezer? the woman has the attention span of a gnat.
43675,Sheldon,"anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way."
42639,Sheldon,"yes, for the first five or six years, but i’ve gotten used to it. it helps me sleep. he’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine."
43375,Sheldon,"yeah, shut up, sheldon."
42183,Sheldon,"all those people blowing their noses. you can’t tell the sick from the sad. mm. i’ll be at home celebrating star wars day, as planned."
41248,Sheldon,"well, i have been toying around with an idea for 4d chess."
43105,Sheldon,"well, i’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable."
34949,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m hungry!"
44114,Sheldon,hello.
43645,Sheldon,"uh, but this is violating university code."
34574,Sheldon,it’s 7:05. 
35357,Sheldon,i promised penny. 
43646,Sheldon,"huh. all right, do it. tell him we’re in."
45019,Sheldon,"disagree. we’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in noah and his amazing zoo boat. this could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me."
41077,Sheldon,you don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. to have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
36760,Sheldon,"what am i supposed to do, eat french toast on a monday? now, that would be impossible."
41281,Sheldon,"i’m quite familiar with plumbing. not to brag, but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
41084,Sheldon,and a complete sucker.
44342,Sheldon,i love lisa simpson.
37297,Sheldon,i heard a noise.
44385,Sheldon,melba toast?
37712,Sheldon, here. i had to trade the others for my life.
44968,Sheldon,very well.
42808,Sheldon,"well, what if you did it gradually?"
37426,Sheldon,"yes, that good news."
37339,Sheldon,"oh, all right."
41263,Sheldon,and here’s another interesting weather fact.
39387,Sheldon,get them before they get us.
35678,Sheldon,did you enjoy the humorous footnote where i illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself?
44099,Sheldon,i don’t see why not.
39213,Sheldon,"who said that? leonard, i can hear your voice, but i can’t see you."
43284,Sheldon,"initiating rotation sequence. don’t look at me, initiate. what does red and yellow mean?"
42035,Sheldon,"so, first there was playstation, aka ps1, then ps2, ps3 and now ps4. and that makes sense. you’d think after xbox, there’d be xbox 2. but no, next came xbox 360. hmm? and now, after 360, comes xbox one. why one? maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."
43898,Sheldon,"i see. is that all right? i’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. i’m gonna need verbal consent."
34686,Sheldon,"yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
41295,Sheldon,"oh, really? she and i once had a staring contest. she clapped really loud and made me blink. it’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
39147,Sheldon,"i’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
42146,Sheldon,"and amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
41970,Sheldon,"i realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago."
35056,Sheldon,lamda equals one over pi r squared n 
44060,Sheldon,"here you go, meemaw. i made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
43011,Sheldon,when are we going to get robot eyes?
44223,Sheldon,what?
45179,Sheldon,it’s slowing down.
42887,Sheldon,of course not.
43633,Sheldon,"leonard, if that swedish team beats us, i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. which is a shame, because swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."
38014,Sheldon,"a juvenile amalgamation of our names. sheldon and amy,  shamy."
45585,Sheldon,"i miss you, too. hey, this is good timing. remember that dr. nowitzki i told you about? she’s right here."
39480,Sheldon,can we? stand back while i turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
44011,Sheldon,"you brought me my comic books when i wasn’t feeling well. that, that was thoughtful. and i was insensitive. i’m sorry."
36102,Sheldon,"they’re right, it was the only option."
37679,Sheldon,"or fornication. yeah. but that has judgmental overtones, so i’ll hold that in reserve."
41347,Sheldon,he is a born showman.
35904,Sheldon,i’m helping you with stephanie.
35580,Sheldon,i didn’t. let’s go.
45236,Sheldon,"your father may have spoiled you, but i won’t. if you want a ticket to comic-con, i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
39068,Sheldon,nine.
38580,Sheldon,i’m practicing my theremin.
44553,Sheldon,"not really. but i’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
43274,Sheldon,aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
37672,Sheldon,i was going to get my mail.
38561,Sheldon,"oh, i know. i’m now an independent contractor."
37687,Sheldon,"oh, it’s all right, i do. oh! you’re in for what my mother calls a real eye-talian treat. ."
36452,Sheldon,"i am asserting, in the event that batman’s death proves permanent, that original robin, dick grayson, is the logical successor to the bat cowl."
37147,Sheldon,"there’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? ma equals mg?"
45047,Sheldon,"oh, penny, i’m trying to take an interest in other people. uh, how was your girls’ night?"
42626,Sheldon,yes. so much so that i started to panic.
39765,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you exactly how he did. readiness: unsatisfactory. follows direction: barely. attitude: a little too much. overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day."
39767,Sheldon,"of course i can. it’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, i thought i got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to mexico."
38725,Sheldon,"well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your facebook page."
36017,Sheldon,do it.
40877,Sheldon,"now, amy already has a real harp. and it can play any song. what are you trying to pull here?"
39883,Sheldon,dibs.
38920,Sheldon,sure.
43765,Sheldon,"i am a bit of a unicorn. well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing."
34797,Sheldon,so you admit that you’re an egotist?
41869,Sheldon,wow. your life’s amazing.
39037,Sheldon,i don’t see why that’s surprising. i excel at so many things. you’ve had my sourdough bread.
36777,Sheldon,"there’s just no pleasing you, is there, leonard? you weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of thorndike and b.f. skinner. by this time next week, i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
36217,Sheldon,what? wh-where did my cashew chicken come from?
41784,Sheldon,wow. didn’t see that coming.
39493,Sheldon,"if you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
39218,Sheldon,"give it a second to load. whenever you’re ready, at&t! okay, here we go. this is us here. to the south is professor loomis and the geology department. according to their twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. that’s our edge. all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. all right, let’s move out."
39968,Sheldon,roommate agreement? are you kidding? we are living in a world of chaos. roommate agreement.
35187,Sheldon,really?
38183,Sheldon,i assure you i am quite real and i’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
37659,Sheldon,excuse me. i don’t know who you’re chanting for as i am currently the ball.
41650,Sheldon,you should probably go.
38560,Sheldon,"oh. good morning, shoemaker. i think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
35015,Sheldon,well count me out.
37793,Sheldon,vocal test. morning vocal test. second vocal test. second morning vocal test.
41034,Sheldon,glad.
42251,Sheldon,"you tell me. dear esteemed colleagues, as you may know, i have requested to change my field of study. my decision to do so is, i believe, in the best interest of science. at your convenience, i’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand."
45446,Sheldon,he’s not wrong. it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
36867,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, but i have no interest in playing a game in which i find no challenge."
36405,Sheldon,"good. see how it’s done, leonard?"
39226,Sheldon,what about nebraska?
42902,Sheldon,"we could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."
39217,Sheldon,"all right, this is a google earth view of the field of battle."
39357,Sheldon,"interesting. you see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
44823,Sheldon,"i have such a profound sense of creation. i, it’s like when i hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my dna, so this is like me monkeys. "
42002,Sheldon,"earlier, i came here to surprise you. i looked in the window and i saw you with a man."
43382,Sheldon,"ah, well, very well. so does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?"
45343,Sheldon,"oh, that is much better. yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape."
45186,Sheldon,"well, have a lovely evening."
34343,Sheldon,"evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. if you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
43400,Sheldon,whatever.
44199,Sheldon,excuse me. i’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. don’t need one now.
41609,Sheldon,hah!penny? next.
36634,Sheldon,three months. this is gonna be great!
42427,Sheldon,"not according to the work of berscheid, snyder and omoto."
44294,Sheldon,"okay. well, shall we check each other for ticks?"
44479,Sheldon,"all right, now i’m starting to sense a little tension."
43915,Sheldon,"aw, you always know just what to say after i tell you what to say."
45094,Sheldon,then why didn’t you say that?
45295,Sheldon,i have.
40231,Sheldon,"as i’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature i would even consider being eaten by is the kraken, because the last words i would hear are “release the kraken.” that never gets old. “release the kraken!” oh, chills. besides, i’m having dinner with amy."
35340,Sheldon,"i’m kidding, i packed it. it was a joke, i was subverting the conversational expectations. i believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. "
42918,Sheldon,"hmm. no, not yet."
35296,Sheldon,"interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. "
42256,Sheldon,what do you mean?
38606,Sheldon,"before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership."
36996,Sheldon,don’t flatter yourself. i’m just ignoring you.
42932,Sheldon,professor hawking?
40999,Sheldon,don’t.
37671,Sheldon,uh-oh.
34573,Sheldon,and you said the party starts at seven. 
39771,Sheldon,hold on. are you saying that you want to invoke clause 209?
39578,Sheldon,i believe i do.
37555,Sheldon,am i in trouble? did my mother call you?
42170,Sheldon,"and how do you propose to do that?  unless you have gravity on blu-ray under that skirt, i don’t know where you’re going with this."
42633,Sheldon,still think it’s me.
43405,Sheldon,hello.
37301,Sheldon,would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
37121,Sheldon,"okay, point. what sort of foundation do you have? did you take any science classes in school?"
37967,Sheldon,i have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. i’m nauseated and feverish. i believe i may have cholera.
42197,Sheldon,i know why. you’ve come to me because you’re my obi-wan.
45665,Sheldon,bad leonard.
35060,Sheldon,"well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, i answer the questions."
37484,Sheldon,that’s my spot.
44279,Sheldon,"oh, it’s car air freshener. i was simulating the smell of the forest."
45744,Sheldon,"hey, look. i won."
36653,Sheldon,wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. do you have anything to say for yourself?
40014,Sheldon,"oh, good. hah-hah!"
44246,Sheldon,and i’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
36215,Sheldon,more?
36068,Sheldon,it’s a terrific book. i’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
34578,Sheldon,yes. it’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
35737,Sheldon,"all right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please."
36109,Sheldon,hang on a moment.  here. take some. pay me back when you can.
43696,Sheldon,"i think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. spock came from a planet governed only by logic. you know, on vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, i’m not. you’re moving my arm. to which he says, fascinating. and then you both watch educational television."
40377,Sheldon,"that is true. i have a higher than normal body density. if i run too deep a bath, i drown."
41279,Sheldon,"what, now, do you have company?"
43308,Sheldon,"it is awful, isn’t it? listen to that noise."
44978,Sheldon,"what, a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff? how scandalous. you naughty girl, you went to the wizarding world theme park without me."
39804,Sheldon,"yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
36585,Sheldon,"excellent. and just an fyi, as i am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. but don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
36684,Sheldon,i forgive you. let’s go home.
39773,Sheldon,right here. use your finger.
42880,Sheldon,hey. what are you trying to pull? the president of science isn’t in here.
44533,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i think we are losing sight of the real issue. we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. isn’t that exciting?"
42643,Sheldon,i don’t. i’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
36794,Sheldon,"although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
35811,Sheldon,"all right, will you at least stipulate that star trek iv: the voyage home is inarguably the best?"
40728,Sheldon,but the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. i know i’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. i love the turn-by-turn voice option.
42144,Sheldon,and amy doesn’t look sick.
41898,Sheldon,do you want the long answer or the short answer?
37874,Sheldon,may i buy you a beverage?
39325,Sheldon,fair enough. it’d give you the right to rule a replica of england.
41140,Sheldon,"he does sound effects, too!"
39209,Sheldon,"that sounds like sarcasm, but i’m going to disregard it, because i have an agenda. paintball. specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, i thought we should establish a chain of command. now, it goes without saying that i would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? now, i don’t see me as some four-star general, back at hq riding a desk and playing golf with the secretary of defence. but i also can’t be sergeant cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular joe. this might take some thought. as you were."
36500,Sheldon,is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
43865,Sheldon,hello.
34554,Sheldon,"of course i’m listening. blah blah, hopeless penny delusion, blah blah blah."
35998,Sheldon,"if it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead."
36214,Sheldon,nope.
41637,Sheldon,"look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. you’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."
43996,Sheldon,"hey, we’re both great at this."
42526,Sheldon,now i’ve got room for another thing. what do you want?
41877,Sheldon,the conductor and i have the same pocket watch. 
41226,Sheldon,"by the way, how are you with zippers?"
37026,Sheldon,we should have you checked for a concussion.
41207,Sheldon,"so, did you do that, or am i in the house with an intruder?"
38515,Sheldon,what’s the bad news?
43246,Sheldon,"so, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, i prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
41645,Sheldon,how could you not like getting attention for playing wesley crusher? you were wonderful. a know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. who couldn’t relate to that?
41443,Sheldon,"so, goofing off. as i was saying, i’m done with work and leonard’s not. so good news, you get to take me home. play your cards right, i’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
44610,Sheldon,why are you all smiling like crazy people?
44311,Sheldon,i’m calling it. i won.
34849,Sheldon,"yea, who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee, remember that, it’s important. "
41694,Sheldon,the second i go out of town you throw a christmas party without me? 
39244,Sheldon,"it is. aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. this is a chair worthy of the name."
36462,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, don’t wake her. she’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
37556,Sheldon,"oh, i doubt that. i haven’t figured out a way, and i’m much smarter than all of you."
34889,Sheldon,from the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. all you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. 
35547,Sheldon,now?
36467,Sheldon,i don’t like this game.
35953,Sheldon,for how…
44473,Sheldon,"excuse me, i take care of him."
44398,Sheldon,what do you do?
38668,Sheldon, penny.
43811,Sheldon,"amy, i excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. i think i need to just be your friend."
40484,Sheldon,you’re just repeating what i said. it’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
41713,Sheldon,"oh, thank you. i wasn’t sure i was gonna to make it. but my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and i just thought to myself, sheldon, if you can make it through the green lantern movie, you can make it through this."
38266,Sheldon,i think a more amusing violation of raj’s trust is when howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to americans on thanksgiving.
34459,Sheldon,"uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
34511,Sheldon,"well i assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. an alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. as in, oh look, leonard and lesley made mr and mrs goldfarb, aren’t they adorable. "
42944,Sheldon,"that’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. but that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along."
38446,Sheldon,"a cross we all must bear. you know, in difficult moments like this, i often turn to a force greater than myself."
40765,Sheldon,"there is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. i don’t know where you’re from, but where i’m from, that means i’m not doing okay."
38272,Sheldon,alright. but i’m watching you.
43055,Sheldon,"well, based on your reaction, it looks like i made the right choice. isn’t that right, giuseppe?"
38358,Sheldon,i changed my mind. get out of my spot.
44985,Sheldon,"i was not thinking it. although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
42752,Sheldon,correct.
40252,Sheldon,that’s a negative. my mother had me tested. over. 
40871,Sheldon,"oh, you caught that, did you?"
34236,Sheldon,"oh, come on. who hasn’t seen this differential below “here i sit broken hearted?”"
39758,Sheldon,"yeah, you know how it works. once a quarter, keep our readiness up. now, rise and shine, sleepy head. half the town is probably dead."
40658,Sheldon,"yes. what, is there a problem?"
40903,Sheldon,right. and which one do i want?
39223,Sheldon,"following in the footsteps of kirk, crunch and kangaroo. "
44694,Sheldon,you are truly wise.
35336,Sheldon,this is a very old building. 
38041,Sheldon,"penny, i assure you, i’m fine. my relationship with amy was purely intellectual. there were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. the relationship simply outlived its utility, and i’m continuing on with my life as before."
35982,Sheldon,"here. now, are we friends? colleagues? lovers? are you my grandmother?"
34548,Sheldon,"i won’t go out on a limb, but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger. "
38721,Sheldon,"and so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, i stayed right here and did a load of whites."
44744,Sheldon,and welcome to the first on location episode of dr. sheldon cooper and dr. amy farrah fowler present…
41987,Sheldon,"but if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you."
38584,Sheldon,probably going to have to throw them away.
41328,Sheldon,"careful, amy. the friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy. "
38775,Sheldon,"given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
44677,Sheldon,well i’m open to that.
37108,Sheldon,"yes. leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  while i appreciate the oh, snap, i’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
35727,Sheldon,what a nice girl.
35328,Sheldon,there doesn’t have to be a reason. 
37737,Sheldon,"we had dinner last night. she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. well, little hot dog. i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. a real, big dog. a hell hound. tangential to the primary story. how about i circle back to it?"
43338,Sheldon,do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
43980,Sheldon,"ugh, atlantic city without the taffy? no, thank you."
44812,Sheldon,how much will it hurt?
36700,Sheldon,"under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard, i’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
36213,Sheldon,there’s one more zero. you forgot the time parameter.
43892,Sheldon,it’s kind of spooky.
40685,Sheldon,"well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. let’s call this colleague ricardo shilly-shally."
41393,Sheldon,yes. why?
39638,Sheldon,leonard.
40501,Sheldon,i drink tea all the time. i think i know what i’m doing.
45760,Sheldon,"it’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
38762,Sheldon,"you heard the man, leonard. and while you’re at it, i’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. point of inquiry, given that leonard is your secondary friend and koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?"
43663,Sheldon,"and i’m sorry i lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. although i am currently single, if you know anybody."
38451,Sheldon,"i hadn’t considered that. give me a moment. all right, i’ve considered it."
42622,Sheldon,"according to an online message board, i may be having a panic attack. soccermom09 had similar symptoms. but to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day."
35400,Sheldon,pastries such as bearclaws?
45518,Sheldon,"well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. you and i could spend more time on that."
40985,Sheldon,"oh. yeah, well, i was waylaid by penny, bernadette and amy. they made me reveal confidential information about howard’s father."
39551,Sheldon,"fine. the record shall so reflect. now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
39875,Sheldon,that is your opinion.
45054,Sheldon,you know what? i feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
38090,Sheldon,it’s my office.
39919,Sheldon,is it? listen.
40881,Sheldon,"well, i hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh."
41674,Sheldon,"i have two words for you, jurassic park. this day just keeps getting worse and worse."
34575,Sheldon,so what time does the costume parade start? 
36033,Sheldon,first warning.
34950,Sheldon,i want grilled cheese. 
36514,Sheldon,i suppose we can stay up and talk.
41035,Sheldon,bad. however…
43835,Sheldon,it’s about amy.
39966,Sheldon,penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
41705,Sheldon,"a tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about."
43276,Sheldon,fine. i wonder if they make i told you so cards in braille.
42063,Sheldon,"well, yeah, okay, sure. but which one?"
43520,Sheldon,"ooh, the green lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
40943,Sheldon,exactly. it’s like asking the human torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
38713,Sheldon,"it’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. if you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
39003,Sheldon,i have to skip the chitchat. emergency.
43925,Sheldon,what are you doing?
21814,Sheldon,"last question. in a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
36732,Sheldon,old comic book. i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
36159,Sheldon,aw…
44327,Sheldon,he says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
39956,Sheldon,"leonard, explain it to her."
43539,Sheldon,"i tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in bible study. leonard’s mother is on a book tour. my mee-maw was taking a nap, and after a while siri started repeating her answers."
34307,Sheldon,"you’re kidding, right?"
45674,Sheldon,behind you.
45699,Sheldon,"okay, fine. i’ll tell him. leonard, mrs. latham’s car is here for you."
39940,Sheldon,can you pass the parmesan cheese?
39382,Sheldon,stop yelling! i’m not happy about this.
39535,Sheldon,"no, bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
37950,Sheldon,"but seriously, even if i disregard the uncle carl factor, at best i have 60 years left."
37797,Sheldon,"all right, elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. the seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
38923,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i thought this delay was so you could watch wheel of fortune with your mother."
43746,Sheldon,and i have the soulful eyes of a cow.
41602,Sheldon,now i know how the african slaves felt. being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
38605,Sheldon,"boy, i’m getting good at this."
38355,Sheldon,no. the cushion is merely symbolic. i’m giving you my spot on the couch.
38404,Sheldon,"i don’t care for novelty editions of monopoly. i prefer the classics, regular and klingon."
37176,Sheldon,you did.
34561,Sheldon,no.
43013,Sheldon,"well, i’m not. and if i could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler."
38437,Sheldon,who.
43820,Sheldon,"i was always afraid this day would come. this might be the first step of my descent into madness, where i gradually test the limits of public nudity."
35287,Sheldon,i assumed you would. 
43280,Sheldon,it actually says at least?
45453,Sheldon,"ooh, we already have our first call."
35642,Sheldon,ooh!
38203,Sheldon,"oh yes. it runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
44079,Sheldon,"yeah, well, that is exactly what i’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress."
38141,Sheldon,you’re welcome. but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
37879,Sheldon,i thought you broke up with her. why is she here?
36855,Sheldon,i walked.
40113,Sheldon,this is not my laundry.
35836,Sheldon,"okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock."
42095,Sheldon,the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
45610,Sheldon,you called my mother?
44357,Sheldon, leonard.
38005,Sheldon,it’s a game we invented. it’s called counterfactuals.
40697,Sheldon,"you don’t know? oh, you poor dear. your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. you made an inappropriate sexual advance towards dr. hofstadter."
40649,Sheldon,"brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. when a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel."
37676,Sheldon,"oh, yes. it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. i’d hate for that effort to have been in vain."
37319,Sheldon,then i’ve been up all night.
44001,Sheldon,"what? i apologized and i meant it. i know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong."
37277,Sheldon,"all right, then. good night."
45553,Sheldon,"well, i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered, i’ll tell you that."
38487,Sheldon,literally? literally a million years?
36478,Sheldon,"penny. i realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
44722,Sheldon,okay. i can do this. just give me a moment… oh! mimosas coming up.
38052,Sheldon,it’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
43067,Sheldon,but i made a video.
34396,Sheldon,"okay, look, i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. nevertheless, i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. you did not ask her out. "
39436,Sheldon,"yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
39901,Sheldon,"oh, it’s very simple. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons spock, spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves spock, spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
40284,Sheldon, leonard?
43690,Sheldon,"absolutely not. yeah, penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. any words of advice?"
34567,Sheldon,oh no! 
40693,Sheldon,"talk to her? that’s all you’ve got? with a cool name like sheldon cooper’s council of ladies, i really expected more. give me back the t-shirts."
37134,Sheldon,this is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient greeks through isaac newton to niels bohr to erwin schrodinger to the dutch researchers that leonard is currently ripping off.
36203,Sheldon,i’m not sure. it doesn’t feel right.
35327,Sheldon,forget! you want me to forget? this mind does not forget. i haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. it was a drizzly tuesday.
35064,Sheldon,formal protest.
34996,Sheldon,"now, i notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
43749,Sheldon,"right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."
44044,Sheldon,"and that’s not helpful. you know, i got her an iphone for christmas. i’ll see where she is."
37728,Sheldon,"yes, there are."
43132,Sheldon,i didn’t hog anything. unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
45155,Sheldon,"oh, hey. if you knocked, i couldn’t hear you. i’m welding this locomotive engine. and if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?"
35675,Sheldon,what a nice girl.
36643,Sheldon,"if this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
40080,Sheldon,then to avoid jewish hell?
41554,Sheldon,"well, first, i think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. "
43253,Sheldon,"ah, it’s just like he’s here."
42620,Sheldon,"i can’t do this. and for your information, leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck."
44448,Sheldon,what if each of those people let someone cut?
37423,Sheldon,"all right, my friend. would you like some cholermus?"
35267,Sheldon,"there are a number of options and, i’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
41847,Sheldon,i submitted you a notarised list. 
38892,Sheldon,they took my battle ostrich.
44063,Sheldon,yeah.
42372,Sheldon,you take that back.
36675,Sheldon,bread.
44943,Sheldon,"anyway, i’ll leave you be. i have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. apparently, they still make them."
34945,Sheldon,can you sing “soft kitty”. 
42518,Sheldon,but we didn’t see them bust one ghost.
38159,Sheldon,"simple! you want a girlfriend, amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. take her off my hands. i give you my blessing."
36498,Sheldon,can you?
38657,Sheldon,acting lessons. interesting. it might help if i could act as though i care about my students and whether or not they learn.
34699,Sheldon,"damn you, walletnook.com."
42048,Sheldon,"well, they do."
38172,Sheldon,"the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. now, get my back, jack."
45251,Sheldon,this is an interesting way to stay out of it.
38256,Sheldon,"it’s pretty convincing, huh? and it wasn’t even a real person. and here is the clincher. a lock of maggie’s flaming auburn hair."
35457,Sheldon,"yes, but what does it stand for?"
44136,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. and if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
36464,Sheldon,"what exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? does he provide her with health insurance?"
36827,Sheldon,i’m the boss. i make the jokes.
44824,Sheldon,"yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
45136,Sheldon,yes. i don’t need an emotion machine. i am one.
38317,Sheldon,but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go.
45026,Sheldon,"delighted? what., not if i guessed for a hundred years."
41770,Sheldon,"come on, take me to work with you."
41320,Sheldon,i wish i could believe you.
41191,Sheldon,it was you.
35147,Sheldon,what just happened?
45729,Sheldon,"and the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. but, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. the end."
38416,Sheldon,"oh, there you are. just so you know, i was up all night, but i have finally completed the penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
36750,Sheldon,the math would suggest that in a few i’m a clown made of candy. but i don’t dance.
45597,Sheldon,"because there’s only one of me, i’m more valuable."
37191,Sheldon,"to comfort you, of course. no, that’s not going to work at all, i’ll comfort you from over here. leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
42485,Sheldon,"well, good lord, no, have you seen jaws?"
34841,Sheldon,"of course i do. my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder, colorado. it’s accurate to one tenth of a second. but as i’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
35401,Sheldon,i don’t like bearclaws.
37350,Sheldon,"no, no, i’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but i figured out how to figure it out."
43343,Sheldon,"well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. or train a rat."
40034,Sheldon,"ah! a vintage, mint in box, 1975 mego star trek transporter with real transporter action. hot-darn!"
35743,Sheldon,"dill slices, not sweet?"
39918,Sheldon,"why is there a hole in my new office? i’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: there was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out."
43291,Sheldon,what about this one?
40907,Sheldon,"good news. uh, the latest episode of fun with flags is online."
39827,Sheldon,"you don’t like written suggestions. you don’t like when i give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. if i didn’t know any better, i’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
42991,Sheldon,"uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or pope."
35165,Sheldon,"alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it i say. i’m going to settle this right now. neither of you are good enough for my sister. "
37153,Sheldon,all right. leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
37514,Sheldon,"we can’t sell it. we have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
45173,Sheldon,gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.
37531,Sheldon,i said stop it!
34617,Sheldon,good night leonard. 
43001,Sheldon,what would constitute a perfect day for you?
42554,Sheldon,you’re not going to have funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the earth.
40861,Sheldon,it’s penny’s fault.
44272,Sheldon,"oh, i feel closer to you, too. you know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime."
44883,Sheldon,"bert? i wanted to let you know that i read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
40230,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?"
43626,Sheldon,a month? what? are you kidding me? that would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
40550,Sheldon,"i always listen to myself. it’s one of the great joys of my life. now, get your car out of my spot."
39328,Sheldon,okay? it’s magnificent.
41308,Sheldon,"fine. leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
39527,Sheldon,"yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
34222,Sheldon,no. we’re going to start season two of battlestar galactica.
37813,Sheldon,this is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
40265,Sheldon,"yeah, of course you do. you’re a girl. you like all kinds of hippy-dippy things."
45013,Sheldon,and?
40544,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, 294?"
44509,Sheldon,or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
43907,Sheldon,"arthur. what are you doing here? i, i don’t think i need any more advice."
37197,Sheldon,you’re very welcome.
42814,Sheldon,"before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"
40630,Sheldon,why?
37116,Sheldon,"all right.  go away. i agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy."
37073,Sheldon,hello.
39210,Sheldon,"gentlemen, if i may interject, i’ve decided my rank will be captain. if it’s good enough for kirk, crunch and kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
21797,Sheldon,"i know what i said. i know what you said. i know what my mother said on march 5, 1992. what is the sixth noble gas?"
40259,Sheldon,"at the movies, wolowitz always eats raisinets."
40822,Sheldon,"leonard, wait."
45196,Sheldon,why aren’t you talking to me?
35666,Sheldon,that is the prevailing opinion.
35254,Sheldon,"howard, i’m going to need another mandarin lesson. i obviously didn’t make my point with those people. "
41980,Sheldon,kind of like when firefly was cancelled. but not as big.
42771,Sheldon,you want to be green?
39171,Sheldon,why?
35509,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
38226,Sheldon,"really? leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
44401,Sheldon,three giant red ones and they never blink. it’s unsettling.
36139,Sheldon,"all right. leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? say hi to kurt for us."
41258,Sheldon,"i opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
45161,Sheldon,"well, good for you guys. look, i have a grease smudge on my hand, and i’m okay with it."
35579,Sheldon,you did.
40116,Sheldon,that’s close enough.
37295,Sheldon,better.
40551,Sheldon,very well. you leave me no choice.
39585,Sheldon,"the thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like stuart is repellent. no offence, stuart."
40445,Sheldon,"fine. women, huh?"
39293,Sheldon,"leonard. check it out. i bought an n-gauge locomotive. half the size of h-o. look, it fits in my mouth."
39439,Sheldon,droll.
40556,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but could you be more specific?"
45489,Sheldon,this conversation is over.
41006,Sheldon,"if we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, i’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle."
36931,Sheldon,hold on i believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed. would you like to bring some cylon toast?
39751,Sheldon,you’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. kudos.
45503,Sheldon,this is disconcerting. 
35552,Sheldon,did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
41067,Sheldon,i am not flying back to texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
40725,Sheldon,"so to answer your question, no, it’s not better."
35385,Sheldon,"well then, no problem, i have three controllers, the more the merrier."
36359,Sheldon,"not bad? it’s horrible. i mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you."
39035,Sheldon,i’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about aztec human sacrifice.
35542,Sheldon,"oh, sorry. "
41278,Sheldon,"are you sure? with your italian pizza and my chinese noodles, we could play marco polo. i mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of marco polo the venetian explorer, not marco polo the terrifying water sport."
44116,Sheldon,"because this changes everything. what about comic book night? uh, what about playing games together? what about our trips to disneyland? how can we do those things with a child around?"
41938,Sheldon,"well, isn’t this nice. sometimes the baby wins."
45399,Sheldon,it’s getting clearer.
37534,Sheldon,subliminal messaging. i’m going to make you want to pee. dripping faucets. leaky gutter. peeing.
37518,Sheldon,i’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
41598,Sheldon,"oh, since you put it that way, i’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
42294,Sheldon,i do.
45070,Sheldon,"very well. you got married spur of the moment, i don’t see why your divorce should be any different."
40733,Sheldon,"oh, smashing. now, leonard, do you know how to get there?"
43141,Sheldon,"and rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. um, noise-cancelling headphones. oh, danger whistle. um, pepper spray. ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. oh, and a mirror on a stick, so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo."
40145,Sheldon,wrong. leonard?
44696,Sheldon,"penny, i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone."
40432,Sheldon,really?
41800,Sheldon,good. now we’re getting somewhere.
37655,Sheldon,i so loathe you.
41014,Sheldon,my primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. i might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. or a chainsaw.
43268,Sheldon,"yeah, and if he does ask you, go. it’s amazing."
45254,Sheldon,"well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
37055,Sheldon,when was your last menstrual period?
43672,Sheldon,"it’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter u."
38285,Sheldon,of course. why do you have to make things so complicated?
45359,Sheldon,"soon. see, i could’ve said in the near future, but i didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. in, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. see, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
37828,Sheldon,not my world.
40387,Sheldon,"amy, do something. amy, help. amy, stop that. amy, penny, both of you, stop it."
42014,Sheldon,no. i’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
42693,Sheldon,"oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. you still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. the minute you sneeze web, i’m moving out."
39924,Sheldon,how can i relax? my nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict professor rothman.
42961,Sheldon,okay.
43628,Sheldon,did you know that i almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
39014,Sheldon,"um, it’s fairly technical."
38593,Sheldon,do you have those little marshmallows?
44436,Sheldon,"oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick."
42652,Sheldon,"leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?"
43399,Sheldon,"yes. if i ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like i do to you when you say dumb things."
39155,Sheldon,"zandor, wizard of the north. ha! i win."
42447,Sheldon,"oh, i like their emergency room. yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop."
41153,Sheldon,the dragon’s christopher walken. that’s perfect.
35947,Sheldon,didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
36667,Sheldon,you see? people have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
41414,Sheldon,"huh. yeah, i always took it literally. that’s why i have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. hmm."
42669,Sheldon,i see. take me to leonard.
36106,Sheldon,"oh, i see. penny, i’m not sure i’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 north los robles corporation."
34434,Sheldon,i can’t believe he fired me.
34664,Sheldon,"well then, it’s all settled, christie will stay with howard, penny can go back to her apartment, and i’ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who, although at this point it’s more like doctor why bother. "
45274,Sheldon,"i mean, it’s unfair; people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room."
44450,Sheldon,excuse me.
44341,Sheldon,"well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. see, leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. this is what a generation raised on bart simpson looks like."
36218,Sheldon,"no. no, this isn’t right. our food always comes in szechuan palace containers."
42359,Sheldon,"it is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. feynman, einstein, professor x. humorously, in the case of professor x, some of his students actually had wings. that’s rich. i’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
36454,Sheldon,has to be? has to be? i hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
34704,Sheldon,"if i may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
41223,Sheldon,do i miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? no. do i miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? i don’t think so. do i miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using morse code? 
41810,Sheldon,do not stop refreshing your screens.
37489,Sheldon,you know very well how it went.
40787,Sheldon,"oh, don’t play the einstein card. his great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. so everything was a great breakthrough."
37805,Sheldon,the implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
35012,Sheldon,youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
44073,Sheldon,no. they asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
35912,Sheldon,"just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
39448,Sheldon,it’s a snake. a terrifying snake.
38644,Sheldon,"good evening. i’m your guest lecturer, dr. sheldon cooper. i was expecting applause, but i suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. i agreed to speak to you this evening, because i was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. hmm. of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. best and brightest, my sweet patootie. all right, let’s begin. show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? don’t kid yourselves."
41246,Sheldon,"oh, seriously?"
35653,Sheldon,"no, i’m not giving up, i never give up."
39775,Sheldon,"yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
44781,Sheldon,it’s all right.
43019,Sheldon,the point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
45182,Sheldon,why?
34983,Sheldon,"so i’ve decided, i’m going to collaborate with you."
43453,Sheldon,really? i never imagined it any other way.
40703,Sheldon,"i needed advice about a woman. i would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle."
41513,Sheldon,look. a new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. wow. i can’t wait until i get a rash. 
42172,Sheldon,get it?
42233,Sheldon,can’t happen. we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
38785,Sheldon,"but tonight’s thursday. on thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like jackie chan."
37436,Sheldon,heated to 180 degrees?
35004,Sheldon,"you know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. "
45482,Sheldon,"what, are you crazy? i’m on a unicycle."
36104,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t specify."
41026,Sheldon,barely knew him.
36311,Sheldon,i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. good luck.
40089,Sheldon,"howard, please, i’m begging you."
36458,Sheldon,i am forgetting nothing and i resent your tone.
39699,Sheldon,"all right, then. the reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
34461,Sheldon,isn’t it?
38739,Sheldon,excellent! what are you planning to wear?
45341,Sheldon,"no, i can still hear it. oh, wait, that’s me. never mind, it’s fine."
41841,Sheldon,okay. but i think it could have ended with the karaoke.
41683,Sheldon,what a surprise. did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
37150,Sheldon,oh!
39951,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, i’m just here to get my hair cut."
42274,Sheldon,no.
44909,Sheldon,"you know, i wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
43335,Sheldon,"oh, sure."
44934,Sheldon,"come along, amy. i know when i’m not wanted."
39736,Sheldon,why are you waving a white flag?
44315,Sheldon,oh. never have i ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
35289,Sheldon,"you also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. but go on. "
39820,Sheldon,and a funny greek letter.
44604,Sheldon,"no, i can’t figure out the math. i’ve been racking my brain for days, and i’ve got nothing."
36662,Sheldon,are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize?
40216,Sheldon,"well, what if it’s his only way out? i can’t risk it. here is twelve dollars. now, we’re even. wait, wait, wait, i bought a card. give me two dollars. and for the record, this is why i hate gift-giving."
35800,Sheldon,"ooh, i don’t think so. no, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. i suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock."
44837,Sheldon,"uh, no. we lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
36192,Sheldon,"my good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
43790,Sheldon,is that regular or honey nut?
38107,Sheldon,yes.
42188,Sheldon,"oh, i appreciate the offer, but arthur is gone and there’s nothing i can do about it. when darth vader struck down obi-wan, did luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?"
41245,Sheldon,"well, if it’s any consolation, i’m sure leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
43795,Sheldon,they gave one to that baby. he wasn’t even awake.
41795,Sheldon,"well, to be honest, i thought she said yoda."
37102,Sheldon,hello.
45122,Sheldon,you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.
44408,Sheldon,morning.
36362,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
40792,Sheldon,yes. that is the reason. my work is suffering because of all the laid i’m getting.
44420,Sheldon,why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
44961,Sheldon,wolowitz might hand out cigars. i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish.
43739,Sheldon,gentlemen.
44346,Sheldon,gladly.
36658,Sheldon,about what? being betrayed by my friends? spending three months at the north pole for nothing? and i didn’t even get to go to comic-con!
43560,Sheldon,"hello, 2003."
39720,Sheldon,it’s not about you. it’s about a poor immigrant from pakistan trying to make his way in america by working the graveyard shift at the colorado boulevard chevron.
45288,Sheldon,can you believe this guy?
44690,Sheldon,"well, see, why can’t amy be that subservient? she has coitus one time, suddenly she’s gloria steinem. anyway, i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
36369,Sheldon,"i knew it! ps3, definitely  ps3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
41462,Sheldon,"i couldn’t sleep because i kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. also, i had one heck of a bus nap. oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
34765,Sheldon,"they’re not supposed to, but they should. "
40626,Sheldon,"in a perfect world, i’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. that probably requires a permit."
40402,Sheldon,fine. how about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? hewlett and packard. dibs on hewlett. what? you want to be hewlett?
45498,Sheldon,"thank you. no bendy straw, some party."
41837,Sheldon,"in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
45694,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen. glory, hallelujah."
38582,Sheldon,he wouldn’t drive me to work today. i had to wear my bus pants.
42738,Sheldon,"yeah, i appreciate the ride."
36594,Sheldon,no. this is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole.
38411,Sheldon,"oh, friggety-frak. not this again."
35308,Sheldon,why would you lie about that?
38600,Sheldon,"oh, no. mrs. mary cooper didn’t raise her no liars."
36812,Sheldon,"i assumed as much. but never fear. like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, i have returned to save the day. odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. anyway, i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that i could benefit…"
41161,Sheldon,"well, i don’t think our relationship is a joke. i think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. it’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
45057,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ll miss you too."
41307,Sheldon,amy?
40165,Sheldon,i just threw up the bachelor party.
38959,Sheldon,thank you. my father taught me archery as a child. it’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of kmart bourbon.
41906,Sheldon,"but we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats."
42058,Sheldon,"yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record the macneil/lehrer report. now i also was certain that hd dvd would win out over blu-ray."
44316,Sheldon,"i have a question about batman. batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. now, if man-bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be man-batman?"
38693,Sheldon,why would we want to do that? it’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
44158,Sheldon,i am. oh. wait.
21857,Sheldon,"you don’t see your mistake, do you?"
39251,Sheldon,name one time i’ve ever done that.
40596,Sheldon,"it is, right behind do-do-do-do-do inspector gadget., and teenage mutant ninja turtles, heroes in a half-shell."
40093,Sheldon,"i’m not asking for me, i’m asking for hawking."
38927,Sheldon,this says beyonce bootylicious dance mix.
35697,Sheldon,he does want that. does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
42759,Sheldon,of course it is. it’s the perfect gift. how are you feeling right now? guilty? sad? wishing you were jewish?
43016,Sheldon,"so, it would be today? huh. well, i suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
40096,Sheldon,how do i do that?
44470,Sheldon,"you know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with mrs. cooper."
45127,Sheldon,"it’s more than that. it’s me. i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
39749,Sheldon,how about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
21826,Sheldon,"we might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. initial here. all right, that’s television and movies. section nine, miscellany. the apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
41931,Sheldon,which i also figured out by myself.
44702,Sheldon,"since amy and i have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to."
41264,Sheldon,"changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
37593,Sheldon,and how did that make you feel?
38011,Sheldon,greetings. you all remember amy farrah fowler.
43954,Sheldon,exactly. see how well we work together?
40635,Sheldon,"amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
45821,Sheldon, penny.
40422,Sheldon,"and if they ever come out with a game called words with people you once worked with, you’ll be off to the races."
45109,Sheldon,"oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her."
40258,Sheldon,hmm. do you like raisinets?
38639,Sheldon,"all right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
44237,Sheldon,"look at the 4k resolution. next time we skype, i’m gonna count all those nostril hairs."
41478,Sheldon,"oh, well, thank you. believe it or not, i just learned a chinese research team at the hubei institute for nuclear physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
34526,Sheldon,"i don’t know what the protocol is here. do i stay, do i leave? do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? "
41821,Sheldon,"not true. wil thinks this is a great idea. he was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard."
36255,Sheldon,i forgot my flash drive.
35286,Sheldon,other people might be interested. 
34715,Sheldon,fine. i’ll have a virgin cuba libre. 
44351,Sheldon,i didn’t say fun fact. i’m not a monster.
43997,Sheldon,"leonard, get ready for an apology. and with the added twist of an m. night shyamalan movie, i’m going to mean it."
40536,Sheldon,"am i? the mind’s a mysterious thing, leonard. he could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn."
36154,Sheldon,"yes, yes. yeah, i’m definitely going with colonoscopy."
36346,Sheldon,"okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the american spirit. did davy crockett quit at the alamo? did jim bowie?"
38330,Sheldon,"i have troubles, penny. i’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
40855,Sheldon,"yeah, why would you?"
36811,Sheldon,"raj, did you get the job with professor laughlin?"
37471,Sheldon,"well, of course you have a choice. although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. now, sit down. i call your attention to the events of november 16. do you remember that date?"
42545,Sheldon,"where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine."
35023,Sheldon,i will yield.
44774,Sheldon,leonard?
40043,Sheldon,was i hit on the head by a coconut.
44532,Sheldon,that doesn’t sound terrifying.
39552,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
45028,Sheldon,how did we get in the car?
39098,Sheldon,it’s three-person chess. did you bring a friend?
36486,Sheldon,eat? my dinner? in your apartment?
45056,Sheldon,bye.
43219,Sheldon,that’s a big step.
42315,Sheldon,"where didn’t i go? i went to new york, chicago, atlanta, denver, seattle."
35821,Sheldon,will you all excuse me? leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
44088,Sheldon,i’m nervous. i hope people will be around to watch even though it’s valentine’s day.
35285,Sheldon,then don’t.
43593,Sheldon,good to know? what’s that supposed to mean?
37572,Sheldon,i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
35937,Sheldon,see? she’s not offended. and now you finally have an answer.
45419,Sheldon,"sure you do. i was telling you both the story about how haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. it was at the summer olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…"
34265,Sheldon,"yes, but not of the same species."
45792,Sheldon,you seem tense. perhaps this will relax you.
38227,Sheldon,prescription or non-prescription strength.
34650,Sheldon,"okay, well since i’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, i use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly. "
39077,Sheldon,"all right. last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. i then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and i left."
35834,Sheldon,doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
39001,Sheldon,"i asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now."
39245,Sheldon,chair.
43541,Sheldon,"well, in addition to amy leaving me, leonard’s moving in with penny. it’s difficult not to feel abandoned."
40604,Sheldon, amy.
38194,Sheldon,"the fun starts with brunch at carney’s in studio city, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. next stop, travel town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the hollywood carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
34749,Sheldon,why would i see her again? i already have a dentist. 
35283,Sheldon,"i can see that. unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
44558,Sheldon,"look, i’m sorry. tell me why bernadette is upset with you."
36366,Sheldon,you can’t know that. how can you possibly know that?
44238,Sheldon,but you only have two eyes. you got a lot of nostril hairs.
37315,Sheldon,"thank you, fellow bozite. and may i say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s chamber of commerce.  one ticket to pasadena, california, please."
38520,Sheldon,i’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. i’m waiting.
38313,Sheldon,yes.
40954,Sheldon,smart. we don’t want any problems.
42449,Sheldon,"i miss stuart’s place. all this loud music and exposed brick. what, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?"
43140,Sheldon,i don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell.
42584,Sheldon,"oh, please, you know, i’ll tell you how he did it. implacable, relentless badgering. in urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. and she was a urethra that could not shake him."
36673,Sheldon,"aw, mom."
40948,Sheldon,"mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, i hear glass ceilings shattering all over town."
43782,Sheldon,"and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at i’d wear shorts if i had a pair. 78."
36720,Sheldon,"forgive me. yiddish was not spoken in east texas. and if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
41571,Sheldon,"okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? remember, when you can hear me, i can hear you. and second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. it’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain i can’t scratch."
37285,Sheldon,i do tonight. it’s scary over there.
44990,Sheldon,"amy, i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. if that’s not foreplay, i don’t know what is."
45125,Sheldon,not really.
41413,Sheldon,really?
40850,Sheldon,"i suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair."
43948,Sheldon,"okay, back to me. i discovered an asteroid, and now i get to name it."
40642,Sheldon,i signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
35167,Sheldon,"it’s nothing personal, i’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie. "
36648,Sheldon,of course it was. the whole plan reeks of leonard.
39970,Sheldon,what’s going on?
38184,Sheldon,"oh, yes. we’re like wild animals in heat. it’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
34763,Sheldon,"i let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. not to put too fine a point on it, but i was throwing you a bone. you’re welcome. "
37327,Sheldon,"pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
41702,Sheldon,did you hear that? a mop. i have two phds yet somehow i’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
40911,Sheldon,all right.
37020,Sheldon,"well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
34220,Sheldon,great.
44769,Sheldon,are you going to confront penny?
34920,Sheldon,i need soup.
39489,Sheldon,where are you going?
36783,Sheldon,"oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
42558,Sheldon,my major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
35638,Sheldon,"how else are they going to learn? look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. the correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
43932,Sheldon,"it wasn’t difficult. you know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?"
36254,Sheldon,"oh, no."
44879,Sheldon,"top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
36262,Sheldon,"okay, i’ve found the perfect solution. we get off the train at the next stop in oxnard. we then take the 1:13 train back to union station. we take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to san luis obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train."
44303,Sheldon,got it.
44129,Sheldon,"you guys, the bathroom here is amazing. there’s people cooking in it."
37867,Sheldon,you’re bluffing.
41052,Sheldon,"i just found out that you recommended myself, dr. hofstadter and dr. koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
38468,Sheldon,look at this stamp. on what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
36774,Sheldon,really?
36170,Sheldon,"oh, i can’t believe that."
36387,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, penny."
36615,Sheldon,"i want a cookie, meemaw."
34429,Sheldon,"how’s this? pleased to meet you, dr gablehouser. how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. mahalo."
34340,Sheldon,i just gave you a reasonable explanation.
37661,Sheldon,did you let wil wheaton get in your head?
41566,Sheldon,why would i flip out? is it a spider? it’s a spider.
39532,Sheldon,this is ridiculous. i’m a grown man from texas. this isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. it’s just a blue jay.  no!
41040,Sheldon,what? did she do it yet?
42766,Sheldon,"that’s not true. any colour’s fine with me. yeah, i could be a-a combination of blue and yellow."
44466,Sheldon,"yes, i’m inviting people to our wedding. yeah, i’ve already asked stephen hawking and robert downey jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but erno rubik."
38965,Sheldon,yes. i think prolonged exposure to penny has turned her into a bit of a gabby gertie.
38682,Sheldon,you do?
39443,Sheldon,"leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
43086,Sheldon,"oh, i’d be incensed."
43599,Sheldon,"if you intend to pursue amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it."
39841,Sheldon,"now you do, too. oh! i have a brilliant idea. amy’s a biologist. i’ll go work in her lab."
44729,Sheldon,"hmm. you see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. help me out here, this is not where i shine."
42280,Sheldon,"no. i do not accept this. everything is changing and i hate it. it stops now. i’m helping you get back on your feet. i would like to purchase this comic book, please."
42691,Sheldon,i told you not to get the surgery.
43558,Sheldon,"oh, i wish i could, but i realized i’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, i’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before i met leonard."
45705,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, good. there you are. i need you to check my head for chair lice."
34936,Sheldon,"no. no, my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. "
44776,Sheldon,why are you speaking english?
36473,Sheldon,and how are you doing this fine evening?
39503,Sheldon,"last night i was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional amy farrah fowler. this on a night that i had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my lego death star. and why? your gal pals, penny and bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my lego fun time."
38292,Sheldon,that’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
38517,Sheldon,"no, wait! i have a speech."
40557,Sheldon,"oh, that. well, see, i wanted it, and you weren’t using it. apparently, those are the rules we live by now. payback, it truly is the b word, isn’t it?"
35549,Sheldon,"i can make it, but i won’t."
38083,Sheldon,our collaboration is a work of the mind. we don’t need desks.
44513,Sheldon,"yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. pretty efficient, huh?"
34255,Sheldon,yes. 
35473,Sheldon,you’re in my bedroom.
41125,Sheldon,"there anything i can get for you? some apple juice? uh, some jell-o?"
35848,Sheldon,"oh, good, i used that right. anyway, you’re aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
39031,Sheldon,"it’s talc. but as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, i understand your confusion."
35335,Sheldon,"don’t be ridiculous, you love trains. "
41234,Sheldon,isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
40636,Sheldon,"yeah, like a bunch of savages."
36290,Sheldon, penny.
36376,Sheldon,hello. on a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
38186,Sheldon,"agreed. amy, i find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. bazinga. bedtime. please show yourself out."
34395,Sheldon,"oh, come on, leonard! this is obviously about penny. "
43314,Sheldon,you act like i didn’t get you that mushroom log on valentine’s day.
45680,Sheldon,mine!
39444,Sheldon,open the mail!
38075,Sheldon,"ah, then you may find zazzles a little cloying."
34884,Sheldon,your parents made the right decision. 
38674,Sheldon,you’re the teacher.
43079,Sheldon,"two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. and that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
39801,Sheldon,"excuse me, leonard."
43968,Sheldon,she’s a dermatologist.
38261,Sheldon,"did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
37705,Sheldon,"no, of course not. that would be odd and suspicious behavior."
43691,Sheldon,"this is a documentary about mr. spock. i’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful."
41871,Sheldon,trick question. there never was one.
42166,Sheldon,"the majority of people have dark hair. even you, at one time."
40892,Sheldon,"no. no, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, i want you to have it."
39428,Sheldon,"or maybe i’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means i’m still basically a toddler."
45548,Sheldon,"now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello. "
39952,Sheldon,"i got to run. but not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
42603,Sheldon,"i’d like to discuss this party that amy and bernadette are throwing. since you and i are both reluctant to go, i think i’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it."
45118,Sheldon,"well, hey. now she’s angry, too. this thing works like gangbusters."
37014,Sheldon,"they’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
41461,Sheldon, amy.
45247,Sheldon,why?
42254,Sheldon,"of course. she’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."
40677,Sheldon,"no, i was wrong. the looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. i’ve never felt so alive.  oh, hello, alex. uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings."
43364,Sheldon,"yeah. exactly. you know, i waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
44387,Sheldon,"h-o gauge trains are 1/87th scale. n gauge are 1/160th scale. and that brings us to z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how i know, 1 to 220."
40795,Sheldon,"because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. anyway, if kripke asks, tell him my coitus with amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive."
41257,Sheldon,here’s something else you don’t know about me. you just hurt my feelings.
36417,Sheldon,all right. let’s go to the comic book store.
43128,Sheldon,"yeah, so are you."
39008,Sheldon,"according to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection b, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. and believe me, i am experiencing a very majeure force."
37640,Sheldon,"you want me to remove him from the team? i’m the captain, i can do that."
43604,Sheldon,"true, but penny’s married, and so is bernadette. and your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia."
42855,Sheldon, ladies?
35138,Sheldon,"she’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly i’ve never been able to see it."
21855,Sheldon,"oh. well, in that case, i don’t need my jacket. and for the record, the correct syntax is i’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. "
37909,Sheldon,thank you for driving me.
45033,Sheldon,"hey, how’s life with your baby?"
41718,Sheldon,"me, too. i got a lot of tv to catch up on."
43015,Sheldon,you sure it’s not too much bible juice?
37088,Sheldon,it’s a simple matter. there are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
39916,Sheldon,i’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
37858,Sheldon,it’s a time of day i invented. it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. preevning. i’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
40679,Sheldon,"jenga, i win!"
38340,Sheldon,"i wronged howard, and he won’t accept my apology."
45320,Sheldon,it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee. it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
38132,Sheldon,"meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
38673,Sheldon,"penny, my body and i have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
34359,Sheldon,"penny, penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  well that was a little non-responsive."
42489,Sheldon,"yeah, i have it on blu-ray. we should watch it."
41676,Sheldon,"oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?"
38400,Sheldon,why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
37936,Sheldon,"i’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, penny. in any event, now that amy and i have spent quality time together, i feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
43024,Sheldon,yes.
41591,Sheldon,"you know, it might be fun. you love hummus."
41176,Sheldon,"no one asked you, uhura."
38548,Sheldon,how about this for the app name? the surprisingly helpful equation-linked differential optimized numerator.
44016,Sheldon,"and, emily, i’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. and i’m sure you’re tired of hearing that."
40171,Sheldon,"a little. but not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. well, i cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t i? i look like the flash about to get married. oh! a tissue! a tissue! oh, good lord!"
44826,Sheldon,"i understand. she’s the mean one, i’m the fun one."
38501,Sheldon,"oh, i hardly think so. the real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late."
36771,Sheldon,"and it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
37549,Sheldon,"thank you. yeah, i’ll bear that in mind if i’m ever nominated for the hillbilly peace prize."
35524,Sheldon,"excuse me. thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
39809,Sheldon,every time?
43281,Sheldon,why would they say at least? is it ten toggles? is it a hundred toggles? you know? is it a thousand toggles? ten thousand toggles? a hundred thousand toggles?
41042,Sheldon,are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
39434,Sheldon,"hmm.  all right, all right. i see what’s going on. a little pre-halloween hijinkery. a ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. the trifecta of haunted house clichés. instead of eek, i say yawn."
45464,Sheldon,"i started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and i came across an area of research called super-aging."
41721,Sheldon,or instead of me.
44033,Sheldon,"oh, that’s very kind of you. but i’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. let’s go, stuart."
36710,Sheldon,help me open it.
40543,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
38918,Sheldon,"fine, we’ll abide by the geneva convention. but ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? how many kites? how many scooby-doo trapper keepers?"
36143,Sheldon,you don’t remember me? how could he not remember me?
41228,Sheldon,ooh. bad move.
38322,Sheldon,"if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry christmas. think about that, dr. tyson."
37166,Sheldon,"i sense that’s not sincere, although i have no idea why."
34957,Sheldon,"personally, i would never use a transporter. because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon."
43635,Sheldon,how many questions are too many questions?
38040,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
35305,Sheldon,do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? 
35191,Sheldon,"my god! why don’t you just tell them i’m a toll taker at the golden gate bridge? rocket scientist, how humiliating. "
44753,Sheldon,i am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
38128,Sheldon,"no point. it’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. what makes you chuckle, leonard?"
34509,Sheldon,"he asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. "
43760,Sheldon,"sounds like a drama queen. oh, no. it is jennifer lawrence."
40748,Sheldon,i hate this planet.
44358,Sheldon,i never got to ask my question about batman.
36797,Sheldon,you guess? you don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
42452,Sheldon,"i’ll give you a plan right now. step one, open comic book store. step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
34717,Sheldon,yes. and would you make it diet? 
34498,Sheldon,"thanks, mom. mom?"
38728,Sheldon,no!
39870,Sheldon,"oh, better than good."
34933,Sheldon,"well, of course, but, not by myself. "
41706,Sheldon,to what?
45258,Sheldon,"nuts to that, i’m going to comic-con."
36201,Sheldon,they don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
38588,Sheldon,"i didn’t say that. but no, i don’t."
35261,Sheldon,"yes, i suppose he is. "
36005,Sheldon,what do you mean?
43433,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it agrees with you."
34545,Sheldon,leonard?
36007,Sheldon,make it so.
42482,Sheldon,did you see the lake house?
43789,Sheldon,how many dates have you been on? who were they with? where’d you go? where did you meet them? did you sleep with them? and how much longer to the aquarium? i’m getting kind of hungry.
36578,Sheldon,…the invitation to join the arctic expedition.
38596,Sheldon,really? leonard wants me back?
44925,Sheldon,"oh, now, what about our 3-d chess set?"
39745,Sheldon,"the flags of liechtenstein and haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 olympics. and thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of fascism."
35803,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but i’m not going to watch the clone wars tv series until i’ve seen the clone wars movie. i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
44862,Sheldon,"yeh, why? eh, why? oh, that’s why."
41945,Sheldon,"well, with that sorted out, i’m happy to answer your question, bernadette. howard started it."
45332,Sheldon,"aw, someone drew a penis in it."
42833,Sheldon,"according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. so i’d like to ask you all to do something for me. keep me on my toes. just throw me off my game. essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
42290,Sheldon,i suppose it is. except i have a credit card. and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. and i’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
37242,Sheldon,"raj, i highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
39007,Sheldon,what are you doing in there? she can’t be in here.
44021,Sheldon,"no. as a fight, it was excellent. she used harsh language and slammed the door. although as i say this, that might not have been what you were asking."
40552,Sheldon,"what are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?"
42248,Sheldon,"it’s an outrage. honestly, i’m tempted to leave the university."
37864,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
38524,Sheldon,"you know, leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. very good."
39508,Sheldon,"leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. they are a handful."
40858,Sheldon,you can’t live here.
42432,Sheldon,"the answer is one simple test away. hmm? you know, it’s like when i thought there was a possum in my closet. did i sit around wondering? no, i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."
34940,Sheldon,agreed. 
44630,Sheldon,"oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain."
35581,Sheldon,but how am i going to get to work?
42377,Sheldon,"i’m a teacher, leonard. it’s my job."
35433,Sheldon,"i hope so, it was a snort of derision."
36489,Sheldon,"no, it’s the accepted convention. how was your day?"
41420,Sheldon,"hi. um, i’ve reconsidered. uh, you can’t work where i work. enjoy the rest of your evening."
41330,Sheldon,maybe there’s a third option.
39713,Sheldon,without shoes?
36712,Sheldon,are you bothered that i can so easily manipulate you?
37910,Sheldon,i wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. it’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
34463,Sheldon,well then you’ll want some manganese.
42285,Sheldon,"boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
42266,Sheldon,"yeah, and on top of that, leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
39910,Sheldon,"i don’t think so, kripke. i’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
34779,Sheldon,"excuse me, little idea? "
39302,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please focus. you’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
40906,Sheldon,hello. how’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
43507,Sheldon,"uh-oh. according to this mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 vhs tapes."
35042,Sheldon,no you didn’t.
42745,Sheldon,i’m going to buy her a present.
42015,Sheldon,"howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. that woman needs to learn how to tie a robe."
34689,Sheldon,"your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
39033,Sheldon,"other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. but in the interest of full disclosure, i was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. every year i get a christmas card from her, signed with far too many x’s and o’s."
41039,Sheldon,what are you going to do? take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
39404,Sheldon,"mom, i want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
39278,Sheldon,"i’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
39301,Sheldon,"when you play chutes and ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
42975,Sheldon,i can’t. i’m naked.
43681,Sheldon,"well, the swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison."
45154,Sheldon,"oh, get this. i get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. i get to learn things like hand signals. ooh. there’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. are you done yet? you’re missing"
35568,Sheldon,"yes, half eagle, half lion."
42844,Sheldon,"really? oh, that’s fantastic. now, wait, they’re dropping. why are they dropping?"
35148,Sheldon,i needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. 
44760,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. and i can’t eat, i can’t sleep. and don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."
38161,Sheldon,wait! what am i supposed to do?
41068,Sheldon,"oh, that’s nonsense. i mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. i don’t care how they end."
45129,Sheldon,"yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. you’re kind of a sad sack. i’m sorry, i shouldn’t have said that. i’m just upset."
40535,Sheldon,"while unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. she might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it."
35470,Sheldon,"there you go, one enchanted sword."
45143,Sheldon,"fine. candy bars. now, do you enjoy a fun size? i know you do."
40762,Sheldon,"that’s a drawing of a really cool train. don’t look at that, either. what do you want?"
43098,Sheldon,"no. no, they loved it. they, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it."
39185,Sheldon,remarkable. i’m just realizing how much leonard’s been skating by all these years.
43730,Sheldon,"oh, dr. and mrs. hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
44077,Sheldon,"meemaw, look, i’m sorry, but i have to defend my girlfriend to you."
37324,Sheldon,"electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
40910,Sheldon,why would i do that?
34663,Sheldon,"oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little b&b."
36976,Sheldon,"you can’t make a half-sandwich. if it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
36726,Sheldon,i’m sorry?
36538,Sheldon,but the mission is for six months.
36829,Sheldon,what?
42776,Sheldon,"before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog."
41981,Sheldon,yeah.
38998,Sheldon,"i wish you hadn’t done that. that’s going to make me a chick magnet, and i’m so busy as it is."
35620,Sheldon,"she’s in my spot. don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
41534,Sheldon, arthur. door knocker. that’s tv money.
35693,Sheldon,"me. sorry, leonard."
38934,Sheldon,can i at least kick down the door?
41036,Sheldon,fine. bad.
36722,Sheldon,"he’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is jiminy.  "
35976,Sheldon,"i told you before, bears are terrifying."
38953,Sheldon,"forgive my language, but poppycock."
35025,Sheldon,of course. 
42068,Sheldon,but i haven’t decided yet.
45628,Sheldon,romulan.
44031,Sheldon,"so, for all the times i’ve offended you and all the times that i’ll offend you in the future, i’m sorry."
39847,Sheldon,"what? excuse me, you have dr. sheldon cooper in your lab. you’re gonna make him do the dishes? that’s like asking the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar."
43711,Sheldon,no. she broke up with me before i could broach the subject.
44499,Sheldon,"whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? okay, why, what’s wrong?"
43051,Sheldon,"i know. i like him, too. hi, little guy. how’d you like to come home with us? you’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house."
39716,Sheldon,"well, then, i guess it’s plausible. hang on a second, mister."
40280,Sheldon,i like the transformers. do you like the transformers?
45787,Sheldon,"no, i’m not."
45526,Sheldon,what does it look like? i’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
44207,Sheldon,"no, i am not saying that, because i kept saying that this morning and leonard said stop saying that."
43767,Sheldon,"hey. good news, everybody. now that i’m no longer with amy, i have an extra ticket to the annual thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. who wants it? well, you realize you won’t be going alone, i’ll be there the whole time. providing fish and pilgrim facts. can you people hear me?"
39592,Sheldon,wow. is that the kind of nagging i can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? good thing i drew this up.
40186,Sheldon,spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
41155,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know about you guys, but i have been through the emotional wringer tonight."
41819,Sheldon,"you know, there was a time when comic-con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. and you mark my words, i’m gonna rip that guy off."
37574,Sheldon,suppose i could run downtown and pick up something at shel-mart.
44296,Sheldon,"oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm."
41531,Sheldon,what?
40457,Sheldon,"i won’t. this feels right. my mother always said, to thine own self be true."
35949,Sheldon,"oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. last time i had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
41941,Sheldon,i have an eidetic memory. i don’t know what his problem is.
36554,Sheldon,"i don’t see why i have to worry. my career’s not hanging in the balance. that was a joke. it’s funny, because it’s true."
34868,Sheldon,"sadly, it’s not. substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that i have realised that the leo i described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
39580,Sheldon,"are you sure? that would explain so much. your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
41852,Sheldon,"for starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
43816,Sheldon,"let’s see. hey, i was humming. one point for hufflepuff. what song is that?"
45719,Sheldon,"sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay."
42596,Sheldon,you can do this.
40576,Sheldon,"your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  stop that."
43029,Sheldon,"oh. well, i suppose i do think of you as a sister. and sometimes, a mother."
35204,Sheldon,in addition i really don’t think that leonard wants a…
39163,Sheldon,it’s a little stiff. what a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. not unlike balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick.
34714,Sheldon,i’ll have a diet coke.
44754,Sheldon,"you know, if you’d like, i could call your landlord and complain."
43889,Sheldon,oh.
38206,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
36395,Sheldon,"oh, great! now, i have to start all over again. "
35965,Sheldon,nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
43388,Sheldon,"hello. listen, i’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and i think…"
34742,Sheldon,"how would i know, do you have a low sperm count?"
36607,Sheldon,adversity is to be expected. continue.
41832,Sheldon,"is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
37871,Sheldon,"hello, amy farrah fowler. i’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. additionally, i’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
37329,Sheldon,"peas! perfect, they can be electrons."
38185,Sheldon,"oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina."
37250,Sheldon,"well, i suppose. come in. i’ll sleep in leonard’s room. good night."
37305,Sheldon,my new computer came with windows 7. windows 7 is much more user-friendly than windows vista. i don’t like that.
44979,Sheldon,"yes, you’re in trouble, you went to wizarding world without me."
42304,Sheldon,"2530 east andy devine avenue,"
45272,Sheldon,and what is that supposed to mean?
45640,Sheldon,when the two of you reach a natural stopping point i’d like to have a word.
43942,Sheldon,we better choose a name no one can make fun of. sir frederick william herschel didn’t do uranus any favours.
41492,Sheldon,"what matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. i’m not a genius, i’m a fraud."
36533,Sheldon,"answer the phone, leonard."
34282,Sheldon,my apologies. what’s your plan.
37647,Sheldon,"it’s a blindingly clever play on words. by appropriating his character’s name and adding the s, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of wesley."
41673,Sheldon,what’s that animal doing in our apartment?
38356,Sheldon,no. i love my mother. my feelings for my spot are much greater. it is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. and now it’s yours.
38339,Sheldon,all right. to the metric system.  i can’t taste the cherries.
36483,Sheldon,what’s it doing in my apartment?
44402,Sheldon,"good choice. critical hit. your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. with its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. it’s low sodium. aaaah."
42033,Sheldon,"i’m not being stupid. i’m employing the work of dutch researcher, mirjam tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."
43569,Sheldon,"all right, great. just give me one minute, and i’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. yeah. nothing from pratt, we’re good."
39259,Sheldon,you have to get rid of the chair.
43142,Sheldon,would you like to play a physics car game i invented called i can’t spy? it’s all the nail-biting tension of i spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
37824,Sheldon,"i know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
36010,Sheldon,you are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify monte so that he’s prepared.
35887,Sheldon,"i’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
44393,Sheldon,"oh, i have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
35256,Sheldon,"actually, i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character, now i just find him to be whiny and annoying. "
21809,Sheldon,doesn’t concern you. you’ll be going to the university every day?
42928,Sheldon,"oh, okay, okay, calm down.  it’s him. he’s trying to video chat. perhaps i shouldn’t have taken this into the real world."
45398,Sheldon,it’s hard to say.
41648,Sheldon,would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
37778,Sheldon,i apologize. he’s only an experimental physicist.
39268,Sheldon,no.
36394,Sheldon,"it’s axiomatically atypical. up until recently, they did not know alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical is demonstrably fallacious."
44221,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i didn’t get that."
37550,Sheldon,am i? let me tell you a story.
40296,Sheldon,excuse me. this is not about protecting my friend. i’m a big fan of homeostasis. do you know what that is?
43381,Sheldon,"well, look at that, even when i’m causing problems, i make the world a better place. hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?"
42429,Sheldon,"it’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
39586,Sheldon,"stuart, please. you’re being rude."
34728,Sheldon,"when i was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. it’s about an indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. for some reason i related to it quite strongly. "
38603,Sheldon,"of course. he will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and i will know it to be."
36614,Sheldon,"that’s very unlikely, mrs. koothrappali. if raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
41521,Sheldon,"no, no, no. i’m really good at this. all right, give me a hint. does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
39957,Sheldon,"i have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. but all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, i’ve been wasting my time."
45071,Sheldon,"hello, amy. it’s nice to see you."
34670,Sheldon,"fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. "
35780,Sheldon,your clothes?
45045,Sheldon,"at our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?"
40381,Sheldon,no.
45471,Sheldon,"yes, it is delicious. physicist, baker, lover, what can’t i do?"
34948,Sheldon,little ball of fur. keep rubbing. 
37625,Sheldon,i know where my feet have been.
34553,Sheldon,you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy? this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker. this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. 
40212,Sheldon,you didn’t have to do that.
34287,Sheldon,tell him about our iq.
35201,Sheldon,i think a birthday party is a terrible idea. i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish. 
40090,Sheldon,"do you understand how important hawking is to me? when i was six years old, i dressed up as him for halloween."
44542,Sheldon,that’s what you said.
38754,Sheldon,she stiffed you?
34519,Sheldon,what does it mean?
35883,Sheldon,this is banana bread.
42118,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. where’s amy?"
40176,Sheldon,what can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny lego indiana jones?
40539,Sheldon,"sorry? you may not realize it, but i have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. you know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as i want to. it’s exhausting. which is why, for twenty minutes a day, i like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what i need to do to recharge."
37711,Sheldon,"oh. hello, doggie. nice doggie. i bet you think you smell hot dogs. look, a cat!"
36901,Sheldon,i… i… i don’t understand. your grandmother’s alive?
36798,Sheldon,"i believe it means that the u.s. government is going to expel him from the country. he could then either return to his native india, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. personally, i’d choose pirate."
39465,Sheldon,"it just occurred to me that i never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. so i hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
43580,Sheldon,we’re not afraid of physical activity.
41276,Sheldon,"oh, penny, i see you’ve ordered pizza. i have chinese food. "
35843,Sheldon,what is shaking?
38876,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, i improved upon it."
41849,Sheldon,"ah, the worst for last. hmm. classic flakey."
34971,Sheldon,get him out leonard.
37982,Sheldon,all right.
44147,Sheldon,"oh, that part wasn’t so bad. i didn’t like them, either. but then i’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends."
37730,Sheldon, leonard.
36564,Sheldon,"you, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. that entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
37733,Sheldon,do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
43467,Sheldon,"well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again."
35896,Sheldon,"so, that’s all you’ve got? apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
35113,Sheldon,oh! i don’t usually pick up on those things. good for me. 
38696,Sheldon,"east texas. a warm summer night. a woman, mary, stands on a porch. in the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. woo-woo. the droning buzz of cicadas. zzzzzzzzz. a coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. aw-aw-aw! out in the woods, an owl screeches."
34621,Sheldon,well i’m sure he’ll be fine. he has his hammer. 
40717,Sheldon,but i came to file a complaint. somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
39509,Sheldon,"yes, cuddles. we cuddled. grow up, leonard."
36267,Sheldon,people don’t go in my room!
34523,Sheldon,"i didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide. "
34850,Sheldon,"details, leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. "
41735,Sheldon,"i don’t know about you, but i’m very uncomfortable with all this."
44298,Sheldon,"ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. i’m sure we can figure that out."
44616,Sheldon,"not yet. how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment? now, if this experiment is going to be valid, i suggest a neutral environment."
42788,Sheldon,"let’s see, my armies are going to attack the shire from buckland. and i roll a five and a three."
41156,Sheldon,another quest by wolowitz? count me in.
35822,Sheldon,is there some problem?
41132,Sheldon,father.
43715,Sheldon,"oh, no, he broke my collarbone. i can still hear it click."
45212,Sheldon,a little.
37444,Sheldon,what is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
41394,Sheldon,"april 13, a dark night, indeed."
40084,Sheldon,"oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
35441,Sheldon,would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
38553,Sheldon,i see. is that decision open for discussion?
34310,Sheldon,"in what space, sir, in what space? she’s two feet above the ground. frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. it would be a more merciful death."
35688,Sheldon,aren’t i?
40010,Sheldon,"thanks. ooh, listen, i wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry."
40049,Sheldon,oh dear. two suns and no sunscreen.
35739,Sheldon,"oh! worf, nice! too bad that’s a proper noun."
45631,Sheldon,hello penny. leonard just left.
36937,Sheldon,you know. mimesis. an action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. mimesis.
38238,Sheldon,"april 12th, 2005, bob’s big boy, toluca lake. raj had just introduced us to priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of hindu rebellion in the form of a bob’s super big boy hamburger. in order to preserve your friendship, you and howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. i had a patty melt."
40192,Sheldon,"look at us, leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies."
34944,Sheldon,"no, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. "
36680,Sheldon,they’re not my friends.
44986,Sheldon,"raj, show some compassion. those are things that we think but don’t say."
35971,Sheldon,of course i do. the essence of the custom is that i now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. it’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
35981,Sheldon,"if i were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
38314,Sheldon,no.
37278,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
44905,Sheldon,do people know about her? ‘cause she’s delightful.
43100,Sheldon,they didn’t mention you in the article. only me.
37127,Sheldon,come in. take a seat. subject has arrived. i’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
39495,Sheldon,"i knew it. just keep going, i guess i’m good at this."
44481,Sheldon,it only got three-and-a-half stars on yelp.
43771,Sheldon,and feel free to tell your guest that the myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. in case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
41725,Sheldon,"yay, penny."
40436,Sheldon,does it affect me?
45500,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ll definitely live long enough. vitamin c."
41242,Sheldon,"actually, i can’t. before leonard left, he made me promise that i’d take care of you."
43064,Sheldon,"yep, you’re mad."
44576,Sheldon,i won’t be there.
36509,Sheldon,i can’t sleep. how are you going?
37062,Sheldon,"that’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but i appreciate the sentiment behind it."
42258,Sheldon,i don’t understand. how could we all live together if i’m not there?
41046,Sheldon,"well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. last night, i was feeling in need of sexual release when i happened to come across your mother."
45034,Sheldon,to this day i’ve never touched stuart.
35733,Sheldon,bilurrrbe.
40085,Sheldon,how about dolphins?
38093,Sheldon,they do some of their best work at night.
34576,Sheldon,"yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
41557,Sheldon,"yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of professor proton was alka-seltzer rocket. you said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. remember? remember that? remember?"
37754,Sheldon,"that’s what typhoid mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
34531,Sheldon,"are you insane? are you out of your mind? are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem i’ve been having. "
43370,Sheldon,hello.
40982,Sheldon,"are you pointing out that california is a community property state, and since howard and bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?"
38612,Sheldon,"since we come in every tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, i believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, how are they hanging?"
35844,Sheldon,"it’s colloquial, a conversation opener. so, do you find the weather satisfying? are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
44217,Sheldon,"uh, can you repeat that? you’re breaking up."
42623,Sheldon,what’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. and there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what mr. bob eubanks called making whoopee.
34764,Sheldon,it doesn’t need proving. 
35928,Sheldon,"leonard moves the meeting not occur. is there a second? none heard, the motion fails. i’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with dr. stephanie."
37228,Sheldon,thank you. and what is my function as wingman?
37607,Sheldon,what do i search?
44587,Sheldon,i want another one.
35879,Sheldon,"yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike. who’s mike? why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
44657,Sheldon,"okay, well, i am sorry. i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. and no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
37832,Sheldon,hello.
39204,Sheldon,"penny’s brain teaser this morning. she and koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. she is dishevelled, and raj is dressed only in a sheet. the sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
41892,Sheldon,hmm. it never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
38992,Sheldon,this is moving faster than we thought.
45515,Sheldon,"you’re so kind. you know, i don’t know how i ever got by without you."
37414,Sheldon,"alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, i believe you know why i’m here."
40878,Sheldon,next.
37271,Sheldon,the only thing we can do. watch tv on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
41896,Sheldon,you’ll get ’em next time.
37348,Sheldon,"and that didn’t work out, did it?"
34885,Sheldon,"he’s a homeless drug addict, leonard, where is he going to go? boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
44636,Sheldon,enjoy having the place to yourselves.
35720,Sheldon,and i could not have done it without you.
41404,Sheldon,thank you.
45205,Sheldon,"not exactly the welcome wagon, but i’ll take it."
43631,Sheldon,"he said be honest, so i was honest. didn’t your mother tell you? it’s the best policy. so, what do you say?"
42645,Sheldon,"really leonard. insults? after i spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?"
21807,Sheldon,"cathedra mea, regulae meae. that’s latin for my chair, my rules. now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
34479,Sheldon,"i know, but why?"
40129,Sheldon,"oh, for heaven’s sake. i did your laundry, i pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, i, i even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
36023,Sheldon,just a toy robot?
45587,Sheldon,"i must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. don’t you agree?"
40040,Sheldon,is someone there?
43455,Sheldon,"perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. in one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."
35934,Sheldon,it’s not a big deal. we have latex gloves.
34375,Sheldon,"there is no more sheldon, i am the swordmaster!"
35765,Sheldon,"look, penny, i wish i could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else."
34823,Sheldon,it’s important.
36375,Sheldon,"if that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
45243,Sheldon,very well. prepare for a long night of deceit.
37030,Sheldon,they always look. it never ends well.
40673,Sheldon,two trains?
34835,Sheldon,"when we played chess earlier, you were terrific and i can’t wait to play you again. goodnight. "
36857,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. you can’t possibly win.
38587,Sheldon,that’s your app idea?
39019,Sheldon,this isn’t over.
44778,Sheldon,dayaj’a’ 
35745,Sheldon,onion rings?
38494,Sheldon,"congratulations. zack, how would you like to be superman?"
37951,Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. i need to get to here.
45296,Sheldon,i hadn’t thought about that.
34360,Sheldon,that wasn’t sarcasm?
42551,Sheldon,i told you to use the walkie-talkie!
41858,Sheldon,"howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
41558,Sheldon,"oh, wait here. i’ll get some alka-seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at bill nye’s house. as long as i’m not within 500 feet of it."
42454,Sheldon,"nice. you mean, like at parks and schools?"
41094,Sheldon,of course i do.
40548,Sheldon,"i don’t want another parking space. i want my parking space. it’s perfect. it’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. it’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks."
38532,Sheldon,"she befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
35451,Sheldon,make yourself comfortable.  sheldor is back online.
44828,Sheldon,"aw. yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in amy’s lab."
35626,Sheldon,and the comic book store.
36719,Sheldon,obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
39863,Sheldon,all right. i’m no stranger to a little gray matter. locus coeruleus. locus coeruleus.
41862,Sheldon,"i’m prepared to say i love it, as soon as i confirm there are no hobos aboard."
42952,Sheldon,"no, i said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science."
43598,Sheldon,"barry, a word?"
40784,Sheldon,"no, look."
42653,Sheldon,"well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves i bought for you to do the dishes?"
40002,Sheldon,when is the last time i asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
45818,Sheldon,thank you. i just want to say i’m a big fan. you’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
42576,Sheldon,"uh, mee krob and chicken satay?"
39937,Sheldon,"to paraphrase t.s. eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
37719,Sheldon,just making polite dinner conversation. your turn.
39886,Sheldon,"dibs? this is a university, not a playground. offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
44132,Sheldon,"all right. look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the magnus force issue should be negligible."
43151,Sheldon,and this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?
42486,Sheldon,"yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
42570,Sheldon,that’s humorous.
44175,Sheldon,"oh. oh, now, you know i hate change. say it."
34376,Sheldon,"goodbye, peasants. "
37942,Sheldon,i’ve decided not to procreate.
38536,Sheldon,"duly noted, steve from wichita."
45346,Sheldon,what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?
44428,Sheldon,"you don’t have the authority to save places in the line. if i do that, i’ll be cutting."
35673,Sheldon,"three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
34227,Sheldon,chat? we don’t chat. at least not offline.
43825,Sheldon,this is leonard. he’s your best friend in the world.
44741,Sheldon,"you know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em."
36134,Sheldon,"forgive me, penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
42173,Sheldon,come in.
38359,Sheldon,"that’s the work of noted hollywood costume designer deborah nadoolman. she also designed the iconic red and black jacket in michael jackson’s thriller video, which i’ve never viewed in its entirety, as i find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. and also, it’s really scary."
41631,Sheldon,yes.
45202,Sheldon,this isn’t fair. you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny.
44092,Sheldon,"uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of dr. sheldon cooper…"
42158,Sheldon,have you ever paid for a meal?
42539,Sheldon,"yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, i know."
21836,Sheldon,explain the couch.
36100,Sheldon,"excuse me, in what universe are slurpies icees?"
38460,Sheldon,what insult?
35778,Sheldon,"woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken."
44915,Sheldon,"you know, leonard, the more i think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through. uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, longclaw?"
43682,Sheldon,"it scared me straight, leonard."
43194,Sheldon,"well, i’ll give you three guesses why i’m so irritated."
42949,Sheldon,no. she helped barry kripke make an advancement in string theory.
44965,Sheldon,grape. i find it the most mild.
42330,Sheldon,that i couldn’t do it?
44201,Sheldon,"if she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd."
39242,Sheldon,a good wife would go to the store.
45764,Sheldon,hello.
45490,Sheldon,thank you.
43683,Sheldon,that’s preposterous.
39080,Sheldon,good news. i finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
41392,Sheldon,"wait, hang on. you’ve spent time with amy. can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?"
39936,Sheldon,"no, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and i’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. uh, excuse me. do you have access to my haircut records?"
42548,Sheldon,who’s he?
45206,Sheldon,"i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. i call these circles zones of privacy. don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. this circle contains only me and you. it represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. although, as i’m saying it, i may need to add dr. fink in here."
37943,Sheldon,the humorous implication being that i am wile e. coyote?
36764,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. ooh, penny, it’s as if the cheesecake factory is run by witches."
41490,Sheldon,"yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. my calculations were wrong. there must be some resonance between the elements i didn’t know about."
36374,Sheldon,hello.
44806,Sheldon,"what, you’re familiar with the reference?"
37479,Sheldon,"very well, a quick opening statement. like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. but first, i will raise a sixth amendment issue. i’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. so, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, sixth amendment. my milk stool is complete."
35769,Sheldon,"no one said anything of the kind to neil armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon."
39643,Sheldon,"the dark knight has your back. he’s scared, but he has your back."
40893,Sheldon,read it.
34894,Sheldon,"oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. "
45369,Sheldon,"you know, i felt the same way about the spork. uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? that’ll never work. spoiler, works."
40467,Sheldon,"my friend, wil wheaton."
42362,Sheldon,"i called the department secretary to see what happened. apparently, i have a reputation for being obnoxious."
41120,Sheldon,i’ll do it.
44228,Sheldon,how could you do that?
42044,Sheldon,"no, i am not. and this esram buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two ram types."
39107,Sheldon,"rajesh, i’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. my recommendation is that you gobble these up like tic tacs."
37266,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard. it’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
45307,Sheldon,that is true. did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
34485,Sheldon,morning.
45652,Sheldon,tell me what you see here.
38103,Sheldon,yes.
42606,Sheldon,there are post-prom mating rituals?
37808,Sheldon,"elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
44243,Sheldon,"i’m not being weird. i, it’s hard to explain."
41604,Sheldon,he’s right.
43012,Sheldon,"well, what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling. like, i can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. you know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something i’ve done or just in a bad mood. it, it’s incredibly stressful."
38013,Sheldon,i believe she’s experiencing her menses.
37595,Sheldon,"so, i hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
45234,Sheldon,"you can always watch the panels online. oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
44290,Sheldon,i’m ready to go.
40211,Sheldon,what do you see in her?
36313,Sheldon,"just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance."
39446,Sheldon,"well, no, no, i need something more permanent to join these papers. say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
37286,Sheldon,"good lord, i could not have made this easier. hydrogen atom, h, plus pigs minus pea, higgs. bow, general zod trapped in the phantom zone. bow-zone. pear. tickle. pear-tickle. higgs boson particle. how could you not get that?"
34667,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, we cannot do this without wolowitz."
39651,Sheldon,"if we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that ryan reynolds was a better choice for green lantern than lovable rogue nathan fillion."
34679,Sheldon,what about the won-tons?
41614,Sheldon,"i would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
44519,Sheldon,"hey, hey. she’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
40030,Sheldon,yes.
41332,Sheldon,"a crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
41682,Sheldon,"that’s right, sheldon cooper. he was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. which, sadly, he couldn’t build because santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium."
39067,Sheldon,i never bluff. ten.
35371,Sheldon,you’re wearing modern underwear?
38853,Sheldon,it’s not cool. it’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. how’d you do it?
37839,Sheldon,he must be very skilled at coitus.
35798,Sheldon,how is deep space nine better than saturn 3?
44106,Sheldon,yes. i believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
36110,Sheldon,that’s why it’s guarded by snakes. take some.
36571,Sheldon,"i’m on the horns of a dilemma. can you imagine me, sheldon cooper, at the north pole?"
45530,Sheldon,so trick her.
39214,Sheldon,"oh, there you are. leonard, i know you’re upset about recent events, and i have someone here to help. "
45135,Sheldon,"uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again."
35759,Sheldon,you have two strikes. three strikes and you’re out. it’s a sports metaphor.
36560,Sheldon,it doesn’t say. it must be an emergency. everyone at the university knows i eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
38766,Sheldon,that’s what tertiary friends are for.
39678,Sheldon,"ooh, a pocket watch."
35690,Sheldon,"oh, yes, it’s halo night. let me just dry my tootsies."
43294,Sheldon,i thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
42070,Sheldon,"i don’t know. hey, look, a quarter."
37174,Sheldon,"my pleasure. for a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a bose condensate."
41106,Sheldon,"oh, no, there are no kids. no, the, the show’s for me. come on. i’ll race ya, arthur."
41762,Sheldon,no. that wouldn’t be funny at all.
40902,Sheldon,interesting. a few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
42135,Sheldon,any chance that restaurant is near griffith park?
37221,Sheldon,i don’t drink.
34339,Sheldon,"i had no choice. i couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this."
42715,Sheldon,"welcome back. our guest today is a returning fan favourite. he puts the reading in your rainbow, the geordi in your la forge, and the kunta in your kinte, mr. levar burton."
40483,Sheldon,why’s that?
41757,Sheldon,why not?
39939,Sheldon,nope. 
36767,Sheldon,"there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
45224,Sheldon,i’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.
41377,Sheldon,"no, no, that’s not mine. it has a big spot on it."
43833,Sheldon,they have beach right in the name. what do you think?
43239,Sheldon,"i don’t recommend it. you’ll be doing it the rest of your life. anyway, if you’re looking for leonard, he’s with koothrappali."
36053,Sheldon,you’re driving me to the mall. i’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
42555,Sheldon,we’ll take some funyuns.
40779,Sheldon,yes.
35276,Sheldon,okay. i think this will be my seat. 
41274,Sheldon,"oh, right, a present for leonard. you better throw in that squirt gun."
37545,Sheldon,they expect me to give a speech at the banquet. i can’t give a speech.
37925,Sheldon,"apparently, a semi-incestuous teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown didn’t count."
45187,Sheldon,"if you think that’s more fun than talking to zachary quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy."
39639,Sheldon,"in case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
42210,Sheldon,i’m okay. how was the funeral?
41160,Sheldon,thank you. would you go tell everyone else that? because they sure think otherwise.
41165,Sheldon,"i know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
39646,Sheldon,"you did it, leonard, you stood up to your bully."
39506,Sheldon,"did you know that when alexander graham bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? ahoy. i like it. amy? is that you? have you been drinking? i’m sorry, i bet my sweet what? well, all right. we’re on our way."
38729,Sheldon,"oh, the humanities!"
40500,Sheldon,"not true. leonard made me like you. and let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. cheers, pal. ooh. boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. get the mad hatter on the horn, i’m having a tea party."
45385,Sheldon,"well, i remember waking up in the morning, amy rubbing vicks on my chest. and her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. i took some cold medicine to… i took cold medicine."
41724,Sheldon,"we can, but thanks to steve jobs, we don’t have to."
36429,Sheldon,why should i let it go? i saw it first.
38497,Sheldon,amy farrah fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. she isn’t the free spirit i am.
39474,Sheldon,"ladies, please. these four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. but through no one’s fault, penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. and again, i’m looking at no one in particular, penny."
43906,Sheldon,i look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
43445,Sheldon,"i see. well, i think i’ll be going."
42231,Sheldon,"no, i do. you’re upset about emily and you’re indian. i need to make you chai tea. now, i have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. do you happen to have any on you?"
34476,Sheldon,"that’s just the beginning. i also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. oh, glow in the dark tampons! leonard, we’re going to be rich. "
40401,Sheldon,"okay, i’m gonna let that slide because i know you’re hopped up on tea bags."
39367,Sheldon,what i’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. this is quite lovely.
34956,Sheldon,"assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. you would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
40097,Sheldon,walking away.
35094,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i know we said we’d take turns, but i think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here. "
39230,Sheldon,you didn’t let me finish. dinfast . are those soy-based candles?
44323,Sheldon,"well, you have to go. it’s penny’s first time leading the pledge of allegiance."
44608,Sheldon,the computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
42448,Sheldon,i have some odd freckles on my buttocks. can i make an appointment for you to look at them?
35726,Sheldon,"let’s see, today’s thursday. thursday nights, i eat pizza from giacomo’s. sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
37075,Sheldon,"biologically speaking, howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
41834,Sheldon,oh. is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
40169,Sheldon,said the hangman offering a noose.
37041,Sheldon,"that can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. we need to find a service station."
37067,Sheldon,my thank you was not sincere.
42204,Sheldon,that’s it? i thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
36469,Sheldon,i don’t understand. if you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
36818,Sheldon,for me.
45355,Sheldon,hello.
40838,Sheldon,"yes. all is forgiven, so come back home. i’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then i’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy."
42357,Sheldon,"a valid point, but unoriginal. b-minus."
41261,Sheldon,how about a hearty handshake?
38851,Sheldon,"howard, if i may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s nobel prize acceptance speech."
37186,Sheldon,i made tea.
45321,Sheldon,"yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple."
35211,Sheldon,that’s because i didn’t bring one.
44355,Sheldon,"well, the important thing is i said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and i was right."
42116,Sheldon,not so good.
44545,Sheldon,you don’t need him. i’ll represent you.
43920,Sheldon,"uh, stop selling it, kid. you won."
40285,Sheldon,are you sleeping?
43721,Sheldon,hello.
41116,Sheldon,"i wrote a fan letter to you when i was a child in texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. do you remember that?"
41446,Sheldon,i’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
39090,Sheldon,knight to old woman six-and-a-third. brilliant move. thank you.  will the two of you excuse me?
35605,Sheldon,"all right. hmm, huh, i’m sorry, i’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
43754,Sheldon,"well, by that logic, i should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? not to cast aspersions, but i can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that."
35776,Sheldon,what are you implying?
40591,Sheldon,"lipid residue. an anal autograph. a colon calling card, if you will."
42831,Sheldon,"boy, i’m not nearly as mysterious as i think i am."
45286,Sheldon,"oh, good grief. she is such a stickler for citing sources. those were amy’s words."
35687,Sheldon,"well, to paraphrase mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, i just have to put them in the right order."
38643,Sheldon,"all right, if no one’s going to guess, i was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
38196,Sheldon,he rejected train day.
37811,Sheldon,"and of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to dr. hofstadter."
38338,Sheldon,that’s not how it looks in the picture.
36795,Sheldon,the parade.
44681,Sheldon,"you know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, amy is just as challenging."
45384,Sheldon,nine o’clock? what happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
35415,Sheldon,i’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? or in your case the old community college try?
39903,Sheldon,"surely. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…"
40103,Sheldon,of course.
45615,Sheldon,"this is dr sheldon cooper. yeah, i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium. yeah, well i’m sorry too, but there’s just no room for you in my wallet. yeah, i understand, but it was between you and the museum of natural history and, frankly, you don’t have dinosaurs. well i’ll miss you too, bye bye. okay, i know you’re texting about me, and i’d really like you to stop."
35450,Sheldon,just when i think i’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
39190,Sheldon,"no. origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
35536,Sheldon,i had not considered that.
39935,Sheldon,"yes, there are."
35871,Sheldon,"to help. look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
43478,Sheldon,"now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as i see it, there’s a simple solution."
40114,Sheldon,those are howard’s.
40243,Sheldon,you can’t leave. i need you.
44185,Sheldon,that’s great.
36593,Sheldon,i need access to the cheesecake factory’s walk-in freezer.
43894,Sheldon,"i thought i could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. if we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon."
37852,Sheldon,are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
44111,Sheldon,"i’m glad you asked. amy, you have a confetto in your nose. no, no, no, no. other side. there you go."
45560,Sheldon,"gentlemen. you may remember dr. nowitzki, she’s back at caltech for her postdoc."
40968,Sheldon,"howard, i have a few questions. i found three bowling pins. now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?"
40117,Sheldon,"because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. you don’t think i’m condescending, do you?"
40833,Sheldon,um…
40009,Sheldon,"oh, i got that covered. headset. i won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying."
38659,Sheldon,"you’re an  actress, correct?"
39073,Sheldon,"you may have gone to cambridge, but i’m an honorary graduate of starfleet academy."
40932,Sheldon,"aw, for pete’s sake. can we go now?"
40634,Sheldon,"yeah, oh, i’m sorry. i should’ve mentioned this earlier. you’re not invited."
38982,Sheldon,it’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that i don’t find repellent.
37646,Sheldon,"no, not the wesley crushers. the wesley “crushers.”"
43075,Sheldon,"oh, i know. we could be the first to plant a flag on mars. we could be the first to watch mars attacks! on mars. we could be the first to say good lord, what on mars are you talking about?"
43851,Sheldon,"but someone might spoil the movie. no one can spoil amy’s birthday for me. surprise, she’s even older. who saw that coming?"
44767,Sheldon,it’s khoo-vakh. 
35794,Sheldon,penny.
34457,Sheldon,"this is great. look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. "
42091,Sheldon,"yes. as it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. anyway, it suggests that i set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in east texas."
38367,Sheldon,what happened to the leonard hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of star trek: nemesis?
45794,Sheldon,"you mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. there are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. how many can you name?"
36753,Sheldon,"look, leonard, penny made french toast."
41015,Sheldon,"or, the chainsaw."
40319,Sheldon,i am glad you asked. are you familiar with the higgs boson?
40987,Sheldon,"sorry, badgering me won’t work. what you should have said is, it’s pointless to keep this a secret because penny will tell us."
36484,Sheldon,you were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
34682,Sheldon,"you can’t go out, it’s halo night. "
40119,Sheldon,"au contraire. when i correct people i am raising them up. you should know, i do it for you more than anyone."
39399,Sheldon,"yes, penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
34539,Sheldon,i’m coming.
38864,Sheldon,"i think i figured out wolowitz’s magic trick, and i need you to pick a card."
44710,Sheldon,"amy farrah fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
44951,Sheldon,"in fact, i want you to keep the apartment flag, and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
43677,Sheldon,you’re taking advantage of us? we clarified nomenclature together.
40335,Sheldon,"yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, ms. jenson. fyi, there will be no breaks."
37499,Sheldon,you said we were invited.
40740,Sheldon,what kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
42502,Sheldon,"oh, i’m going with it. marty and doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. that means 2015 biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff. therefore, the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac. and not just never gets. never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t."
36158,Sheldon,the frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
42812,Sheldon,it’s not a basket. it’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century china.
38000,Sheldon,uganda.
40523,Sheldon,i’m quite sure. good day.
35179,Sheldon,not at all. frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. 
35980,Sheldon,"i have insufficient data to proceed. excuse me, miss?"
42587,Sheldon,"leonard, i was wrong. heaven does exist. and it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in sherman oaks."
36873,Sheldon,but i must have it.
36193,Sheldon,"hello, penny."
39485,Sheldon,"okay. you know, i heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
39300,Sheldon,you see a dragon.
35403,Sheldon,oh please. the only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
40447,Sheldon,it sucks to be you.
35644,Sheldon,"you know the pale blue of luke skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
41584,Sheldon,"the more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
36752,Sheldon,"dear lord, are you still going to be here on french toast day?"
43868,Sheldon, bernadette.
44755,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t mind, i’m very good at complaining. if it were an olympic sport, i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold."
45063,Sheldon,"good lord, i made you tea, just drink it."
44003,Sheldon,challenge accepted. sounds like it’s time for the sheldon cooper apology tour.
44503,Sheldon,and turned their phones off.
36973,Sheldon,"excuse me, miss. i’d like to order lunch."
34610,Sheldon,"if he understands that, you’re in trouble. "
41623,Sheldon,"all i know is you can only fit one of her in a car. and there’s the clown that came out of her. i really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best thanksgivings i’ve had in a long time."
43078,Sheldon,"good idea. and since you’ve had such a rough day, i’m gonna let you throw the pie in leonard’s face."
44765,Sheldon,"well, i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. i have no choice but to confront her."
36987,Sheldon,"your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
43356,Sheldon,what happened?
40527,Sheldon,"to be honest, i didn’t know you were here."
42610,Sheldon,"his name is alfred, and, yes, he does."
41230,Sheldon,"if i make this move, but i won’t because we’re having too much fun."
40281,Sheldon,"leonard, the transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. you know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. or a conversation about the transformers might actually be about someone in this room. i’m going to pause to let that sink in."
41294,Sheldon,"she claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. i have no choice but to assume the worst, given leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
36302,Sheldon,and you’re going to let her handle my food?
43440,Sheldon,"wait a minute. i know this may sound far fetched, but i’m on the market now. you know, if i dated mandy, that would teach both leonard and amy a lesson."
38382,Sheldon,"well, if it isn’t wil wheaton, the jar jar binks of the star trek universe."
45032,Sheldon,"so bernadette, if i express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
35174,Sheldon,why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   
35680,Sheldon,yes.
42434,Sheldon,"we got an eight-point-two. trust me, you’re happy."
38699,Sheldon,"glory be to heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. george, put down that pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
44432,Sheldon,"i don’t understand. you were happy to do this when i hired you. why, why are you upset with me now?"
36220,Sheldon,what’s real? what isn’t? how can i know?
38228,Sheldon,"well, i think i have a nice 2009 anamantle hc. it’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
40379,Sheldon,darts is a bar game. you’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
41471,Sheldon,when did we get to the cheesecake factory?
44635,Sheldon,i know. they probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
45516,Sheldon,"well, i thought that, too, but i’ve come to realize, i am completely dependent on you."
34535,Sheldon,who told you you could touch my board?
42169,Sheldon,hello. i didn’t expect you this evening.
45672,Sheldon,"hello, kripke. this classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of sheldon cooper. if you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to youtube. oh, and a hat tip to leonard hofstadter and raj koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
40859,Sheldon,no. it’s not the message.
42523,Sheldon,perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
42901,Sheldon,"only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. i have it ready to go, but i wasn’t gonna do it without you."
42052,Sheldon,wolowitz?
43832,Sheldon,i wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
41370,Sheldon,yes. yes. my brain is better than everybody’s.
43334,Sheldon,"oh, no, not at all. no, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."
42746,Sheldon,"with gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. if i show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible."
39336,Sheldon,"hello, wil wheaton."
44202,Sheldon,"okay, you got it. see, i was afraid it was a thinker."
45087,Sheldon,"so now you think you’re better than isaac newton? oh, no wonder women don’t like you."
44889,Sheldon,sorry i’m moving slowly.
41456,Sheldon,but you didn’t even hear the details.
42013,Sheldon,apparently any man is welcome in this house. why not you? i thought you were waiting in the car.
43949,Sheldon,"now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid."
36817,Sheldon,"yes, please.  how may i help you?"
42721,Sheldon,"and if i may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. but with all its ups and downs, i wouldn’t give it up for the world. except for now, when i’m giving it up. before i sign off, i’d, uh, i’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. it’s good for times like this. good night."
35404,Sheldon,"everybody has a date. even you, mario, going after princess peach. and what am i doing, i’m just enabling you."
37774,Sheldon,"i’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
43509,Sheldon,are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
37662,Sheldon,he’s evil. he plays evil mind games. did he tell you his grandmother died?
39241,Sheldon,"if we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
37744,Sheldon,we stayed for the california adventure water show. it was pure disney magic.
39633,Sheldon,yes.
36125,Sheldon,was that sarca..
45511,Sheldon,i apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
34981,Sheldon,i’ve decided you’re right. my career is not over. 
36765,Sheldon,"well, thank you. how thoughtful. would you like a chocolate"
35558,Sheldon,what took you so long?
44138,Sheldon,"a microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? you bet i am."
38267,Sheldon,"well, excuse me. that was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
41666,Sheldon,"i have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so i agree."
36784,Sheldon,"you mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
40532,Sheldon,you were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
43586,Sheldon,"uh, yes, i’m aware. but if i say i want to touch one of my friends, i’ll get called into human resources."
35818,Sheldon,plus i understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
45376,Sheldon,that didn’t happen.
43899,Sheldon,"you know what, let me pull a quick contract off the internet."
43655,Sheldon,"well, i never thought of it like that. boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?"
38961,Sheldon,with what?
37276,Sheldon,nothing. just wanted to see if you were both okay.
35022,Sheldon,"point of order. i move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. "
42420,Sheldon,"oh, listen to them. not even married and the honeymoon’s over."
42046,Sheldon,good night.
37128,Sheldon,"one moment. subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. apparently, ignorance is bliss. all right, let us begin. where’s your notebook?"
43511,Sheldon,it is extraordinary.
37344,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
41189,Sheldon,"it’s not that big of an opportunity. and even if hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. i mean, me? i’m interested in the big questions."
38534,Sheldon,"all right, i’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
44699,Sheldon,"my mother was at bible study. i walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. when i opened the door, i saw my father having relations with another woman."
42246,Sheldon,i just got called into president siebert’s office. the university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. they’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
42698,Sheldon,"oh, that one’s mine."
35466,Sheldon,"you can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
40466,Sheldon,what’s wrong?
45802,Sheldon,sing me soft kitty.
36532,Sheldon,"we don’t know. and if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know."
35206,Sheldon,"well of course i… oh! yeah, i have an idea, let’s throw leonard a kick ass birthday party."
35293,Sheldon,"you sound surprised. mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.  "
45774,Sheldon,what are you doing in my room? stop it. that’s mine. why are you so strong?
42870,Sheldon,"that nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."
44065,Sheldon,"but why? other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time."
37443,Sheldon,"yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and i will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
43530,Sheldon,"what a wonderful day, thank you."
34986,Sheldon,no. hmmm. what happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
34963,Sheldon,i sense a disturbance in the force. 
39519,Sheldon,"it depends on the activity. for a prostate exam, yes. if you’re playing vegas, i’d add sequins."
42739,Sheldon,"because in the last ten minutes, santa came to town, kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer. i had a drunk uncle who did all those things. nobody sings songs about him."
40311,Sheldon,call me a romantic. i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
40403,Sheldon,night of the living garlic bread?
38495,Sheldon,"excuse me, i believe aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
43415,Sheldon,i didn’t want to come in. i was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. so i’ll just stay out here and pretend that i don’t have to go to the bathroom.
42680,Sheldon,you know those confounded things make me dizzy.
44242,Sheldon,can we please change the subject?
44048,Sheldon,"oh. you got even smaller. i love it. uh, meemaw, this is leonard. leonard, this is my meemaw."
37968,Sheldon,"well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung’s disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
39483,Sheldon,"sorry. i’m a little distracted. i can’t seem to get in touch with amy. i tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
40079,Sheldon,"um, to go to jewish heaven?"
36848,Sheldon,"doing what?  all right, you’ve made your point."
36379,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry. well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. next question, are you fertile?"
41099,Sheldon,i’m getting worried.
41482,Sheldon,"let’s see, what’s next? okay, here. this is the magic marker i was using when i made the discovery."
42132,Sheldon,"hmm, what can we do that’s fun?"
35244,Sheldon,that’s what you did. i assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
42379,Sheldon,"interesting point. you’re suggesting that i have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
41179,Sheldon,"well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting."
36239,Sheldon,"socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
43967,Sheldon,"i hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke."
42735,Sheldon,"ugh. english pudding. you get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. i’m not going."
37345,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
41959,Sheldon,"maybe it’s just something minor. ooh, good news, the light just went out."
44624,Sheldon,oh. thank you.
39995,Sheldon,"yeah, i always thought if i were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from glendale."
42229,Sheldon,good. i thought she saw something on my forehead.
41551,Sheldon,"if you’re hoping to get in touch with bill nye, i can’t help you. i’ve been informed that he’s now bill nye the restraining order guy."
42881,Sheldon,"okay. hey, i thought you were trying to trick me."
44058,Sheldon,"a texas special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. thank you, meemaw."
36480,Sheldon,we have a bowl. our keys go in a bowl. you should get a bowl.
38718,Sheldon,sheldon is not going.
37219,Sheldon,thanks for giving me your limited edition green lantern lantern.
42717,Sheldon,while you watch me do it.
34839,Sheldon,"well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. "
41887,Sheldon,do you want to come with me?
42779,Sheldon,"you’re making it too complicated. why not stick to the basics? go shopping for clothes while leonard and i sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? i know i’d hate that. leonard?"
41410,Sheldon,"you know, riding with leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. the only car game he ever wants to play is the quiet game. and he’s terrible at it, i always win."
42071,Sheldon,meh.
42027,Sheldon,"well, someone has to."
43934,Sheldon,"ooh, perhaps it’s a heliosheath scintillation."
40692,Sheldon,"oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. no, he’s loving it. yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six."
44486,Sheldon,"that’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
40485,Sheldon,"fine. it’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. i was this close."
38009,Sheldon,"incorrect. obviously, the answer is cheese danish."
43717,Sheldon,excuse me?
38760,Sheldon,did you offer him a hot beverage?
43728,Sheldon,those are very wise words.
37521,Sheldon," it’s not the first time. i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. if only i’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then i’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly christmas letter."
39229,Sheldon,"all right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. i suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. but if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, hey, leonard, how was your dinfast with priya last night?"
43193,Sheldon,"amy, the daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. oh, no, i left my sonic screwdriver behind."
45097,Sheldon,thank you.
38518,Sheldon,stop counting!
36258,Sheldon,it’s brilliant. he needs to read it.
45048,Sheldon,hmm. did you have anything to eat?
44173,Sheldon,"that’s how you do it, wolowitz. now you see why he’s famous and you’re not."
37188,Sheldon,it’s a conversation starter.
39076,Sheldon,"ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
43289,Sheldon,won’t that void the warranty?
36089,Sheldon,"penny, penny, penny. everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. raj, you’re out. the good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. how could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is glutamine?"
38919,Sheldon,"of course you did. it was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. but the bullies took it from us. well, no more. tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. what do you say? who’s with me?"
45519,Sheldon,i’m confused. you’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
36025,Sheldon,it is extracted from the plant…
41319,Sheldon,i want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
36603,Sheldon,two for two. i’m on fire.
44621,Sheldon,very well. i’m on board.
43665,Sheldon,"right this way, uncle harvey."
39947,Sheldon,i tried once. they do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. it’s like sodom and gomorrah with mousse.
34325,Sheldon,"no, it hurt…  great caesar’s ghost, look at this place?"
39976,Sheldon,"that’s okay, i never understood them anyway."
37894,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
45715,Sheldon,good lord! would you stop that caterwauling!
36077,Sheldon,not really. i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
39787,Sheldon,"how about your grandparents, they alive?"
39557,Sheldon,"flaming spittoon. and for the record, i’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. we’re playing our inaugural round of wild west and witches, and i’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  patooie."
45730,Sheldon,"amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?"
37060,Sheldon,"now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. try not to choke on your own drool."
36358,Sheldon,"penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
36529,Sheldon,"well, i have and it will knock your socks off! good luck getting them back on."
35100,Sheldon,"but if we all go back to the same point in time, bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up. "
37699,Sheldon,"oh, that’s not necessary. you can go first."
39345,Sheldon,"of course. now get it yourself, you traitor."
36118,Sheldon,of course you will. it’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
40493,Sheldon,"penny, if you wouldn’t mind, i’d like to have a conversation about girls."
35736,Sheldon,…playing klingon boggle.
44149,Sheldon,"i do, but why do you care if i celebrate my birthday at all?"
39851,Sheldon,biologists are mean.
42383,Sheldon,i suppose that’s a fair request. there’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
42847,Sheldon,yes.
36787,Sheldon,have a chocolate.
35550,Sheldon,a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind.
39290,Sheldon,"all this years, i’ve been so wrong. the tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
37670,Sheldon,wheaton!
42758,Sheldon,"oh, not just something, no. it’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and i swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
37002,Sheldon,"sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. while my colleagues are off observing the leonid meteor shower, i have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. although my research is going well i do miss the warmth of human companionship. "
45175,Sheldon,"its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
42895,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll take it back."
35154,Sheldon,"i guess. don’t worry, i was going to order you cheeseless."
45479,Sheldon,"amy, look, i’m on a unicycle!"
40139,Sheldon,i know.
37903,Sheldon,"i did. he said, and i quote, ask penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
34471,Sheldon,"oh, that was a dead end. scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be."
34368,Sheldon,"run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. "
43066,Sheldon,"actually, as part of the application, i was required to make a short video answering that very question. you want to see it?"
41688,Sheldon,yes. my sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
43403,Sheldon,amy’s upset? is it about me?
43103,Sheldon,you should know i had nothing to do with that.
42276,Sheldon,and you couldn’t put it out?
42488,Sheldon,really?
42465,Sheldon,"i know that if i had a wife or a fiancée, i’d ask her first before i invested money in a comic book store."
35294,Sheldon,"they were clever, leonard. they exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. "
40275,Sheldon,i think i might have tartar buildup. my tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
39996,Sheldon,you’re right. i’m smart as a whip. i should be able to figure this out.
36791,Sheldon,this movie baffles me every time we watch it.
41995,Sheldon,"no, i’m just going to tell her i’m coming so she can give that good time charlie the heave-ho."
45775,Sheldon,this is my ticket to star wars….
37666,Sheldon,"wait! where are you going? penny, come back! i’ll get you ice cream!"
38047,Sheldon,"yes. this is enrico fermi, richard feynman, edward teller, otto frisch, and zazzles."
44890,Sheldon,"oh, no. a plaque? nobody wants to see this."
42591,Sheldon,"oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. all the squares have been purchased."
36179,Sheldon,"i was hesitant the first time i tried it, but i experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. it’s quite satisfying."
36336,Sheldon,it’s not my apartment.
43266,Sheldon,"perhaps howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing leonard."
42916,Sheldon,can i respond now?
39359,Sheldon,not yet.
34268,Sheldon,leonard has a lady over.
35643,Sheldon,"statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. i don’t want any hassles with the fuzz."
40660,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be silly. christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. why is this so important to you?"
35521,Sheldon,i’ll tell you why.
39277,Sheldon,"penny, a moment. we just had thai food. in that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
34931,Sheldon,"wait, where are you going? "
36513,Sheldon,homesick is a type of being sick.
36442,Sheldon,"then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
35748,Sheldon,did you protest?
35583,Sheldon,"i didn’t try, i succeeded. for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to de-bus."
43891,Sheldon,"okay. ooh, this is different, hmm? candles and music."
21803,Sheldon,"no, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
40127,Sheldon,"i did it. had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
38297,Sheldon,"is there anything else? where would you like to start? he refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books i lend him. he crashed the mars rover while attempting to impress a woman. he recommended that i go see the third matrix movie because it was, and i quote, just as good as the first one. if that’s not irresponsible, i don’t know what is."
43776,Sheldon,hello.
45261,Sheldon,there’s my pretty girlfriend.
21805,Sheldon,no! that’s where i sit!
44406,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. and any time you need a break from being bernadette the pregnant, bernatrix the warrior queen is here waiting."
42675,Sheldon,is he okay?
45181,Sheldon,"oh, i won’t. i only eat equilateral triangles. isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. you didn’t see that."
34855,Sheldon,"no, of course not, there’s no cousin leo, there’s no intervention, focus leonard."
43958,Sheldon,even the girls.
40918,Sheldon,"well, so much for your advice on complimenting penny."
43500,Sheldon,it’s bad enough i’m being taken against my will. i don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
45016,Sheldon,"you’re right. i have leonard and howard and raj, stuart, penny, leonard’s mom, bernadette, wil wheaton…"
45556,Sheldon,you know you just split an infinitive.
41867,Sheldon,"it’s like there’s a train in your mouth. howard: oh, yeah. i’ve got one. um, the amtrak wolverine coming into chicago. bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. ooo-ooo."
36447,Sheldon,"vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, zork. it’s the buggy beta version."
44195,Sheldon,but which one of us should be the party who…
35391,Sheldon,"well, why should i leave, this is my apartment too."
45547,Sheldon,and every morning.
34926,Sheldon,"well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
42073,Sheldon,why would i be jealous?
34911,Sheldon,"well, i didn’t hear the phone ring."
42296,Sheldon,yes?
42667,Sheldon,come on.
42038,Sheldon,"okay, now, the ps4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
40726,Sheldon,"it’s a comic book convention. you know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good."
41830,Sheldon,"me, too. but he wasn’t, was he?"
44364,Sheldon,i shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
42922,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. then no matter how he responds, i am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?"
37430,Sheldon,"well then, you leave me no alternative. from this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
45145,Sheldon,then what?
36390,Sheldon,"congratulations, i see you did your laundry."
37258,Sheldon,it was listed under seafood.
36926,Sheldon,"nothing. that, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
43228,Sheldon,not there. that’s my spot.
42029,Sheldon,"boy, do i have to urinate."
35326,Sheldon,"i’m constitutionally incapable. that’s why i was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of travers city, michigan. which you did not hear about from me. "
40727,Sheldon,i think you should turn on the gps.
41000,Sheldon,"you know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing i read in the closet. bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages."
41470,Sheldon,really don’t care.
36814,Sheldon,for me. you’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
34367,Sheldon,we could put her stereo back there.
43927,Sheldon,"oh, i see. how about now?"
37455,Sheldon,"okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
42536,Sheldon,"plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked."
38882,Sheldon,hello.
39640,Sheldon,you’re soft. this world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
45571,Sheldon,"hey, everybody. this is my friend, dr. nowitzki."
37622,Sheldon,pacific daylight time!
38694,Sheldon,i’m sorry. you’ll be spock?
34184,Sheldon,"you’re in my spot. this may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration."
21835,Sheldon,i’ll get to you later. what are you sitting on?
35970,Sheldon,"oh, penny. i know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. you haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation."
37409,Sheldon,it’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. i’ve had some time to reflect and i’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. it’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. butterscotch scone?
35805,Sheldon,what did i do?
37854,Sheldon,who’s going to tell whom about what?
39111,Sheldon,i’d like to buy a scone.
42185,Sheldon,"if we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight."
35658,Sheldon,"no, no. leonard, i’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
34710,Sheldon,"understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
34566,Sheldon,"tv , film, d&d, manga, greek gods, roman gods, norse gods…"
44171,Sheldon,"wolowitz, perfect. everyone listen to wolowitz."
36117,Sheldon,won’t it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
35045,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
40698,Sheldon,"now, there’s no need to get defensive. i’m not unsympathetic to your plight. my father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm texas day."
40798,Sheldon,"well, word around the university is i’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling."
44773,Sheldon,"wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
39973,Sheldon,"fine, let’s go. thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
43990,Sheldon,i can’t believe you’re not on my side. i was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
45675,Sheldon,is that really necessary? good lord. the interference pattern in the fracture. the motion of the wave through the molecular structure. i’ve been looking at it all wrong. i can’t consider the electrons as particles. they move through the graphene as a wave. it’s a wave! the moment to applaud would be now. troglodytes.
37472,Sheldon,excellent. go on.
35799,Sheldon,in what sense is that a compromise?
45639,Sheldon,"i’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
40782,Sheldon,i feel like i’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. why’d you stop?
36370,Sheldon,"oh, no, the new ones, they’re here."
43575,Sheldon,"no throwing, no catching, no running."
40972,Sheldon,"wait, can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?"
44283,Sheldon,you may need this more than i do.
45442,Sheldon,who’s ready to laugh?
38403,Sheldon,"are you sure you have enough comics? you’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. that’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing american comic book idioms like bamf and snikt."
34602,Sheldon,"yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is. "
39165,Sheldon,still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
36474,Sheldon,good. i’m glad.
43533,Sheldon,what’s wrong with your closet?
39574,Sheldon,i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
40283,Sheldon,that is literally the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard.
41051,Sheldon, mrs davis? i know you’re in there. i saw your car in the parking lot.
45356,Sheldon,because i am.
36064,Sheldon,"hi rebecca, i’m your new friend, sheldon."
39714,Sheldon,on a cold winter’s night?
39967,Sheldon,"maybe, maybe not. maybe tomorrow i start a bongo band and tour the world."
34659,Sheldon,because i am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating mother’s day. 
39000,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in the shower?"
41053,Sheldon,"i don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, i do want to express my gratitude."
41746,Sheldon,"now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
36482,Sheldon,where?
38038,Sheldon,a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. she was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
44087,Sheldon,"you know, uh, once i ordered an uber by accident. i just got in and went somewhere."
35501,Sheldon,stay close to the wall. avoid the mummies.
44929,Sheldon,"it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing, i skipped kindergarten."
45723,Sheldon,cherry stem! cherry stem!
45049,Sheldon,anything to drink?
36883,Sheldon,"look at him. wil wheaton, my old friend, i have chased you round the moons of nibia and round the antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!"
41468,Sheldon,can’t talk. in the zone.
45748,Sheldon,"it’s me again. i gave up string theory. you should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together."
39394,Sheldon,nice. kick a man when he’s down.
41397,Sheldon,"um, i’m putting on lotion. are you in or not?"
38235,Sheldon,perhaps. but they might ask me something else.
40386,Sheldon,stop that.
39695,Sheldon,"oh, no! they sent the wrong spock! live long and suck it, zachary quinto."
43918,Sheldon,that’s the one to beat. leonard?
35107,Sheldon,so it’s my turn. why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
42367,Sheldon,no.
35048,Sheldon,"it’s on, bitch. "
36690,Sheldon,"excuse me, wolverine: origin. miniseries issue two, page 22. retractable bone claws. if you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
40352,Sheldon,"he left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero."
36283,Sheldon,"no, it’s a novelty i ordered off the internet. now, did you hear the click?"
34890,Sheldon,sick? 
41096,Sheldon,and you just got yourself uninvited. see? i told you i’d find a tactful way to do that.
36418,Sheldon,"last night was wednesday. wednesday is comic book night. tonight, we’ll be going on thursday, because it’s anything can happen thursday."
34658,Sheldon,"every saturday since we have lived in this apartment, i have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal…."
40707,Sheldon,hello.
39609,Sheldon,"you know, the holidays are just around the corner. maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
35721,Sheldon,"it was a lot more than that. you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. how can i ever repay you?"
43060,Sheldon,"huh, that’s exactly what leonard, wolowitz, koothrappali, bernadette and penny said."
37265,Sheldon,"in anticipation of their arrival, i’ve bagged some evidence. one of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. you should be able to pull some good prints off this. and now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
34959,Sheldon,"so, you see it too."
41455,Sheldon,"well, can you believe she said i embarrassed her?"
42191,Sheldon,"howard, i think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
37887,Sheldon,"amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
43477,Sheldon,nothing odd. i just wanted to rub amy’s nose in it.
42034,Sheldon,here come the waterworks.
37387,Sheldon,"of course, my good friend. come in. help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
35027,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
43592,Sheldon,"not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me."
41342,Sheldon,come on.
43262,Sheldon,"bah, you didn’t say building on. you’re out."
36978,Sheldon,aren’t you going to ask me if i want a beverage?
34497,Sheldon,i’m not quite sure. it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. 
41119,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s true. a generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders."
37019,Sheldon,all right. let it never be said that sheldon lee cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
34807,Sheldon,"now, who would do that?"
34738,Sheldon,i’m not hitting on her.
42967,Sheldon,"okay, that’s great. now, let it go."
45768,Sheldon,hello.
41253,Sheldon,i’ve seen that. yeah. serial apeist. howard found it online the day we met you.
43234,Sheldon,"all right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to earth nuts, but i’m the alien."
41282,Sheldon,"that’s curious. if there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
40122,Sheldon,i want you to tell me that howard is being mean to me for no reason.
39926,Sheldon,help! somebody help!
34391,Sheldon,"oh, good lord."
40895,Sheldon,"well, i thought, if i have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would i want to share that with?"
39878,Sheldon,that the soap was…
36687,Sheldon,i did.
39600,Sheldon,"in the year 2000, pope john paul ii was named an honorary harlem globetrotter."
38794,Sheldon,"no, i’ll go to your haggis party. but i’m telling you, this is adness. this is utter and coplete adness."
36860,Sheldon,"photographic is a misnomer. i have an eidetic memory, as i’ve told you many times. most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. you had turkey and complained it was dry."
44480,Sheldon,mom.
37875,Sheldon,"impressive, but we must be cautious."
34974,Sheldon,"fifteen years old. dennis kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to… you know, that other guy."
44664,Sheldon,"well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
36331,Sheldon,"hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. i’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
42935,Sheldon,"i’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?"
38187,Sheldon,amusing. a play on the two meanings of cobbler.
42538,Sheldon,"well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in home depot buckets. that last one is quite new, but i have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list."
43973,Sheldon,hello.
43538,Sheldon,"as my relationships with penny and amy are currently strained, i’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
37260,Sheldon,the tv is gone.
37352,Sheldon,albert einstein.
39598,Sheldon,"relationship agreement section 4, boo-boos and ouchies. you have to take care of it."
36333,Sheldon,let’s think out of the box for a moment. how about a molecular sieve?
41206,Sheldon,"back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case, and back to the future iii was, get this, in the back to the future ii case."
43258,Sheldon,"get together tonight? leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do. go ahead, raj."
44709,Sheldon,"amy, you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women. and to prove how serious i am about us, i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level. "
42393,Sheldon,"you’re not going to do that, and i’ll tell you why. this is an institution of higher learning, i am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… you shot your spit in my mouth!"
38583,Sheldon,yes. and they’re still sticky.
39876,Sheldon,i’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
41239,Sheldon,"um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?"
40427,Sheldon,"ooh, my friend stephen just played the word act for 18 points. that’s right, i call him stephen now, because i checked, and he was not okay with wheels."
42712,Sheldon,"fancy a dip, my dear?"
34251,Sheldon,that’s interesting. leonard can’t process corn.
39898,Sheldon,"well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. as you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. with that in mind, i propose the following. i will take rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
45424,Sheldon,"bert, you’re tying up the line. my apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments."
36534,Sheldon,aren’t you going to check your messages?
37658,Sheldon,you weren’t the ball.
36263,Sheldon,are you going to be sarcastic?
37196,Sheldon,why is leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
39219,Sheldon,you can’t quit. that’s a court-martial offence. that’s punishable by… you can’t quit.
44597,Sheldon,with what?
36275,Sheldon,"all right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, i need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. easement. it’s a legal right"
40062,Sheldon,"oh, nice job, man-hands."
45387,Sheldon,"my pants are missing, i don’t remember anything. penny, this is your youth. what do i do?"
41533,Sheldon,"oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. go ahead, amy, say i’m annoying. i’m annoying. i’m annoying. i’m annoying. yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? look, you know you want to say it, say it. say i’m annoying. go ahead, say it. say it. say it. amy, say it. well, she can’t stand it when i’m right."
36921,Sheldon,are you making this a tier one friendship request?
37908,Sheldon,so this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
35031,Sheldon,why? 
37048,Sheldon,"all right, there’s no need to bark at me. according to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play doodle jump on his iphone. we have to fill these out. describe illness or injury."
42261,Sheldon,did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
42206,Sheldon,"oh, no. no. i’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 dr. whos."
37333,Sheldon,the same thing i’ve been doing for three days. trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
36796,Sheldon,will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
34701,Sheldon,it’s been in every wallet i’ve owned since i was five. 
41149,Sheldon,"oh, even better than money. you gained experience points."
35081,Sheldon,there’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
43167,Sheldon,"well, get over it. confidence is key in these situations."
40118,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, condescending means…"
44565,Sheldon,"oh, while you do that i am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts."
39034,Sheldon,thank you. not necessary. we know everything there is to know about kissing. it requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
39774,Sheldon,"all right. that’s it. we are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. we are now merely acquaintances. to amend the words of toy story, you have not got a friend in me."
21812,Sheldon,i can. i choose not to.
44180,Sheldon,thank you so much. i can’t believe you’re…
42694,Sheldon,"i was not panicked, and i am not overly attached to leonard."
36286,Sheldon,"fine! smoot-cooper. wow, what a diva."
40608,Sheldon,"oh, no, i see the confusion. no, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when i’m ill. when you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny."
45430,Sheldon,hold on. we don’t know anything about this woman. 
39641,Sheldon,"oh, there it is, tacos."
42913,Sheldon,"well, i’m responding to it."
36406,Sheldon,"they’re gone, penny. they can’t hear you."
39411,Sheldon,"all right, mom. when you’re at the ripley’s believe it or not museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. "
37151,Sheldon,why are you crying?
44994,Sheldon,"it was fine. other than the weird-tasting juice amy gave me, i slept the whole way."
44975,Sheldon,who’s killing the mood now?
36938,Sheldon,"i’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. let me try again. have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
41049,Sheldon,"i don’t want any more, but let’s go."
37368,Sheldon,"senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech, focusing on m theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
40494,Sheldon,"penny, please, i’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. and for the record, i had a full pubis of hair by the time i was 19."
39582,Sheldon,"strap on a pair? of what, skates?"
37617,Sheldon,that is what is referred to as a burn on you.
41398,Sheldon,"excellent. then i shall see you tomorrow. good night, dr. fowler."
41044,Sheldon,what? that was ambiguous.
41587,Sheldon,how is it i can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
44849,Sheldon,"amy, i didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. the flamenco."
42894,Sheldon,not just a sticker. that is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
35713,Sheldon,i’m invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
35941,Sheldon,what could i possibly have done to offend mrs. vartabedian?
37146,Sheldon,greece.
36093,Sheldon,i’m confused. i was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
34978,Sheldon,"well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything. "
36948,Sheldon,"come on, leonard, if you roll a six, penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. see what i mean when i say the fun is real?"
42301,Sheldon,"uh, i’m in kingman, arizona, and, uh, i need you to come pick me up."
34304,Sheldon,"thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
39191,Sheldon,here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
35963,Sheldon,it’s a rhetorical question. there is nothing more important than wii bowling night.
35051,Sheldon,"yes, well, i’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. "
37897,Sheldon, penny.
34212,Sheldon,"if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
36539,Sheldon,have you notified nasa?
37760,Sheldon,"i didn’t realize i was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. you enjoy canadian bacon. i’ve been to toronto."
45072,Sheldon,and that’s how you make effort look effortless.
44916,Sheldon,"that seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
43535,Sheldon,"no, i thought we were friends. you asked for a sip of my icee. if you had your own straw, i might’ve said yes."
36551,Sheldon,why does leonard get to go?
39263,Sheldon,"under my authority as a self-appointed member of the centres for disease control street team, these premises are condemned.  penny."
36782,Sheldon,"no, of course not. we’re talking very mild electric shocks. no tissue damage whatsoever."
43295,Sheldon,hello.
39796,Sheldon,"oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because i happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. please try not to see anything by this light. it’s not for you."
44288,Sheldon,are you trying to manipulate me?
39613,Sheldon,i don’t watch you 24 hours a day. i don’t know what you do.
34253,Sheldon,it took you four years to get through high school?
36404,Sheldon,did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
34314,Sheldon,i hardly think so. 
41653,Sheldon,"yeah, but what about the chinese research team? they found it."
44528,Sheldon,yes ma’am.
34923,Sheldon,i want soup.
39211,Sheldon,"for the record, i do have genitals. they’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
35464,Sheldon,"they make up a non-newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
40941,Sheldon,"i think that’s incredibly sexist of you. i believe in a gender-blind society like in star trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals."
35007,Sheldon,"of course he has, the oracle told us little neo was the one. you can see the matrix, can’t you."
43867,Sheldon, penny.
42323,Sheldon,"well, i was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. please? this’ll be quick. leonard? as soon as we get home, i want to have coitus with amy. okay, she can’t hear. the reason i called you is because i didn’t want amy to know i couldn’t make it on my own."
36620,Sheldon,"assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? did she say it?"
41002,Sheldon,although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
44236,Sheldon,"fine. i’m sorry. thank you for the thoughtful gift. i really do appreciate it. as you know, i had become attached to my old laptop. but i’m sure, in time, that this one will… jeepers creepers, that started up fast."
39024,Sheldon,fine. i’m nothing if not adaptable.
36251,Sheldon,yes.
40370,Sheldon,don’t know.
42157,Sheldon,"turn to you for wisdom? clearly, that cookie is mocking you. you’d never hear that kind of sass from a nutter butter."
34731,Sheldon,you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess punchali. 
38246,Sheldon,well alfred has secrets too.
42016,Sheldon,i didn’t know she did.
39458,Sheldon,it’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
42405,Sheldon,did you enjoy my lecture?
39982,Sheldon,she’s 93. she won’t be disappointed for very long.
37309,Sheldon,"it will take me a few days to get settled. after i do, i will e-mail you detailed pdfs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to bozeman, montana. in the meantime, please forward my mail."
37931,Sheldon,"based on the number of awkward encounters i’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…"
38680,Sheldon,"i’d like a frozen yogurt, please."
37946,Sheldon,"my family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
43660,Sheldon,perfect. now we really are in a mexican standoff. is this one of those times where i’ve won the battle but lost the war?
37603,Sheldon,i’m ready.
36233,Sheldon,"we’re not flying, we’re taking the train."
42535,Sheldon,"well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
45589,Sheldon,"hey, i hate to break up the party, but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed."
36145,Sheldon,i’ve got it. he didn’t remember me because the last time we met i was in a halloween costume.
45778,Sheldon,popcorn’s on me.
41778,Sheldon,i’m on vacation. what do you think?
42834,Sheldon,"well, i suppose…"
42282,Sheldon,can you break a twenty?
42270,Sheldon,i don’t know. perhaps.
39488,Sheldon,how can i? you won’t stop talking about it.
41124,Sheldon,want me to sing it again?
36182,Sheldon,i think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my physics department paintball strategy meeting.
36900,Sheldon,"no. i came here to defeat wil wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. but i can’t defeat wil wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. enchanted bunny."
34619,Sheldon,he’s not here. maybe the avenger summoned him. 
44799,Sheldon,can we just focus on the decision i’m facing?
38032,Sheldon,"that’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s!"
40729,Sheldon,"ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. i’d put on my listening ears if i were you."
40343,Sheldon,"if i’ve learned anything from british television shows on pbs, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind."
43843,Sheldon,"well, i’ll let you get back to your date."
39522,Sheldon,not at all.
41907,Sheldon,"well, that means not one, or not any. maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. well, i don’t know if i won that, but at least he’s upset."
44771,Sheldon,"excellent. i’m very hungry. speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?"
40083,Sheldon,"yeah, okay, i can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. let me try again. imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
38800,Sheldon,"oh, indians making tex-mex. might as well have had the chinese pizza."
40393,Sheldon,"interesting hypothesis. let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment."
37396,Sheldon,"indeed, the roommate agreement. i call your attention to the friendship rider in appendix c, future commitments. number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the large hadron collider, now under construction in switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
43914,Sheldon,at a neurobiology conference? what a mean thing to say.
41290,Sheldon,"yes, i am."
41886,Sheldon,"good. um, the conductor said if i come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing."
44930,Sheldon,"yeah, take whatever you want."
36863,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, no."
37063,Sheldon,“soft kitty” is for when you’re sick. you’re not sick.
36155,Sheldon,i have the same problem with him. my theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
43200,Sheldon,"then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night."
43393,Sheldon,"leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
41224,Sheldon,"well, i try."
45081,Sheldon,"i did this for free, let me get a little something."
37895,Sheldon,oh. i hadn’t considered that. i suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. and you don’t think i can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
40986,Sheldon,i can’t tell you that. i am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
39440,Sheldon,"yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. you think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. well, you’ve forgotten one thing. i am also a son of the lone star state. i’m texas through and through. and we know how to settle scores down there. if you doubt me, ask mexico."
40503,Sheldon,"penny, please, i think i’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing."
45681,Sheldon,"oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. uh, mute, please."
40452,Sheldon,you’re right. i guess i just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. he played! he played! coop and rolling thunder are together again. he was okay with that nickname.
38234,Sheldon,there it is. what if someone asks?
38933,Sheldon,"well, now i just feel silly holding it."
40070,Sheldon,"okay. leonard, even though i don’t have one any more, i hope you have fun playing with it."
45060,Sheldon,and it’s just the way you like it.
44029,Sheldon,"before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to emily."
43976,Sheldon,"i had a hundred and one fever. if that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"
41504,Sheldon,that’s the most romantic thing i’ve ever heard.
42126,Sheldon,"leonard, i could use your assistance."
38121,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my best friend. i’ve known you for seven years, and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler."
35271,Sheldon,leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? 
42785,Sheldon,"oh. well, that’s all right. there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
44538,Sheldon,"or in german, a besserwisser."
43169,Sheldon,you’re blowing it. we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him.
36518,Sheldon,thank you for letting me stay here.
38758,Sheldon,another compliment! learn to recognize them.
38771,Sheldon,"priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to, if i may quote howard, do the dance with no pants."
39222,Sheldon,no. jamba juice is for heroes. and that’s what we’re going to be.
42458,Sheldon,"you know, the more i think about it, the more intrigued i am about having our own store."
36231,Sheldon,"george smoot is a nobel prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. his work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
37674,Sheldon,"well, we could if it were true. but as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. the variable which has changed is the coitus."
39151,Sheldon,"this might be a good time to point out, howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. hold the door!"
45228,Sheldon,"no, absolutely not. you can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. that is a foolish expense, and i forbid it."
38065,Sheldon,"well, rest assured, i am in full possession of my faculties."
42163,Sheldon,"okay, i just did. what was it?"
44980,Sheldon,you know i’ve been wanting to go.
37182,Sheldon,"isn’t she brilliant, leonard? how i envy you."
43074,Sheldon,"i am. yeah, if i’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, i want you there with me. why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
40390,Sheldon,that’s rude.
35664,Sheldon,the truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. but why should i cater to second-rate minds?
38938,Sheldon,i am sheldor of azeroth. i want my things back.
42156,Sheldon,"no, it’s not."
36475,Sheldon,"i’m just in a good mood. while my compatriots are in las vegas, i will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal fortress of solitude."
42487,Sheldon,thinking caps on.
43330,Sheldon,"oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
34780,Sheldon,"of course you didn’t, he said little idea? "
38821,Sheldon,leonard.
45814,Sheldon,can you tell me the specials this evening?
41828,Sheldon,"thank you. my friend leonard said if i bothered you while you were eating, you’d think i was a creepy stalker."
37160,Sheldon,"excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earth. frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. a crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
42133,Sheldon,"oh, got it. we order a pizza."
38273,Sheldon,"well, sure."
39013,Sheldon,"very well. count the first, on or about the 28th day of april, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
41814,Sheldon,"it’s okay. you know, there, there’s always wondercon in anaheim, you know? that, that’s just as good. excuse me."
34583,Sheldon,"well, i actually might be able to help."
36057,Sheldon,excuse me. do you have any books about making friends?
41541,Sheldon,"so, uh, what do you say?"
41993,Sheldon,no.
41091,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, leonard, look. he’s still available for parties and events. we should hire him."
34826,Sheldon,"never mind. i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle, you’re in no state to talk."
39754,Sheldon,"guten tag, das youtube. ich bin ein bavarian."
45126,Sheldon,"i wish i never tried that device. and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time i mean it."
35144,Sheldon,no we don’t.
45009,Sheldon,"i’m the child she was worried about? i have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if i spotted them the potato."
35891,Sheldon,"it’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
36859,Sheldon,"from your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
43471,Sheldon,you wore it the night we went ice-skating. remember?
42580,Sheldon,"hold on, doctor. leonard, where are your social skills? this man is clearly upset. we should invite him in for a hot beverage."
36618,Sheldon,"okay, leonard, i know you’re concerned about disappointing me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
43265,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be offended. you know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
37963,Sheldon,"essentially, yes."
39471,Sheldon,okay.
44264,Sheldon,only you.
45189,Sheldon,"bert, i insist that you join us."
38897,Sheldon,"you know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
41071,Sheldon,i take issue with the word compulsive.
41079,Sheldon,let’s box it up.
42703,Sheldon,"and you said you pressed record. anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. and, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the stewards of gondor, and the japanese minamoto clan, but i’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, white flags, who’s wavin’ ‘em and why?"
44647,Sheldon,"like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
34892,Sheldon,"friday, was that morning or afternoon? "
39145,Sheldon,"regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. what’s more likely going to kill howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
36425,Sheldon,"oh, i forgot sensational spider-man."
36851,Sheldon,"nevertheless, i didn’t say it. anyway, i would like you to come back and work for me."
42343,Sheldon,swish.
38291,Sheldon,"correct. now to business. 18 years ago, i sent the fbi crime lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and dna analysis. why haven’t i heard back yet?"
44893,Sheldon,"rock, rock, water fountain. i am not proud of this, but i have been envious of your recent success."
38815,Sheldon,leonard the nucleus? that makes no sense. i’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
44205,Sheldon,are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘cause i did not l-l-see that coming.
38004,Sheldon,you’re right. my apologies.
39106,Sheldon,it was its own point. go on.
34864,Sheldon,break a leg. 
39137,Sheldon,"oh, i’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in d-dimensional de sitter space."
42849,Sheldon,"oh, no, it will. see, by keeping my mind engaged, i’ll become more focused."
37787,Sheldon,"then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
37823,Sheldon,i should’ve brought an umbrella.
38901,Sheldon,see if raj is done with pilates.
36049,Sheldon,i did learn how to swim.
44803,Sheldon,"apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all."
39160,Sheldon,"unless he takes bernadette’s last name. and considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
38478,Sheldon,was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? because you might have been watching nickelodeon.
37890,Sheldon,"i’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
40922,Sheldon,"amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, i’m obligated to do something nice for you. so, yes, i’ll go to your dopey play."
37123,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, penny, i don’t think so."
38459,Sheldon,"i thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. but recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. like you."
45696,Sheldon,you said to do whatever feels natural. this feels natural. certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
35178,Sheldon,"exactly. now, i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with. if you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
38733,Sheldon,"no, that can’t be it. and since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. and i got your back, jack."
44717,Sheldon,"well, for our first time hosting, i thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. you know, like how i practiced for that halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
34449,Sheldon,"no it doesn’t. not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. "
40206,Sheldon,that’s what you said about the green lantern movie. you were 114 minutes of wrong.
36826,Sheldon,"all right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
38827,Sheldon,"well, it would appear levar burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. um, i thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. okay. i’m sheldon. uh, for regular readers of the new england journal of high energy physics, i need no introduction. if you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. stuart?"
37878,Sheldon,"you realize, penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
45413,Sheldon,now navajo.
35987,Sheldon,"ah, good, penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. you’ll be pleased to know i’m prepared for whatever you have to offer."
40499,Sheldon,"it’s a band-aid at best. see, the core problem is that amy and wil do not like each other. which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. and i like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on star trek."
36205,Sheldon,"that is my desk chair, that is where i work. i don’t eat in my desk chair and i don’t work in my spot. i work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
36955,Sheldon,"hey, i thought of a game we can play in the car."
39042,Sheldon,what happened to you?
34834,Sheldon,"oh, alright. leonard."
45011,Sheldon,just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought i was.
38768,Sheldon,"well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, i stand at the ready."
39380,Sheldon,there’s a lot of harm in trying something new. that’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
45578,Sheldon,she was part of the american team at cern.
37313,Sheldon,"please, penny, as you know, i’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared a short video."
34669,Sheldon,our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. 
39744,Sheldon,here’s an interesting fact about flags.
43475,Sheldon," amy. hmm. tables work, too. good to know."
35282,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, no, no. let me start again. in 1935, erwin schrodinger…"
38177,Sheldon,"no misunderstanding. i’ve learned what that request actually means, and i don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
43937,Sheldon,"come on, daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist."
44516,Sheldon,"great, now i have to start all over."
38619,Sheldon,"all right. we have seven people, and two cars. in the lead car, driven by leonard, will be myself, amy farrah fowler and penny."
45683,Sheldon,"pee for houston, pee for austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. and shake twice for texas."
36547,Sheldon,that could work.
40856,Sheldon,hello. this is sheldon.
45289,Sheldon,i thought that was gonna break the other way.
42467,Sheldon,i’d like your honest opinion on something.
39763,Sheldon,"look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. really? you’re going to face armageddon without your orthotics? all right, your choice.  uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
35263,Sheldon,we’re not done? 
44829,Sheldon,"yeah, i have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
43326,Sheldon,"ooh, this is a good one."
38303,Sheldon,"sleep eludes me, leonard."
34528,Sheldon,"big boy!  someone touched my board. oh god, my board. leonard! leonard!"
34270,Sheldon,i really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
36785,Sheldon,"no, that would be incongruous, i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
36428,Sheldon,get her out of here.
40498,Sheldon,"the trouble isn’t with me, penny, it’s with your gender. someday, scientists will discover that second x chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle."
38573,Sheldon,"oh, well then, by all means, carry on. i wouldn’t want to impede your progress."
40624,Sheldon,"it hurts that you would lie to me, amy. i thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
41748,Sheldon,all of them.
38624,Sheldon,indeed. nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
40065,Sheldon,i didn’t. that was a lie. i opened my own toy. and it was already broken so i switched them.
35478,Sheldon,you were invited on a quest to the black castle?
35801,Sheldon,"it’s very simple. look, scissors cuts paper. paper covers rock. rock crushes lizard. lizard poisons spock. spock smashes scissors. scissors decapitates lizard. lizard eats paper. paper disproves spock. spock vaporizes rock. and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
34973,Sheldon,fourteen and a half.
42861,Sheldon,"thank you. oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. hey, this is fun. we should do it sometime when you aren’t all pms’ing. bye."
34510,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
39549,Sheldon,"i’m not sure how to respond, leonard. i don’t own amy. can’t own a person. at least not since? 1863. president lincoln freed the? slaves! come on leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
40891,Sheldon,"well, i don’t know what to say. this is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. and that’s including an amazing gift that i gave myself earlier today."
38398,Sheldon,"don’t worry, wil wheaton. i was just leaving.  da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
43763,Sheldon,"careful, it’s addictive."
35596,Sheldon,"if it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. that’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine."
44267,Sheldon,i suppose i could try getting rid of the golf ball.
39486,Sheldon,who thinks amy was eaten by a bobcat?
40391,Sheldon,"oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!"
44956,Sheldon,a functional mri of my brain. i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped.
44275,Sheldon,but i feel like i could reach out and touch you.
36703,Sheldon,i can’t take your money.
45235,Sheldon,"you put me in charge of your finances. if you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked leonard."
35409,Sheldon,fascinating.
43161,Sheldon,what are you talking about?
45043,Sheldon,only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
45176,Sheldon,kind of busy right now.
38035,Sheldon,"the motion carries. good day, amy farrah fowler."
36120,Sheldon,ask me why.
34725,Sheldon,that’s princess punchali. 
41010,Sheldon,pchew! pchew! pchew! pchew!
37193,Sheldon,"no, no. the comforting part is that the germans have a term for what you’re feeling. weltschmerz. it means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
40919,Sheldon,"she tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. don’t worry. luckily, i had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river."
39082,Sheldon,"it’s what i do. but wait, there’s more. i also invented two new chess pieces. the serpent, and the old woman."
44110,Sheldon,did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
44413,Sheldon,yes.
37093,Sheldon,"already taken care of. observe. this is a live shot of kripke’s lab via a mini webcam i was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. at the same time, i also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
39782,Sheldon,"hello, stuart."
35500,Sheldon,"there, problem solved."
45720,Sheldon,"oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
42718,Sheldon,"well, since you’re here, i’d like to get your opinion on something. in honour of black history month, i portrayed george washington carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. what do you think?  hi. my name is george."
42404,Sheldon,"well, not just him. may i remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team."
40224,Sheldon,"leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
44405,Sheldon,"i can understand that. from the moment people realized i was a genius, i’ve been sheldon the genius. although i’ve never really wanted a break from that, so i suppose i don’t understand. which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius."
34620,Sheldon,thank you for the clarification. 
38602,Sheldon,i was being sarcastic.
37601,Sheldon,alcohol? i don’t drink alcohol.
35489,Sheldon,"i did. i told her, i texted her, i sent out a very emphatic twitter. i even changed my facebook status to sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone. i don’t know what else to do."
43480,Sheldon,"well, right now, penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
42874,Sheldon,"yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. i have been hallucinating lately."
34400,Sheldon,no. the dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. what time is your date?
45703,Sheldon,would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? and the answer was elephant!
42081,Sheldon,"all right. i’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. i’ve got nothing to show for it, and i feel like a fool."
45653,Sheldon,"hello. this is sheldon cooper. i’m leaving a message for barry kripke. barry, it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. i saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. nevertheless, i hope you enjoyed it. i’m following up on our pending friendship, and i look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. sheldon cooper."
36325,Sheldon,"you’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. no. the moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in 1908. that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. i guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your radiohead."
41937,Sheldon,"no, thanks. we’re fine. i mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. i like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. but if those days are gone, they’re gone. it just makes me sad."
43748,Sheldon,that’s it. the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge is officially live.
35034,Sheldon,"oh please, you don’t even have a phd. "
45606,Sheldon,what’s happening.
43608,Sheldon,it’s a pokémon reference.
37827,Sheldon,how on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
44637,Sheldon,it’s penny’s bedroom. plenty of men have gone before.
41942,Sheldon,"am i missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?"
36744,Sheldon, yes.
42140,Sheldon,oh. who knows?
44552,Sheldon,"oh, leonard’s mad at me, so i’m making him lemon bars."
42581,Sheldon,"so have these two, and they’re having dinner with us."
39963,Sheldon,leonard sleeps while i play bongos.
35134,Sheldon,thank you for coming by.  hello.
35825,Sheldon,who would ask me?
39129,Sheldon,last one.
36842,Sheldon,you’re defacing my work.
40136,Sheldon,"all right, then. thank you, howard. please let professor hawking know that i’m available at his earliest convenience."
37785,Sheldon,"all right, let me show you some of the features of the room. first, windows. conventional. open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. over here is my comic book collection. feel free to browse. there’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
36112,Sheldon,don’t you need money?
36212,Sheldon,all right.
37211,Sheldon,"well, that’s certainly amusing, but i have no interest."
42792,Sheldon,all the time.
34636,Sheldon,"raj, raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
41641,Sheldon,good. i don’t deserve cookies. come in. wil?
43350,Sheldon,"yes. i thought, i can’t decide if i should watch the flash tv show. i know, i’ll ask amy. anyway."
40799,Sheldon,"well, first of all, i’m quite fond of amy."
36420,Sheldon,fascinating.
36332,Sheldon,"of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. to start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
40924,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, more rules? where does it stop? can i want to go because i have to want to go?"
37054,Sheldon,are you sure? you look a bit puffy.
41861,Sheldon,it’s magnificent. this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever.
41488,Sheldon,"this table, it’s in square centimetres. i read it as square metres. you know what that means?"
42510,Sheldon,"oh, i’ll check amazon."
45404,Sheldon,i swear.
42857,Sheldon,"well, as you may know, i’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and i thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"
34237,Sheldon,"i didn’t invent them, they’re there."
45260,Sheldon,"that’s very kind of you, stuart. check back in with me in july."
43402,Sheldon,"did she say anything about me? never mind. i don’t care. well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. just don’t be shocked when you find out that i don’t care."
44948,Sheldon,dividing our belongings is difficult.
34808,Sheldon,"forget your suit, look at my arms waving, i’m like a flamingo on ritalin. "
43212,Sheldon,i know. this isn’t the printout. this is my real face.
41921,Sheldon,"at the bottom. i must say, i’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this."
39032,Sheldon,i don’t know how to process that.
35667,Sheldon,"amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
41291,Sheldon,"uh, elephant?"
38491,Sheldon,"that’s sad. let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of krypton?"
35859,Sheldon,and you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
36556,Sheldon,i can’t comment without violating our agreement that i don’t criticize your work.
42533,Sheldon,"well, i’ll just google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
42247,Sheldon,"he said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. he then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face."
43037,Sheldon,thank you for walking me home.
43374,Sheldon,okay.
34927,Sheldon,can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
43896,Sheldon,yes. may i ask you a question before i give it to you?
34468,Sheldon,"oh, penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
45540,Sheldon,"hmm, yes. yeah, perhaps i’ve been harder on them than they deserve."
44152,Sheldon,i enjoy marching bands and tibetan throat singing.
40769,Sheldon,"yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!"
36296,Sheldon,"well, the contents are irrelevant. a legal bailment has been created. does that mean nothing to you?"
36122,Sheldon,"the learning opportunities would be abundant. additionally, i like having my belly scratched."
44548,Sheldon,am i allowed to inform him that colonel sanders was never actually in the military?
41790,Sheldon,"no, i don’t think you are. "
45210,Sheldon,of course. 
45436,Sheldon,you made me sit on the stairs and think about what i did.
41804,Sheldon,"well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. uh, penny, you’ll need a straw."
41654,Sheldon,really?
44187,Sheldon,that’s outrageous. this is our idea based on our research. how can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
45451,Sheldon,hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper.
42793,Sheldon,"oh, yes. i, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. did i say anything? no. i compromised and kept my mouth shut. like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you."
39403,Sheldon,"what do i say? i say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. stop it."
37882,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
35502,Sheldon,"i must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
40619,Sheldon,"oh, i’m hanging in there. thanks for asking."
36341,Sheldon,brilliant. men love bluetooth.
45092,Sheldon,"we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently, i was insensitive to him."
40268,Sheldon,wrong. she just took a sip from his diet dr. pepper.
40567,Sheldon,"oh, yeah. okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here."
42507,Sheldon,"yeah, he’s right. oh, here’s a thought. what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
36384,Sheldon,"alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. she’s still on probation, of course, but i like her."
37889,Sheldon,why on earth would we have sex?
36230,Sheldon,"i understand your envy. this is a can’t-miss symposium. there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
35367,Sheldon,oh-ho! really? well here’s another nit for you. the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
45040,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear? "
45342,Sheldon,"hold on. i see what’s wrong here. we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
44040,Sheldon,"uh, thank you. oh, meemaw got a new set of teeth. oh, but then she found her old ones. oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth."
42862,Sheldon,"oh. uh, i need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so i’m using darth vader, the joker, and godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. uh, i tried including taylor swift in the mix, but turns out i love her."
36544,Sheldon,"you don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?"
44547,Sheldon,okay. quick question. am i allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
40177,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now i’m in your apartment after dark. how much faster can this thing go?"
35715,Sheldon,"shh. all right, i’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
37630,Sheldon,"a common spare. the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant. before you jump on twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. i am the ball. my thoughts are its thoughts. its holes are my holes.  yes. tweet that, tweety bird."
40528,Sheldon,you think you don’t care?
35461,Sheldon,"you’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
36878,Sheldon,"my arduous journey, however, was for naught. although advertised to appear, he did not show up. it was at that moment, i vowed eternal hatred for wil wheaton."
35447,Sheldon,and you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
44715,Sheldon,"oh, uh, stuart, bert from the geology lab, and mrs. petrescu from downstairs."
40209,Sheldon,"leonard, where did you envision marrying penny?"
36082,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. i brought my new friend, barry kripke, home for dinner."
36059,Sheldon,oh! i love trains!
35129,Sheldon,"little miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. if i were to go into that apartment right now, would i find beanie babies? are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies? and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts? hello,hello kitty! "
37149,Sheldon,no.
43304,Sheldon,you call tech support.
44000,Sheldon,"terrific. now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could i say no to that face?"
44550,Sheldon,"yeah, we’ll do it in two. hi. i’m dr. sheldon cooper. i’m the actual brains behind this project. also, engineers aren’t real scientists, mit’s a trade school, and the death star is from star wars, not star trek. but otherwise, thank you for your service."
45207,Sheldon,"no, i was just excited to list him as a friend."
35136,Sheldon,"how can you be late, i wasn’t expecting you at all. "
39816,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. but whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no leonard’s day."
39315,Sheldon,"let’s see.  snake eyes. sorry, bud."
35878,Sheldon,"this is stephanie’s facebook page. now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
42147,Sheldon,where are we going?
42807,Sheldon,that’s exactly what i told him.
35181,Sheldon,i have an alternate proposal. 
35411,Sheldon,"it’s not hard. it’s simple. you can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
34432,Sheldon,a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
41926,Sheldon,wait. how do i know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
44646,Sheldon,"well, clearly, it’s not whatever i want, because what i want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
42886,Sheldon,"oh, i’m feeling much better. and i’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels."
38053,Sheldon,it wasn’t a breakup. a breakup would imply that amy was my girlfriend.
45632,Sheldon,aieee ya! xia si wo le. 
41505,Sheldon,"congratulations, dr. fowler. you just made the fort."
44444,Sheldon,"it went well. yeah, i’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. uh, stuart, i relieve you of your line duties."
40959,Sheldon,"oh, you shouldn’t have."
44381,Sheldon,"oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. i’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it."
37757,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43439,Sheldon,"oh, you don’t need to worry about her. she’s brilliant and attractive. she can do way better"
45637,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m moving out. "
45025,Sheldon,how would you feel if i contacted your mother behind your back?
37972,Sheldon,i do. and yet i’m doomed while you live on.
39953,Sheldon,hello.
44900,Sheldon,professor hawking.
38221,Sheldon,and is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
38126,Sheldon,hu-u-urgh! leonard not jealous.
36505,Sheldon,"there was a tall man from cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. my body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big cornish head."
40690,Sheldon,"ladies, ladies, please. we’re not here to talk about penny, okay? we’re here to talk about me. uh, i mean einstein von brainstorm. oh, darn it! all right, i guess the cat’s out of the bag. let me explain what’s going on. ricardo is really leonard."
42517,Sheldon,leonard’s right. we can’t just jump ahead. we have to watch the whole movie.
36465,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i can’t imagine any of that."
36511,Sheldon,"twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. it’s in a galaxy far, far away."
37087,Sheldon,"well, i suppose i could poison kripke."
37675,Sheldon,"good, good. i’m glad we’re still friends."
36550,Sheldon,"oh, an excellent idea! i could certainly use a break."
42269,Sheldon,"four keys! who does he think he is, a warden?"
43255,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
36541,Sheldon,"yeah, i have to say, i thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. "
39997,Sheldon, penny!
41247,Sheldon,here is a hot beverage to comfort you. it’s in a to-go cup. make of that what you will.
38557,Sheldon,"all right, let’s get right to the vote. show of hands all those opposed to leonard and his reign of tyranny."
45618,Sheldon,leonard! leonard i’m sick!
35582,Sheldon,i can’t take the bus any more. they don’t have seatbelts. and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
37590,Sheldon,i was wearing size a million pants.
41368,Sheldon,"no one likes a know-it-all, penny."
38618,Sheldon,"raj? what are you doing? i don’t think so. you’ve had your allotted six ounces. the first bathroom break isn’t until the denny’s located near bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder."
37335,Sheldon,"i don’t know, two, three days. not important. i don’t need sleep, i need answers. i need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
34896,Sheldon,what?
42903,Sheldon,my name is right on there with yours. that is a surefire mark of quality. that might as well say directed by joss whedon.
39905,Sheldon,"not pistols. minds. a trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. star trek trivia, star trek: next generation trivia, star trek: deep space nine trivia, star trek: voyager trivia, or model trains."
36323,Sheldon,"all right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from honoré blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? the assembly line, of course."
43449,Sheldon,you would never kiss me and make me say i love you and then break up with me.
41429,Sheldon,too late. no backsies.
41720,Sheldon,i would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
45558,Sheldon,i’m going to admonish you.
43856,Sheldon,"so, you agree with my friends that i should skip the premiere?"
21823,Sheldon,do you do this often?
44374,Sheldon,"eh, maybe it’s your voice. i’m gonna see if i can get james earl jones to do it in post."
38142,Sheldon,since we got home from the comic bookstore.
39965,Sheldon,richard feynman played the bongos. i thought i’d give that a try.
37870,Sheldon,haughty derision it is.
42181,Sheldon,"hmm. yes. look at him, amy. it’s such a shame. struck down in the prime of my life."
35021,Sheldon,"poor choice. gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. "
39517,Sheldon,"quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
41722,Sheldon,i did. 
38822,Sheldon,"we had a good run, you and i."
45349,Sheldon,science it is.
38873,Sheldon,"relax, we’re not under attack right now."
43197,Sheldon,agreed.
42632,Sheldon,me.
34504,Sheldon,can’t we just go to big boy? they only have one burger. the big boy. 
41630,Sheldon,"thank you. uh, the university made me come here. i didn’t want to. uh, big fan of the show."
42740,Sheldon,"my uncle was accused of that, too. it turned out to be legal in oklahoma."
44495,Sheldon,are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
34495,Sheldon,"um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when i called you an idiot. and i just wanted to say that i was wrong. to point it out. "
43548,Sheldon,i appreciate your interest in the apartment. i just need to ask you a few standard questions.
40236,Sheldon,i invited him.
35485,Sheldon,"oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. dr gablehauser, i have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. all she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
38249,Sheldon,ta-da. it’s short for da-da-da-da!
37723,Sheldon,you can’t cook and you made me this.
45645,Sheldon,forget it.
39297,Sheldon,not for you!
42460,Sheldon,"yes, but as a store owner, i’ll finally have a good comeback to, you don’t work here, shut up."
37713,Sheldon,"mmm, mmm, mmm. that’s eye-talian."
44638,Sheldon,i guess this is it.
40960,Sheldon,"no, you really shouldn’t have. i brought my own."
42688,Sheldon,try and stop me.
45409,Sheldon,yummy. and warm on my back.
37424,Sheldon,cholermus. it’s a traditional swiss breakfast dish. i’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of switzerland.
40262,Sheldon,wolowitz went to mit. what’s your educational background?
39890,Sheldon,we tried. his assistant said he was on sabbatical. although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
44808,Sheldon,thank you.
36152,Sheldon,"this should be fairly easy to deduce. he’s holding the phone to his left ear. ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
40366,Sheldon,there.
35110,Sheldon,it won’t change the past. 
38809,Sheldon,"i don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. apparently, because leonard is dating raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment."
45364,Sheldon,"ah, i’m back, you got me for eight minutes."
43185,Sheldon,"boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
43026,Sheldon,this is kind of creepy.
35495,Sheldon,"hang on, leonard, while i have no respect for leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
37420,Sheldon,you will?
39743,Sheldon,cut! take 47.
44693,Sheldon,"hmm? well, she spends her whole day scooping. one arm’s probably bigger than the other."
36956,Sheldon,"it’s called scientists. now, i will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. to make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. for example, abu musa jabir ibn hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology. okay, ready to have some fun?"
38535,Sheldon,a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
45017,Sheldon,"i was going chronologically. you’re right between koothrappali’s father and omar, the one-eyed sparkletts guy."
39499,Sheldon,"counterproposal. i will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good amy."
21806,Sheldon,"this seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. it also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. as a result, i’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
44389,Sheldon,"what an interesting question. when i was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. i could line them up, categorize them, control them. i guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t."
37850,Sheldon,counting this instance? 317.
38198,Sheldon,that’s what i said.
40347,Sheldon,notice people on your own time. we’re working.
44145,Sheldon,"please, look at this porcelain skin. i’m like a human sink."
35139,Sheldon,how exactly would one measure a sense of humour? a humourmometer? 
37729,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i misspoke. what i meant to say was my battery died.
39402,Sheldon,what sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a nobel laureate?
39948,Sheldon,"why don’t i let my hair grow out? um, why don’t i start wearing birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
36600,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
34804,Sheldon,"i really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, i came, there’s just no pleasing you. "
45099,Sheldon,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing. it could help me be a more considerate friend.
40024,Sheldon,"they had a make your own sundae bar. ooh, that was a night to remember. do you know, on the one trip, i just had a bowl of nuts."
44727,Sheldon,this is it. you are the practice round.
39893,Sheldon,kripke?
41288,Sheldon,have you gotten leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
38913,Sheldon,"i’ve never said these words before, but good job, howard!"
42171,Sheldon,"gentlemen, star wars day is rapidly approaching. we should finalize our plans."
45598,Sheldon,"although, amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me."
45090,Sheldon,"well, i thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out i was being offensive."
35534,Sheldon,"oh! no, i beg to differ. of the three of us, i was by far the most supportive."
36584,Sheldon,"well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
45798,Sheldon,obviously. i don’t even have water yet.
35869,Sheldon,"excuse me. when i come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
45237,Sheldon,i’m gonna go as dumbledore.
37006,Sheldon, penny..
41041,Sheldon,"well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. don’t just stand there. take your breasts out."
41331,Sheldon,"howard, raj. judas."
35906,Sheldon,"yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. i’m not strong enough, leonard, you’ll have to do it."
34448,Sheldon,theoretical physicists do not get canned. but yeah. 
37145,Sheldon,okay! at what point did you begin to feel lost?
36924,Sheldon,"that’s how my father always began our football conversations. and if you’d like, after the game, i’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
43900,Sheldon,hello.
41064,Sheldon,"that show ended with all the residents of new york either dead or unconscious. oh, now i’ll never know what happened."
39746,Sheldon,"speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? the tiny landlocked nation of andorra. oh, the next classic episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags is writing itself."
37516,Sheldon,"the ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. proof? i did."
40812,Sheldon,good.
37199,Sheldon,i blame penny.
44784,Sheldon,"wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room."
38150,Sheldon,"well, i have to void my bladder. it was nice spending this time with you."
34354,Sheldon,i may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
35482,Sheldon,"here’s the problem. i was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in buckman 204, and dr winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
37873,Sheldon,"well, then you might want to avoid east texas."
40547,Sheldon,"well, i’m not using my nipples, either. maybe they should reassign those."
45636,Sheldon,you must release me from my oath. 
40433,Sheldon,"good lord, what have i done?"
45758,Sheldon,yes. open it and check.
43664,Sheldon,"did you hear that, leonard? there’s plenty we could do about it. do you have a card?"
35909,Sheldon,like a gladiator!
35203,Sheldon,"have i pointed out that i am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. "
43057,Sheldon,i was playing got your nose. that’s how you get children to like you.
36492,Sheldon,how can one person be a whole movie?
44504,Sheldon,"you know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."
37017,Sheldon,"well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
36751,Sheldon,it’s oatmeal day.
45524,Sheldon,"thank you, but i’ll be fine."
36343,Sheldon,"oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
34442,Sheldon,use new eggs. .
39283,Sheldon,"i’ll let you know after tonight. unlike some people, i’m going in with an open mind. who am i kidding? of course we all know it’s o-gauge or no gauge."
34639,Sheldon,"you laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. "
43041,Sheldon,"as you know, amy and i have been together a long time, and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible."
42772,Sheldon,"fine. now that we’re not playing, you can be green."
39097,Sheldon,i’m working on my three-person chess game.
37770,Sheldon,"i want her to feel at home. i also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
43083,Sheldon,all i did was answer a few questions about the theory. and then expressed my gratitude that scientific american doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
40828,Sheldon,"oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. he would just go whenever the mood struck him."
38996,Sheldon,"interesting. so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
43442,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. forever. who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
37072,Sheldon,yes. look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
35957,Sheldon,superman doesn’t sweat on earth.
37651,Sheldon,"oh, yes. the losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. fyi, i plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited velikovsky hypothesis."
40791,Sheldon,so?
38210,Sheldon,five more minutes.
37298,Sheldon,why would you knock over a lamp?
38870,Sheldon,i’m reverse engineering wolowitz’s magic trick.
38969,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about dr. greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
36461,Sheldon,"darn tootin’, i win."
36790,Sheldon,interesting. sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. i wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
41766,Sheldon,but i don’t want a vacation.
43983,Sheldon,"oh, fine. then i’ll just hang out with wolowitz."
35412,Sheldon,penny.
44461,Sheldon,i most certainly did not.
35610,Sheldon,"no, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work."
40104,Sheldon,all right. what would you like me to do first?
35061,Sheldon,"hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia, but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist. . ow!"
41400,Sheldon,"well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. you see that cabin there? i read they were illegally squatting on indian land. yeah. personally, i think what we did to the native americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. oh, look at little laura ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. peanut butter? huh? that’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. if i knew this show was about time travel, i would have watched it much sooner."
42364,Sheldon,"oh, yes. fig newtons. i was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? and then after someone said newton, i was going to tell them they’re wrong. the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts. and then i’d throw the cookies away."
45682,Sheldon,"no, goofy, no."
38289,Sheldon,oh. all right. i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex.
44350,Sheldon,"interesting fact, in italian, the morta in mortadella means death."
42041,Sheldon,"yes. not sold separately. although the ps4 uses cool new gddr5 ram, while the xbox one is still using the conventional ddr3 memory."
40101,Sheldon,"great, thank you. oh, that’s terrific."
36281,Sheldon,nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw!
43213,Sheldon,roughing it? okay. everything looks so big from down here. this must be how leonard feels.
36344,Sheldon,we should get to work.
37673,Sheldon,"i think you mean telekinetically. and no, i just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and leonard are no longer having coitus."
37759,Sheldon,"yes. and until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. we’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. and now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
36075,Sheldon,"coming, kripke. okay. harness seems to be secure. small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. hey, this isn’t so bad. a bit like vertical swimming."
42492,Sheldon,wait. i’m confused. why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
39109,Sheldon,"oh, there’s no need to interact with me. i’m just here to observe."
42001,Sheldon,i saw you having naked sex.
44698,Sheldon,i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
41484,Sheldon,"well, you should be. my discovery is spreading like wildfire. unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
35233,Sheldon,i know everything about this stuff.
38663,Sheldon,"so, when could we start?"
37363,Sheldon,i could do that.
44167,Sheldon,"based on this pep talk, i’d say you’re still doing it."
45771,Sheldon,"hello, yes, i was hoping you could help me. what song is this? la, la, la, la, la, la, la. you don’t know? well, how dare you call yourselves a rock and roll hall of fame? my goodness. do you sing along to the greatest hits of elvis presley with that mouth? well, they were no help at all."
42976,Sheldon,hang on.
21843,Sheldon,yes.
39685,Sheldon,what time did you tell amy to be here?
42741,Sheldon,"oh, we’re not exchanging gifts."
34217,Sheldon,hi.
45134,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you should be. your socks were still in it. i had to throw it away. anyway, i, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict."
37457,Sheldon,but the only reason i was driving your car was because you were in distress and i was rescuing you.
42906,Sheldon,i don’t want to talk about it.
35421,Sheldon,"given this situation, i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with leonard."
34740,Sheldon,"luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
44731,Sheldon,oh. thank you. 
38361,Sheldon,because the print they’re showing on friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
42122,Sheldon,i drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for stephen hawking.
39819,Sheldon,uh-huh. and an irrational constant.
38096,Sheldon,this isn’t a desk. this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity.
35817,Sheldon,i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion.
34421,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about time travel again.
34867,Sheldon,"no, that’s the least of our worries. i’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie. "
34483,Sheldon,"yes, well i’m not a child, i’m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit. and i certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother. "
38290,Sheldon,"for the record, i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
35196,Sheldon,"it’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. "
44062,Sheldon,"how could it? i never told you, and you never bothered to ask."
39479,Sheldon,she popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
42475,Sheldon,i remember it distinctly because i had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of dr. seuss’s death.
40371,Sheldon,i am not a loser. pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
35058,Sheldon,"hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. what are you doing?"
45337,Sheldon,"by the way, your name can go first."
39409,Sheldon,i can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
36953,Sheldon,has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
38479,Sheldon,"oh, that’s easy enough. we’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
43822,Sheldon,i’ll show you.  everyody cut footloose. nope.
35718,Sheldon,godzilla clause?
35857,Sheldon,"uh, peace out!"
37107,Sheldon,my mother was right. hell is real.
40929,Sheldon,would it help if i gave him some pointers? i’m just funnin’ ya.
38383,Sheldon,"well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. no cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
45470,Sheldon,"yes. yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then i realized, it’s like the chemistry set i had as a kid. only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call poison control."
45164,Sheldon,that’s wrong.
43758,Sheldon,"well, that last hunger games was not my cup of tea."
35463,Sheldon,level three and she thinks she’s rich! what a noob.
36756,Sheldon,that doesn’t seem likely. her bed’s of sturdy construction. even the addition
35577,Sheldon,did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
43136,Sheldon,they did.
44497,Sheldon,"hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking."
38470,Sheldon,are you sure this is what you want to do?
36962,Sheldon,"i believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. the movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on colorado boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
40648,Sheldon,"good king wenceslas looked out, on the feast of stephen. when the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even"
37270,Sheldon,"well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. if so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
36737,Sheldon,a chicken that was owned by mrs. riley.
40068,Sheldon,"leonard, penny, i just, i want you both to know that i regret my actions toward the two of you. that’s a lie."
37173,Sheldon,no trouble at all.
40641,Sheldon,"fun? mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly."
37253,Sheldon,"yes, general tso."
36330,Sheldon,intriguing.
39084,Sheldon,"unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the grand empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
35255,Sheldon,"i like tangerine chicken, i’m not getting tangerine chicken."
36455,Sheldon,"yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
43017,Sheldon,yes.
35122,Sheldon,my spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with penny. 
44918,Sheldon,"although, amy and i did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
45366,Sheldon,it’s five and a half.
35602,Sheldon,"euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. but you have the conn. of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, i withdraw my previous objection. here’s a fun question. do you know what the most common street name is?"
40862,Sheldon,"she doesn’t want to live with leonard, so he has to come live here again. she’s the snake in our garden. she’s the reason we can’t be happy."
37117,Sheldon,"a little physics? there’s no such thing. physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
41496,Sheldon,"you know, frankly, i’d prefer a sex tape."
43506,Sheldon,viva la imodium. ay-ay-ay.
37558,Sheldon,i do like the x-men.
44838,Sheldon,clearly the combination of our dna is exceptional. our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. we’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
44505,Sheldon,"all right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
40295,Sheldon,"oh, very well. i can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. she told me that you were thinking of ending it with leonard."
44127,Sheldon,that’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. where’s the bathroom?
39842,Sheldon,"ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. now you’re an expert."
36531,Sheldon,"you’re making an assumption. perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
39971,Sheldon,"penny, you’re not trained. you’re not licensed. most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
43058,Sheldon,"ugh, this again. amy, i’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. i don’t need another one."
35230,Sheldon,really?
36688,Sheldon,perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
41525,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not cry.
35310,Sheldon,"yeah, but you were neither. "
35234,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
45772,Sheldon,why can’t i recall this song? this is taking far too long. the urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
41696,Sheldon,<i>she went into labor an hour ago.
39113,Sheldon,they were out of scones.
42378,Sheldon,"oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure."
40380,Sheldon,"well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. pool, beer pong, wet t-shirt contests, they’re all out."
40374,Sheldon,"it’s a game that i just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial spanish. um, ¿dónde está el boson de higgs?"
42971,Sheldon,"okay, maybe this will help. imagine you’re holding a pen. before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard."
35352,Sheldon,"i’m trying, i’m counting catwomen. she did make a fine mutant in the x-men movies though."
42462,Sheldon,"because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list."
43198,Sheldon,sure. it’s not like i was invited to richard feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
39826,Sheldon,"oh, president siebert, i assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions i put in the box by your office."
35563,Sheldon,"that’s northwest texas, i’m from east texas, the gulf region, home to many vietnamese shrimpers."
37764,Sheldon,yes. bazinga. leonard?
45677,Sheldon,"it’s actually not bad. but my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief powerpoint presentation. lights. why sheldon cooper, phd, should go to switzerland to see the cern supercollider. a powerpoint presentation by sheldon cooper, phd."
35095,Sheldon,"alright, i think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, i propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. "
37987,Sheldon,i think so.
41292,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i’m just distracted by something that happened over at penny’s.
35754,Sheldon,fine. mock parliamentary procedure. at least put it on mute.
42200,Sheldon,those are your jedi robes.
43563,Sheldon,"as the kids are saying today, talk to the hand."
40600,Sheldon,"no, you can’t use that one. that’s mine. uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental united states, alaska or hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in china."
44733,Sheldon,"stuart, wait. i do know what it feels like to be left out. "
40341,Sheldon,"it’s all right, alex. i’m not mad at you, i’m just disappointed."
43617,Sheldon,"okay. but don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man."
34806,Sheldon,yes. i’m sorry i tried to blow up your head. it was uncalled for. 
38723,Sheldon,that’s it. prepare to be minimized.
40901,Sheldon,what’s wrong?
41202,Sheldon,"oh, i see a space in the white zone. quick, circle the airport."
41055,Sheldon,"anyway, thank you."
36164,Sheldon,"leonard, i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
42985,Sheldon,"oh, that’s nonsense. i proclaimed my love for you. and the last time i looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis."
35701,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but apparently i’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
40099,Sheldon,i wasn’t talking to you.
35683,Sheldon,thank you. did anyone touch it?
43911,Sheldon,"i know how you feel. the best buy by my house is only the third best best buy. they have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a best buy the best best buy."
38022,Sheldon,so?
37985,Sheldon,okay.
37566,Sheldon,"okay, but don’t punch me."
35835,Sheldon,leonard is going to  the office.
34724,Sheldon,"so, how’s koothrappali d…. oh my lord."
44052,Sheldon,"you were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. there’s amy. i just know you’re gonna hit it off. you both have the same fashion sense. hello. come in, say hi to my meemaw."
39531,Sheldon,"it’s not a death ray. it’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. trust me, if i had a death ray, i wouldn’t be living here. i’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of earth gave me for not using my death ray. all right, and in three, two, one. "
40584,Sheldon,"well, howard, thank you. it’s quite a gesture on your part. you’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man."
38935,Sheldon,your doom!
40994,Sheldon,"anyway, um, i realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence."
39331,Sheldon,what are you doing? two fifty is already the discounted price.
45373,Sheldon,"hmm? oh, i did. it hasn’t stopped. i figured out a solution for our navigation system while i was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
42642,Sheldon,"let’s see. oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
45575,Sheldon,"yes, we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep."
39602,Sheldon,oh. i thought it was a game.
34917,Sheldon,is that a dog?
37494,Sheldon,"not finished. it is because of you that i now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee."
45716,Sheldon,"oh, that’ll be kripke."
39944,Sheldon,"penny, i know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
44525,Sheldon,yes ma’am.
38452,Sheldon,i reject it.
40478,Sheldon,i was out raising heck with mr. wil wheaton. four hours more and we would have closed down the hometown buffet.
44095,Sheldon,"you know what, that’s not a flag question. next caller."
43236,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm."
42128,Sheldon,that’s helpful. okay. of these four areas…
39066,Sheldon,"he does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
41222,Sheldon,you overestimate his significance in my life.
39121,Sheldon,"yes, i’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
42501,Sheldon,marty and doc never had have had brought?
45487,Sheldon,"well, it is. if i wanted to hold three things at once, i’d wear cargo pants."
41605,Sheldon,"let me ask you a question. at any point, was las vegas on its side?"
45124,Sheldon,fine. i’ll just give them the finger.
40225,Sheldon,"you don’t even know what it is, do you? the anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. as i am doing so eloquently right now."
42582,Sheldon,"here you go, doctor. red zinger with one teaspoon of honey."
43601,Sheldon,"that is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. if you’re worth your salt as an instructor, i should be ready by then. yeah, and be warned. i’m going to touch you all over."
35969,Sheldon,why would you do such a thing?
34752,Sheldon,"someone in sezchuan province, china is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. "
38039,Sheldon,regarding what?
35259,Sheldon,a second what? pair of underwear? 
36915,Sheldon,the line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
37509,Sheldon,it’s not elvish. it’s the language of mordor written in elvish script. one ring to
36646,Sheldon,you tampered with my experiment?
39017,Sheldon,irrelevant. leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. he thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
40249,Sheldon,"2311 north los robles avenue, pasadena, california to international space station. can you read me? over. "
41218,Sheldon,"everything i say is true. now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace."
40805,Sheldon,"no, i gave it to her well. now, over here, i was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…"
45314,Sheldon,"well, what do you know? here i was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
34888,Sheldon,it must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. 
38087,Sheldon,yes.
42450,Sheldon,"oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies."
41444,Sheldon,what on earth are you talking about? my behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. maybe your friend gunderson needs to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humour.
34848,Sheldon,"hunger? indigestion, i’m sorry i’m really not very good at this. anyway, penny now believes that on friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin leopold’s drug intervention. "
34296,Sheldon,"thank you. you’re not done with her, are you?"
37636,Sheldon,i’m not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep.
40790,Sheldon,we do?
38928,Sheldon,we are winged fury! which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
39570,Sheldon,penny. 
43521,Sheldon,"oh, please, the hulk would never get across the border with that temper."
44935,Sheldon,"well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t leonard hofstadter."
38652,Sheldon,do you realize that teaching is the first thing i’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in march of 1989?
44493,Sheldon,i hope you’re right. ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
43979,Sheldon,"oh, where are we going?"
34420,Sheldon,score one for liquor and poor judgement.
39355,Sheldon,"well, i started the list when i was nine."
42386,Sheldon,"wonderful. now, what about euler-lagrange theorems?"
43643,Sheldon,was she helping him with his research?
36914,Sheldon,it’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
35242,Sheldon,wo de zhing shi sheldon.
37777,Sheldon,"i would imagine it is. this is my friend and roommate, dr. leonard hofstadter."
38484,Sheldon,penny.
41946,Sheldon,"i wasn’t referring to this evening. ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that i looked like c-3po and pee-wee herman. and he called me c-3p-wee herman."
37520,Sheldon,ow! you hit me! i’m bleeding!
40289,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it."
37905,Sheldon,now.
43618,Sheldon,"interesting. i asked two women out today, and they both said no."
44019,Sheldon,"point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? because if not…"
36573,Sheldon,how can you say that? the scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
38147,Sheldon,"oh! good point, amy. yeah, building on your premise, leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the apple genius bar, what are you doing?"
44665,Sheldon,"wow. i anticipated we’d have problems, but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
37449,Sheldon,"undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. from left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of pasadena."
43689,Sheldon,"well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and wil thought i’d be good for it."
42809,Sheldon,how about one night and i let you whistle?
44382,Sheldon,"oh, i have quite the evening planned. our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."
35309,Sheldon,you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
43726,Sheldon,"i’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. and if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. and if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran."
34267,Sheldon,do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
40228,Sheldon,"yeah, wait, raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
43302,Sheldon,"oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
34606,Sheldon,"given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system. "
38751,Sheldon,are you just getting home?
41251,Sheldon,i see. i own nine pairs of underpants.
35490,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, i warn you i shall become very difficult to live with."
37069,Sheldon,"yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. it’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
45062,Sheldon,yes.
35216,Sheldon,"question, how am i going to get leonard a present before the party? i don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station. i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. "
38388,Sheldon,"i believe in knowing my enemy, leonard. had twitter existed at the time, would not general custer have followed the tweets of sitting bull? would not lee have followed grant? would not spy have followed spy? i have more examples, but excuse me.  hello. well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. test phrases? all right. imatote. ulbu. twad. all together? i’m a total buttwad. why are you laughing? hello?"
45365,Sheldon,"the coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. and over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. and lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
41399,Sheldon,"good night, indeed. what a rube. why would i put on lotion when i have such soft hands?"
35445,Sheldon,"well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein."
34456,Sheldon,"fine. we’re travelling forward at, good lord, 51 miles an hour. now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."
44809,Sheldon,really?
38642,Sheldon,must be out of range.
40562,Sheldon,"he’s in my spot. leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot."
41196,Sheldon,"um, can i have your attention, everyone?  that’s, uh, b-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. i would like to propose a toast to my best friend, dr. leonard hofstadter. he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and i couldn’t be happier for him."
37388,Sheldon,"well, of course you are. who else would you take?"
36071,Sheldon,"you know, i am a fan of ventriloquism. maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. he could talk while you drink."
42003,Sheldon,can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
42340,Sheldon,"yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. you would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked."
42893,Sheldon,"not at all. in fact, i have got something for just such an occasion. i was starting to think i might never get a chance to give it to you. good job."
34570,Sheldon,"if i have to, i can demonstrate. neeeeoooowwwww!"
36184,Sheldon,"all right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. did you see the episode of stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on earth’s athens and sparta? not important. leonard, raj and i are going to burst out the door and run away, howard will cover us."
45616,Sheldon,hello penny.  
37207,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, i have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
35645,Sheldon,i haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
35886,Sheldon,how can you be sure?
45078,Sheldon,"oh good, you’re here. are you still fighting? if you get divorced, do i get two christmas’s?"
35220,Sheldon,"okay, i see, so not a dvd burner."
37496,Sheldon,"this is stan lee’s front door. we were on stan lee’s curb, then we were on stan lee’s walk, and now we’re at stan lee’s front door."
44446,Sheldon,"no, it’s not fine. it is a breach of line etiquette."
34970,Sheldon,you think i haven’t considered it? you really think i haven’t considered it? 
35300,Sheldon,"i would prefer that you not, but i won’t go so far as to forbid it. "
37810,Sheldon,and not-a-doctor howard wolowitz.
45726,Sheldon,oh! it’s eating my face!
37488,Sheldon,please tell the judge i’m ready to apologize.
37118,Sheldon,why can’t leonard teach you?
34756,Sheldon,not to mention you’d have to power down on saturdays. 
34244,Sheldon,fine. 
44617,Sheldon,"well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in new mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. "
39748,Sheldon,"all right, that’s it. who con, you’re out."
41341,Sheldon,thank you.
37559,Sheldon,"i don’t know. if you’re my x-men, what are your powers?"
37070,Sheldon,"thank you. my mother is very excited. she’s convening her bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
41029,Sheldon,"eh, it will be. honestly, if i must endure a long and tedious evening, i’d rather it be with you on date night. but i have no choice. the tenure committee’s going to be there."
36083,Sheldon,d-d-d! that’s where i sit.
43995,Sheldon,now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in detroit longer than you needed to.
41956,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fine. it’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. there’s the remote yet distinct possibility that i may end up in south america."
41001,Sheldon,there’s nothing to worry about. your secret’s safe with me.
43303,Sheldon,whoa.
42382,Sheldon,"okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin."
34546,Sheldon,i still don’t care. 
44724,Sheldon,she’s learning english from tv.
39261,Sheldon,"for your safety, please wait in my apartment as i call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
45621,Sheldon,"so, this is engineering, huh? "
41147,Sheldon,"okay, literal goose bumps. look."
44678,Sheldon,i think we should see other people.
43704,Sheldon,"no offence, but this is pure 100% nimoy. because of your mother, you’re only 50%. which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
43363,Sheldon,"oh, no, not just a season. if i’m in, i’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
43047,Sheldon,"yeah. and if he ever goes berserk, i know i can outrun him. coincidentally, that’s also why i chose you as a roommate."
41773,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. take me with you."
41549,Sheldon,i’m surprised to see you here.
40813,Sheldon,"oh, really, leonard? are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?"
40318,Sheldon,"there are some charts in the back where i kept track of shape, colour and consistency."
43738,Sheldon,"oh, no, it’s all right. i think of my time with amy as a stick of fruit stripe gum. sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."
41635,Sheldon,"president seibert, i don’t know why you’re yelling. you’re the one who made me go on the radio. i was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. whoa, that one’s worth a dollar."
45741,Sheldon,"we’re fine, thank you."
38590,Sheldon,"i know, it’s baffling.  nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen."
43639,Sheldon,that’s right. and what did he do?
44489,Sheldon,she’s still not answering.
43361,Sheldon,"baffling, right? we were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. i stopped so i could ask the question. next thing i know, good-bye, kissy face. hello, yelly face."
36875,Sheldon,excuse me. are you saying that wil wheaton aka ensign wesley crusher on star trek:
41348,Sheldon,"no, oh, it actually is if you get the joke. it’s based on the premise that princeton isn’t a very good school. "
42194,Sheldon,"look at arthur, cracking up at a joke i told him. i’ll never hear that laugh again."
36136,Sheldon,outside? i just made cocoa.
39075,Sheldon,"are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
36890,Sheldon,fire demon.
39576,Sheldon,no. why is everyone so obsessed with amy and stuart? and whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
43331,Sheldon,"well, i had just begun puberty. it was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."
37164,Sheldon,"wait, excuse me, but it’s much more christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
41128,Sheldon,are you saying that you want me to be professor proton?
40185,Sheldon,"i love strawberry quik. it’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out pepto-bismol."
45167,Sheldon,excuse me. i have a girlfriend. i’m already king of the train store.
43928,Sheldon,"well, i can be helpful. give me something to do. you know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes i figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. it was my father. yeah, dad lost his job, but mr. hinckley gave me a fudgsicle."
40923,Sheldon,why not?
37413,Sheldon,hello.
35967,Sheldon,"in the pre-christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. this custom was later appropriated by northern europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called christmas tree."
40835,Sheldon,um…
38001,Sheldon,"kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. a central african power block is formed, colonizing north africa and europe. when war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. kenya withers, uganda triumphs."
45435,Sheldon,see? it was fine. i didn’t need a time-out.
38445,Sheldon,hang on. i don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
44536,Sheldon,"we don’t need howard’s cousin. no, we have me. "
39343,Sheldon,"it’s not that simple, leonard."
44531,Sheldon,"oh, what did he say?"
36443,Sheldon,would you rather i offer my personal insight?
34713,Sheldon,"with certain obvious exceptions. suicide, for example. "
44255,Sheldon,"in here is every clock radio i’ve ever owned. calculators, vhs tapes. yeah. oh. sporting equipment."
40678,Sheldon,"well, you remember when you told me i talk in my sleep? well, it occurred to me that, like most things i say, it’s probably pure gold. so i started recording it all, and now alex gets to comb through eight hours of what i like to call sheldon after dark."
45069,Sheldon,"never mind. you know, penny went to this spa to be away from you. are you sure you should be going there?"
42647,Sheldon,"i have to be honest with you leonard, i’m truly worried."
41313,Sheldon,i’d like a ride. assuming you actually do take me to work.
37101,Sheldon,leonard.
37249,Sheldon,yes?
42954,Sheldon,"is that all you have? shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? gee, penny, life’s giving me lemons. what should i do?"
38909,Sheldon,"be ruthless. you tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his internet service provider."
38949,Sheldon,hysterical.
44117,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, penny’s pregnant, too?"
45204,Sheldon, amy?
37842,Sheldon,"thank you. lift with your knees, not your back. good night."
41801,Sheldon,"yeah, no kidding. despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22. "
35430,Sheldon,"i will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. you kids have fun."
36869,Sheldon,how does it different from the money i have?
45010,Sheldon,"well, i was in my room, i couldn’t hear what they were saying."
44989,Sheldon,"it was. bernadette had her baby, i made it to wizarding world, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. hankius pankius."
35999,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming southern california robot fighting league round robin invitational?"
34412,Sheldon,"it’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, i read a paper about it in the journal of american neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but i think the basic science is valid, i probably have it here somewhere."
40680,Sheldon,"ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?"
45671,Sheldon,"no, i hear you fine. as i was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. the primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
39142,Sheldon,i would think he would know that.
45765,Sheldon,"and then the czech republic says to slovakia, i don’t think you understand how being broken up works. can you believe that? you’d think that the czech republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. and i don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders."
42689,Sheldon,why didn’t you stop me?
44361,Sheldon,"personally, i find the notion of external rewards demeaning. i pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."
43443,Sheldon,hang on. you knew that she was going to end it with me? did you try and stop her?
36994,Sheldon,"although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
38321,Sheldon,i’m quite familiar with dr. tyson. he’s responsible for the demotion of pluto from planetary status. i liked pluto. ergo i do not like you.
42313,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fine. why did you come?"
35418,Sheldon,"do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
40410,Sheldon,"okay. if you think being nice will get him to shut up, i’ll try it."
35108,Sheldon,"you can’t. if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. this is a classic rookie time travel mistake. "
44751,Sheldon,"yeah, we could get thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress."
39813,Sheldon,no.
34787,Sheldon,how’d that work out for you?
45478,Sheldon,are you sure? ‘cause i’m feeling a twinge.
38793,Sheldon,"but what if he does? i’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. and frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. i don’t know why he’s serving both."
39862,Sheldon,"you think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? they could do the same thing at any quiznos. and they’d offer to toast it for me, too."
40444,Sheldon,"yeah, i hear you, brother."
41385,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you why. amy ruined raiders of the lost ark for me, so now i’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
43288,Sheldon,"oh, no."
38732,Sheldon,"my stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. crafty old gal."
42601,Sheldon, penny?
38708,Sheldon,"well i’m sorry. it’s not my fault. i’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. oh, now, don’t you start crying. you get in that spaceship. mommy’s late for indian bingo."
35173,Sheldon,oops. 
38623,Sheldon,"copy that, red five. radio contact is sufficient. no need to extend your middle finger."
36403,Sheldon,you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
41540,Sheldon,"well, then, i’ll make this quick. um, i want to talk about the paper you sent leonard. now, i know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and i are friends again, i am at your disposal. and, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. or dead."
44421,Sheldon,she can cover it in a car ride? i could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
44447,Sheldon,what if every person in front of us let someone cut?
39636,Sheldon,you know what would be nice?
43670,Sheldon,uh-oh.
43416,Sheldon,i see. and is that why everybody was invited but me?
40611,Sheldon,102.2. exactly what it was half an hour ago. it’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
36496,Sheldon,"hmm, i see."
42069,Sheldon,okay.
41143,Sheldon,"it would? fun? okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play d&d? do you have a drug problem?"
45395,Sheldon,what does it say?
39672,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it’s the alcohol talking. go on.
44188,Sheldon,i know when i’m beat.
35210,Sheldon,luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. 
44949,Sheldon,"i have to admit, leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be."
42586,Sheldon,so what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
38926,Sheldon,"i almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the san diego freeway at 71 miles an hour. ease up there, lead foot. you trying to get us killed?"
35867,Sheldon,radiation burns. a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner.
34571,Sheldon,"well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
34582,Sheldon,and that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
38691,Sheldon,"it’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
42519,Sheldon,no.
44464,Sheldon,"no, i could’ve done more."
40876,Sheldon,"now, see, i never would have thought to do that. clearly, i made a good choice farming this out to you. but i am telling you, amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. anyway, my socks are on. let’s knock them off."
45198,Sheldon,what is there to gossip about? we barely have one.
36958,Sheldon,"hint, madame curie had her husband to help her."
34454,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, did i insult you? is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
41737,Sheldon,all right.
44165,Sheldon,i know that you worked hard to put this together. i’m sorry i’m ruining it.
36988,Sheldon,"that’s actually from my list, but leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
44612,Sheldon,i don’t know. what if living together kills the romance?
39808,Sheldon,and how would i do that?
44788,Sheldon,"hey, i get it. everybody wants to spend more time with me. i’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants."
41280,Sheldon,"oh, i can take a look at it."
34378,Sheldon,"wooh, i’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, i just built a virtual pool."
36652,Sheldon,"hello, penny. i realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may i interrupt this one?"
44043,Sheldon,that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her.
37143,Sheldon,"really? of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
36481,Sheldon,i left them in the bowl.
37370,Sheldon,"a reasonable question. i asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an apple store genius, and what penny does. now, since i don’t like touching other people’s coins, and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here i am."
38905,Sheldon,"no. glenn’s was leather. he was a simple ostrich. is! is, i haven’t given up hope."
38243,Sheldon,"you mean, you want me to keep a secret."
45499,Sheldon,to success without raj.
39351,Sheldon,"don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. and yes, it sure is, buddy."
45191,Sheldon,"well, i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
39333,Sheldon,killing you? i can’t breathe.
38229,Sheldon,excellent choice.
42572,Sheldon,are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? that wasn’t a joke.
38770,Sheldon,"actually, he can. the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters. if a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, raj. the code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. if true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is leonard."
44928,Sheldon,"for a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-d chess?"
38023,Sheldon,are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy?
43275,Sheldon,"at the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. it’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
41286,Sheldon,what’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
38312,Sheldon,"thank you for agreeing to see me, agent page."
43769,Sheldon,"well, i’m calling because thanksgiving is coming up, and i wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
37451,Sheldon,a summons for what?
41048,Sheldon,what do you think i should do?
43241,Sheldon,"oh, sorry. that’s not on the list."
37791,Sheldon,"sleep well, my friend."
21822,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
38566,Sheldon,"good morning, friend howard. friend raj. i see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. perhaps they would taste better out of these."
44818,Sheldon,you tricked me. you didn’t say one.
45815,Sheldon,the great and powerful woz.
36202,Sheldon,"hello, fastest man alive. want to see me read your entire comic book? want to see it again? something’s wrong."
35979,Sheldon,you put no thought into that.
44130,Sheldon,"oh, wait, i found something."
35938,Sheldon,"in leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying."
34557,Sheldon,"i was giving clear, concise orders. "
36698,Sheldon,"hang on. based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
43930,Sheldon,found one.
34355,Sheldon,"goodbye, honey puffs, hello big bran."
38579,Sheldon,could have beaten around the bush a little.
37360,Sheldon,shouldn’t you check your database?
42527,Sheldon,"well, i’m from texas and you’re from india, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. next."
42032,Sheldon,"because i’m trying to decide between getting an xbox one or a ps4. oh, pee, why’d i say that?"
42597,Sheldon,you think you’ve got problems. the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
39029,Sheldon,shotgun.
40364,Sheldon,"hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it."
40789,Sheldon,"i know. go ahead, mock me. just use small words so i understand."
40244,Sheldon,yes. you’re my ride.
21808,Sheldon,hmm.
36219,Sheldon,"but. oh, this changes everything."
39153,Sheldon,mountain elf.
38020,Sheldon,"oh, i never identified with the rebel alliance. despite their tendency to build death stars, i’ve always been more of an empire man."
35861,Sheldon,thank you.
39518,Sheldon,"please, that’s a seagull. if you’re not going to help, don’t help."
44455,Sheldon,what about joss whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
42320,Sheldon,"wrong. hunt’s. hey, amy, what do you say? you ready to move on to the mustard round?"
36151,Sheldon,"that’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. i was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
35277,Sheldon,"well, let’s see. we might consider schrodinger’s cat. "
38140,Sheldon,i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
36617,Sheldon,what?
39061,Sheldon,"excellent question. do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor frank gorshin, in the star trek episode let that be your last battlefield?"
35379,Sheldon,"if we were, the food would be better."
38955,Sheldon,"i believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. excuse me. dr. greene, question?"
38057,Sheldon,come in. 
40969,Sheldon,you health nuts kill me.
43088,Sheldon,grass is always greener?
40541,Sheldon,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… drat. i’m never going to get to forty-three again. one, two, three, four… rats."
35198,Sheldon,"what would we talk about? we’ve no overlapping areas of interest i’m aware of, and you know i don’t care for chit-chat. "
38569,Sheldon,i understand. and your loyalty is admirable. but what if i were to up the ante?
42392,Sheldon,why?
36964,Sheldon,"no, we’re not. we’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
40614,Sheldon,"great. now, this may look like a tic tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
36274,Sheldon,"no! leonard, let me tell you something. personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
38805,Sheldon,a margarita? where are we? what is happening?
44958,Sheldon,we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities. 
40743,Sheldon,"well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."
45001,Sheldon,"given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
42612,Sheldon,"i was, but penny didn’t want to. you didn’t want to. bernadette, amy, koothrappali and wolowitz didn’t want to. and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody."
41806,Sheldon,"good lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants."
45310,Sheldon,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
41254,Sheldon,"and it was literally the moment you walked out the door. but i see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. okay, here’s one i thought i’d take to the grave."
36577,Sheldon,"good news, gentlemen, i have tentatively accepted…"
34861,Sheldon,"well, uh, penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by dr emile farminfarmian."
43115,Sheldon,"fine. then grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side."
43922,Sheldon,sexual insecurity.
38790,Sheldon,"well, no, sir, and do you know why? in a word, tradition. every thursday night for the last eight years, you and i and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. but i guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
40187,Sheldon,"oh yummy, yummy! we should do this more often. uh-oh."
43087,Sheldon,squeaky wheel gets the grease?
39002,Sheldon,moot. rendered unimportant by recent events.
34739,Sheldon,exactly the kind of spirit with which princess punchali led the monkeys to freedom. 
38552,Sheldon,another happy accident.
41027,Sheldon,"i won’t be able to make our date night this thursday, so, bad news for you."
45607,Sheldon,"you’re not swelling, howard."
38616,Sheldon,you lied to me?
38598,Sheldon,you know what i’m going to do? i am going to sit here and just let them stew.
39687,Sheldon,"good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious."
43839,Sheldon,"i don’t care. amy, there was a song i couldn’t get out of my head. eventually, i realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, i can’t get you out of my heart. so, what i’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. the metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
41433,Sheldon,"uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. this is fun. your turn."
40991,Sheldon,"yes, it’s six against one. stand down, sir."
36000,Sheldon,"yeah, excuse me, penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar."
34654,Sheldon,"it’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
45697,Sheldon,"no, no, no, i’m just here for your money. i don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. explain it to them, siebert."
44085,Sheldon,"if any of you are looking for something to do on valentine’s day, amy and i’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of fun with flags. you’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."
44120,Sheldon,not to mention the impact on our social circle. everything’s going to change. howard won’t be able to come over as much.
35269,Sheldon,"a little crush? well i suppose so, in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy. "
38522,Sheldon,"i won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
40558,Sheldon,"i’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , i’m using it."
39828,Sheldon,i don’t need a vacation.
45658,Sheldon,"listen carefully. i’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter."
40385,Sheldon,i’m okay. i’m okay. i’m not okay.
34503,Sheldon,"i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that i’ll like the hamburgers here. "
35613,Sheldon,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! oh god, not euclid avenue! aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
43229,Sheldon,"hey, would you like to hear some songs i’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?"
36421,Sheldon,"to the comic book store. you’re probably thinking, the comic book store? on a thursday? why, i’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. what you have failed to take into account, penny, is that this is anything can happen thursday."
41960,Sheldon,"oh, in that case, i’d like to be partnered with my good friend howard."
40633,Sheldon,maybe i will.
43069,Sheldon,why? i really don’t understand what’s happening here.
34321,Sheldon,you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
35291,Sheldon,"alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
42968,Sheldon,"well, excuse me, amy was testing you. i was rooting for you. good job on that banana box, by the way."
40313,Sheldon,"oh, thank you, penny."
41087,Sheldon,"leonard, you’ll never guess who i just found online. hey!"
36657,Sheldon,"you’re right, leonard, it’s not a big deal. all you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. that, fyi, was sarcasm. i, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
41538,Sheldon,"anyway, i wanted to apologize. i am truly sorry."
34824,Sheldon,yes. 
43975,Sheldon,"you know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?"
38158,Sheldon,i don’t want the next level. i like this level. fix it for me!
45423,Sheldon,"hello, bert. what is your flag-related comment or query?"
43438,Sheldon,mandy chao?
40935,Sheldon,she’s remarkable.
44827,Sheldon,"look, look, here i am standing next to the incubator. uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
39599,Sheldon,i believe that you’re capable of great change. like when i finally got you to stop saying valentimes day.
34980,Sheldon,hey.
43111,Sheldon,well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill?
40482,Sheldon,enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. the manager recognized wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. right next to it. i was closer to it than i am to you right now.
44878,Sheldon,and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
43336,Sheldon,"you mean the box, right?"
45217,Sheldon,"thank you, bert. you’re a good man. that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
37124,Sheldon,"interesting. i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla, i could teach you some rudimentary physics."
44459,Sheldon,"you know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was rosa parks."
36820,Sheldon,i reject them all.
39350,Sheldon,"simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. you sicken me."
39897,Sheldon,fine. in the interest of preserving our friendship…
37600,Sheldon,i can’t do this. i’m going to faint.
44695,Sheldon,"i’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there."
45504,Sheldon,where did you move it?
34263,Sheldon,that woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
39398,Sheldon,"it was in my weekly e-mail blast. right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
36537,Sheldon,"do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of mountain dew?"
36506,Sheldon,may i say one last thing.
36877,Sheldon,"i was such a fan that in 1995, i travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in jackson, mississippi, wearing my star fleet academy cadet uniform in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package wesley crusher action figure."
40413,Sheldon,"no, i don’t think so. those dolls represent three things i do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. i think it’s a lost cause."
43101,Sheldon,"i know. it’s not fair. let the anger go, buddy. you just, you relax all your muscles. except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. let’s keep those tight."
39884,Sheldon,"what are you doing here, kripke?"
44035,Sheldon,"that’s me. bye, stuart."
38178,Sheldon,so we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
35160,Sheldon,why?
35232,Sheldon,"yeah, i suppose. "
39704,Sheldon,we don’t know that. not to a certainty. all we know is that leonard is home.
44896,Sheldon,"we, hang on, you’re my enemy. now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. and right now, i’m my own worst enemy. that makes you my friend. okay, i’m good to go."
37888,Sheldon,"yes, penny."
43657,Sheldon,"not necessarily. uh, many argue the essence of a mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
35337,Sheldon,uh-oh.
44842,Sheldon,"very well. oops, how clumsy of me. you know what? let me get that. hey. where are you going? i, did you even look at my bottom?"
43986,Sheldon,ugh. stuart.
43492,Sheldon,she was listening through the door. she wants me.
38516,Sheldon,thank you! thank you so much!
43446,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no. we are done here. would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
42298,Sheldon,"excuse me. is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. but, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, i embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. uh, sir, may i use your phone?"
43853,Sheldon,"in the past, you’ve come to me when i’m struggling with a dilemma."
35184,Sheldon,i weep for humanity. 
35241,Sheldon,"yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. "
34481,Sheldon,i went to the market with penny.
41579,Sheldon,i’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
38952,Sheldon,"really, amy? gossip? i’m disappointed in you."
42974,Sheldon,i think i left my pen in there.
35599,Sheldon,of course not.
37853,Sheldon,i have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
35032,Sheldon,what do manners have to do with it? this is war. were the romans polite when they salted the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
39776,Sheldon,"hello, dear friends. and dr. hofstadter."
44415,Sheldon,yes. kardashian.
37632,Sheldon,this is for you.
35630,Sheldon,i’m actually more of a theorist.
38489,Sheldon,of course. we’re coming as the justice league of america.
37184,Sheldon,"she was old and blind, leonard. what choice did we have?"
38247,Sheldon,"alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl. which i’ve now just told to batman. see, i can’t keep a secret."
38436,Sheldon,then why did you ask?
41135,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. leonard?"
40001,Sheldon,"oh, come on. it’s just a simple favour. now, when’s the last time i asked you to do something for me?"
39680,Sheldon,"well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
43656,Sheldon,"not technically. in chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. uh, you have plenty of moves available. you could beat us up and steal the money. you could kill us, you know. really, you’re only limited by your imagination."
40005,Sheldon,hello.
34311,Sheldon,"are you listening to yourself, it is well established that superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from earth’s yellow sun."
37998,Sheldon,"i’m coming, woz, i’m coming.  ow! aw."
41365,Sheldon,"nice try. now, element lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. helium has an atomic number of two. if you multiply that by the atomic number of n, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? i’m just funnin’ you, silicon. and that is the most common element in the earth’s surface. so that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."
44317,Sheldon,"well, isn’t man-man just man?"
36806,Sheldon,i’m sorry.
36385,Sheldon,you don’t jog.
39196,Sheldon,"i said, what are you doing here?"
39478,Sheldon,"ah. new topic. women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
35924,Sheldon,is that possible? i used to get those all the time. even in church.
43201,Sheldon,you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff.
36995,Sheldon, raj.
41072,Sheldon,"…tion. okay. for the sake of argument, let’s say i have a problem. what would be your plan for addressing it?"
34405,Sheldon,"of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
43804,Sheldon,"i know. it makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down."
36856,Sheldon,"i can’t. there’s a big dog outside. on the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles."
40266,Sheldon,it’s not fair. penny isn’t making leonard hold hands.
45106,Sheldon,you are happy?
42563,Sheldon,"it’s dark matter. when i entered the field of string theory, i was a prodigy. i rose to a position of respect, and i assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. now here i am in my 30s, i’m back at square one. and, frankly, it’s frightening."
37977,Sheldon,"no, the flash shirt is because it’s friday, but it’s nice when things work out. where’s your heart rate monitor?"
36419,Sheldon,"the one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? n equals r times fp times ne times fl times fi times fc times l?"
39055,Sheldon,"i understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but i really need to talk to smart amy now."
40507,Sheldon,"no, she won’t. i’m great."
35183,Sheldon,correction. missy can date whoever she wants. 
45557,Sheldon,i am. it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
37163,Sheldon,"you’re kidding, right? it’s a bust of sir isaac newton."
43572,Sheldon,"nah, i’ll do it tomorrow."
40908,Sheldon,much better than i expected. she even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. watch. welcome to my world. not welcome to my world. welcome. not welcome.
34719,Sheldon,bartenders are supposed to have people skills. 
34946,Sheldon,my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick.
43313,Sheldon,"well, my mother’s been there for every honour i’ve won since i beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. how does this look?"
42516,Sheldon,"oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. even bill murray makes that mistake in the first scene of ghostbusters."
34770,Sheldon,"penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that i’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. "
44758,Sheldon,i’m concerned about amy. she’s acting a bit odd lately.
42088,Sheldon,"break it off, shake hands, walk away."
42806,Sheldon,"i understand. either way, i want you to know that i’m aware of how difficult i can be. so i just want to say thank you for putting up with me."
41588,Sheldon,there’s probably a deep reason. which i’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
36453,Sheldon,more wrong? wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
43214,Sheldon,"okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, fort knox, fort ticonderoga, fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket."
43080,Sheldon,"oh, look, it’s the scientific american that covered the paper leonard and i wrote."
45660,Sheldon,"zoom, zoom, zoom! where’s the coffee?"
38357,Sheldon,high five. not too hard. thank you.
38509,Sheldon,"but they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. hello?"
35099,Sheldon,"wait a minute, i’d want to see that too. "
35212,Sheldon,the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
35096,Sheldon,"hold on. bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? "
41401,Sheldon,"that’s silly. almost as silly as dr. baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. this is more like little house on the preposterous."
44584,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fantastic, never been better. i had my first energy drink and i feel great. hey, you guys want to wrestle? we can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers."
36645,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in the world of emoticons, i was colon, capital d."
37167,Sheldon,no. isaac goes at the top of the tree.
37990,Sheldon,"coming! . greetings, friends."
38645,Sheldon,"good evening, leonard, howard, raj, freeloader."
42999,Sheldon,"well, i haven’t. and while they say never meet your heroes, i just don’t see how i could disappoint. who would you choose?"
36644,Sheldon,so we slept together naked. it was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
35388,Sheldon,"leonard, i am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an iq which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could i be?"
37635,Sheldon,"no, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton."
36624,Sheldon,she does have a short attention span.
44618,Sheldon,"interesting. if my official residence were across the hall, i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here."
42561,Sheldon,"i apologize. i just, i’m plagued by an internal struggle."
43759,Sheldon,"oh, fine, i won’t shut my heart to the love of jennifer lawrence."
41139,Sheldon,"go on, give him your lunch money."
36086,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. you are safe."
37515,Sheldon,you mean my ring?
41967,Sheldon, howard?
35237,Sheldon,"not now, penny, this poor man needs me.  you hold on, i’ll be right with you. what computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?"
38627,Sheldon,"amy, it’s penny’s turn. penny?"
36813,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. anyway, i got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
44239,Sheldon,oh. i am.
36730,Sheldon,"cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
38295,Sheldon,"you heard me say blu-ray, right?"
40874,Sheldon,"well, i guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, i think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. contribute to my work. ah, kids say the darnedest things."
45084,Sheldon,"that’s not a problem, we can figure this out. what are the reasons women reject raj?"
38465,Sheldon,oh. oh! you mean something i could do.
41692,Sheldon,"well, she’s due tomorrow. although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?"
42385,Sheldon,good. and how it relates to the calculus of variations?
37314,Sheldon,"that is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. lord, is it cold!"
38211,Sheldon,everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
35877,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, this is it."
42720,Sheldon,"well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of fun with flags is at an end. if i could, i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. and if you touched the ground, burn you. i’d like to take a moment to personally thank dr. amy farrah fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related internet info-tainment show."
34524,Sheldon,"well, there’s leonard.  and he’s either with lesley winkle or a 1930’s gangster. "
37551,Sheldon,i was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. summa cum laude is latin for with highest honours.
45328,Sheldon,"i’d write that down, but i can’t now, can i?"
38218,Sheldon, leonard.
39376,Sheldon,"the lord giveth and the lord bloweth away. well, mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
38395,Sheldon,"raiders of the lost ark, with 21 additional seconds. if i can’t see it, no one else can see it."
44025,Sheldon,"well, that is fine, because i’ve decided that i won’t be joining you. i’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse i feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
41054,Sheldon,"no, no. no, i learned my lesson. i understand that was inappropriate."
42416,Sheldon,"leonard, i assumed you knew. the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy, howard and bernadette, raj and his girlfriend, penny and chardonnay, penny and you."
40555,Sheldon,"leonard, you’re my best friend. why don’t you ever take my side?"
44089,Sheldon,"oh, and speaking of valentine’s day, i haven’t forgotten about you tonight."
43829,Sheldon,"well, i shouldn’t be surprised. there’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."
44309,Sheldon,amy.
37608,Sheldon,"oh, lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
37833,Sheldon,"yes. in 1917, when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper zur quantentheorie der strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
44967,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be. you were like a foxy tea kettle."
38100,Sheldon,"brobdingnagian, brobdingna… how did you even get it in here?"
45165,Sheldon,"well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
43093,Sheldon,leonard? have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
41749,Sheldon,who’s in the mood to laugh?
39058,Sheldon,are you suggesting i play dirty?
38837,Sheldon,"forgive me, but i think you’ll find my story is more interesting."
44287,Sheldon,"i hardly think so. you be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars."
38307,Sheldon,but why should that keep me up?
35330,Sheldon,"leonard, i don’t see how i could have made it any simpler. "
35077,Sheldon,"well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
37428,Sheldon,that’s a somewhat ambiguous response. am i going or not?
39844,Sheldon,way to kill the mood.
38021,Sheldon,"i know what your point is. you’re intimidated by amy’s intellect. to that i say, buck up."
43202,Sheldon,"i was afraid you might bring this up, so i have a work-around. there you go. as far as you’re concerned, i’m smiling. although, i must admit, i’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant."
36054,Sheldon,coping with the death of a loved one. my condolences.
45642,Sheldon,sit over there. baby wipe?
43910,Sheldon,i’m glad to see you made it safely. how’s your hotel?
44791,Sheldon,i hate your apartment.
42592,Sheldon,"leonard, as your friend i feel i should tell you something."
35616,Sheldon,"oh, but i’m not going home. it’s wednesday, wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. and then we have to stop at soup plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and radio shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. plus, we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets."
39726,Sheldon,"people, people, please, before you say something you both regret, i’d like to place my order."
43766,Sheldon,"she was late. and she found atomic spectroscopy boring. well, i wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals."
35246,Sheldon,why?
38349,Sheldon,"hello, all."
41698,Sheldon,and turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic slip ‘n slide.
38466,Sheldon,"well, i was hoping to avoid this. but i might as well get it over with. thank you, penny. i’ll let you know what happens."
41880,Sheldon,how is that possible? i’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
38792,Sheldon,i can’t do that. what if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
39291,Sheldon,"better than james bond, because he’s tinier."
42571,Sheldon,"yeah, i bet you leave your patients in stitches. that was also humorous."
37762,Sheldon,go ahead.
45114,Sheldon,"oh, ooh! and that makes leonard angry."
44105,Sheldon,"raj, now, i’m sorry you’re suffering. when amy and i were broken up, i also suffered. and this may sound surprising, but i’m grateful for having gone through it."
36241,Sheldon,"gentlemen, this is the coast starlight, one of the great american trains operating on one of the classic american routes. on this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of costcos, jiffy lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
34741,Sheldon,i could eat. 
40879,Sheldon,mmm.
35017,Sheldon,"by that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition."
36669,Sheldon,my credibility may have been damaged…
36608,Sheldon,"gentlemen, use your imagination. innovate. did han solo let luke skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of hoth? no. he cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
35036,Sheldon,"leonard, excellent, i want to show you something."
40440,Sheldon,how would i know? i’m not listening to you.
45406,Sheldon,the top secret military information i’m about to tell you.
39424,Sheldon,"thanks, mom.you’re the best."
35655,Sheldon,"leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
43488,Sheldon,"yeah, there’s fisherman’s wharf and alcatraz and cable cars. we’re gonna have so much fun."
39157,Sheldon,it wouldn’help. the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
38076,Sheldon,"thank you, amy. here’s your cat. and here’s your $20."
40900,Sheldon,"yeah. well, you came to the right place."
40326,Sheldon,"you said it, not me."
37183,Sheldon,september 22nd.
44488,Sheldon,i think it’s pretty obvious. they don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
39626,Sheldon,you really need to work on your penmanship.
43023,Sheldon,"okay. wait, hang on. bladder check. we’re good to go."
35087,Sheldon,"it’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
38138,Sheldon,are you ill?
36892,Sheldon,brimstone.
35176,Sheldon,"let me explain. you see, i’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. "
41652,Sheldon,i’m in a great mood.
41883,Sheldon,"oh, really? because i remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
40239,Sheldon,every time you drink alcohol.
36052,Sheldon,that’s insane on the face of it. come on.
36001,Sheldon,his name is monte.
36889,Sheldon,luminescence spell.
42681,Sheldon,there was a large plant in the lobby. it kept looking like the outside.
37717,Sheldon,"do you have a stomach ache, too?"
42477,Sheldon,"oh, really? since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?"
36699,Sheldon,"in 1890, emile dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. a precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
35142,Sheldon,"they call me a genius because i’m a genius. tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds, and that i’m having regular bowel movements. enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
44026,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been on a little trip myself recently. not to sin city but to sincere city. where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth."
39288,Sheldon,not my fault. you said there’d be other scientists there my age.
44964,Sheldon,"that’s a bit childish, isn’t it? "
45098,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re just showing off."
39347,Sheldon,mohammed lee.
39079,Sheldon,"you’re preaching to the choir, sister."
36021,Sheldon,"so what do you think, howard? it’s not that bad, right?"
34577,Sheldon,this party is just going to suck. 
40197,Sheldon,"no! would you please stop referencing that infernal book? for example, this morning, i was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. oh, what has that vixen done to me, leonard? and how do i make it stop?"
42107,Sheldon,"you want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? you know, why don’t you break up with penny and start dating a brown bear?"
37248,Sheldon,"good night, puny human! ."
43297,Sheldon,you can’t return it. howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
39606,Sheldon,"was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
37033,Sheldon,all righty.
43596,Sheldon,you really think so?
43391,Sheldon,okay.
35913,Sheldon,watery?
34475,Sheldon,shhhhh!
37693,Sheldon,"just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
37256,Sheldon,good idea. we’ll go to corleone’s.
37818,Sheldon,there’s doubt?
45023,Sheldon,i have gotten much better at that.
43395,Sheldon,"some important new information has come to light. women are the worst. i thought it was paper cuts, but i was wrong. no piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
43409,Sheldon,"boy, i’m glad we’re going out again."
34874,Sheldon,"for your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile i wrote for you. "
34352,Sheldon,you have a sarcasm sign?
35740,Sheldon,is qochbe’ spelled with a ?
37113,Sheldon,just need a little more practice.
45112,Sheldon,surprisingly well.
35810,Sheldon,"no, no, no. star trek v has specific failures in writing and direction, while star trek i fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
42228,Sheldon,is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
39821,Sheldon,i said funny.
42549,Sheldon,that’s preposterous. how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
37665,Sheldon,"all right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
35782,Sheldon,"you know, i do recall seeing some female undergarments. where was that? oh, yes, earlier this evening i happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. do those look familiar?"
37202,Sheldon,detailed analysis posted online.
39186,Sheldon,"yes, it’s “penny, get your own wi-fi.” no spaces."
36148,Sheldon,sarcasm?
41475,Sheldon,"look at it. i feel like my mind just made a baby. and it’s beautiful. it’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
43366,Sheldon,"if that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
37269,Sheldon,"oh, my goodness. where do i begin? for instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
45493,Sheldon,so i’m running out of time.
34322,Sheldon,"yeah, those are men who just had sex."
40777,Sheldon,fine.
38635,Sheldon,"howard is a complete and total ass, bernadette is in penny’s bed, amy bites, and penny may or may not have coitus with leonard."
38139,Sheldon,"are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?"
38637,Sheldon,"dr. koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
39962,Sheldon,three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
41197,Sheldon,"well, i mean it. i’m really happy for you. and that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. cheers."
21853,Sheldon,wait. let me get my jacket.
40330,Sheldon,"i did a comprehensive background check. medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   i trust you paid off those parking tickets."
37899,Sheldon,"if you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, i would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now."
41741,Sheldon,brain lesions!
39934,Sheldon,"when i first moved here i was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to mr. d’onofrio."
40749,Sheldon,"hello. hello. uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. anything for you guys?"
43974,Sheldon,"physically, yes, but i’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason."
39628,Sheldon,i help the weak. it’s yet another way i’m exactly like batman.
42864,Sheldon,of course.
36434,Sheldon,"yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
35905,Sheldon,"when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. you see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
43102,Sheldon,"it is. they’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. it’ll only make you feel worse."
41164,Sheldon,i have not ruled it out.
35141,Sheldon,"the papers could have been mailed, mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
39286,Sheldon,you don’t know the half of it. it was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. but it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying h-o starter sets.
40734,Sheldon,"yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does."
36913,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. and without rules, the competition has no meaning. and without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  i have your kite. i have your kite."
45593,Sheldon,what? is this about leonard and amy? i don’t like it either.
43456,Sheldon,"me neither. but i just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems."
45316,Sheldon,"yeah, i picked it up without thinking about it. which raises a neuroscientific question, when did i decide to pick it up?"
34247,Sheldon,tuesday night we played klingon boggle until one in the morning.
41287,Sheldon,"oh, very well. i’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. oh!"
43065,Sheldon,"i was going to make you red zinger, but since mars is the red planet, i went with peppermint."
35719,Sheldon,rats.
39596,Sheldon, bernadette.
34204,Sheldon,"i know, and i do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
36694,Sheldon,i know. as i’m sure you’re aware…
42024,Sheldon,"well, this is confusing for me. but i don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. so, i’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance."
43616,Sheldon,it was pretty easy. and i think my background in mathletics helped. barry kripke was there. i should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
45816,Sheldon,i must speak to him.
42851,Sheldon,"why, of course it’s what i want. why would i say it’s what i want if it’s not what i want?"
40522,Sheldon,"no, thank you."
35231,Sheldon,huh? 
35978,Sheldon,"no, we’re not. let’s say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis, i now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
39769,Sheldon,"wrong, sir. wrong. under section 37b of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. see? it’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”"
40455,Sheldon,"oh, but i want to be hawking’s friend."
34215,Sheldon,evidently.
36778,Sheldon,"i’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. i thought the “bazinga” was implied. i’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
43947,Sheldon,okay. guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
37886,Sheldon,"well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
35324,Sheldon,i said good day! 
37148,Sheldon,no.
41621,Sheldon,all right.
38944,Sheldon,it’d be swell if they had a train.
39183,Sheldon,"also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. tonight is thai food. you’ll find the standard order in appendix b or downloadable from my ftp server. if you have any questions, here’s the faq sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, i do a live web chat called apartment talk on tuesday nights."
35090,Sheldon,"oh, i never joke when it comes to vertigo. "
42498,Sheldon,that’s my boy.
45351,Sheldon,can you read them back?
42920,Sheldon,we’re just standing behind her. it’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
44049,Sheldon,"no. oh, no. now you call her constance. i call her meemaw. you have your own meemaw. it’s not my fault she died when you were four."
35725,Sheldon,"maybe when i publish it, i’ll include an inhaler."
38401,Sheldon,"as usual, you’re all wrong. the bravest person in the marvel universe is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam."
45006,Sheldon,and what special circumstances are those?
45123,Sheldon,gladly. can we storm out?
35109,Sheldon,"same paradox. if you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. "
42468,Sheldon,"now, before i start, i need you to know that i’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. so, keep an open mind."
41271,Sheldon,i’m a real collector. how rare is it?
38714,Sheldon,"hold on. just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. what’s the occasion?"
45713,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, get away from me, you monster!"
35029,Sheldon,by that logic i should answer all the anthropology questions because i’m a mammal.  
37683,Sheldon,i’d rather you pretend i didn’t say it. i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
35597,Sheldon,is there a “check the check engine light light”?  o-o-o-oh!
35075,Sheldon,then it’s got to be patrick stewart. 
21828,Sheldon,well that’s disappointing. 
44426,Sheldon,"oh, bad news. amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go."
34361,Sheldon,"wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  i have a masters and two phd’s, i should not have to do this."
21844,Sheldon,it’s not an assumption. change seats with me.
43479,Sheldon,bring penny to meet mandy.
38711,Sheldon,"perhaps he’s emulating shakespeare’s henry v, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails i’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
44304,Sheldon,i can’t believe penny hasn’t.
45232,Sheldon,she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
38974,Sheldon,no.
36070,Sheldon,"alright kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and i would like to propose that we do that together. tomorrow. yes, i’ll pay. alright, goodbye. alright! time to learn rock climbing."
40334,Sheldon,no. i have people for that now. you’re up.
39852,Sheldon,there was something wrong with that detergent. that was way too bubbly.
35548,Sheldon,"there’s a tribe in papua new guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. "
40823,Sheldon,dobby the elf dies in book seven.
35911,Sheldon,"what a beautiful job stephanie did. i might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. it’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
43172,Sheldon,honesty will never get us in.
45801,Sheldon,i can’t get out of bed. i hurt my ankle.
41785,Sheldon,let me guess.
35555,Sheldon,did you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
37727,Sheldon,satellites are down. solar flares.
40124,Sheldon,"what is it now, mrs. wolowitz?"
42351,Sheldon,so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that i can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
38259,Sheldon,"and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation. because i too know absolutely nothing about priya’s preferences in male companionship. and with that, i will re-zip my lip."
38776,Sheldon,it’s actually thai. you’re slipping.
35435,Sheldon,only nine more months to comic-con.
44831,Sheldon,"yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
34474,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no. no, i’ve too much to do."
41316,Sheldon,"hurts, doesn’t it? you know, i find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true."
43237,Sheldon,any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
38689,Sheldon,i’m glad you asked. i took the liberty of adapting a star trek fan fiction novella i wrote when i was ten into a one-act play.
42757,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. which is why i got amy this."
34385,Sheldon,"that depends. when i learn that i’m a robot, will i be able to handle it?"
40714,Sheldon,"yes. no, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. he’s also brown."
39322,Sheldon,"hurry, hurry, hurry."
39346,Sheldon,"in case you have forgotten, schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
41369,Sheldon,"okay, another 30 feet."
37528,Sheldon,i don’t want to hear this.
36153,Sheldon,"he’s referring to an activity he has done before. it’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. this suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
35365,Sheldon,worst renaissance fair ever.
38449,Sheldon,cheap science fiction?
43454,Sheldon,why are you up?
38019,Sheldon,"although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. it’s an action we both regret to this day."
42153,Sheldon,i am. so much so that i’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
39284,Sheldon,"howard, i think i can help here. yes, bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
41608,Sheldon,"oh, oh, oh, i have a reason. it could be because you said yes to marrying zack, but every time leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. yeah, that’s just off the top of my head."
39985,Sheldon,"yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. that’s for babies."
38912,Sheldon,what?
42980,Sheldon,may i say something?
43904,Sheldon,neither do i. but we can find out together.
36872,Sheldon,thank you. you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
34690,Sheldon,the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
41212,Sheldon,"um, well, i was worried that you might be missing leonard. and that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched clash of the titans right before you went to bed."
45152,Sheldon,you.
41817,Sheldon,"i told you. buying scalped tickets is against the rules. if you get caught, you get banned from comic-con for life. life, leonard. you’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
41979,Sheldon,"if you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life."
43039,Sheldon,aah! and after i let you be gary.
35779,Sheldon,yes?
42981,Sheldon,but i think it would be comforting.
35057,Sheldon,a sigma particle.
36909,Sheldon,sorry won’t bring their kites down. ow! string burn! string burn!
45222,Sheldon,uh-huh. interesting. okay.
38764,Sheldon,"don’t worry. as your tertiary friend, i am prepared to step in and comfort you."
45100,Sheldon,"it could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them."
37158,Sheldon,"tears seem appropriate. enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
34925,Sheldon,"i did not think of that. clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while i still understand what a spoon is for. "
41888,Sheldon,hello.
41252,Sheldon,"but i don’t want to know how many underpants you own. although, based on the floor of your bedroom, i’d say it’s a thousand."
39289,Sheldon,"ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
36040,Sheldon,well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. may i suggest it as the topic for your essay.
40199,Sheldon,"so, that’s how this works? i complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
43921,Sheldon,"a doctor? well, i hope you’re not contagious. i’ve got a weekend in the telescope room i’ve been excited about for almost three minutes."
40204,Sheldon,"remarkable. in just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath howard’s keister. and all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been tetris and mail-order brides."
44010,Sheldon,wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while i take a quick…?
39257,Sheldon,all right. it is a comfortable chair.
39507,Sheldon,it would seem amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
43377,Sheldon,outdoor? oh. i can rsvp no right now.
37546,Sheldon,i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. i cannot speak to large crowds.
36773,Sheldon,thank you. chocolate?
34932,Sheldon,you’re going to leave me? 
35069,Sheldon,who?
38328,Sheldon,"oh, shut up."
35593,Sheldon,"oh, good. i’m not keeping you from anything. your check engine light is on."
34349,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43571,Sheldon,"according to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. for all you know, i could be exercising right now."
37340,Sheldon,size ratio was all wrong. couldn’t visualize it. needed bigger carbon atoms.
44245,Sheldon,we’d have to take your car.
41859,Sheldon,"oh, i’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
41322,Sheldon,keep it up?
36886,Sheldon,silence!
36477,Sheldon,"that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. not only is it indian cuisine, which koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. and finally, it’s main ingredient is paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
45185,Sheldon,hello.
38408,Sheldon,"einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. by that standard, penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
40057,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t want a broken toy.  nothing!"
42474,Sheldon,"i know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. you thought of it september 22nd, 2007. two days later, penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
38877,Sheldon,all right. pick a card.
45448,Sheldon,"actually, our friendship group is at capacity. but if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. unless it’s raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
34587,Sheldon,good luck. 
40997,Sheldon,or that’s complete poppycock which amy made up. it still could be the map.
42924,Sheldon,"yeah, but it’s still so aggravating."
41823,Sheldon,"no, wait. i need you to call stan lee, leonard nimoy and bill nye the science guy, ’cause, legally, i’m not allowed to. oh, and, also, carrie fisher, you know, ’cause i hear he can be pretty nuts."
38704,Sheldon,"yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. so much."
40699,Sheldon,full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
42996,Sheldon,"well, as a texas gentleman, i’m inclined to say ladies first. although, i’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. perhaps we should flip a coin. or if you’re familiar with the rules of rock, paper, scissors…"
37111,Sheldon,bazinga. i don’t care.
41309,Sheldon,"no, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with penny."
34298,Sheldon,"we can’t have thai food, we had indian for lunch."
45596,Sheldon,i already do.
45255,Sheldon,hold on. is it back pay or is it a gift?
39954,Sheldon,"eh, why? my spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
35959,Sheldon,so what? his observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
37028,Sheldon,don’t look?
45468,Sheldon,hey.
45285,Sheldon,"well, i know this is a difficult time for you. you’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
43707,Sheldon,"yeah. my 1/18 scale wil wheaton action figure. i also have the other kind of will, and in it i will my wil back to wil."
36037,Sheldon,"i know, i may have started off with a fairly obvious one. you did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. i’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. it should take you no more than 3 hours."
45111,Sheldon,"hey, leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because i have an emotion detector."
21825,Sheldon,roommates agree that friday nights shall be reserved for watching joss whedon’s brilliant new series firefly.
43845,Sheldon,the web site’s frozen. i can’t get in.
45361,Sheldon,"these are hydration backpacks. for efficiency, whenever i’m thirsty i have access to water. when i’m hungry, i have lentil soup."
36377,Sheldon,is that your answer or do you not understand the question? we’ll come back to that one.
36121,Sheldon,of course. that’s how you move a conversation forward.
37243,Sheldon,"oh, my. i’ve admired these for years."
35750,Sheldon,"well, then what took you so long?"
36372,Sheldon,so? do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
42934,Sheldon,"good to see you again, mr. stephen-hawking liked-our-paper."
43585,Sheldon,when can i stab one of my friends?
34640,Sheldon,"and another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, penny, a well estab…"
39221,Sheldon,"wait. i just want you all to know that i forgive you. this mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. i haven’t earned these bars. although what i lack in leadership, apparently i more than make up for in sewing."
39324,Sheldon,"well, off the top of my head, i’d have to go with excalibur. it gives you the right to rule england."
36970,Sheldon,"no, i believe leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
36250,Sheldon,all right.
45579,Sheldon,"do you know, i’ve corresponded with peter higgs. would you like to see some of his letters?"
35898,Sheldon,i see. apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and leonard crossed some sort of line. i apologize.
40806,Sheldon,i didn’t notice.
37047,Sheldon,"sorry. as i told you, the hero always peeks."
42530,Sheldon,"so it’s settled, we’re not doing it."
42769,Sheldon,"oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours."
41606,Sheldon,yes. like we’re on a ship. coming from africa to america.
40054,Sheldon,i thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
44742,Sheldon,"oh, calm down. i already put away five of these. you see? no muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
35556,Sheldon,did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
39228,Sheldon,it’s eight o’clock in the morning in mumbai. how can she have dinner?
43346,Sheldon,"perhaps. but my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever i wanted, so who cares?"
37036,Sheldon,didn’t work out well.
21832,Sheldon,"you asked what i wanted. i wanted to come in. i’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection c, females, paragraph four, coitus. roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”"
44876,Sheldon,maybe you’re right.
42216,Sheldon,why do i need you now?
37526,Sheldon,"go ahead. i have no illusions about my mother. she is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild dr. pepper addiction. anything you’d like to add?"
41690,Sheldon,"well, i never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. you want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?"
43812,Sheldon,"good. oh, i watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so i’m gonna change my answer and eat spongebob."
35494,Sheldon,she comes into my room. no-one’s supposed to be in my room.
45780,Sheldon,the light’s green.
36312,Sheldon,of course i could.
36549,Sheldon,"if you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
38031,Sheldon,"excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
37480,Sheldon,thank you.
35200,Sheldon,"i hardly think so, leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party."
43387,Sheldon,now get out of my spot.
45474,Sheldon,"it really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging."
41008,Sheldon,pchew!
43613,Sheldon,hello.
39496,Sheldon,"when they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘cause i can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
35962,Sheldon,where were you that’s more important than wii bowling night?
44071,Sheldon,thank you. i’m gonna go next door and play with leonard.
36249,Sheldon,i’m confused. i thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle.
35632,Sheldon,"excuse me, but i have some concerns about these questions."
34637,Sheldon,"okay, that’s it, i don’t know how, but she is cheating. no-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. "
42187,Sheldon,i’m fine.
43591,Sheldon,"ah, this is fun."
38660,Sheldon,all right. you’re an actress. i need you to teach me.
42421,Sheldon,"if you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, i’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the u.s. constitution. and it may not be cool to say so, but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today."
44211,Sheldon,"the, the revisions i made start on page four."
43703,Sheldon,not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. so we are currently in the presence of leonard nimoy’s dna.
44568,Sheldon,how late?
37547,Sheldon,any group big enough to trample me to death. general rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
35968,Sheldon,wait! you bought me a present?
43545,Sheldon,"well, it’s not like i’m never going to see you two again. which brings us to article 23 subsection c, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion."
35897,Sheldon,may i come in?
45650,Sheldon,"hello, puny insects. as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike."
44954,Sheldon,it’s midnight. happy birthday.
37691,Sheldon,"well, usually i’m on the team that picks last. unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair."
37650,Sheldon,"no, it’s not the… never mind."
43217,Sheldon,"well, of course we do. fort knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library."
44963,Sheldon,"it doesn’t matter what i want. it’s your birthday, you decide."
42863,Sheldon,"boy, taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
37365,Sheldon,what’s sheetrock?
45020,Sheldon,why would you do that?
37567,Sheldon,"when i was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
37698,Sheldon,"i read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. bye-bye."
42239,Sheldon,how many women have you had dates with?
43607,Sheldon,"excuse me. i’m recovering from a recent breakup, and i’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. and as ash ketchum said to pikachu, i choose you."
40439,Sheldon,"i was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. why does everyone love me except stephen hawking?"
41786,Sheldon,what was i gonna do? two ins in a row? where’s my lemonade?
39895,Sheldon,"we’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. and if that doesn’t work, i’m going to poison his tea."
42145,Sheldon,that’s a good question.  amy and bernadette. why did you lie to us?
34795,Sheldon,because i knew you’d screw this up.
41141,Sheldon,"okay, well, i have a sound effect for those sound effects. "
35407,Sheldon,i don’t care. there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
37689,Sheldon,is he making any progress? because i’d like to erase ben affleck as daredevil.
36339,Sheldon,what i want is irrelevant. this is penny’s decision. penny?
41569,Sheldon,i believe you.
35815,Sheldon,really? they don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
42308,Sheldon,"well, perhaps i can help. sherlock holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. now, have, have you tried doing that?"
38755,Sheldon,what?
41856,Sheldon,vintage? be specific.
42306,Sheldon,"oh, yes, please. a pair of pants. and my toothbrush. yeah, and my mail. and a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “i know you are, but what am i?” was met with stony silence."
45396,Sheldon,where?
38167,Sheldon,exactly.
41129,Sheldon,"oh, my. what an honour. oh, this is like being asked to ascend mount olympus and dine with the gods."
35396,Sheldon,"what if i choke on my popcorn, who will administer the heimlich manoeuvre."
37366,Sheldon,that seems acceptable.
38884,Sheldon,figure out the magic trick yet?
37989,Sheldon,"if it makes you feel any better, thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night."
44292,Sheldon,"well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time."
42119,Sheldon,"oh. i should call her and apologize. oh, no."
42031,Sheldon,i can’t.
41930,Sheldon,"no. sorry to disappoint you, but amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me."
42977,Sheldon,thank you.
37485,Sheldon,"excuse me? excuse me, jailor?"
36307,Sheldon,"no, of course you’re not. all right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
37817,Sheldon,hello. why do i smell methacrylate?
40025,Sheldon,"howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
41985,Sheldon,i already am. i’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
39654,Sheldon,"and that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at the cheesecake factory?"
45551,Sheldon,how are you settling in?
38808,Sheldon,excuse me? isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
38957,Sheldon,"have you ever considered trying to do something useful? perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
43267,Sheldon,we looked great.
36682,Sheldon,what are they doing here?
36422,Sheldon,i think you mean comic books. comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
43956,Sheldon,"perhaps i should explain. while working with koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and i named it after you."
42227,Sheldon,"that was awkward, right?"
42630,Sheldon,there’s no denying i have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite. but that seems even more farfetched. the only conclusion was love. i know what’s happening. this is a panic attack. soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
37568,Sheldon,that’s what my sister used to say.
38394,Sheldon,you whistled?
42030,Sheldon,seriously. i feel like i’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
39419,Sheldon,"thank you. yeah, i’ve learned something today. you and i, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. "
38650,Sheldon,"it’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
39865,Sheldon,no. what you see is a man trembling with confidence. does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
41381,Sheldon,that’s it? good”
36131,Sheldon,"i’m at a loss. if you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder i overlooked."
44189,Sheldon,"well, that’s not fair. we should all get plaques."
38570,Sheldon,"monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. no? how about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? go, beavers. i’ll be back."
41884,Sheldon,"well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. oh, look, there’s wine. mmm. grape juice that burns. uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? you blinked. i win."
38464,Sheldon,it’s illegal to spay a human being.
36896,Sheldon,your mee-maw died? that’s terrible.
39294,Sheldon,i did. how was yours?
34638,Sheldon,what?
43166,Sheldon,"there’s a speaker box. drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens."
40092,Sheldon,it’s actually 01100111.
37638,Sheldon,no. clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
37349,Sheldon,i came to tell you i’ve got the answer.
35572,Sheldon,"uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. they could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and i’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
38169,Sheldon,she’ll get lost. we no longer live at 2311 los robles. we now live at 311 los robles.
44560,Sheldon,"see, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that i said it on purpose, and i have no regrets."
39319,Sheldon,about halfway between bruce wayne and scrooge mcduck.
35804,Sheldon,then i believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock moment.
38530,Sheldon,hardly. consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. a young woman alone in the big city. her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
37346,Sheldon,i have good news.
40686,Sheldon,"no, no, shilly-shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the mexican navy. anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, shilly-shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady."
42431,Sheldon,"why? we won. you know, i say, next, we take on koothrappali and his dog. really give ourselves a challenge."
44122,Sheldon,all get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
38334,Sheldon,ah. blame president james “jimmy” carter. he started america on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. he wonders why he was a one-term president.
43734,Sheldon,on oatmeal day?
43653,Sheldon,guess i’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
43436,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry about leonard. thought i raised him better than that."
45646,Sheldon,it’s a waste of time. i might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
36772,Sheldon,you’re here a lot now.
35135,Sheldon,buddy.
40232,Sheldon,"darn. if you weren’t busy, i’d ask you to join us."
39548,Sheldon,"oh, of course he is. she’s very interesting. did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
38195,Sheldon,"well then apparently, you hate fun."
43053,Sheldon,"oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on mars, and i applied to be among the first to go. what should we name him? you know, i came in thinking seth, but he kind of looks italian."
41864,Sheldon,"oh, of course. um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the miller hook and platform?"
34301,Sheldon,"i don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable mack daddy."
44937,Sheldon,"all right, i tried. that should be the title of your autobiography. ooh, a second-degree burn."
35152,Sheldon,i’m not ignoring my sister. i’m ignoring all of you. 
34905,Sheldon,it’s right here on the bottom. 
39264,Sheldon, amy.
44770,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. like that spider-man action figure that used to be on your desk."
44125,Sheldon,oh. i’ll just take one last sip. ah.
39987,Sheldon,hello stuart.
37490,Sheldon,i was found guilty and fined $533.
44176,Sheldon,"thank you, bernadette. that was perfect."
35358,Sheldon,that i wouldn’t tell you the secret. shhhhh!
36990,Sheldon,and she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
45283,Sheldon,"uh, wait, before we eat, i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj."
36583,Sheldon,"well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. now, i know i’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?"
37001,Sheldon,i should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
38846,Sheldon,are there beans in it?
41661,Sheldon,leonard disproved my element. now all the attention is going to go away.
38441,Sheldon,"and the answer was zack, correct?"
42209,Sheldon,but i do appreciate them.
40694,Sheldon,"alex, check my schedule. what does my afternoon look like?"
43077,Sheldon,"they would, wouldn’t they? we could give them cool martian names. and we could teach them about martian history. like, who planted those flags? and, uh, where did that copy of mars attacks! come from?"
37200,Sheldon,agreed.
42899,Sheldon,when i mixed it with sheldony goodness and cooked it in the easy-bake oven of my mind.
45059,Sheldon,"here. you’re sad, so i made you tea."
37628,Sheldon,"oh, i’m ready. i don’t know if stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the east texas christian youth holy roller bowling league championship team. seven to twelve year-old division. also, penny’s pretty good."
41396,Sheldon,"yes. you were kind enough to watch raiders of the lost ark with me. so i’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, little house on the prairie."
35989,Sheldon,"to sheldon, live long and prosper. leonard nimoy."
43183,Sheldon,"uh, one question about that picture. can it be with george lucas? ooh, grumpy you are."
39770,Sheldon,"well, it has. ask anybody."
39172,Sheldon,i can see how that would be upsetting. come in. i’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
41324,Sheldon,thought i heard you out here.
40890,Sheldon,more than anything.
44580,Sheldon,superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
39323,Sheldon,"i don’t know. if we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and i’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
45379,Sheldon,"well, perhaps i am a little under the weather. it’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix."
38646,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. i may have changed a few lives today."
43553,Sheldon,"you’re healthy. you have a job in the sciences. i’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner."
42529,Sheldon,yeah? we have to be somewhere.
41758,Sheldon,does that mean the relationship is over?
44507,Sheldon,"so, did you defile my mother or not?"
45572,Sheldon,we just went swimming.
35649,Sheldon,sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
37781,Sheldon,"no, he doesn’t understand. i understand."
40194,Sheldon,"it’s awful. this morning, she arranged for me to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day. it, it’s usually only open to children. she got them to make an exception."
39057,Sheldon,"well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. that’s a little outside my comfort zone."
36907,Sheldon,"focus, leonard, focus! the heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
42009,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous. i am a grown man. i am a professional scientist. and i currently occupy the moral high ground.
40214,Sheldon,"while a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
36355,Sheldon,"very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother."
34438,Sheldon,"i finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
40672,Sheldon,"oh, i hope it’s a train."
38724,Sheldon,your lab is funded by some middle-eastern dilettante?
43474,Sheldon,"hey, you broke up with me. it is none of your business whose naked bosom i’m smooshing around like pizza dough."
41627,Sheldon,"now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?"
36030,Sheldon,what’d you say of the idea of you and i becoming friends?
42115,Sheldon,"oh, no. what have i done?"
40248,Sheldon,"okay, my turn. let me talk to him."
42230,Sheldon,"oh, quite all right. after my forehead melanoma scare i’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. well, sorry, i don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
37157,Sheldon,it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
43745,Sheldon,"people compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?"
36211,Sheldon,"from that key maker, i highly doubt it."
35553,Sheldon,even though the menu description specifies shredded?
38280,Sheldon,"excuse me. if we’re changing topics, i believe i have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
44260,Sheldon,"really? ‘cause every time i come in here, i think less of me."
37427,Sheldon,"howard, could you lower the lights? i have a short powerpoint presentation."
41516,Sheldon,"i’m not going to bother him, i’m going to talk to him."
42564,Sheldon,voyager the space probe or voyager the star trek tv show?
39273,Sheldon,"all right, name your price."
34317,Sheldon,"yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
34984,Sheldon,"what exactly is it you do? i know you chatter on about it all the time, but i’ve never really paid attention."
38025,Sheldon,yes. and i’d thank you to do the same.
38015,Sheldon,"i should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
41231,Sheldon,we’re all out of alcohol.
39262,Sheldon, penny.
40747,Sheldon,"leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. and look at us. at this moment, we are, in fact, a star trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. as long as we have those things, nothing can stop…"
42866,Sheldon,i can do both. my brain is working at optimal capacity. i can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
44453,Sheldon,you need to go to the back of the line.
36163,Sheldon,"you were lucky. when i was a kid, if i wanted an eeg, i had to attach my own electrodes."
38852,Sheldon,is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
37788,Sheldon,"he’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
34591,Sheldon,hello.
34257,Sheldon,no?
43002,Sheldon,that’s it?
36788,Sheldon,"well, i’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. i trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
35974,Sheldon,yes?  did you forget your key?
39260,Sheldon, penny.
43623,Sheldon,a swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
42399,Sheldon,"yeah, try me."
44487,Sheldon,"see, that’s funny because…"
36739,Sheldon,of course i’m right what are the odds i’d be wrong twice in one week?
35914,Sheldon,"she’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
40710,Sheldon,like what?
44328,Sheldon,"oh, fine. we don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to."
42929,Sheldon,interesting. i can’t think of a single thing i wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
45522,Sheldon,"well, that’s wonderful. congratulations."
38154,Sheldon,amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
38316,Sheldon,"yes. i’d like to offer a laudatory statement about howard’s many excellent qualities that i believe will tip the scales back in his favour. howard joel wolowitz. h is for honesty, of which he has much. o’s for outstanding, which he is such. w’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. a’s for artistic, his ability…"
38193,Sheldon,"i always tell people, if you have only one day in los angeles, make it a train day."
34698,Sheldon,and now you’re out of life. why did you hit pause?
39105,Sheldon,i like cows.
43666,Sheldon,i’m trying not to attract attention.
39011,Sheldon,move. move. move!
43033,Sheldon,"i remember it perfectly. but i have an eidetic memory. if you’re interested, i also remember how much you owe us for the food."
38450,Sheldon,using kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
41997,Sheldon,"i beg to differ. i used to live in those genitals. and if someone wants to move into my old room, i should at least get a vote."
44139,Sheldon,you’re kidding. what kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
37993,Sheldon,"at my age, do you know how i’m statistically most likely to die?"
43544,Sheldon,"just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. okay. as my future neighbour, i’d like you to have a key. initial here to acknowledge you received it."
39785,Sheldon,"great. great. so, what’s new with your family? how’s your mother? is she alive?"
43514,Sheldon,what if it’s banditos shooting at us? what if we get kidnapped? what if we end up in a factory making bart simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
34240,Sheldon,"no, i sit there."
39454,Sheldon,are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
41833,Sheldon,oh. is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of darth vader breathing?
38018,Sheldon,"she’s not my girlfriend. she’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
36809,Sheldon,"that’s happy, right?"
43551,Sheldon,"in general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
39310,Sheldon,"and now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. bam! that’s what i’m talking about!"
34860,Sheldon,un-unravelable. 
45201,Sheldon,"i’m not sure of the protocol. television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized."
38117,Sheldon,"highly. oh, dear. "
21810,Sheldon,and you have a vehicle?
34958,Sheldon,"no, he would be exactly the same. "
45107,Sheldon,"aw. somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right. "
41747,Sheldon,will you please stop joking around? i’m trying to figure this out.
36285,Sheldon,"so, i’m thinking, you won the nobel prize what, three years ago? so you must deal with a whole lot of what has smoot done lately? my thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, cooper-smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the nobel prize, you’ll be back on top."
34416,Sheldon,got it. so i’m assuming nothing venereal. i’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
37021,Sheldon,i see no organizational system in here whatsoever. which panties do you wear on mondays?
37771,Sheldon,yes. why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
34972,Sheldon,"yes, in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it. "
45041,Sheldon,i’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
45786,Sheldon,"you don’t know where i am. my physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location."
42345,Sheldon, guess who?
41728,Sheldon,"wait, if howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game hungry hungry hippos, they eat marbles. maybe i need to dumb these down for you. "
38120,Sheldon,"well, the status is as it always was. she’s a girl. she’s a friend. she is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
37103,Sheldon,"wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. more does not equal merry. if there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? no, we’d be suffocating."
45580,Sheldon,i’ll get them.
40022,Sheldon,"oh, that’s very kind of you. next time i have a hankering to wash down a d cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, i’ll come a-knocking."
44083,Sheldon,"i just gave you my virginity, woman. cool your jets."
38098,Sheldon,brobdingnagian.
37834,Sheldon,"see, now this is a man for penny."
40132,Sheldon,you’re obviously good at what you do.
21820,Sheldon,third barrier passed. you have won the right to see your room. huzzah!
38190,Sheldon,"given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible."
35334,Sheldon,"excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of menushya yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the hindu householder? "
42744,Sheldon,"hmm. it’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. oh, i’ve got it. this is good."
42199,Sheldon,you must be here to give me advice.
42969,Sheldon,"she’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. that’s when amy said, want to make this interesting?"
37287,Sheldon,all right. i’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
36060,Sheldon,me too! most people don’t see it. what are you reading?
36540,Sheldon,i agree. it’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. check your messages.
41949,Sheldon,hello.
43564,Sheldon,they are in 2003.
43879,Sheldon,then it’s settled. amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
43611,Sheldon,i smell funny. i taste salty.
44663,Sheldon,how? you had the whole floor to yourself.
45824,Sheldon,…of ap calculus.
41359,Sheldon,"it is a marathon, not a sprint."
34757,Sheldon,"well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but occam’s razor would suggest that someone threw it out. "
39907,Sheldon,"hey! he did that on purpose,"
36640,Sheldon,tell me what?
34334,Sheldon,nan
34522,Sheldon,"oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. last time i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse. "
41663,Sheldon,"when i thought the element was real, i didn’t want it. but now that leonard made it not exist, i want it more than anything in the world."
43030,Sheldon,what?
34786,Sheldon,were you trying to impress penny?
42923,Sheldon,"he wrote back. cooper and hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. it should come as no surprise given they work at cal tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. engineers? do you know how insulting that is?"
39534,Sheldon,"oh, come now. your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
44644,Sheldon,which side of the bed would you prefer?
45668,Sheldon,wheaton! wheaton! wheaton!
37614,Sheldon,of course they are. leonard’s being one.
42562,Sheldon,my struggle is emotional.
44076,Sheldon,hello.
37209,Sheldon,i don’t need anything at the galleria. do you need anything at the galleria?
38550,Sheldon,"all right, fine. if we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
39799,Sheldon,"before you go, consider this. not only do i have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, i also have all 61 episodes of the bbc series red dwarf and fiddle-faddle. all yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
36519,Sheldon,"okay, i’m sleepy now, get out."
42059,Sheldon,"old enough to know better. you know, and now that i think about it, i stood in front of a case of ipods and i bought a zune."
35919,Sheldon,in which i am not an expert.
38778,Sheldon,"at home, forbidding it."
34633,Sheldon,mine. 
35438,Sheldon,"fellow warriors, this is sheldor the conqueror. we are about to enter axel’s fortress. now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. alright barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
45130,Sheldon,"i feel the same way about you. now, put your glasses back on. you look weird."
35996,Sheldon,what did the toaster oven ever do to you?
34453,Sheldon,"no, no. let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
42354,Sheldon,what a stupid question.
34869,Sheldon,because leo is a middle child. 
36616,Sheldon,but meemaw just made cookies.
43487,Sheldon,plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in san francisco.
35035,Sheldon,"good idea, i need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury. "
41090,Sheldon,professor proton hosted my favourite science show when i was a child. i never missed an episode. he demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
36861,Sheldon,"june 30th, 2004. opening day of spider-man 2 at the amc pasadena. they only had red icees, no blue."
34337,Sheldon,"penny, i just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. i’m here for you."
38856,Sheldon,"well, i don’t care how you did it. i have more important things to think about. clearly, the cards are marked."
42908,Sheldon,then we’re probably okay.
42327,Sheldon,can i have one more moment with leonard?
39880,Sheldon,next year i’m going to epcot.
41076,Sheldon,"or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
36940,Sheldon,i can see that. i was providing you with an alternative. a courtesy i was never offered in similar circumstances.
37386,Sheldon,"this is incredible! i’m so happy, i’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. i’m just going to run home and start packing."
35716,Sheldon,"yes. she’s in the living room. go, i’ll wait here."
44241,Sheldon,"well, no, i just, i, i don’t want to recycle it. and i don’t want store credit."
37259,Sheldon,"leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
35426,Sheldon,"wait a minute, why am i doing all the giving here? if leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of leslie winkle?"
38163,Sheldon,screwed.
44093,Sheldon,"it’s also my gift to you. that was clear, right? ‘cause you’re not getting anything else."
38248,Sheldon,ta-da!
34792,Sheldon,"no, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. "
34225,Sheldon,i have a very wide circle. i have 212 friends on myspace. 
38752,Sheldon,"that’s a good sign, right?"
40320,Sheldon,"nice try. now, in 1964, dr. peter higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the higgs boson. now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a nobel prize."
35686,Sheldon,"oh, good one."
41899,Sheldon,"chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result."
45306,Sheldon,what if she’s correct? doesn’t that say something troubling about us?
41975,Sheldon,but i still need to use the bathroom.
43972,Sheldon,"i never did get that chicken noodle, did i?"
43191,Sheldon,"and i saw jabba the hutt riding by on a motorcycle. although that was right after the tasing, so who can say for sure?"
42760,Sheldon,"oh, really? well, how about now?  and you got me nothing. christmas is ruined. let’s never speak of it again. well, this was fun."
44521,Sheldon,"speaking of love, stds among the elderly are skyrocketing."
40944,Sheldon,"i suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. harry potter’s j.k. rowling, uh, star trek’s d.c. fontana."
34525,Sheldon,"no, no, wait, hold on. "
37005,Sheldon,penny?
41351,Sheldon,"yes, and do you know what the odds are i’d pick your name?"
36579,Sheldon,"thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
45799,Sheldon,"that’s discrimination against the otherwise located. i’m going to have to go over your head. manager, manager. oh, lord, look who it is."
39759,Sheldon,"i think you’ll like the drill tonight. i’ve tried to make it fun. each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by canada. pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
44747,Sheldon,"dr. fowler and i began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. this is our friend penny’s place. you may remember her from our episode, flags and the people who don’t understand them."
43752,Sheldon,someone will show.
34239,Sheldon,"um, penny, that’s where i sit."
43952,Sheldon,"it’s perfect. it appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of valentine’s day forever."
34745,Sheldon,and may i point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring. 
34309,Sheldon,"oh no, let’s assume that they can. lois lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. miss lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. "
45727,Sheldon,i found your webcam and replaced the video feed. you two should be ashamed of yourselves.
39340,Sheldon,"i see what you’re doing. you accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. fiendishly clever."
37745,Sheldon,it’s all right. i’ll see it again with you.
45484,Sheldon,"drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. but before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
41211,Sheldon, penny. 
43661,Sheldon,i told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
40091,Sheldon,"no, sir, no, i took my dad’s desk chair, attached a speak & spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. granted most people thought i was r2-d2, but still, i got a lot of candy."
44356,Sheldon,"they don’t wear bicycle helmets in game of thrones. you’re thematically inaccurate, but i applaud your commitment to safety."
43872,Sheldon,"well, so far, i’ve come up with three ideas. the first is a chance for her to play the harp with the l.a. philharmonic."
43247,Sheldon,mmm.
44656,Sheldon,"well, it’s funny you should ask, because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
37356,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. good night to you, too. oh, by the way, i was watching you sleep for a moment, and i noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
36882,Sheldon,my enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. game.
42106,Sheldon,have you considered studying standard model physics?
37316,Sheldon,interesting. the acquaintance is the first to greet me.
39829,Sheldon,"but if i don’t come into work, what am i supposed to do with myself?"
35384,Sheldon,"but it’s friday. friday’s always vintage game night. look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where i left off in 1999 when i had pernicious anaemia."
44061,Sheldon,"and i call her meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her."
36144,Sheldon,i remember him.
41520,Sheldon,"no. wait, i want to guess. don’t tell me."
36757,Sheldon,i want oatmeal.
40240,Sheldon,your point being?
39140,Sheldon,i can’t.
39370,Sheldon,"look, everyone. wil wheaton is my friend!"
39928,Sheldon,it’s called scientific curiosity. now go get butter.
45535,Sheldon,"okay. oh, and just to be clear, i’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
35763,Sheldon,"i trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me internet banality, strike one. touching my food, strike two."
35332,Sheldon,it’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. recommended by the department of homeland security. and sarah connor. 
38469,Sheldon,little comfort tonight. i look like a hell’s angel.
45318,Sheldon,"well, don’t get me wrong. neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. but, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the ford, martha, we’re going for a drive."
43332,Sheldon,"oh, true. but all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."
44059,Sheldon,"amy, why don’t you look excited? well, you get to watch me play with this."
45005,Sheldon,"what? wh, where’s the judgment? wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to hell and i say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? we’re already there."
44570,Sheldon,what? you have some coffee.
34641,Sheldon,well she could have said goodbye. 
37844,Sheldon,oh! not this again.
40276,Sheldon,"thank you. i appreciate that. you’re good people, leonard. there’s something i need to tell you."
42087,Sheldon,i don’t know if i can do that.
44685,Sheldon,she’s always complaining about people at work.
37018,Sheldon,but i could call you a cab or an ambulance.
40314,Sheldon,"yeah, wait, here. for your troubles."
43705,Sheldon,wouldn’t you like to know?
40077,Sheldon,but i said i’m sorry.
36871,Sheldon,got it. got it. got it. got it. got it. got it. betty and veronica? ugh.
44672,Sheldon,great.
36918,Sheldon,football or chicken-fried meats?
41111,Sheldon,yes.
41881,Sheldon,i get it.
36167,Sheldon,you went to the comic book store without me.7
43427,Sheldon,"no, i’ll be okay. but i think that i’d like to send the ring back to you."
37478,Sheldon,"and yet you wound up in traffic court. anyway, if it would please the court, i’d like to begin with an opening statement."
41283,Sheldon,of course. ask a silly question. 
41857,Sheldon,"wow. i’m feeling the urge to hug you. and one, and two, all right, gollum, we’re good."
38621,Sheldon,"red leader to red five, come in. red leader to red five, come in. howard, you promised."
43165,Sheldon,is that the attitude that helped you get penny?
41703,Sheldon,hello.
37816,Sheldon,"oh, ubuntu, you are my favourite linux-based operating system."
39850,Sheldon,y-you’re being ridiculous. those are perfectly clean.
37831,Sheldon,"thank you. raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
35265,Sheldon,"well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia. "
42481,Sheldon,a hotel? did you see the shining?
36905,Sheldon,"oh, that certainly would suck."
34655,Sheldon,hm! 
42816,Sheldon,"aw, now i’m sad i didn’t hear it."
42164,Sheldon,"for your information, i was asking her about the next star trek movie."
42284,Sheldon,you tracked my phone?
38956,Sheldon,you’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
39296,Sheldon,to send a message. she is not for you.
40613,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i just want you to get better as soon as possible. and with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. do you believe in the placebo effect?"
43821,Sheldon,there was a project i’ve been thinking about starting.
43692,Sheldon,"oh, it’s nice to meet you. i admire your father’s work very much. it’s not every day i get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum."
37656,Sheldon,that’s not even from your franchise!
36098,Sheldon,they have twizzlers instead of red vines. no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
42541,Sheldon,"true. sheldon’s mine simulation log, entry one. koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves."
42534,Sheldon,"oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos."
45360,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i’ve got amy up and running. shall we get to work?"
44371,Sheldon,"you, you and i spend a lot of time together. can there be a little mystery between us?"
40069,Sheldon,yes.
36834,Sheldon,astro means star.
44193,Sheldon,i’m fine with that.
45679,Sheldon,it’s you! i touched you!
42124,Sheldon,"well, you know, i’ve always been a fan of a story told by attar of nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. and that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass."
34722,Sheldon,"nothing, i just really didn’t want to come. virgin diet cuba libre please."
38614,Sheldon,"in order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
45277,Sheldon,wrong. we were standing outside my room in the hallway.
39545,Sheldon,"well? what do you think of new comic book night? magic, huh?"
37195,Sheldon,"if it’s any consolation, i’m not happy about it either. good night."
35295,Sheldon,"oh, even i know that’s lame. "
38875,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve been meaning to tell you, i figured out your magic trick."
35498,Sheldon,would you like to be?
35975,Sheldon,i don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
36527,Sheldon,said the grinch to christmas.
41964,Sheldon,"oh, very much so."
42946,Sheldon,hello.
45160,Sheldon,"leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. so much is unprovable. but when i was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. then it clacked. then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. whoo-whoo."
34712,Sheldon,"okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may i suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. "
40163,Sheldon,you’re upset. the convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
39977,Sheldon,"hmm, well, it’s a little hollywood. but i think i can pull it off. well done, penny."
38835,Sheldon,the water level rose.
40526,Sheldon,"well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court."
39312,Sheldon,"because it’s working. in the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, i’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and i’m close to figuring out why the large hadron collider has yet to isolate the higgs boson particle."
40778,Sheldon,i’m fine.
39304,Sheldon,one moment. i’m conducting an experiment.
40058,Sheldon,nothing. i said nothing.
36210,Sheldon,this is my spot. where else am i supposed to crouch?
41552,Sheldon,thank you. it would be an honour.
38826,Sheldon,"and good-bye to you, sir. he’ll be back."
42884,Sheldon,"yeah, darn straight, you can’t. try to tell a grown man to go to sleep."
43042,Sheldon,do you want to say it?
34404,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
41285,Sheldon,there are takeout containers in the trash can.
36272,Sheldon,"what’s up? i’ll tell you what’s up. i’m in a crisis situation, and i need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…"
40963,Sheldon,"wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally."
36610,Sheldon,"here, drink slash eat this."
44707,Sheldon,hello.
36870,Sheldon,do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
42114,Sheldon,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  empty room. if somebody says come in, i’m gonna freak out."
36157,Sheldon,of course. i would very much like to read about your sex life.
44561,Sheldon,i never realized this building was classified.
35456,Sheldon,what does that stand for?
38071,Sheldon,"amy, after consideration, i believe we may have acted rashly. i propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
37097,Sheldon,there is no abort.
38506,Sheldon,i understand why you’re upset.
43417,Sheldon,"raj, you’re probably wondering why amy and i aren’t showing any affection to one another."
37609,Sheldon,"you are ignoring the square-cube law. the giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. and for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, batmobile, and then giant ant."
37613,Sheldon,"for the record, giant rats are possible."
36006,Sheldon,we accept your challenge. name a time and place.
38214,Sheldon,"well, what if i spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak."
45050,Sheldon,"well, i’m just playing tennis against the drapes here."
35177,Sheldon,"that would be you. but residing within you is the potential for another me. perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a sheldon 2.0 if you will. "
42263,Sheldon,i see. you’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
43637,Sheldon,what’s he say?
35207,Sheldon,that’s not the secret knock. this is the secret knock. 
45796,Sheldon,"this is a photograph of the 1911 solvay conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. using photoshop, i’ve introduced a few anachronisms. see if you can spot all 24. i’ll give you the first one. madame curie should not be wearing a digital watch. and go."
42925,Sheldon,and send.
41204,Sheldon,"it’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of leonard’s face in it. he got it at the mall on clearance. now move, move, move."
44921,Sheldon,it’s one of a kind.
44032,Sheldon,good. then i’ll be leaving now.
39279,Sheldon,"wait. uh, which is closer to the new train store in monrovia, the movie theatre or the cheesecake factory?"
41915,Sheldon,she told you?
38251,Sheldon,i came to go over your alibi for last night.
39482,Sheldon,what?
44686,Sheldon,"do you know that when i get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat?"
34487,Sheldon,"what do you want, mom?"
41100,Sheldon,"professor proton was never late when he was on tv. you know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. unless tornadoes were ripping apart east texas, in which case we’d join him in progress.  it’s him. hello. well, i see. yes. all right, we can come get you. yeah, well, see you soon. bye."
34711,Sheldon,"no need, we have the special edition. "
34693,Sheldon,it’s halo night. 
37231,Sheldon,it’s a limited edition green lantern lantern. my friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
45053,Sheldon,and if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
43630,Sheldon,not a chance.
35228,Sheldon,"instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. they got me… a motorised dirt bike. "
36972,Sheldon,i want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
43465,Sheldon,"sonny and cher made it work. their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them."
34245,Sheldon,aaah!
34901,Sheldon,"when i’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. "
34402,Sheldon,not if you’re a rugby team. 
37273,Sheldon,i do not have to urinate. i am the master of my own bladder. drat.
43778,Sheldon,"if there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"
39162,Sheldon,your doctorate is in neurobiology. i fail to see the distinction.
44178,Sheldon,"thank you. that, that was wonderful."
41595,Sheldon,i know. and it wasn’t easy. do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
37473,Sheldon,and who performed that heroic act?
41431,Sheldon,"yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
44714,Sheldon,"you expressed an interest in having people over, and i feel i dismissed it too quickly. so, i took matters into my own hands, and i arranged a brunch."
44244,Sheldon,it might be easier to show you.
43944,Sheldon,koo from koothrappali and per from cooper.
35840,Sheldon,i believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. the cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
40597,Sheldon,"however, the spider-man lyrics posit that spider-man, spider-man does whatever a spider can."
36822,Sheldon,please.
39335,Sheldon,"i’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
40253,Sheldon,over and out. 
45302,Sheldon,"yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. it used to be me. now it’s raj and his attack tribble. anyway, i’m sorry for everything. oh, and fyi, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to mcdonald’s."
34353,Sheldon,"do you want some cereal. i’m feeling so good today i’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. hello, honey puffs."
43678,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
44522,Sheldon,"yeah, excuse me, i need to say something to someone pretty special, and i just can’t wait any longer."
37341,Sheldon,"back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. child’s play. you can start sorting protons and neutrons while i build carbon atoms."
35159,Sheldon,what i’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis.
35728,Sheldon,"yes, i’m getting a free pizza. i’m on a roll."
37756,Sheldon,"of course. pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
39728,Sheldon,"leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because i am very, very hungry."
36965,Sheldon,"all right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. have a nice evening."
37395,Sheldon,afraid not. do you recognize this?
41543,Sheldon,"say it. arthur, say it. say i’m annoying. say it. say it. i’m annoying. say it. "
38045,Sheldon,"now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
42751,Sheldon,"i do. now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless."
44535,Sheldon,"okay, howard’s on board. what do you think, leonard?"
35250,Sheldon,"okay, where were we? "
38215,Sheldon,i’ll have the chicken noodle. goodnight.
37969,Sheldon,"it’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. oh, lord, my belly!"
36253,Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as portland.
40519,Sheldon,"it’s a frisbee-sized wormhole, leonard. you can block it with a frisbee. calm down. "
40027,Sheldon,quantum physics makes me so happy.
44440,Sheldon, amy.
42278,Sheldon,"so, tomorrow?"
38352,Sheldon,there’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
45352,Sheldon,"excellent. excellent. and on a related point, you’re going down, punk."
40515,Sheldon,"you’re asking a lot of questions, wil wheaton. as a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? never mind, i’ll choose.  you were so good in stand by me."
40615,Sheldon,"how can you sleep? i’m not done making you feel better. i still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply vaporub to your chest."
34844,Sheldon,"he lied, and i’m feeling very uncomfortable about it."
44161,Sheldon,"uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. beverly. wil wheaton. adam west, for some reason."
43124,Sheldon,i don’t believe it matters what the topic is. what’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. it’s all about the execution.
44013,Sheldon,the one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
34409,Sheldon,"alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
35935,Sheldon,"good morning, dr. stephanie. i trust leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
39018,Sheldon,but…
41560,Sheldon,"yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? i finally decided what prize i want. hurry up."
37761,Sheldon,"my room, of course."
42997,Sheldon,hmm. living or dead?
43022,Sheldon,that’s it. we’re done with the questions.
43531,Sheldon,"blue icees and a trip to the container store? it’s like i died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven."
42406,Sheldon,"well, if you’re going to serve cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it."
34336,Sheldon,no.
40492,Sheldon,"first of all, you’re welcome. and furthermore, not being familiar with wil wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. get ready for 130 hours of i told you so.  she’s hooked."
45588,Sheldon,see? we both think so.
38741,Sheldon,but we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
45264,Sheldon,"i know our apartment’s small, but i think we can make room."
41101,Sheldon,the third floor landing. the poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. it’s really you.
43594,Sheldon,"well, that’s unacceptable."
38685,Sheldon,"oh, and we’re going to use props?"
35492,Sheldon,"danger, danger."
40504,Sheldon,"on the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman."
41514,Sheldon,"hey, isn’t that professor proton?"
36725,Sheldon,i’m dr. cooper from the physics department.
39396,Sheldon,"careful, you’re using too much downey. you know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
44585,Sheldon,my head hurts and i’m more tired than ever.
41374,Sheldon,i’m not a child. i know the word ninny.
40048,Sheldon,"oh, of course. set phasers to dumb, right?  it’s only logical."
39546,Sheldon,"well, a, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of lascaux, and b, you play the harp. like that’s cool."
35444,Sheldon,"well, the american midwest was mostly settled by scandinavian and germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…."
37804,Sheldon,no.
36347,Sheldon,"alright, let me put it this way. your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work."
34818,Sheldon,"and you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
42614,Sheldon,"oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. it’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants."
38948,Sheldon,"we did it! i said, we."
40394,Sheldon,"it’s fascinating. let me see if i can duplicate the result. howard, i’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. care to weigh in?"
39423,Sheldon,can i have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
41033,Sheldon,sad.
38379,Sheldon,what did he say?
45149,Sheldon,"you’ll never believe it. leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and i get to operate an actual locomotive."
40573,Sheldon,"no, i don’t."
38811,Sheldon,wonder what she’s exasperated about. hello?
36497,Sheldon,"i’m curious about the whole social construct. on its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. what i’ve observed, however, is howard wolowitz crying like a little girl."
34813,Sheldon,"i don’t guess. as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as i’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. "
44789,Sheldon,"night. if we did continue living together, would it be here?"
45193,Sheldon,"actually, we met online."
38276,Sheldon,you’re so close.
44028,Sheldon,"my plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."
39683,Sheldon,"remarkable. diamonds, crystallized carbon. every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. but just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
40143,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no, of course not. it’s just, i was thinking… oh, gosh, golly, i made a boo-boo, and i gave it to stephen hawking."
38543,Sheldon,"good one, boss."
35202,Sheldon,"year after year, i had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. "
37025,Sheldon,all right.
41073,Sheldon,by playing tic-tac-toe?
37064,Sheldon,"i see. now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
45753,Sheldon,"thiospinel sulfide. thiospinel sulfide. that’s even more fun than gee-ode. hey, did you see the lego movie?"
35870,Sheldon,"i do. do you? because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since i sat down."
34198,Sheldon,"don’t stop. yes, keep going. just like that."
44815,Sheldon,"no, this is for science. i can be brave for science."
42240,Sheldon,how many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
39175,Sheldon,"all right. this is a form indemnifying me from your use of leonard’s bedroom. sign here, indicating that i tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
44484,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. they’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
37822,Sheldon,go ahead.
38462,Sheldon,it’s simple biology. there’s nothing i can do about it.
34859,Sheldon,"that’s the best part, you don’t have to, see i told penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. "
39550,Sheldon,"the question is moot. there is no way that stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to amy farrah fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
37384,Sheldon,"professor norton, although, god knows why. he hasn’t published anything of note since he won that nobel prize."
37995,Sheldon,"until i can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
43018,Sheldon,"well, i don’t enjoy presents. and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas director’s cut."
34342,Sheldon,you might want to speak in a lower register.
44848,Sheldon,"amy, come back. i don’t know how to open the oysters."
40598,Sheldon,"i can think of many things spider-man can’t do that a spider can. one, crawl in your ear and die. two, legally leave guatemala without a passport. three, have sex with a spider."
39614,Sheldon,"wear loafers. look at dr. saul perlmutter up there, clutching that nobel prize. what’s the matter, saul? you afraid someone’s going to steal it? like you stole einstein’s cosmological constant?"
36162,Sheldon,"you’re clearly misremembering. your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and i’m betting she never hit you with a bible because you wouldn’t eat your brussels sprouts."
37501,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you where i’ve been. you boys may have had gelato with stan lee and gotten autographed comics, but i saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
34820,Sheldon,"no, i imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago. "
35615,Sheldon,"whether or not he was trying to kill me. for the record, i maintain he was. where are you going?"
45591,Sheldon,that was fun. it was like mario kart.
41459,Sheldon,you’re not listening to my side of it.
39800,Sheldon,"oh, he’ll be back. wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind."
42613,Sheldon,"yes. i’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
37053,Sheldon,are you currently pregnant?
34601,Sheldon,"or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. "
41321,Sheldon,"you say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
42761,Sheldon,but what about our agreement?
44379,Sheldon,"oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
43775,Sheldon,and there goes my list.
41289,Sheldon,"oh, great. do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
36884,Sheldon,silence! how much longer must i wait for my revenge?
39159,Sheldon,"oh, congratulations."
37739,Sheldon,i didn’t want to upset you. howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
38806,Sheldon,water. neat. with a little umbrella.
38377,Sheldon,this is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. this is where we could have been if koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
40760,Sheldon,"a hush falls over the crowd as cooper studies the board. he makes his move. he’s dividing both sides by i. he’s adding back the coefficient. he has a value for p. he’s plugging that back in. he takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. the crowd goes wild. nobel! nobel!"
42086,Sheldon,"okay. well, what do you do?"
44416,Sheldon,khloe?
35398,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
43819,Sheldon,"well, i’m not everybody. i have an eidetic memory. i should be able to remember what song this is, but i can’t. something’s wrong with me."
35290,Sheldon,"well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind. "
36672,Sheldon,"thanks, mom."
40053,Sheldon,"why? i got away with it. leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. and i have a toy that isn’t broken. everybody’s happy."
40142,Sheldon,"no, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. i-i don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
44534,Sheldon,"not at all. in star wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
39292,Sheldon,all aboard! woo-woo! it’s official. i’m an h-o trainiac.
44409,Sheldon,"oh, i overdid it myself last night. hair of the dog."
37359,Sheldon,"i do. for thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. do you have anything like that?"
38887,Sheldon,i hate you.
41343,Sheldon,"that’s amusing, i was going to say that about m.i.t., but it works for princeton, too."
40832,Sheldon,um…
43163,Sheldon,this is so amazing.
43031,Sheldon,it was a monday afternoon. you joined us for indian food.
39451,Sheldon,"hello, howard. i’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. allow me to say, job well done.  perfect."
37643,Sheldon,"oh, i think we both know the answer to that question."
40588,Sheldon,to burying the hatchet.
38874,Sheldon,"and is this my card? rats! i wonder if howard used a radioactive tracer. where am i going to find uranium-235 this time of night? come on, craigslist."
34851,Sheldon,"no, i made him up. i think you’d call him lee. "
43743,Sheldon,"excuse me. no one does a better job pretending to be a person than i do. siri comes close, but i know more jokes."
38385,Sheldon,"this is indiana jones, not star trek. there should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. and even at star trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
39406,Sheldon,but i apologized. and that was hard for me because i didn’t do anything wrong.
34863,Sheldon,good for you. 
40687,Sheldon,no. no. no. this is tondelaya della ventimiglia.
40534,Sheldon,"well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist."
41998,Sheldon,"okay, let’s do this."
34320,Sheldon,"ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
35545,Sheldon,aaaah!
44816,Sheldon,"oh, jiminy, that’s cold."
41593,Sheldon,"seven years ago, i found out the dvd was late and i paid for it."
38978,Sheldon,"i know. the group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. everyone was set a-twitter. although oddly, no one tweeted."
42369,Sheldon,"hmm. do you know how to integrate x squared times e to the minus x, without looking it up?"
38216,Sheldon,"i know how to get the bucket! i can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. let’s see. go north. you are in a forest. go north. you are in a forest. go north. you are in a forest. oh dear, i believe i’m lost. well, i’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
41259,Sheldon,it is to me; that’s the point.
34993,Sheldon,"well, up until now i’ve had better things to do. so, what are we making today? "
34316,Sheldon,archimedes would be so proud.
42125,Sheldon,clogzilla. that’s pretty funny. i don’t think that’s gonna pass.
34195,Sheldon,"oh, yeah."
38480,Sheldon,that’s not correct. we were implying it. you then inferred it.
43662,Sheldon,space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
37475,Sheldon,only a suggestion. a catch in your throat would work just as well.
39855,Sheldon,366… 367…
38701,Sheldon,"oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
36208,Sheldon,did you notice the sign on his counter? he’s not a full-time dry cleaner. he also makes keys.
39583,Sheldon,"excuse me. excuse me. pardon me. pardon me. excuse me. hi, stuart."
36078,Sheldon,what part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
35851,Sheldon,"yes, see, of the handful of women leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one i have ever found tolerable."
36367,Sheldon,"hold on. you honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
44922,Sheldon,"well, leonard, you know, who should keep this? on the one hand, i love mr. spock more than you do. on the other hand, i care more about clocks than you do."
36264,Sheldon,but the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
34568,Sheldon,"see, this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting. "
34790,Sheldon,"goodbye penny.  oooh, one of these days, pkshhhh!"
38972,Sheldon,why are you smiling?
42006,Sheldon,"and of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
37112,Sheldon,that’s not fair. i got stuck behind a tree.
44501,Sheldon,"do i say stop what, or just throw in the towel?"
37893,Sheldon,i can’t date amy.
41709,Sheldon,"actually, much better."
37034,Sheldon,"for the record, i should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
45721,Sheldon,i’m going to need a larger shirt. this one’s a little tight under the arms.
41083,Sheldon,"doesn’t matter, does it?"
35575,Sheldon,"yeah, we’re going to have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work, i bought these star wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. i don’t like the way darth vader stares at me."
41112,Sheldon,potato clock. do potato clock.
38148,Sheldon,he does it all the time. he’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
38458,Sheldon,amy’s changed. i might have to let her go.
36559,Sheldon,"you actually had it right in the first place. once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. bazinga! well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. the president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
41916,Sheldon,"you’re right. without realizing it, i’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality."
37068,Sheldon,why are you such a stupid head? that is also rhetorical. i’m sorry you had to hear that.
41169,Sheldon,what do you do?
41050,Sheldon,"wait. hold on. i believe screw it, i’m going in is what i said to your mother last night. don’t worry, i didn’t really say that. i find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
21831,Sheldon,i’m just going to keep knocking till you answer.  leonard?
40696,Sheldon,let’s not call it a problem. let’s call it an opportunity. to solve a serious problem.
35186,Sheldon,"okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. "
38344,Sheldon,captain kirk won.
42497,Sheldon,is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
37407,Sheldon,"i’ve made you breakfast. juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. see, here’s frodo."
38044,Sheldon,"my apologies. raj, howard, i’d like you to meet dr. robert oppenheimer."
45058,Sheldon,"well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then i’ll miss you x plus one."
40193,Sheldon,"believe it or not, amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
21847,Sheldon,because no one likes babylon 5.
41739,Sheldon,i’ve been studying how to make people laugh. they say that comedy is tragedy plus time. let’s tickle some ribs.
34406,Sheldon,"if i could of, i would of. "
38274,Sheldon,guess.
35370,Sheldon,"that was not fifteenth century soap, my god those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
44926,Sheldon,"well, no, i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. as a kindness, i should probably take all the games."
36748,Sheldon,no.
35076,Sheldon,formal protest. 
44168,Sheldon,"well, everyone will think i’m weird."
41962,Sheldon,"it is. you were wrong, friend howard. she completely understood."
43693,Sheldon,all right. but this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
36061,Sheldon,oh i do like monkeys!
40208,Sheldon,he asked her during coitus.
40988,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll tell you. my goodness, everyone’s on their game today."
44683,Sheldon,yes.
45480,Sheldon,i hurt myself juggling.
44097,Sheldon,"i suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. and speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former soviet union. hubba, hubba."
42348,Sheldon,"that’s the one. i believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
43871,Sheldon,"well, as you know, i’ll be celebrating amy’s birthday with her, and i could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift."
41522,Sheldon,"but i’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. look how happy he is."
37208,Sheldon,the zoot suit riots.
39530,Sheldon,"age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. need i go on?"
36427,Sheldon,"yeah, provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the dc multiverse."
34527,Sheldon,"hi, leonard. it’s me, sheldon. in the living room. i just, i wanted you to know i saw the tie. message received. you’re welcome. you carry on. give my best to lesley. "
37013,Sheldon,the ducks in my tub.
39838,Sheldon,my family took a trip to florida when i was a child. a seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. i got the message.
42305,Sheldon,hurry.
39028,Sheldon,"a girls night? oh, i don’t know if i’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
35611,Sheldon,"now, how do you propose i get home?"
37991,Sheldon,i’m behind you. please look at me when you’re talking to me.
36460,Sheldon,"so, i win."
38880,Sheldon,"i said, ta-da. show’s over."
36099,Sheldon,"unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work."
42220,Sheldon,"i thought that subject had run its course, so i changed it. it’s called reading the room, amy."
42506,Sheldon,"well, i wonder if anyone’s tried that."
44631,Sheldon,okay. talk.
45561,Sheldon,"oh, thanks. dr. nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern. and she brought me this duty-free toblerone."
45707,Sheldon,you’re welcome. please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. i’m trying to stream a movie on netflix in here.
40755,Sheldon,"captain, what are your orders?"
41232,Sheldon,"well, if you’d like, we could call him. i mean that you could call him. as i’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. as rock and roll bad boy paul simon once said, i am a rock, i am an i-i-i-island."
34411,Sheldon,now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
35814,Sheldon,so what exactly do you want us to do?
40949,Sheldon,all your ideas address the issue at a university level. by then it’s too late. you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
35560,Sheldon,i want you to check before you accept the order.
34323,Sheldon,"no we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not."
37807,Sheldon,"not penny, me!"
41818,Sheldon,how do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the comic-con police?
41449,Sheldon,bleugh!
41793,Sheldon,i’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
38325,Sheldon,"no. if anything, i made it worse. in any case, i have been riddled with guilt, which is causing gorn-infested rem sleep. so, i’m here now to say i’m sorry."
34203,Sheldon,"no. we are committing genetic fraud. there’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring, think about that. i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers."
44339,Sheldon,"yeah, amy, just one second. meeting."
35469,Sheldon,"you’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, penny."
44908,Sheldon,"you know, i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
40797,Sheldon,that’s awfully personal.
40074,Sheldon,"oh, okay, let me see this. all right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. now, i was thinking… howard, you go ahead and eat. this isn’t going to make any sense to you."
41564,Sheldon,"well, you barely looked. let me see."
41542,Sheldon,"it’s because i’m annoying, right? i know it is. say it. say it. say i’m annoying. "
43484,Sheldon,"hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to sheldon cooper presents: fun with flags. you may notice that i’m holding a remote control. that’s because my cameraperson and co-host, dr. amy farrah fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. i’m going to pause here to let that sink in. okay. if you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. but the show must go on. and thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. we’re here to talk about flags. tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women i have a feeling were responsible."
37956,Sheldon,i was going to. i planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
44192,Sheldon,"to be clear, leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the t-shirt and mugs. oh, now they own the mugs."
45174,Sheldon,there’s no way.
40344,Sheldon,"it’s a kindness, leonard. otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."
41594,Sheldon,"i was going to mention it at the time, but then i thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
41032,Sheldon,okay.
37512,Sheldon,"well, yes, but i found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
39738,Sheldon,cut. did you not see we are rolling?
35692,Sheldon,he did.
38774,Sheldon,did you get the part?
40299,Sheldon,i do. you clear on the shampoo issue?
38855,Sheldon,it’s not amazing. all magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
39352,Sheldon,"would you prefer a simpler application of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which i could either know where you are or whether i like you, but not both?"
44123,Sheldon,and can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
43095,Sheldon,"oh, right. this is a disaster."
34994,Sheldon,"really, how does it work?"
40684,Sheldon,"i need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. uh, to protect those involved, i’ll be changing their names."
35427,Sheldon,oh now you’re just making stuff up.
34912,Sheldon,"well, as i predicted, i am sick. my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate. "
44743,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
40350,Sheldon,"well, i don’t sell my friendship that cheaply."
44115,Sheldon,"oh, no."
36337,Sheldon,– what’s wrong with it?
41988,Sheldon,"yes, but now that i’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. boy, i can’t wait to see the look on her face. we’re leaving right now."
36045,Sheldon,"yes, well it’s better than what wolowitz did. he drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
40071,Sheldon,big fat whopper. i hope it breaks.
38240,Sheldon,and me.
43152,Sheldon,let me ask you this. do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
42815,Sheldon,okay. go ahead.
40398,Sheldon,i couldn’t agree more.
40585,Sheldon,"which i find totally unacceptable. i must be the bigger man. therefore, you may use my spot until such time as i learn to drive or get a batmobile."
43605,Sheldon,"there’s that prostate doctor, but i’m still mad at her. oh, there’s a woman. i’ll make her my girlfriend."
44797,Sheldon,"i need to see it. while i’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow."
36768,Sheldon,"you know, i’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
42120,Sheldon,"apparently, i called stephen hawking last night."
43732,Sheldon,"i realized something. when amy was in my life, i was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
36602,Sheldon,"oh, good, i got it right. are you upset?"
40160,Sheldon,and the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. ba-da-bazinga!
39059,Sheldon,fascinating.
39252,Sheldon,"i said, name one. you really need to work on your listening skills."
34488,Sheldon,yeah.
41305,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. you find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
38180,Sheldon,"amy farrah fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
35508,Sheldon,drink a healing potion.
45481,Sheldon,"howard said i could borrow it, bernadette said forever."
37721,Sheldon,"no. it’s just a suspicion i have. mmm, mmm, mmm."
42165,Sheldon,that’s an easy guess. i’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
42397,Sheldon,you violated the sanctity of my mouth.
35837,Sheldon,hello.
41237,Sheldon,that you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
38841,Sheldon,i’m unhappy.
35942,Sheldon,"oh, she is. she’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
44524,Sheldon,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
43627,Sheldon,thank you. aren’t you sweet.
34219,Sheldon,hi.
38796,Sheldon,raj’s television. i just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
37855,Sheldon,your surprise confuses me. i live here.
42495,Sheldon,i think i have the same one.
45169,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home."
34762,Sheldon,you can’t. i’m the lead author. 
45429,Sheldon,"yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. people were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
35511,Sheldon,good to know. big old five.
45231,Sheldon,"very well. hey, comic-con tickets go on sale this friday. you can’t buy one."
43362,Sheldon,it was. i asked her if she thought i should watch the flash.
35496,Sheldon,"some what? oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
38973,Sheldon,"oh, i’m back to trains. woo-woo."
36180,Sheldon,"you see right through me, don’t you?"
37649,Sheldon,do you people even hear yourselves? it’s not the wesley crushers. it’s not the “wesley” crushers. it’s the wesley “crushers.”
43805,Sheldon,"how can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?"
37952,Sheldon,"the earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
35146,Sheldon,and don’t ever call me shelly.
35826,Sheldon,so you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
35901,Sheldon,"i’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. which brings me back to my question, where are you in . clearly, i’m 14 days too early."
38182,Sheldon,"my apologies. good night, amy."
44300,Sheldon,"oh, well now, we’ll never win. you always play the drinking game."
39949,Sheldon,"mr. d’onofrio? it’s sheldon. they didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so i got you this. i don’t know if you can read his little t-shirt. it says, um, get well bear-y soon. trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. with that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
41188,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. you know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches."
37136,Sheldon,can’t you hold it?
42651,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, i’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."
44508,Sheldon,did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
45785,Sheldon,"thank you. that’s what i was going for. now, leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. for your convenience, i disassemble into four pieces."
45661,Sheldon,i guess i won’t be needing this.
40741,Sheldon,you’re right. nice going.
41269,Sheldon,"oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. anyhoo, leonard will be back in a couple days and i need a welcome home gift for him. as he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
39457,Sheldon,"you know, the german philosopher, friedrich nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
45559,Sheldon,that’s the only kind of admonishing i do.
36235,Sheldon,"oh, i always enjoy that, but i’m a little busy."
36880,Sheldon,"in the words of khan noonien singh in the immortal wrath of khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and i shall have him."
36360,Sheldon,what?
35221,Sheldon,"something he wouldn’t buy for himself. something fun. something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router. "
34329,Sheldon,hang on.
35551,Sheldon,now?
44226,Sheldon,you got emotional when that lab monkey died.
40781,Sheldon,what do we have to lose?
36503,Sheldon,are you suggesting i sleep on the couch.
41901,Sheldon,"i can’t talk right now, i have several thousand updates to install."
37206,Sheldon,"well, i understand there are several types of artificial women. maybe you should look into that."
43875,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no. she’d be going alone. well, if you think i’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep."
42028,Sheldon,"no, don’t look to him. he’s mad at you right now."
37007,Sheldon,shall i come back at a better time?
39464,Sheldon,hi.
45542,Sheldon,howard hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
35592,Sheldon,thank you for driving me to work.
43208,Sheldon,isn’t that a little juvenile?
41182,Sheldon,"very well. things between you and penny have never been better. i hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. i should have opened with that, huh?"
44462,Sheldon,"excuse me, i paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when i arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. oh, no, no, no, no, wait, i ask you all again, a show of hands. who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in."
42682,Sheldon,it was like a grapefruit.
39043,Sheldon,what’s 16 times 14?
44945,Sheldon,and now you know as much about him as i do.
44976,Sheldon,can i look yet?
36819,Sheldon,"i’m impressed, raj. those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
44435,Sheldon,did you make the apology as sincere as i would have?
40926,Sheldon,"all right. i don’t want to, but at least that makes sense."
41233,Sheldon,"oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
34480,Sheldon,"this is not a sarape. this is a poncho. a sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother. "
45421,Sheldon,and that’s exactly what i did. i found a lot of someones. 
43076,Sheldon,"you just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?"
44766,Sheldon,your klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
34478,Sheldon,"i was working with luminous fish, and i thought, hey, loom! mom, what are you doing here?"
42877,Sheldon,"oh, really? what if i don’t? and before you answer that, can i have my dessert?"
44368,Sheldon,"well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly."
38546,Sheldon,"oh, i’m, i’m sorry. i assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but i realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
34733,Sheldon,you indian.
44946,Sheldon,will you keep it down? what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running?
45249,Sheldon,hello.
39781,Sheldon,what’s that?
38410,Sheldon,i’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
40524,Sheldon,where are you going?
42314,Sheldon,"i do, but, i feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."
35030,Sheldon,and of course it’s gravity probe b.
36011,Sheldon,"have faith, gentlemen. we don’t need wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. watch and learn. do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
36227,Sheldon,"well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy "
43561,Sheldon,"in my present, it’s in the future. in your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man i met in the home depot parking lot."
42749,Sheldon,"no, it’s not good enough. it has to be perfect."
38617,Sheldon,"good morning. if i could have everyone’s attention, please? i know we’re all eager to get on the road to big sur, so if we focus, i’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. then it’s just q&a, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
36823,Sheldon,"so, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
42513,Sheldon,you said quantum coupling. that made me think of the show quantum leap. that’s a tangent and it’s your fault.
44763,Sheldon,"so, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
42520,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, i’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field."
37470,Sheldon,"i’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. so shall we rehearse?"
44157,Sheldon,but this is my birthday suit. are you having a stroke? because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
34879,Sheldon,"unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab. "
38298,Sheldon,did i say mars rover?
41642,Sheldon,why are you here?
44689,Sheldon,"if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
37268,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
42255,Sheldon,"good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish."
37921,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
40468,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
39372,Sheldon,"you’ve already signed something, brent spiner. your name on my list. from this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
40887,Sheldon,"yes, and as you know, i planned to pretend to enjoy it. i’ve been working on this facial expression all day."
37765,Sheldon,"well, she doesn’t care for hotels. and who can blame her? windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. all right, i believe i have time for one more question. yes, raj?"
42441,Sheldon,"oh, i think that sounds wonderful."
45397,Sheldon,"i, no, that is preposterous. maybe."
37452,Sheldon,"november 16? penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and i had to drive you to the emergency room."
35270,Sheldon,well menelaus was the brother of agamemnon…
40050,Sheldon,"what is it now, tiny spock?"
34333,Sheldon,i helped run some cable for a webcam.
40531,Sheldon,"not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products."
36850,Sheldon,i didn’t say that.
42102,Sheldon,"i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band. of course, i’d be the dreamy one and the smart one."
42859,Sheldon,"and how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? continue."
41122,Sheldon,"met my childhood hero, now i get to ride in an ambulance. boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever."
44075,Sheldon,"no, i wouldn’t."
40587,Sheldon,"oh, stop. and i believe this is yours. fyi, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground."
44856,Sheldon,"some genius. i zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice."
41327,Sheldon,i let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. you have any idea the kind of coupons i’m going to get in the mail now?
35926,Sheldon,how is it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c? is that imaginary? i don’t think so.
35163,Sheldon,"so there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. "
34736,Sheldon,"it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. "
45459,Sheldon,"i guess i just need to face it, i’m no longer a wunderkind. now i just wonder what’s for lunch."
42381,Sheldon,howard’s allergic to peanuts. how can i use that against him?
42830,Sheldon,i’m not going. would you like to know why?
37099,Sheldon,"leonard, she’s doing it again."
36090,Sheldon,"yeah. shoulda, woulda coulda, raj."
37040,Sheldon,"oh, i think we’re going sufficiently fast. what’s that?"
34709,Sheldon,"romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
41133,Sheldon,dungeons & dragons.
38745,Sheldon,"just a few things you may need tonight. there’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something i procured from the school of pharmacology. they say it is to viagra as viagra is to a green m&m."
38362,Sheldon,"did leonard? i’m no expert, but i believe what we just heard from penny was sarcasm.  oh, good. i’m eight for 26 this month."
37223,Sheldon,"they don’t? well, apparently, these people and i differ greatly on the definition of party."
35028,Sheldon,"but i answered, it’s called teamwork. "
43133,Sheldon,"she said my name first, that must kill you."
37579,Sheldon,i question your premise. how is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
35674,Sheldon,"that would be acceptable. on mondays, i eat thai food. mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from siam palace."
41769,Sheldon,"i’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  penny. sorry."
43549,Sheldon,it says here you’re a chemist. which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
41577,Sheldon,"how those nipples feeling, chief?"
36864,Sheldon,"yes, i’ve moved to a four-napkin system. lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. if you like, starting tomorrow, i’ll add a guest napkin, but i’m afraid there’s nothing i can do for you today.  good luck. that’s the face napkin."
43941,Sheldon,it is kind of cute.
42224,Sheldon,i brought my own. no sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
39435,Sheldon,"oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  ah. okay, all right. that one was clever. skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. come on out, merry pranksters. take a bow."
45244,Sheldon,"i was talking about leonard. and if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
45544,Sheldon,and when you’re at the gate?
35195,Sheldon,"for the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of bertram forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. "
39025,Sheldon,"thank you. if you think about it, greek food isn’t that far from italian food. they share a spice palette. and what a civilization is the greeks. they gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
42325,Sheldon,i called leonard because i failed. and i didn’t want you to think less of me.
44782,Sheldon,"despite recent events, i do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
41447,Sheldon,"couple things, actually. your tone of voice, your body language…"
34506,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll have the barbecue burger. "
45271,Sheldon,"if real dogs gave me buttons, i’d like them, too. well, i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
34223,Sheldon,not with commentary.
43522,Sheldon,"yes, we could use science. but it’s your bachelor party. lighten up."
42442,Sheldon,"yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the mesozoic spot."
35374,Sheldon,"notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
36528,Sheldon,"excuse me, stuart. have you read the new flash?"
42257,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, well, i’ve already given this some thought, and i’m willing to let penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
43082,Sheldon,"well, that can’t be right."
37857,Sheldon,that’s not afternoon. that’s preevning.
42084,Sheldon,your failed attempt to go back to college?
36310,Sheldon,"penny, i’m a physicist. i have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
40571,Sheldon,"morning, professor stevens. don’t look at that whiteboard. that’s my math, not your math. keep walking, nosey."
42537,Sheldon,"all right, amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. if we run into any problems, i’ll contact you. and if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?"
38786,Sheldon,"we could. we could also stop using the letter m, but i think that idea is isguided and oronic."
45567,Sheldon,"oh, not at all. i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening, and, oh, i had lunch"
45742,Sheldon,"hello to you, too. i’m sorry, but this is important."
40709,Sheldon,"so i’ve been told. but i can’t understand what she has to complain about. i mean, she has a front-row seat as i make scientific history. there’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. yeah, and just yesterday i led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia."
44332,Sheldon,"you keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard."
38476,Sheldon,"yes, infinite sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because i made it at work."
40131,Sheldon,fine. you have very tiny hands.
39320,Sheldon,"can’t figure out what to do? i remember those days. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to…  stay right here."
43527,Sheldon,what an innovative solution. perhaps i don’t give your mit education enough credit.
35010,Sheldon,said pharoah to moses. 
44988,Sheldon,"some will be successful, some may be homeless. it’s fun to think about."
38810,Sheldon,"indeed. yeah, at one point, raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. it was like the last days of caligula.  oh, i have to get this. umbrella?"
41243,Sheldon,yes.
39197,Sheldon,i have paperwork that says differently.
39802,Sheldon,"social niceties have been suspended, leonard. we’re in a state of a emergency. the world has descended into darkened turmoil. lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
42823,Sheldon,i’ve been cooped up in here too long. maybe i need some fresh air.
42149,Sheldon,i don’t understand my food. chinese noodles with korean barbecue in a taco.
34537,Sheldon,"oh, that is so… so…"
41121,Sheldon,"oh, yeah."
45426,Sheldon,"oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. i’ll go first. okay, here. uh, heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. and the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? and heisenberg says, darn it, now i don’t know where i am."
44451,Sheldon,"uh, uh, i couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line."
39554,Sheldon,who are you?
35507,Sheldon,these are market research questions. i’m filling out the online registration for your game.
36575,Sheldon,"odd, president seibert posed the exact same question."
40761,Sheldon,nobel. kripke. don’t look at my board.
34484,Sheldon,"to my room, and no-one’s allowed in. "
40722,Sheldon,"yeah. now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, i’m gonna need you to take it for me. oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad."
41655,Sheldon,so no more interviews?
36318,Sheldon,all right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
36048,Sheldon,what do you mean!?
35699,Sheldon,i suppose. battlestar galactica comes on tonight.  and then never ever watch it.
36142,Sheldon,which means his triumph will be even larger. minstrels will write songs about him.
44293,Sheldon,once. the battery ran out on my phone. i had to wait for my ipad to turn on.
37560,Sheldon,"that’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into xavier’s school for gifted youngsters, but go on. leonard?"
38628,Sheldon,that’s not apropos. we’ve already established i’m found in the periodic table.
37381,Sheldon,"actually, he might have to. there’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. the term was coined in 1976 by economist fred hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
36868,Sheldon,i have money.
35423,Sheldon,smart? i’d have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as smart.
44885,Sheldon,really? i didn’t know that.
45654,Sheldon,"oh my! that’s awfully sticky. alright, let’s see. bernie bunny has two daddies now. it’s probably about homosexual rabbits. jerry the gerbil and the bullies on the bus. read it, not helpful. oh! here we go. stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo. author sarah carpenter lives in fort wayne, indiana, with her husband and best friend mark, and their cockatoos too. hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?"
43081,Sheldon,i have mixed feelings about doing interviews. i like the part where i talk. i do not like the part where the other man talks.
41863,Sheldon,"uh, i do. uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the miller hook and platform?"
40894,Sheldon,at the bottom.
38683,Sheldon,all right. yes. i see a sign. it says camarillo state mental hospital.
35600,Sheldon,you’re going up euclid avenue?
44194,Sheldon,"it sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
39764,Sheldon,and that’s why we wear hard hats.
38232,Sheldon,"is that really what you want to talk about, leonard?"
34194,Sheldon, leonard…
34694,Sheldon,shhh! 
37981,Sheldon,why are you doing that?
40047,Sheldon,"illogical. oh, damn it spock, you’re right. i’ll do it."
36998,Sheldon,really? where’s your friend justin going to sleep?
36516,Sheldon,no. start over.
43699,Sheldon,when there was no more room in the floor safe.
42238,Sheldon,that’s your problem. you can’t be alone.
39750,Sheldon,"well done, dr. koothrappali."
43259,Sheldon,tonight works better for me.
44725,Sheldon,"stuart, this is bert from the caltech geology lab, and this is mrs. petrescu from downstairs."
40188,Sheldon,"bishop to queen four, level two. check."
37605,Sheldon,"penny, leonard. would you be able to answer some questions i’m having about the events of last night?"
41334,Sheldon,i suppose so.
39246,Sheldon,what?
42036,Sheldon,"you know, however, with the xbox one, i can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. up until now, i’ve had to use leonard."
37911,Sheldon,sorry. i just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
35831,Sheldon,all right. leonard went to  the office.
45323,Sheldon,"all right, let’s start right now. uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
45331,Sheldon,"that’s smart, because sheldon 1, amy 0."
44254,Sheldon,i have a ziploc bag filled with all my old ziploc bags.
42509,Sheldon,"mmm, not bad. you know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. it’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
42709,Sheldon,and now it’s time for the speed round of flag or not a flag.
36626,Sheldon,"of course not. even in my sleep-deprived state, i’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. bazinga!"
45790,Sheldon,it’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
21798,Sheldon,you said you’re a scientist. what is the sixth noble gas?
37736,Sheldon,i’ve been seeing penny behind your back.
42074,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i’ve had a lot on my plate. we happen to live in a golden age of television."
39491,Sheldon,would you like to talk about it? and keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
35775,Sheldon,it’s saturday night. saturday is laundry night.
36044,Sheldon,"there are a number of acceptable answers, for example, c: near earth transport, but certainly not b: avocado rancher. and your essay, suggesting that i’d have better luck making friends if i wait ’til the cylons take over? please."
42921,Sheldon,he still hasn’t responded. what’s taking him so long?
40644,Sheldon,"i know they’re making a rhetorical point, i just don’t know what it is."
45823,Sheldon,"leonard, are you listening to me?  "
43737,Sheldon,"well, it was the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me. now that i’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that i employ your services once again."
38233,Sheldon,what do you want to talk about?
36020,Sheldon,"i did this. monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. no matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
34782,Sheldon,what did he say?
44887,Sheldon,"no, i went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
43499,Sheldon,unhand me. this is ridiculous.
36410,Sheldon,only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
35307,Sheldon,do you know any card tricks?
42080,Sheldon,"yes, but you wouldn’t understand."
34845,Sheldon,hungry? tired? i’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit. 
39149,Sheldon,"pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
42628,Sheldon,thank you for understanding.
37835,Sheldon,"no, it’s not."
45115,Sheldon,"what, leonard, please. i know an angry face when i see it. it’s this red frowny guy on my phone."
37367,Sheldon,i don’t drive.
38636,Sheldon,"good morning and welcome to science and society. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, bs, ms, ma, phd, and scd. omg, right? perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. all right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. miss rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?"
41679,Sheldon,i believe i can answer that.
39236,Sheldon,"when i rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
39182,Sheldon,"congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. here’s your i.d. card, your key and your lapel pin. which leonard was too cool to wear. fyi, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other sunday for fresh air."
42299,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i understand that i’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. while i slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. now, typically, i wear pyjamas, but i recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the man. i’ll have you know, mahatma gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. my good man, now, before you walk away, i know that i may appear deranged, but i am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. go ahead, ask. bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. my legs are getting cold. why won’t anybody help me?"
36799,Sheldon,"another reason to consider a life of piracy. even today, i understand that’s an all-male profession."
44768,Sheldon,"no, no, he’s over there."
41515,Sheldon,"look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. let’s go say hello."
34313,Sheldon,challenge accepted.  we’re locked out.
40434,Sheldon,play. play. play. play. play.
43684,Sheldon,i don’t like being extorted like this. especially by him of all people.
42800,Sheldon,"well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."
43943,Sheldon,that’s a great idea. i’ve got it. we’ll call it cooper.
35654,Sheldon,i’m transcending the situation. i’m clearly too evolved for driving.
40449,Sheldon,"oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded."
41700,Sheldon,"no, it’s not. i’ve seen things. lady things."
36113,Sheldon,this is money i’m not using.
40168,Sheldon,"leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. i don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think i feel about theirs?"
36865,Sheldon,"i’d imagine you heard any number of things today. when you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, raj, how are you, raj? given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? and possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
41123,Sheldon,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
42885,Sheldon,that’s not gonna work.
34827,Sheldon,i’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny. 
38415,Sheldon,"yes. if penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. sign here."
38866,Sheldon, is this your card?
41848,Sheldon,"well, you don’t like princess corncob, you don’t like fester, you’re just impossible to please."
34613,Sheldon,he’s a hobbit! i’ve got your back. 
42707,Sheldon,how about four thousand. one for every domino i set up to make that american flag. please enjoy these highlights.
34256,Sheldon,yes. 
37994,Sheldon,an accident.
38345,Sheldon,impressive that you know that. it’s hard to believe i’m actually having this conversation with you.
40179,Sheldon,"and how do you propose to do that? uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of lsd thought control. because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school."
34935,Sheldon,"no, visiting professor. anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than i’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia. "
42525,Sheldon,"i’m always busy. this mind is capable of advanced multitasking. you know, currently, i’m attempting to solve the penrose conjecture, i’m composing my nobel acceptance speech for when i’ve solved the penrose conjecture, and i’m wondering how mermaids have babies."
34593,Sheldon,close! neeeeeoooooowwwww!
37098,Sheldon,"i made a boo-boo, all right?"
38069,Sheldon,"well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. i can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there."
39248,Sheldon,you take it easy! i need to use your shower.
42763,Sheldon,they’re perfect. it tastes like her hugs.
39721,Sheldon,"needy baby, greedy baby indeed."
36561,Sheldon,"that’s 14 hours away. for the next 840 minutes, i’m effectively one of heisenberg’s particles, i know where i am or i know how fast i’m going, but i can’t know both. yet how am i supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
39481,Sheldon,"i have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
42195,Sheldon,arthur. i thought you were dead.
34460,Sheldon,"no, this is fun. oh, the thing about tomatoes, and i think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit. "
41895,Sheldon,"yeah, she’s right. you’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches."
41373,Sheldon,because you’ve been training for this your whole life. you live in a pile of dirty laundry.
44119,Sheldon,i guess we’ll call this a draw.
38326,Sheldon,"yes. i followed the social protocol. i attempted to right the wrong, and when i failed to do so i delivered a heartfelt apology. now you say apology accepted, and i will offer you a one-time-only high five."
41405,Sheldon,yes. but not as good as i’m going to when i tell you that your precious garfield has no reason to hate mondays. he’s a cat. he doesn’t have a job.
38262,Sheldon,"sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable."
39524,Sheldon,"for an audience with the queen, yes. for an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  what am i thinking? whiskers!"
37795,Sheldon,morning. i trust you had a pleasant night.
45473,Sheldon,you’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
43032,Sheldon,"yeah, and you’re still eating our food."
41177,Sheldon,would you like to hear a classic sheldon cooper factoid?
36936,Sheldon,"so leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
35442,Sheldon,"well that’s not surprising. that baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
36287,Sheldon,"despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, i must forfeit."
35065,Sheldon,informal protest.
38843,Sheldon,thank you.
39353,Sheldon,"in fact, i have 61 of them. would you like to see the list?"
34833,Sheldon,i was not aware of that. 
41707,Sheldon,i’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
40157,Sheldon,talk to the hand.
39427,Sheldon,"no, we don’t. the one we have works great."
37779,Sheldon,"no, she’s my guest. if anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. elizabeth, can i get you something? perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
38697,Sheldon,hoo!
35416,Sheldon,leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
38599,Sheldon,how?
42865,Sheldon,yeah.
38558,Sheldon,really? why?
38002,Sheldon,"in a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does scott joplin play the maple leaf rag?"
37213,Sheldon,"let me offer you a compromise. sometimes when i feel stifled and want a change of scenery, i use my imagination."
45595,Sheldon,"that may be true, but dr. nowitzki’s just a friend. in fact, i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
36479,Sheldon,"oh, i shall.  no!"
45445,Sheldon,"comments from our behind the flags retrospective. get this, people are calling it the longest one yet."
40863,Sheldon,"i said the truth. you don’t want to live with leonard, and you know it."
40076,Sheldon,"please, please, please let me meet hawking."
44732,Sheldon,"well, no, that’s not true. i mean, sometimes it’s koothrappali. but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
34563,Sheldon,"yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? "
43434,Sheldon,"leonard told me what happened, so i took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage."
44734,Sheldon,"all right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
42774,Sheldon,you know what you could make us do? ice-skating. the cold air will trigger leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a zamboni.
34226,Sheldon,that’s the beauty of it.
43685,Sheldon,how can you trust wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
38434,Sheldon,interesting. not body parts that usually team up. what about environmental factors? describe the scene for me.
44590,Sheldon,"you want to bet? oh, great, now i’m addicted to gambling."
42182,Sheldon,"oh, i’m not going to the funeral."
44654,Sheldon,be grateful i’m still in the room.
37782,Sheldon,you’re just misappropriating my understanding.
34913,Sheldon,"no. not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. "
35925,Sheldon,"it’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
40195,Sheldon,"they let me blow the whistle, leonard."
37747,Sheldon,"okay, but just don’t fight"
43282,Sheldon,you see where i’m going with this.
41925,Sheldon,wait. you were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
42186,Sheldon,"uh, no, thank you."
39889,Sheldon,i’m sorry. we just need a word.
44772,Sheldon,interesting. very interesting.
42819,Sheldon,okay. here we go. proton decay. proton decay.  proton decay. proton decay.
34997,Sheldon,"and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you, bubbula. but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. "
42521,Sheldon,i started doing it.
35663,Sheldon,"in short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. any questions? of course not. i weep for the future of science. now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of batman is out. come, leonard."
39814,Sheldon,no.
35830,Sheldon,then how can i say it convincingly?
35972,Sheldon,"no, it’s too late. i see it. that elf sticker says to sheldon. the die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, hannibal has crossed the alps."
42542,Sheldon,good. little claustrophobic.
41574,Sheldon,you say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. i say situations like this make me feel the same way. 
42123,Sheldon,"oh, i hope so. what happened to you last night?"
42326,Sheldon,yes.
44131,Sheldon,"this video. the baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
34600,Sheldon,you have a back-up hypothesis. 
39925,Sheldon,"what, and let him win? do i look crazy to you? we’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  and you, the notes are c, d, e, g and a. you pick one or i am chopping down that tree!"
34414,Sheldon,what should i tell her.
38779,Sheldon,i’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
40580,Sheldon,"hey, sweet ride."
41599,Sheldon,"uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year i criticize it. do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
39250,Sheldon,"yes, i did. and now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the redwood national forest."
45195,Sheldon,"no. no, i only told leonard, howard, raj, kripke, uh, professor wu, professor klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. how everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
41366,Sheldon,"and i’m sure your parents are proud. now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to fantastic four member the thing, who’s made entirely of…"
35988,Sheldon,"i should note i’m having some digestive distress, so, if i excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. oh, a napkin."
38260,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve heard of that place, isn’t that pasadena’s favourite irish watering hole."
43160,Sheldon,"yes. oh, i’m so excited. and i just can’t hide it."
34366,Sheldon,considering what? how great this place looks?
39374,Sheldon,"well, mom, if i did, it would be conclusive proof that your god can work miracles."
37283,Sheldon,"oh, as small as leonard is, i don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
34273,Sheldon,you think with your penis.
42890,Sheldon,"well, you could have set newton’s gravitational constant to one. and, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. you know i can’t stand these scented markers."
45422,Sheldon,"and now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments. "
37902,Sheldon,you know i don’t drive.
44057,Sheldon,that’s a risk i’m willing to take.
37988,Sheldon,thank you. 
36183,Sheldon,and i told you i wanted to see a doctor’s note.
35214,Sheldon,"i accept your premise, i reject your conclusion."
40920,Sheldon,"oh, so many crazy rules."
42970,Sheldon,"no, no. we designed an experiment involving you. see? now, isn’t that interesting?"
39735,Sheldon,"fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, oregon. oh, look. hello, mr. beaver. in future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. what’s the only non-rectangular flag? what animal appears most often on flags? what animal appears second most often on flags? and more."
40514,Sheldon,"well, that was a long bus ride for not very much."
43555,Sheldon,"i suppose. what happened to me, amy? years ago i was completely disengaged from my feelings. i’d say it was a happier time, but i was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?"
40293,Sheldon,did you know that leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? hubba-hubba.
44434,Sheldon,hey. is everything smoothed out with amy?
44944,Sheldon,"that’s true, but had i done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id."
38954,Sheldon,"fine. in the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?"
41803,Sheldon,i’m fine with it.
38898,Sheldon,it’s all gone. all gone.
41607,Sheldon,"yes, miss amy."
37227,Sheldon,"oh, yes. so, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
43052,Sheldon,or if they accept daddy’s application to live on mars.
35557,Sheldon,thank you.
39730,Sheldon,"you’re right, i’ll give him a shot."
37300,Sheldon,good thinking. perhaps i’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
36408,Sheldon,may i interject something here?
43803,Sheldon,"hey, let’s not pull at that thread. okay. i’ll fight spongebob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. um, i’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem i’m having with my current friends. which means i’ll have to eat the hagfish."
39045,Sheldon,"if you’re referring to the beverage, you know i don’t drink. if you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, i have one."
39727,Sheldon,i’ve got to go with leonard on this. he is wrong more than anyone i know.
39309,Sheldon,hamburgers and lemonade.
38759,Sheldon,what’s going on?
43895,Sheldon,oh. all right. um. i should probably tell you something about this gift.
39198,Sheldon,irrelevant. rajesh and i have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it.  what are you doing here?
42947,Sheldon,"if i was okay, i would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello."
36951,Sheldon,you accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. lose one turn and a retina.
45044,Sheldon,"oh, well you know, that is interesting. i wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. my money’s on fungal. they’re still having girls night across the hall."
34822,Sheldon,i need to speak to you.
37610,Sheldon,perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
45469,Sheldon,raj is teaching me to make croissants.
45253,Sheldon,"not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…"
35248,Sheldon,"my apologies leonard, i’m only as good as my teacher. "
37009,Sheldon,not surprising. you have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
42805,Sheldon,it’s okay.
42867,Sheldon,"oh, you said it."
43814,Sheldon,what are you talking about?
44270,Sheldon,thanks.
44805,Sheldon,i’m just contemplating buridan’s donkey.
37697,Sheldon,"ah, i do so love beverages. now i think i’ll take my after-dinner walk."
37949,Sheldon,"not true. the fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. who’s to say that i don’t share that flawed dna?"
42674,Sheldon,that’s for the fire marshal to determine.
36568,Sheldon,"yes. in fact, he was quite enthusiastic. he said, “frankly, if i could send you tonight, i would.”"
42909,Sheldon,"oh, nice to meet you, mr. insightful."
35598,Sheldon,"studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
34611,Sheldon,you’re in trouble. 
34380,Sheldon,penny for your thoughts. 
39849,Sheldon,here you go. this is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by carl sagan.
36244,Sheldon,"here. i’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
41882,Sheldon,what is your problem?
36178,Sheldon,"normally, i’d feel the same way. but based on everything i’ve observed about us, i can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together."
37877,Sheldon,no one ever does. that’s why it happens.
35656,Sheldon,"well, those are indicators that i’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
40657,Sheldon,"oh, it’s like i’m really there."
41633,Sheldon,can we talk about something else? do you know that i yodel?
40886,Sheldon,okay. shall we go to dinner?
45039,Sheldon,oh. a small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
39438,Sheldon,gentlemen. .
37330,Sheldon,don’t be ridiculous. what would i do with corn?
44927,Sheldon,are you sure? these items represent our shared times together.
45505,Sheldon,"wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
42439,Sheldon,"okay, new plan. we go to disneyland, play hide and seek on tom sawyer’s island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch."
40174,Sheldon,it’s not an accident. i waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
45347,Sheldon,"well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
37318,Sheldon,is it morning?
34392,Sheldon,"if you’re compiling a mix cd for a double suicide.  oh, i hope that scratching post is for you."
39412,Sheldon,that lecture was a waste of time. i made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
38431,Sheldon,i’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
35019,Sheldon,"or the one. dammit, i’ll do it. "
37454,Sheldon,"penny, i have an eidetic memory. also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
43149,Sheldon,what reference?
43186,Sheldon,"before i answer, was he a smoker? i think you’re looking at this all wrong."
40011,Sheldon,"gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the republic and the light side, or the sith empire and the dark side."
45724,Sheldon,"oh, good, leonard, you’re here. science news. this will interest you. and, penny, feel free to paint your nails."
38026,Sheldon,greetings.
40663,Sheldon,all right. i think i cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
39627,Sheldon,"you’re being too kind, leonard. you ruined him."
43398,Sheldon,"no, of course not. they thrive on our suffering."
45157,Sheldon,"interesting. well, so i was right."
36728,Sheldon,told you.
45382,Sheldon,what’s going on? how’d i get here?
36175,Sheldon,what are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
39664,Sheldon,"she’d see right through that. we go to the zoo all the time. she knows my koala face. and for future reference, it’s this."
40020,Sheldon,"well played, amy farrah fowler. let me get my coat.  oh, grow up, leonard."
43807,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sure you and leonard will be able to pull it off.  oh. it’s my friend amy. hello."
42440,Sheldon,he makes a valid point.
40490,Sheldon, angry amy.
39690,Sheldon,"you’re right, the tiara was too much."
39023,Sheldon,"this is greek food? leonard, you hate greek food."
35487,Sheldon,"leonard, you have to do something about penny. she is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if i had another significant aspect of my life, i’m sure she’d be interfering with that too."
41020,Sheldon,"i’m not sure, it could go either way."
37821,Sheldon,good what?
45411,Sheldon,that’s nice. now in german.
39656,Sheldon,"superb. this morning i made a palindrome with my alpha-bits. nice hat, bob tahecin."
42484,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t suggest a beach house."
38413,Sheldon,include me in what? is there a plot afoot? i’ll have no truck with plots.
37750,Sheldon,explain your sneeze.
44018,Sheldon,"i believe i can answer that. uh, like me, raj is demonstrating empathy. now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free t-shirt, uh, i hope extra small is okay. for some reason wolowitz took a medium."
43175,Sheldon,what if i told you that i was the voice of yoda? a recording session i must attend.
43385,Sheldon,"my aunt and uncle were married 63 years. towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
39337,Sheldon,it’s part of my sword collection. do you have a sword collection?
41318,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll give you that one."
38676,Sheldon,gotcha.
39823,Sheldon,ha. perfect. okay. get this. professor jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. five times the limit of e to the upsilon as in a 
36835,Sheldon,english is your native language.
45036,Sheldon,what? is there another twist coming? is the baby not theirs at all?
36678,Sheldon,my objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
38396,Sheldon,no. crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
39974,Sheldon,"oh, relax. it was just her bottom and her breasts."
38091,Sheldon,"all right, all right. he can buy his own desk."
37841,Sheldon,"all right, let me restate that. it’s very heavy, and i don’t want to."
41440,Sheldon,dr. fowler?
45564,Sheldon,oh. you must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
42943,Sheldon,"oh, really? when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?"
34769,Sheldon,"uh, just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly."
43061,Sheldon,"first of all, this has only made me stronger. but beyond that, all i did was fill out an application."
43779,Sheldon,"no. um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"
42050,Sheldon,penny?
42701,Sheldon,"so as they say, all good things must come to an end."
35162,Sheldon,i hadn’t considered that. we do share dna.
41563,Sheldon,i seem to be a few tickets short. are there more in the box?
36172,Sheldon,can i make you a cup of tea?
38209,Sheldon,i know.
36967,Sheldon,got it.
38666,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, i thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road."
38936,Sheldon,good point. basket of puppies.
45220,Sheldon,"well, last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
34269,Sheldon,technically that would be coitus interruptus.
39254,Sheldon,you need to remove that chair from the building. it’s a health hazard.
40873,Sheldon,"oh, no, no. that’s not going to happen, no. what i need you to do is find a valentine’s gift for my girlfriend."
34930,Sheldon,good. good.
42697,Sheldon,"i can’t send it back, i had it engraved. here lie the ashes of leonard hofstadter. he thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”"
39742,Sheldon,"confound it! you’re right, it’s brilliant. let’s take it from the top."
35662,Sheldon,you saw nothing! 
44235,Sheldon,you wouldn’t.
41568,Sheldon,okay.
45128,Sheldon,"i thought i was getting better at it, but clearly i’m not."
37862,Sheldon,"well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why i’m having this conversation with you."
44469,Sheldon,"oh, you’re welcome."
36553,Sheldon,fascinating.
39682,Sheldon," trust me, we are not a couple."
36708,Sheldon,i don’t see anything.
37898,Sheldon,i know. i can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
36969,Sheldon,"this is a restaurant. it’s lunchtime. i would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
43946,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, great news. we discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."
41685,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t just say smart things about science. i also yodel. "
36035,Sheldon,"it’s a questionnaire i devised. i’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so i’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
37780,Sheldon,"excellent. if the yogurt works, i bought some delightful scented candles."
41535,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, did i wake you?"
37264,Sheldon,when does the csi team get here?
39421,Sheldon,okay.
42845,Sheldon,"oh, that is infuriating. ooh, look, they went back up again. terrific. oh, no, they went back down."
35465,Sheldon,do you have the enchanted sword?
39388,Sheldon,"mom, you remember rajesh? rajesh, my mother."
43123,Sheldon,"oh, i’m aware. it features whoopi goldberg. she played guinan on star trek: next gen. penny, next gen refers to star trek…"
39477,Sheldon,you’re leaving?
41626,Sheldon,ain’t she great? 
45457,Sheldon,"well, i don’t like it."
38979,Sheldon,"i’m familiar with everything, but go on."
36919,Sheldon,"if you want to blend in with penny’s friends, i’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
36322,Sheldon,want me to show my work?
42493,Sheldon,"you know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. the, the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c. clarke. the motorola flip phone, that came from star trek. and i’ve long suspected that the idea of an african-american president was stolen from the movie deep impact."
44457,Sheldon,"excuse me, excuse me, can i please see a show of hands? who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?"
34450,Sheldon,or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
37168,Sheldon,i understand. you dispute newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top.
45329,Sheldon,"thank you, you are a good citizen. told you. go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. same thing’s gonna happen."
41146,Sheldon,"yeah, we, now, penny, we don’t consume alcohol during dungeons & dragons. it impairs our judgment."
41082,Sheldon,"well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…"
36899,Sheldon,i can’t.
39817,Sheldon,"oh, no pressure. just get him a crummy card, you’re good."
45750,Sheldon,gee-ode. gee-ode. i kiss girls now.
45265,Sheldon,wow. i’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
41465,Sheldon,"i wasn’t speaking about me. i mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. you know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. giving you the opportunity to drive me home. breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
36816,Sheldon,of course i’m busy.
35703,Sheldon,hide me.
34906,Sheldon,"oh, dear god.  leonard! leonard, i’m sick!"
35695,Sheldon,i prefer to think of it as i’m pulling them forward.
41303,Sheldon,right.  penny. are you going to answer the door or should i open it and say aha again?
35155,Sheldon,that’s okay. lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
45068,Sheldon,would you like to play a driving game i invented?
36949,Sheldon,i’ll just roll for you.
40736,Sheldon,"i know mr. data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes."
38993,Sheldon,"i must say, amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
35222,Sheldon,what do you think.
37668,Sheldon,"you did this, didn’t you?"
37773,Sheldon,"shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends brad and angelina."
40979,Sheldon,i can’t tell you that. i’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
39983,Sheldon,"amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
44593,Sheldon,you guys stink.
42803,Sheldon,"yes. yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life."
44091,Sheldon,"so from now on, this program will be officially known as dr. sheldon cooper and dr. amy farrah fowler present dr. sheldon’ cooper’s fun with flags."
44611,Sheldon,cohabitation with my girlfriend? that’s a great deal to process.
35189,Sheldon,i’m a theoretical physicist.
34465,Sheldon,"are you sure. there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. for example, i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
41109,Sheldon,"oh, no. how could anybody hate gino the neutrino? it’s nice, huh? i got him for 20 bucks on ebay. including the shipping!"
38271,Sheldon,with real puffing smoke?
45550,Sheldon,"oh, and one last thing. if you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like thor, well, then i want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."
38170,Sheldon,"oh, no worries, i explained my predicament to our letter carrier. he was sympathetic. his exact words were, got your back, jack. bitches be crazy."
42775,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, leonard, i’m a problem-solver, it’s what i do."
41021,Sheldon,"yes, hello. i’m fine. um, i understand you may have a bad impression of me, so i bought you a gift."
45085,Sheldon,doesn’t like games. that’s one.
41460,Sheldon,well…
41794,Sheldon,too bad. it seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
43936,Sheldon,"well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, i’ll be happy."
43620,Sheldon,thanks. and i taste good too.
41553,Sheldon,"actually, i don’t need that. i hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
34788,Sheldon,"libido 1, truth zero. "
36022,Sheldon,"you’re right. monte’s gone. we’ll bury him in the morning. a simple ceremony. i’ll speak. leonard, you’ll play your cello."
37596,Sheldon,"thank you, leonard."
42268,Sheldon,"ugh, it’s like walking into the amazon. and not the good amazon with one-day shipping. the awful one with birds and snakes."
44966,Sheldon,"well, i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
36845,Sheldon,"fine.  oh, lord. dr. koothrappali, as your superior, i forbid you from writing on my board!"
38486,Sheldon,milk dud?
37239,Sheldon,"it means come in. it’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. i disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now i thought i’d learn finnish."
36392,Sheldon,he’s upstairs at alicia’s.
45483,Sheldon,"wait, i need help getting down."
40407,Sheldon,yes! this party just became a major rager.
40612,Sheldon,"well, not with that attitude."
38089,Sheldon,because…
44537,Sheldon,i am not a know-it-all. i’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
39837,Sheldon,"hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to lost was filmed. mahalo for nothing, hawaii."
35420,Sheldon,she called me dumbass.
37080,Sheldon,i was humiliated on national radio. how do you think i’m doing?
42547,Sheldon,"then i’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."
43686,Sheldon,"or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
42336,Sheldon,"yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the cloud."
38825,Sheldon,"don’t make this harder than it is, leonard."
40310,Sheldon,"but, then mark ruffalo was the hulk in the avengers, and he was even better."
38958,Sheldon,"yeah, but not your books. something they might enjoy. i kid, of course. big fan."
40173,Sheldon, amy?
42331,Sheldon,"that’s a good point. you know, i’m a lot like gandalf the grey. he fought the balrog and emerged stronger than ever as gandalf the white. i was robbed of my phone and pants, and i, too, came back stronger. and whiter, too, ’cause i wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks."
40181,Sheldon,super mario bros. theme?
41581,Sheldon,"this chair is squeaky. now, do i fix it or get a new one?"
41360,Sheldon,not with a bowling ball on their back.
40655,Sheldon,"well it’s a game of the imagination, leonard. paint a picture."
37357,Sheldon,"no, i wasn’t talking to leonard."
35790,Sheldon,who is it?
36876,Sheldon,"you don’t understand. growing up, i idolized wil wheaton? wesley crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
35932,Sheldon,"hmm, yes, you did. now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. in the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. third,the bathroom schedule. now, i’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that."
44957,Sheldon,and it’s not just an mri. the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you.
43658,Sheldon,"let me give you an example. earlier today, i decoded the headers on your e-mail, and i know that your name is kenneth fitzgerald. from that, i figured out where you live and where you work. now, to make this a mexican standoff, i would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or i’ll turn you in to the authorities."
42994,Sheldon,you ready to begin?
42064,Sheldon,interesting.
35964,Sheldon,nice motivational speech from the team captain.
35074,Sheldon,william shatner.
37481,Sheldon,i object. you’re completely ignoring the law.
35120,Sheldon,what are you doing?
34684,Sheldon, then it’s not dancing night. 
35448,Sheldon,there there.  would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
41477,Sheldon,"gentlemen. uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. i don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. "
41974,Sheldon,because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. aren’t you going to let me out?
38353,Sheldon,it’s for howard.
38941,Sheldon,"you know, the joke’s on him. without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless."
41265,Sheldon,"joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. with leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
39168,Sheldon,you mean the myofascial point?
45494,Sheldon,"oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me."
38726,Sheldon,are you trying to scare me? ‘cause you’re succeeding.
45749,Sheldon,do you know what’s great? geology. oh. look at this geode. that’s fun to say. gee-ode. gee-ode.
36979,Sheldon,yes.
44634,Sheldon,"this is such a relief. honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, i’d kiss you right now."
40904,Sheldon,"if our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. as long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. and, action. so, penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?"
34358,Sheldon,"depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  oh!"
44460,Sheldon,"now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. and, and i realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. now, i ask you again. who here takes issue with this person…"
35590,Sheldon,then i hereby invoke what i’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. the favour.
40297,Sheldon,homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or ph.
37024,Sheldon,"okay, here."
44539,Sheldon,i don’t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
42644,Sheldon,i’m listening to you snore. i’m wondering how i’ll ever sleep without it.
36185,Sheldon,"because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. on three. one, two, three, go!"
45156,Sheldon,"i said to myself, i think i can, i think i can. and then i couldn’t, so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
40511,Sheldon,i’ll tell you. i’m from texas. need i say more?
41555,Sheldon,"second, um, i thought your paper was inspired. "
42728,Sheldon,let’s celebrate.
41639,Sheldon,"here comes the embarrassment express. with stops at fraudville, wonder blunderberg, and kansas city. because it’s a hub."
44333,Sheldon,are you up-to-date on game of thrones?
38042,Sheldon,"now, if you’ll excuse me, i’m off to buy a pussycat."
34907,Sheldon,"leonard, where are you? "
44380,Sheldon,"boy, do i love restrictions."
35414,Sheldon,"penny, hold on. are you sure things can’t work out with you and leonard?"
38641,Sheldon,"all right, why don’t we open it up to q&a from the audience?"
41756,Sheldon,would you like to talk about it?
36723,Sheldon,interesting. you’re afraid of insects and women. ladybugs must render you catatonic. it was a joke. i made it to lessen your discomfort. you’re welcome
37447,Sheldon,because most of the things i’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
42846,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. i’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. from now on, when i make an assertion, i need you to challenge it."
35272,Sheldon,"the last one worked out well for koothrappali. he got a free ipod. oh, glare! "
45506,Sheldon,"if that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
38102,Sheldon,yes.
41845,Sheldon,ay-yi-yi. 
42464,Sheldon,"yeah, he’s right. once, in a moment of candour, i told amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. she stormed out. which was sad, because we were playing scrabble, and i had all the letters to spell persimmon."
35474,Sheldon,people can’t be in my bedroom.
43849,Sheldon,"hey, thursday can’t get here soon enough. i’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while i eat enough star wars cereal to choke a wookiee."
45240,Sheldon,"no, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
39303,Sheldon,"because you don’t have a girlfriend? well, good lord, if that becomes a reason not to play dungeons and dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
38757,Sheldon,"that’s a good idea, get your rest. there are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and daddy needs a new linear accelerator. and i thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you."
34331,Sheldon,"this is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
44124,Sheldon,forget helium. the real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
38073,Sheldon,"done. you understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
40773,Sheldon,"because i’m not interested in getting published in mad magazine. zingers fly fast in the thunderdome, barry."
45178,Sheldon,"you know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
42219,Sheldon,i know. let’s go see the new spider-man movie.
37507,Sheldon,fascinating.
38174,Sheldon,"i don’t know. you’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
36663,Sheldon,"and on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
36755,Sheldon,i see. did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
43148,Sheldon,"play that funky music, white boy."
44999,Sheldon,"eh, i don’t know. i am her precious little boy. and you did take my flower."
37859,Sheldon,"well, tomorrow’s saturday. saturday night is laundry night, so i’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
45064,Sheldon,"well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
43371,Sheldon,"but you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date."
39725,Sheldon,"well, i doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
38886,Sheldon,"hang on. this time do it with me, so i can make sure there’s no monkey business."
38481,Sheldon,"zack, i’m sorry you’re stupid. have a milk dud."
42160,Sheldon,"you can’t be serious. if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense, i’d follow leonard on instagram."
42796,Sheldon,"oh, here’s another one. i wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an a, but i don’t put it there because i don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast."
39611,Sheldon,"look at these men. they’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than god gave a goose. you should pay attention, leonard. someday this could be you up there."
39384,Sheldon,"well, there’s actually big news on the amy front. she’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
36160,Sheldon,what a remarkable woman.
45604,Sheldon,"well, that would raise a number of problems. we’re colleagues. i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment."
37525,Sheldon,"excellent, excellent. tire each other out, the ring will be mine. howard, why don’t you go after raj’s mother?"
40744,Sheldon,"what, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?"
41744,Sheldon,kumquat?
36412,Sheldon,hu-u-u-uh…. hu-u-u-uh!
42249,Sheldon,i don’t know. i am really aggravated.
35893,Sheldon,"more to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together."
38844,Sheldon,i had to leave. they were having fun wrong.
45574,Sheldon,"well, i was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
40821,Sheldon,crazy bastard?
36186,Sheldon,unacceptable. it baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
44248,Sheldon,right.
45280,Sheldon,all set.
43232,Sheldon,thank you. do either of you know beyoncé? i’d love her to get behind it.
39657,Sheldon,"ooh! speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 twitter followers."
39342,Sheldon,possibly.
42110,Sheldon,"that’s actually not bad advice. you know, i didn’t seek out string theory. it just hit me over the head one day."
44256,Sheldon,"well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. you can still feel the dent. it’s right next to the hockey puck dent."
38748,Sheldon,"given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
41024,Sheldon,"um… well… you are black, right?"
45536,Sheldon,"well, no, it’s just, i’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, i can’t skype it to you."
40965,Sheldon,"oh, five more minutes."
39830,Sheldon,sarcasm?
41108,Sheldon,"yeah, that’s great. did you bring your puppet?"
45466,Sheldon,"well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. you need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
45747,Sheldon,"hawkman. it’s your old buddy sheldonoscopy. how come you didn’t pick up the phone? oh, right. my bad."
35562,Sheldon,"then there’s no excuse for this chicken. you know, this situation with koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
34653,Sheldon,your head goes on the other end.
38895,Sheldon,doctor cooper.
40950,Sheldon,"some people are otters, some people are rocks."
41277,Sheldon,"oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. my uncle used to wear that. perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before leonard returns."
36399,Sheldon,i’m just talking about bees. they’re on the discovery channel. what are you talking about?
34646,Sheldon,"well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
37389,Sheldon,what? that’s absurd. penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
39390,Sheldon,offer them a hot beverage.
36933,Sheldon, penny.
37257,Sheldon,"you know, the more i think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
45523,Sheldon,what is there to talk about? you have to take it. it’s important.
41733,Sheldon,"perhaps i’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. unless they’re german, ’cause that’s a tough crowd."
38622,Sheldon,it’s eleven fifteen. i’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
44579,Sheldon,"i am cool. this is yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin."
41424,Sheldon,"yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. from what i gather, brevity is your friend. so, are we good here?"
37505,Sheldon,"who’s adam west? leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
42130,Sheldon,all right. i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday.
36746,Sheldon,have i crossed some sort of line again?
34626,Sheldon,"you know, i apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha?"
43206,Sheldon,"i can just picture them all right now at feynman’s house, probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing schrodinger. see? they’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
34423,Sheldon,"yeah, it really takes the pressure off. "
35467,Sheldon,"well, have you been to the temple of mithra?"
44984,Sheldon,"but if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
39684,Sheldon,really. talk to me about that pocket watch.
43671,Sheldon,"well, did you see this sticker?"
45067,Sheldon,"hmm. yeah, you’re right. it’s like when i first encountered the pythagorean theorem. you know, i was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. but now i’m just like, eh."
36613,Sheldon,"way ahead of you, that’s an “i can’t believe it’s not butter” stick."
44804,Sheldon,hello.
37872,Sheldon,interesting. my mother and i have the same agreement about church.
34435,Sheldon,"in my defence, i prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
44041,Sheldon,"oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!"
45108,Sheldon,sad.
36351,Sheldon,"no, i don’t drink coffee."
40190,Sheldon,very well. can i ask you a question about women?
39132,Sheldon,hello.
36734,Sheldon,"penny, i’d rather not talk about it."
38455,Sheldon,hello.
44282,Sheldon,"well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."
39873,Sheldon,"i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory. after all, i did book the whole week."
34865,Sheldon,"it’s a very nice community. the queen mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. "
45147,Sheldon,really?
37120,Sheldon,"penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
39520,Sheldon,do you think it’s a date?
38333,Sheldon,ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
37704,Sheldon,i didn’t say outside.
40708,Sheldon,thank you.
34258,Sheldon,no.
44877,Sheldon,"thank you, penny. you know, i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure."
37710,Sheldon,i shall. have a nice scoot.
35325,Sheldon,why don’t you take a minute to decide  i can’t keep your secret penny. i’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. like a renaissance triptych. like a cheap suit.
37571,Sheldon,"where exactly? sheldon square? sheldon towers? sheldon stadium, home of the fighting sheldons?"
44066,Sheldon,yes.
38257,Sheldon,from an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
34915,Sheldon,i want soup.
45638,Sheldon,is that woman aishwarya rai?
44376,Sheldon,"or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby."
35224,Sheldon,"he doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch "
42159,Sheldon,your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
42559,Sheldon,"you tell me. i feel like i can’t breathe, and i am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs."
40106,Sheldon,that’s a lot of belt buckles.
35892,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have a question about dating and relationships."
36243,Sheldon,that’s over the wheelbase. are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 pullman-built superliner deluxe passenger coach?
40328,Sheldon,"now, are you sure? everyone’s smoking them. i think they’re the best."
40409,Sheldon,we seem to have different approaches here. i was going for helpful honesty. i have no idea what you’re doing.
36356,Sheldon,"look at planck’s constant. people say it’s arbitrary. it could not be less arbitrary. if it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. bam! now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. bam! this is a space where we are all essentially alice through the looking glass, standing in front the red queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. bam! of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another sheldon, let’s call him sheldon prime…"
38656,Sheldon,i sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. would you mind very much jumping to it?
44869,Sheldon,how did you deal with it?
36448,Sheldon,"oh, good, stuart, i thought i heard your voice. do you have a moment?"
35373,Sheldon,"don’t be silly, i borrowed one of your pillow cases."
44998,Sheldon,"there’s always one. she gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. that one had some un-christian words in it."
41349,Sheldon,"oh, see? now he gets it."
39984,Sheldon,i use it to get the right way. the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
35483,Sheldon,"if it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then i plead guilty.  oh, penny!"
34976,Sheldon,"why waste food. in texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. "
36993,Sheldon,right now would be good.
42573,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
35917,Sheldon,"i had no choice, he cried in front of her."
43328,Sheldon,but i wasn’t. ‘cause i didn’t have any friends.
36520,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re finally home."
41675,Sheldon,it probably won’t.
38542,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, we’re doomed."
34243,Sheldon,well.
42412,Sheldon,"yeah, which i was initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding."
45080,Sheldon,"if you find this draft acceptable, then i believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
39117,Sheldon,what?
40967,Sheldon,"please, leonard, he said it’s okay."
37362,Sheldon,"oh, that would be good! sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and i sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
39603,Sheldon,"okay, penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. an e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to sweet georgia brown. pick."
39475,Sheldon,i’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
44392,Sheldon,you’re gonna enjoy this. i designed it especially for you.
42466,Sheldon,"yeah, well, of course i am. i was also right about her hair. it did everything but quack."
36320,Sheldon,there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you.
38477,Sheldon,"no, although it’s a question i’ve been pondering since preschool."
38551,Sheldon,"well, but hear me out. the atomic bomb was the manhattan project. windows 95 was originally project chicago. for our app, i would humbly suggest project nodlehs."
35506,Sheldon,"so listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
42781,Sheldon,"well, once again, it’s what i do."
34760,Sheldon,"leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a nobel prize, is the day i begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. "
40502,Sheldon,my problem is i’m out of tea.
36655,Sheldon,that seems like a bit of an overreaction.
40495,Sheldon,"well, it’s been a rough day. i usually go chamomile tea, but i don’t think that’s going to cut it."
43883,Sheldon,"oh, no. not that. i, i understand the mechanics."
45000,Sheldon,anyway…
36008,Sheldon,"we don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. we can’t run away from a fight."
39608,Sheldon,"oh, oh, oh. was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
44749,Sheldon,buda and pest united to form budapest. and that’s why budapest is the budabest. now.
37523,Sheldon,"no, it’s mine."
42253,Sheldon,mm.
45095,Sheldon,"well, i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
35323,Sheldon,"there’s no reason to bring my looks into this. good day, leonard."
40771,Sheldon,why don’t you show me yours first.
36437,Sheldon,"so, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday?"
42624,Sheldon,it’s not just that. leonard and penny also made comments about it. and i’m not blind. even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
42690,Sheldon,you know this is all your fault.
36445,Sheldon,my original point.
40075,Sheldon,"yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it."
34732,Sheldon,a beloved character from an indian folk tale. 
45370,Sheldon,"yeah, i felt the same way about the platypus. you know, bird and mammal in the same creature? no way. and spoiler, way."
34772,Sheldon,a little misunder…. galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding.
42371,Sheldon,no.
36451,Sheldon,"well, i’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the dc comics batman chatroom, and i need your help."
42112,Sheldon,"ah, normally i refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?"
42407,Sheldon,"good, i had cornish game hen."
43862,Sheldon,"see, i, i had tickets to the star wars premiere that night, but professor proton came to me in a dream dressed as obi-wan kenobi and convinced me i should be with you."
36597,Sheldon,yes.
35194,Sheldon,what about the cream cheese frosting.
44962,Sheldon,i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid.
37450,Sheldon,it bothers me.
42544,Sheldon,"just the hits.  where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew."
40207,Sheldon,"it does, indeed. leonard, is it awkward being here with penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
36187,Sheldon,"based on your academic record, any number of things, i would imagine."
39978,Sheldon,"fun time. hah. sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
42134,Sheldon,"you’re right. you’re right. got it. we order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. all right, all right, i’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. got it. there’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every thursday night in griffith park and re-enacts battles from lord of the rings."
42528,Sheldon,"yeah, i have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. next."
41693,Sheldon,"oh, no, thank you, i don’t want to be an inconvenience. chop-chop, leonard. we leave in ten minutes."
39138,Sheldon,"interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
38236,Sheldon,"like, has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
44050,Sheldon,"it isn’t, meemaw. sorry, leonard."
34560,Sheldon,"the thing is, we’re not…."
38597,Sheldon,"well, we sure saw that coming."
42491,Sheldon,i did not get a clear answer. i’m gonna set this down now.
45268,Sheldon,"okay, thanks. just throw it out. speaking of occupants, i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room."
40246,Sheldon,i should hope so. that’s from the first spider-man movie.
42417,Sheldon,"for starters, we enjoy spending time together."
38213,Sheldon,that’s unacceptable. we’re supposed to be given written notice.
39127,Sheldon,fire demon.
35888,Sheldon,"she’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. if i have any hope of keeping them together, i need data. specifically, i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
35486,Sheldon,"hello. penny, this is not a good time. no, i told you, you’re not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls. you need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. penny, i can’t log on and help you. we’ll talk when i get home.  i’m not getting the computing time, am i?"
40509,Sheldon,wouldn’t you like to know?
42056,Sheldon,"oh, it is. although."
43203,Sheldon,do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
40481,Sheldon,walked right out the door.
37045,Sheldon,why do you have the chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
43120,Sheldon,"but you got it, right?"
41136,Sheldon,i’m not sure how i feel about howard being dungeon master instead of you.
44449,Sheldon,but then each of those people let someone cut?
43322,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
40292,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. yeah, pick one, your choice."
35026,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
40793,Sheldon,"what can i say, you know? she enjoys my genitals. i am giving them to her on a nightly basis."
44372,Sheldon,i am going to record this for posterity.
40221,Sheldon,"boldly go, howard wolowitz."
44983,Sheldon,"she’s right. you know, i just learned amy went to a theme park without me, but i’m not going to ruin her birthday. i’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. boop."
35903,Sheldon,i have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
34595,Sheldon,i’m the doppler effect. 
43526,Sheldon,what is that awful smell?
41134,Sheldon,"i’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. hello, new dice smell."
44891,Sheldon,i can’t take this any more.  bert. 
40274,Sheldon,"shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. this is not working out with him."
39662,Sheldon,"oh, i see why you’re confused. no, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. that’s all about yucky, squishy things."
44649,Sheldon,"no, but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
37095,Sheldon,"the reaction will be triggered when kripke reaches the center of the room. mwah, ha, ha."
38881,Sheldon,that does it. i’m getting uranium.
39166,Sheldon,all right.
44700,Sheldon,"i know. it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times. i mean, the first"
43581,Sheldon,"oh, dear."
34604,Sheldon,true. why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
43830,Sheldon,empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. and pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
36297,Sheldon,"bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
38012,Sheldon,sorry we’re late.
38029,Sheldon,are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarke-maxwell or dirac?
39555,Sheldon,"oh, i guess i was wrong."
40955,Sheldon,"hello, female children. allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. polish-born, french-educated madame curie. co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. with a little hard work, i see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. are we done? can we go?"
37592,Sheldon,"really, leonard? you’re just going to try to recycle adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? i could probably get that from the woman at ralph’s. and she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
41262,Sheldon,now i know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
40978,Sheldon,i did.
40829,Sheldon,exactly.
40233,Sheldon,"oh, absolutely. i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that i can’t outsource that to an indian."
44090,Sheldon,"well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, i felt it only right to include your name in the title."
41358,Sheldon,it’s the comic book store.
34914,Sheldon,what else would i drink? gasses? solids? ionised plasma?
35711,Sheldon,shh! ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
43912,Sheldon,"mm, that’s a great question. i like when they’re next to a chipotle."
38736,Sheldon,"no. but we have potatoes, i could make you vodka. it’ll take two weeks."
37177,Sheldon,"neither do i, but it’s the social convention."
37796,Sheldon,"excuse me, i’m going to relieve myself."
44286,Sheldon,"excuse me. here, look up fun, get back to me."
43695,Sheldon,"the first episode of star trek: the original series i ever saw was the galileo seven. uh, spock had just landed on the planet taurus ii. then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. after that day, i was hooked. on star trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine."
35105,Sheldon,it only moves in time. it would be worse than useless in a swamp. 
36838,Sheldon,"all right! first of all, dr. koothrappali, when i first proposed that you work with me…"
38341,Sheldon,"penny, you face failure on a daily basis. how do you cope?"
35321,Sheldon,"i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. "
43736,Sheldon,"thank you for coming by, gentlemen."
40756,Sheldon,wait. they might be hostile.
37755,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, i have something for you. per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that i will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
44259,Sheldon,it ends with dinosaurs. i’m sorry if you think less of me.
44626,Sheldon,"well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. i would like this experiment to go well. are there any insights you can share?"
35705,Sheldon,"um… she distracted me. i told you, penny, i don’t have time for your nonsense, i have important things to do."
42755,Sheldon,"oh. oh, in that case, it was pretty good."
36471,Sheldon,i’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
43323,Sheldon,"doctor hofstadter, i want you to meet my mother, mary."
44911,Sheldon,"yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
38281,Sheldon,"you know, i try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
34491,Sheldon,"i’m not going to apologise, i didn’t say anything that wasn’t true. "
41268,Sheldon,"uh, stuart, i was wondering if you could help me find something."
44306,Sheldon,"no, i crossed in the middle of the street. and normally, i wouldn’t, but i saw an aggressive-looking girl scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
41597,Sheldon,"mmm. you know, i’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so i’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
35480,Sheldon,"i realise that dr gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. university policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
39927,Sheldon,i was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
37749,Sheldon,hold.
43866,Sheldon,"no, i can’t. i need to make preparations for amy’s birthday. which leads me to the following bit of business. this is my ticket to star wars. i don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. i trust you’ll give it to someone worthy."
41159,Sheldon,i’ve never knocked on my own door before. that was a wild ride.
39673,Sheldon,nuts to that. what else you got?
44639,Sheldon,"you, too. oh, don’t forget. tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
41479,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. they called it the greatest thing since the communist party. although i’m pretty sure that the communist party made them say that. i like china. see, they know how to keep people in line."
43146,Sheldon,"we get it, you won the game. stop bragging."
44562,Sheldon,"the way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing."
36587,Sheldon, penny.
37709,Sheldon,perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
36670,Sheldon,"but i would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. that man’s name was, surprise, surprise, albert einstein."
41575,Sheldon,put it on. let’s share the experience.
41619,Sheldon,so was the man who owned the local liquor store. he cried and cried.
44650,Sheldon,"ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
43227,Sheldon,"i want to say no, but it’s too glorious. get in here."
39426,Sheldon,yours.
45701,Sheldon,"i’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home."
43534,Sheldon,so that’s all this day was? a plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
38422,Sheldon,"well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, i will propose a new topic of conversation."
39942,Sheldon,thank you for captioning my nightmare.
41131,Sheldon,"so, in a way it’s like i’m your son."
39621,Sheldon,"the smartest? all right, you know, i may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even i know that was a doozy. leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
44164,Sheldon,"i don’t know. i looked around the room, and i saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
36415,Sheldon,"well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of anything can happen thursday."
42111,Sheldon,a bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
40363,Sheldon,it’s an observational rebuttal of the lambda-cdm model of the universe.
38830,Sheldon,"patience, patience, barry. the whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
38205,Sheldon,"hit troll with axe. hit troll with axe. hit troll with axe. oh my, this is one tough troll."
38647,Sheldon,tell me what?
43459,Sheldon,i will tell you what is happening. i am saving my best friend’s marriage.
42352,Sheldon,you people are sick.
44669,Sheldon,"well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
38202,Sheldon,i’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
39266,Sheldon,thank you.
40764,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous. i am one of the great minds of our generation. i work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. i said stop looking at my cool train!
45512,Sheldon,not really. apparently grief can make one less regular.
36224,Sheldon,that was for my cushion.
39932,Sheldon,you’re not mr. d’onofrio. i get my hair cut by mr. d’onofrio. you believe this guy?
40661,Sheldon,no wonder you love christmas. that sounds amazing.
35636,Sheldon,"i don’t need your help, penny."
38225,Sheldon,with or without a numbing agent?
45717,Sheldon,ew!
35997,Sheldon,"yeah, this is an auspicious moment. yeah, like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
34399,Sheldon,could you be more specific?
42222,Sheldon,i know.
40367,Sheldon,"come on, leonard, i am spoon-feeding this to you."
36701,Sheldon,"howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. humorous word play."
34991,Sheldon,"engineering. where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
43714,Sheldon,"oh, certainly. uh, when i was eight years old, billy sparks cornered me in the playground. i asked myself what would spock do? then i grabbed billy on his shoulder and performed my first vulcan nerve pinch."
36260,Sheldon,"oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
39833,Sheldon,yes. that’s how velma and scooby smuggled shaggy into the old lighthouse.
42289,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter.
34205,Sheldon,i wouldn’t.
44888,Sheldon,i’m so disappointed in myself. jealousy is completely illogical.
40852,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white rice?"
44166,Sheldon,i don’t think i can go back out there.
40238,Sheldon,"oh, i hope that’s a rhetorical question, because i have no clue."
42574,Sheldon,making the extra effort. good for you.
38363,Sheldon,"may i point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
34744,Sheldon,"oh. alright, noted. sorry."
38428,Sheldon,"well, you’re the expert. if the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then i yield."
38903,Sheldon,oh! there isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
39797,Sheldon,and i’m sure some fool in the donner party said the snow would stop any day now. i like to think they ate him first.
42732,Sheldon,"you, at least listen to the premise. since you were born in germany, i thought we could talk"
43396,Sheldon,amy has ended our relationship.
44819,Sheldon,"no, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. you know those things bother me. it’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
43287,Sheldon,"we did it. oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
38389,Sheldon,"munching on complimentary popcorn. woot, woot. oh, the gall. i hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
45418,Sheldon,just roll the clip.  so tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born.
42189,Sheldon,"arthur jeffries was a scientist. i’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. you know, if he were here, i think he’d say enjoy star wars day."
39152,Sheldon,"no, i haven’t. it’s all good."
40349,Sheldon,"okay, one vote for, one vote against. leonard, you’re the tiebreaker."
45626,Sheldon,gentlemen.
34347,Sheldon,morning.
34508,Sheldon,we don’t. this is a disturbing aberration. 
39858,Sheldon,"this is preposterous. i think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, i’ll show you up."
41573,Sheldon,"how about this? i promise i won’t pester you about the dvd. you can defecate in peace. that’s a win for both of us. but, until this matter is resolved, i would like you to wear this sweater. with nothing underneath it."
45024,Sheldon,what? how should i know? excited? itchy? give me the first letter. 
45226,Sheldon,he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
36635,Sheldon,"i don’t know what arctic expedition you guys were on, but i thought it was a hoot and a half."
40870,Sheldon,"so, in conclusion, i believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste."
40724,Sheldon,"that’s a wise policy. i once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. got a terrible case of pinkeye. but luckily, i was going as a zombie. i won second place."
44467,Sheldon,seriously? he invented the rubik’s cube.
40834,Sheldon,um…
35066,Sheldon,no. i decline to provide one.
42593,Sheldon,i’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
43250,Sheldon,"well, penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
45052,Sheldon,"amy is free. she had a harp lesson on saturday but it got cancelled. boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense. "
41958,Sheldon,"well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. penny, your check engine…"
39706,Sheldon,"oh, of course. it’s right here in my hand."
36939,Sheldon,"good. oh, fyi. after i eat my sandwich, i’m taking koothrappali’s patang kite out for a test run. would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
45783,Sheldon,whoopee!
34939,Sheldon,"well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. "
34703,Sheldon,hi.
45405,Sheldon,not to tell anyone.
39794,Sheldon,"i will admit nothing of the sort. and now if you’ll excuse me, i have to call my dentist and see if i can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
45230,Sheldon,you’re talking about me. very funny. although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
42066,Sheldon,a quarter.
38046,Sheldon,robert oppenheimer was lonely.
45079,Sheldon,"i get to write a contract? i say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
40745,Sheldon,all right.
39420,Sheldon,"i hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
41731,Sheldon,the philosopher henri bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object. 
42338,Sheldon,"i know. you know, i almost died in a fire in des moines, but i stayed put. fyi, that’s when the imodium gave out."
37869,Sheldon,"in a few minutes, when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer i do it? the standard i told you so? the classic neener-neener? or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
39843,Sheldon,"boy, oh, boy. this vacation is off to a wonderful start. the smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. mm, i can already feel my cares just melting away."
36638,Sheldon,"i just want you both to know, when i publish my findings, i won’t forget your contributions."
36858,Sheldon,"given the cards that have already been played, penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of osiris."
36631,Sheldon,freeze-dried spicy mustard?
37061,Sheldon,yes. the charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
36328,Sheldon,hot glue.
39670,Sheldon,amy had a fight. i was being perfectly reasonable. i’m gonna have a whiskey. do you want anything?
38816,Sheldon,i’m setting out snacks.
43411,Sheldon,and who’s this guy you’re taking?
39859,Sheldon,"yes, that’s what i think. and i’m super smart, so it’s probably true."
42196,Sheldon,why are you here?
43784,Sheldon,"all right. well, what should we talk about?"
44014,Sheldon,"that would be my understanding. on a less painful subject, what size t-shirt do you take?"
41030,Sheldon,"well, now that i think about it, that would be most helpful."
36808,Sheldon,and you’re wrong about hinduism and cows.
40594,Sheldon,"looks like that laptop’s seen better days. if you’re interested, i’m selling this. it’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of ram, intel core i7 processor, and i can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis."
41953,Sheldon,i have one question. is this a prank where we land in houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a spanish name and then i get arrested and deported to south america?
44705,Sheldon,"i’m sure you’re right. i suppose i should apologize to you, as well."
38424,Sheldon,wrong. the best number is 73. you’re probably wondering why.
44860,Sheldon,"you used to make those jokes about me. now everything is bert, bert, bert."
34441,Sheldon,"i’m not just fixing my eggs, i’m fixing everyone’s eggs."
40359,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. now, how can you not get that?"
34377,Sheldon,"i’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
38263,Sheldon,"don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
35322,Sheldon,well i might ask you the same question. why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? but exist between you and penny. a person to whom i barely speak.  
42321,Sheldon,i just thought you were bad at the game.
40973,Sheldon,thanks. oh. great party.
43583,Sheldon,right. always right.
42575,Sheldon,"ooh, siam palace?"
42288,Sheldon,no. i’ve reached my breaking point. i need to leave. now.
42057,Sheldon,i had the same feeling when i made my dad buy a betamax instead of a vhs.
44987,Sheldon,"oh, speaking of personal growth, i recently tried eating swiss chard. you know, i didn’t swallow it, but amy said it counted."
34584,Sheldon,"like jane goodall observing the apes, i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. "
43981,Sheldon,"well, now, well, that’s hurtful."
40563,Sheldon,get off there.
37378,Sheldon,yep.
39512,Sheldon,"there’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. that is the hell that is going on. we have no worms or seeds here. shoo, shoo."
35863,Sheldon,good. what’s your favourite fruit?
42192,Sheldon,get rid of the trade route part? then how would palpatine get chancellor valorum kicked out of office? how would he get himself elected? how? can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
42889,Sheldon,hmm.
39528,Sheldon,"the question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? my first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
45817,Sheldon,"excuse me, mr. wozniak?"
38106,Sheldon,help me move my desk.
39922,Sheldon,"you don’t get it, do you? that’s a mockingbird. mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. he’s mocking me. oh dear. there it is again. do you feel it?"
36354,Sheldon,"you’re right, of course."
41874,Sheldon,"i may never stop thinking about it. amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?"
38939,Sheldon,careful. that’s a collectible.
39648,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. a man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the caped crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
40456,Sheldon,"oh, but if i do, i’ll be a phony, a sellout, a hollywood poser."
36715,Sheldon,"uh-oh, flashlight went out. i need some batteries. fellas? hello? it’s really dark down here."
35604,Sheldon,"oh, come on, it’s fun. ooh! another bump. okay. i’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one i said, okay? i’ll start. helium. now, you could say mercury. that would give me a y. ooh.  very clever, that’s a tough one. so i go ytterbium, which gets you back to m. so you go molybdenum, and i say magnesium, you say manganese, and  i say europium, and, and you’re left with mendelevium, and  there are no more m’s because i believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. do you wanna go again?"
36309,Sheldon,"i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree. but, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
44329,Sheldon,"of course, it will require a vote. unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, i have my travel gavel."
38461,Sheldon,forget science. she’s horny.
36097,Sheldon,"yes, but they have no icee machines. despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, i might add."
39733,Sheldon,vexillology is the study of flags.
39697,Sheldon,you want to know my opinion?
44640,Sheldon,"oh. oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
41947,Sheldon,"nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over."
44871,Sheldon,perhaps i will. this rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. i will cast you far away. feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
40775,Sheldon,and i am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
39536,Sheldon,"yes. it’s very sweet. now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
41615,Sheldon,i don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. there’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
39400,Sheldon,now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
41240,Sheldon,"oh, no, i don’t think that’s true at all."
36557,Sheldon,great restraint on my part.
38832,Sheldon,question. was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub?
37052,Sheldon,migraines?
43625,Sheldon,perform the experiment immediately.
39559,Sheldon,did it look ridiculous when we got the satanimals pack and i dressed up as a beelzebobcat?
44582,Sheldon,"the first one’s free? flash, how do you stay in business?"
44005,Sheldon,"howard and bernadette, you tried to comfort me when i was ill, and i treated you terribly. i’m sorry."
34903,Sheldon,i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
39938,Sheldon,"fine, but if i come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. "
38807,Sheldon,"sadly, penny, this evening, i am the dark knight, roaming these mean streets alone. a windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
39040,Sheldon,i saved a nun’s life. why am i being punished?
37132,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. now, introduction to physics. what is physics? physics comes from the ancient greek word physika. it’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. physika means the science of natural things. and it is there, in ancient greece, that our story begins."
37308,Sheldon,"all right. boone, north carolina. every summer since 1952, boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, dan’l boone. sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. penny, you’re from nebraska, correct?"
41138,Sheldon,"as good? you just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes."
44454,Sheldon,mrs. wunch in fourth grade. and my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
34410,Sheldon,just do it.
41548,Sheldon,arthur?
36268,Sheldon,"oh, i hate when that happens."
44053,Sheldon,"yeah. and you never will. ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. do it, ask her."
35561,Sheldon,were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali might have intercourse with penny tonight?
38910,Sheldon,"i don’t care! i’m losin’ it, man!"
38454,Sheldon,"oh. as they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi."
39498,Sheldon,"oh, boy. you know ours is a relationship of the mind."
34192,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. that was me having fun with you. look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. yes, that’s how you say it. but, you possess an intelligence i envy. which leads me to my answer. i would choose the ability to read people’s minds."
38971,Sheldon,now i’m thinking about jell-o.
39476,Sheldon,"topic one. faster-than-light particles at cern, paradigm-shifting discovery or another swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? and converse."
42993,Sheldon,"okay, babe, let’s do this."
36135,Sheldon,"in case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that i’ve moved my money out of the snake can."
41920,Sheldon," amy? i’ll get right to the point. i think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my ipad, i didn’t get applecare."
39867,Sheldon,i’m on vacation. social convention dictates that i let my hair down at a local watering hole. social convention is stupid.
35273,Sheldon,"i would not say that. no-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. "
38499,Sheldon,this is how the flash paces.
38370,Sheldon,shrewd.
41684,Sheldon,"well, that seems like a snooze. even for public radio."
40842,Sheldon,yes.
42042,Sheldon,see? that’s what i thought. but then they go and throw in an esram buffer.
36628,Sheldon,it is remarkable.
40695,Sheldon,"well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?"
38987,Sheldon,"yes, i believe so."
21848,Sheldon,"they don’t get a vote. it’s one against one. and according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
42193,Sheldon,"well, you know what else was just a suggestion? why don’t we change the raisin bran box? hmm? and you know who got hurt by that? every single person who eats breakfast."
42840,Sheldon,who eats them horizontally?
42483,Sheldon,"yeah, well, no, not to them. to me. time traveling mailbox. the only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
36887,Sheldon,"i play my endless serpent. raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means larry will have to play chaos overlord, then captain sweatpants, molten river. i play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. now fetch me wil wheaton! bortas bir jablu’di’ reh qaqqu’ nay’"
36792,Sheldon,"well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. how hard is that?"
42931,Sheldon,"click it with me. one, two, three, click."
38845,Sheldon,thank you.
35208,Sheldon,the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators. 
36200,Sheldon,koothrappali picked me up.
36923,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah. all right, poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
41657,Sheldon,you robbed me of my greatest achievement.
36150,Sheldon,"well done, leonard. the true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature."
35824,Sheldon,where are you going?
36282,Sheldon,"you’re holding a japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. first, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. you’ll hear a slight click."
36679,Sheldon,thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
42223,Sheldon,thanks for coming with me.
42609,Sheldon,bruce wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
43154,Sheldon,well then i hate it. music should just be fun.
38539,Sheldon,"oh, of course you are. look at the organizational chart. you’re clearly listed as founder."
42096,Sheldon,you stop it.
38217,Sheldon,yes.
44204,Sheldon,hello.
43901,Sheldon,all right. hello.
44728,Sheldon,"you know, exactly. we’ve never thrown a brunch before, and i wanted to work out all the kinks."
42373,Sheldon,i am trying to prepare my lesson plan for howard. why are you telling me this?
38197,Sheldon,abundantly.
36821,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i believe you’ve misunderstood. i’m not giving you the job. i’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
40086,Sheldon,oh!
45684,Sheldon,i can hear it!
44215,Sheldon,and i just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
44606,Sheldon,but what if we can’t?
34837,Sheldon,"i was analysing our lie, and i believe we’re in danger of penny seeing through the ruse."
36891,Sheldon,three-headed lion.
42926,Sheldon,i’m done hiding from bullies. i’m taking this into the real world.
37653,Sheldon,"no, after you, as we are currently crushing you, wesley."
35915,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, dr. hofstadter."
43046,Sheldon,"after much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. they don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise."
37678,Sheldon,"harsh terms. but all right, i’ll just substitute intercourse."
42234,Sheldon,"slick, huh?"
38418,Sheldon,"i’m going to propose a hypothesis. last night, raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the united states government to keep it a secret."
35823,Sheldon,"all right, goodbye."
40628,Sheldon,i don’t want to. but it looks like you left me no choice.
42374,Sheldon,"amy, please. i am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine."
43260,Sheldon,"uh, building on that, we should order dinner."
41715,Sheldon,why?
37900,Sheldon,i’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with amy farrah fowler.
39681,Sheldon,excuse me. i don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. you’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
34999,Sheldon,did leonard tell you to say that? 
34280,Sheldon,"okay, thanks for your time."
43727,Sheldon,"yeah, right. you can just shut your feelings off. there goes television, lying to us again. we let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. leonard, how could i have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"
38849,Sheldon,"priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
34289,Sheldon,my mom bought me those pants.
45315,Sheldon,"gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
44712,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s say that we were to entertain people. what type of gathering did you have in mind? huh? a meal? lunch? brunch? dinner? afternoon tea? a formal tea? hmm? is it a party? and if so, what kind of party? is it a cocktail party? a tupperware party? ooh, is it a surprise party? oh, i hope it’s not a west coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a west coast party don’t stop."
43854,Sheldon,"well, my friends are telling me i shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new star wars movie."
34799,Sheldon,then i’ll settle for an aneurysm. 
38812,Sheldon,"yes, i was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so i leapt out and ran for it."
44142,Sheldon,"oh, i suppose that’s a discussion we could have."
45339,Sheldon,can you stop breathing so loud? i can hear your nose whistling.
42271,Sheldon,"you and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? why don’t we get a little house, start a family? enjoy our sunset years together? do you hear yourself, woman?"
39741,Sheldon,vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
35951,Sheldon,wha??
40568,Sheldon,"yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. really makes these things tough to budge."
35829,Sheldon,are you going to the office?
38519,Sheldon,"this is my moment, dag nab it!"
43410,Sheldon,"why? is there someone else? just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"
43130,Sheldon,"oh, well, apparently leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. yeah, well, i don’t know about you, but i support our boys overseas."
36517,Sheldon,penny.
44103,Sheldon,"all right. nothing about this is fun. no one wants to talk about flags, and i haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, internet. dr. amy farrah flower present with."
39979,Sheldon,movies or video games? or board game? or trading card games? or lego’s? or dress up? or comic books? or dramatic readings of novelizations? yes to all!
43447,Sheldon,"thank you. and slam it hard, because i am pretty steamed."
38533,Sheldon,"oh, is it? well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
44932,Sheldon,but i designed it.
43840,Sheldon,"i’m, i’m sorry; i didn’t realize you were on a date."
38380,Sheldon,we might not get seats?
35955,Sheldon,like what?
39988,Sheldon,"yes. i’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. can you recommend a gift?"
41518,Sheldon,"this is my girlfriend, amy. amy, this is television legend arthur jeffries. his science show inspired millions of children."
36349,Sheldon,"penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. observe. hey! less talk, more work!"
38074,Sheldon,would you like to see my cats?
45209,Sheldon,that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone.
42824,Sheldon, penny?
35984,Sheldon,"you see, the danger was that i might under or over-reciprocate, but i have devised a foolproof plan. see, i will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
44881,Sheldon,"bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
41777,Sheldon,hello.
45586,Sheldon,what is leonard doing calling you at this hour?
43622,Sheldon,"before i tell you, perhaps i should soften the blow. you’re face is pleasingly symmetrical."
44227,Sheldon,great. now i’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
35956,Sheldon,i think we can safely assume that all kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet krypton exploded.
37440,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t want to know that! how can i possibly discuss with stan lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
34668,Sheldon,"let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, general so’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. do you see the problem?"
38191,Sheldon,"why would i touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs."
42724,Sheldon,"i posted the last episode of fun with flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. all that effort for nothing."
42882,Sheldon,"no, no, comfort is the enemy. you know what’s comfortable? slippers and blankets and panda bears. imagine a panda bear with richard feynman’s face on it. warm up the car, leonard, it’s poster time."
38885,Sheldon,no.
38567,Sheldon,don’t thank me. you earned it.
34514,Sheldon,"i said i could follow it, i didn’t say i cared."
39573,Sheldon,thank you.
45756,Sheldon,can you keep it down? some of us are trying to sleep out here.
36468,Sheldon,"i bet he’s someone from babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
36885,Sheldon,"so, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely larry and captain sweatpants. very well. they must be destroyed."
38278,Sheldon,the capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
38131,Sheldon,"it is if you like bridge. do you like bridge, leonard?"
40358,Sheldon,got it.
42820,Sheldon,"how could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
42018,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why."
40184,Sheldon,you know i don’t drink.
42360,Sheldon,there is no class.
43719,Sheldon,"not true. no, look at me. i had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. and am i emotional about that? no. no, i am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite tv character like nothing happened. ‘cause i am just like him, all logical, all the time."
38060,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
36326,Sheldon,i assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. it’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
42794,Sheldon,"oh, i learned how. amy taught me."
34803,Sheldon,you could have offered me a ride home. 
35349,Sheldon,"yeah, julie newmar, michelle pfieffer, eartha kitt and then her. "
37586,Sheldon,okay. but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  this is absurd. i look like a clown.
40721,Sheldon,"yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that i take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future."
39649,Sheldon,this is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? by lying to them?
41799,Sheldon,penny?
37848,Sheldon,"as a native texan, i must say i’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
39846,Sheldon,"wash those bea… oh, i get it, a little hazing for the new fella. yeah, i’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
41601,Sheldon,do we really have to go to mrs. wolowitz’s house?
40632,Sheldon,excuse me. you’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
42646,Sheldon,"if the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. and if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone."
40605,Sheldon,"i’m not allowed to wear my silver surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
35512,Sheldon,"leonard, this is tom."
38834,Sheldon,"surprisingly, yes."
44867,Sheldon,"i admire you, leonard."
39543,Sheldon,"how could he do this to me? get back here, you stupid bird, so i can love you!"
42218,Sheldon,not at all.
36685,Sheldon,"howard, you know me to be a very smart man. don’t you think if i were wrong, i’d know it?"
39170,Sheldon,there’s someone at my door.
43989,Sheldon,"you know, i liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship."
43897,Sheldon,why are we saying give it to you like that?
35504,Sheldon,what happened to the rest of your group?
34723,Sheldon,"in a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
41745,Sheldon,ointment?
42476,Sheldon,"why, die. why did he die? old, told. i was told he was old."
34379,Sheldon,don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
43173,Sheldon,"all right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
43634,Sheldon,where does he work?
37379,Sheldon,i do.
42395,Sheldon,well?
39450,Sheldon,"i tried to scare an indian with a snake. come on, cooper. you’re better than this."
45120,Sheldon,you first.
37861,Sheldon,"please. even assuming you could answer any question the way i would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
43600,Sheldon,by challenging you to a duel.
42060,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. it’s an mp3 player brought to us by the makers of xbox."
41909,Sheldon,you’re absolutely right. nope.
37815,Sheldon,"i don’t have to go to hell. at 73 degrees, i’m there already!"
38814,Sheldon,cluck-cluck-cluck.
45784,Sheldon,penny. zucchini bread.
35855,Sheldon,"yes. now, should that happen, i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
39845,Sheldon,"okay, what do we start with? maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? ha-ha, i’m a freak!"
39459,Sheldon,"on your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
38224,Sheldon,do you prefer ointment or cream?
36398,Sheldon,"you know, penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. when this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
36696,Sheldon,i sense i may have crossed some sort of line.
34556,Sheldon,"no, i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back. "
37904,Sheldon,"actually, i’m paraphrasing. having been raised in a christian household, i’m uncomfortable with the language he used. and to be honest, i’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
41704,Sheldon,"of course i’m doing laundry. saturday night is laundry night, and i’m in a laundry room, so, i believe your inference is justified."
36232,Sheldon,it’s like talking to a chimp.
39389,Sheldon,"oh, yes, born alone, die alone. it’s a tragic human condition. now, raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good i’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
41729,Sheldon,"leonard, do you think i’m funny?"
37096,Sheldon,"it may be low-tech, but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
43818,Sheldon,okay.  r-e-s-p-e-c-t. no.
41507,Sheldon,she might be contagious. don’t you think i’m having a rough enough day?
41512,Sheldon,"well, you should be. because all i can think about is how much i want to kiss you. and not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. like mommies and daddies do."
41012,Sheldon,mm-hmm.
45669,Sheldon,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
37282,Sheldon,uh-huh.
34776,Sheldon,i couldn’t poop this morning. 
34369,Sheldon,"hang on penny. how about fans, here and here?"
34858,Sheldon,"for a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which i’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
35171,Sheldon,"this has nothing to do with religion. this has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. "
42453,Sheldon,"so, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
45617,Sheldon,what kind of sick?
40746,Sheldon,"gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. we’re starfleet officers and a member of the borg collective."
38756,Sheldon,"smart. get paid up front. yeah, i think you have a real knack for gigolo work, leonard."
35479,Sheldon,"of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
45378,Sheldon,"i am fine. here, eat your toast.  sorry."
44465,Sheldon,"hey, good news, i just got off the phone with my mother. she is coming to the wedding."
38746,Sheldon,maybe this will overcome your reluctance. i went on the internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old mrs. latham to get your libido humming. check out those saddle shoes. rar!
37224,Sheldon,and don’t be chintzy with the shirley.
41689,Sheldon,"no, i will be uncle dr. cooper."
38709,Sheldon,"mommy, i love you. don’t let spock take me to the future!"
35930,Sheldon,"i beg to disagree. “a girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote leonard when she has stayed over for a, ten consecutive nights or b, more than nine nights in three week period or c: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
44373,Sheldon,here goes nothing? this is the initial test of our prototype. can we give it a little more gravitas?
37734,Sheldon,you may want to sit down.
38110,Sheldon,"all right, i see what’s going on. this is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. well titted."
37114,Sheldon,"it’s not about shoes, is it? i don’t think i could go through that again."
45213,Sheldon,fine. two years ago i got my driver’s license.
38264,Sheldon,"i believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
42837,Sheldon,and his last meal was a food pellet? you’re a monster.
34357,Sheldon,"and snoring. and that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. it’s a throat doctor."
44017,Sheldon,"well, i would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting botox into old lady faces…"
43610,Sheldon,"ah, what might have been. and you, give my regards to barnum and bailey."
42765,Sheldon,what colour would you like to be?
40150,Sheldon,you know germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
37279,Sheldon,sheldon. sheldon cooper.
45325,Sheldon,i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules.
38364,Sheldon,"another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. let’s go."
44284,Sheldon,oh. do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
36656,Sheldon,"yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and i’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that i have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
42505,Sheldon,"oh, this is already better. there are far fewer distractions in here."
36188,Sheldon,i believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
34603,Sheldon,"and male partners. animal partners. large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. "
44854,Sheldon,i know how to behave.
34482,Sheldon,"well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby."
36199,Sheldon,fine. the new issue of flash is out.
44281,Sheldon,hmm? oh. amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
34505,Sheldon,"excuse me, in a world that already includes the big boy, why would i settle for something like a big boy?"
41592,Sheldon,"leonard, i have something to tell you, but i want you to promise not to flip out."
35806,Sheldon,what happened?
43245,Sheldon,"no, that train has left the station. now, we can play this one of two ways. you can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and i’ll start."
40061,Sheldon,mmmmm!
37418,Sheldon,"no, it’s not. i’ve got five more slides."
44285,Sheldon,"look, i’m sorry, when did you even get here? i…"
34363,Sheldon,his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
35853,Sheldon,"anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
37343,Sheldon,"you can try, but you’ll never catch me. "
36423,Sheldon,"just pick out anything? maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
43590,Sheldon,my last physical.
37458,Sheldon,i’m not going to pay a fine. that would imply i’m guilty.
36386,Sheldon,"true, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again."
34900,Sheldon,we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment. and having never been to nebraska i’m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies. 
35059,Sheldon,how do you know anything about physics?
38578,Sheldon,"don’t beat around the bush, leonard. if you don’t want me here, just say the word, and i’ll leave."
42198,Sheldon,"wow. uh, you’re dead, so i’m going to let that slide. obi-wan kenobi is a character from star wars. after his physical demise, he comes to luke skywalker as his mentor in spirit form."
45110,Sheldon,"and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. what, now, see, now it says you’re mad. make up your mind."
37944,Sheldon,and this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
39180,Sheldon,boilerplate stuff. a modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. and a living will and durable power of attorney.
35443,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
38730,Sheldon,"an entire dinner to talk about your research? where you going, the drive-thru at jack in the box?"
34825,Sheldon,"you’re right, it can wait until morning. "
40774,Sheldon,fine.
45734,Sheldon,i can’t sleep.
42705,Sheldon,"over the years here at fun with flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder."
34401,Sheldon,"perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate. "
38719,Sheldon,tell him dr. cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of god.
39311,Sheldon,don’t thank me. thank the dice. they told me what percentage of my face to shave.
44936,Sheldon,"if it’s like your 3-d chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. amy, get the neosporin, somebody just got burned."
37372,Sheldon,"is it? just a moment ago i had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
45437,Sheldon,"what’d you do, delete your photo?"
44748,Sheldon,"so, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know nevis.  well, i, i like that, but next time check with me."
43863,Sheldon,"i’ll, i’ll let you get back to sleep now. good night."
34916,Sheldon,we don’t have soup. 
45527,Sheldon,i got the blues. my baby done left me.
41474,Sheldon,"leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
41634,Sheldon,"yes, yes, i’d be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry. everyone laugh at the circus freak. you know, i don’t need to sit here and take this, flatow. it is because of bullies like you, every day more and more americans are making the switch to television."
44692,Sheldon,"no. no, if we both like it, i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
38609,Sheldon,"as a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. now, let’s start fresh. howard, we’re going to need some tea."
38127,Sheldon,"you know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
37065,Sheldon,"oh, good, my turn. well, this is very exciting and i wanted you to be among the first to know…"
43045,Sheldon,"no. it’s true. it means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
38304,Sheldon,mockery? that’s all you have to offer?
38929,Sheldon,i always prefer the train.
43421,Sheldon,"fine, i guess i’m stuck with raj."
44417,Sheldon,"see, i remembered because if it looks like kim it’s kim, if it looks kind of like kim it’s kourtney, and if it looks nothing like kim it’s khloe."
34356,Sheldon,"really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
36727,Sheldon,"no, no. we’re here, let’s settle this. professor, can you identify our cricket?"
35018,Sheldon,"no, don’t. "
37589,Sheldon,"i recently had a dream that i was a giant. but everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
37323,Sheldon,"you’re right.  it’s a great idea, leonard. thank you."
40108,Sheldon,"oh, i-i buffed them with turtle wax. the man down at pep boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
36922,Sheldon,fine.
37962,Sheldon,correct.
41467,Sheldon,"well, i should hope so. i don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. not even a good-bye? you see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. poor kid. she just doesn’t see it."
45488,Sheldon,are you calling me a quitter?
41840,Sheldon,whose house is this?
43121,Sheldon,of course.
34196,Sheldon,there he is.
36961,Sheldon,"come on, come on, we’re late."
38562,Sheldon,but i made it better.
34319,Sheldon,what’s your formula for the corner.
41656,Sheldon,i can’t believe it.
38940,Sheldon,"well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
44482,Sheldon,i’m not sorry. that’s true.
38620,Sheldon,"she made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
37130,Sheldon,how else are you gonna study for the tests?
36357,Sheldon,"no problem. i’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
42569,Sheldon,"no, thank you. delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. it’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. i’d shake your hand, but, well, you know."
37627,Sheldon,"i’m the proud owner of wil wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. what does that tell you?"
36565,Sheldon,"he didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. tell me what my other option was."
34371,Sheldon,"right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink."
44135,Sheldon,of course he’s right. you and i both know how hard it is growing up without a father. that’s why i’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
38062,Sheldon,"i do not agree. cats make wonderful companions. they don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, i think you’ll find to be quite zazzy."
39470,Sheldon,"oh, no! i can’t!"
35073,Sheldon,absolutely.
34615,Sheldon,tea. when people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. there there. you want to talk about it?
43923,Sheldon,kind of a wuss.
38962,Sheldon,really? i didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
38471,Sheldon,"go, amy farrah fowler. follow your endocrine system."
35320,Sheldon,nothing. you seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists.
43722,Sheldon,better. did wil and adam leave?
43038,Sheldon,"well, this is me. it’s been a very interesting evening."
43870,Sheldon,"for future reference, if i want to watch mean girls, i’ll stream it on netflix."
40028,Sheldon,it’s like looking at the universe naked.  
38681,Sheldon,yeah.
43094,Sheldon,"good, good. and your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. and i’m okay with that."
38258,Sheldon,"well, no-one’s going to run a dna test on it, leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
36252,Sheldon,"interesting that you ask. the coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car. built in 1956 and originally known as the santa fe lounge car, the lower level is a theatre…"
43710,Sheldon,"no. the texas rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. it was a happy ending. well, for my nine-fingered nana."
39401,Sheldon,"i’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, mom. i’m taking you to see saul perlmutter give a lecture about his nobel prize-winning work in cosmology. and the best part is, at the q and a afterward, i’ve worked up a couple of q’s that will stump his sorry a."
39835,Sheldon,and no more singing.
44901,Sheldon,"thanks, leonard, now he’s not gonna think i’m cool."
37059,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. there, there. everything’s going to be fine. sheldon’s here."
36601,Sheldon,no. did she seem upset to you?
45292,Sheldon,"honestly, i’ve been better. do you have time? leonard says you’re very busy these days."
43799,Sheldon,"well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
35439,Sheldon,"you appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
38201,Sheldon,"you are in a forest. there is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. go east. an iron gate blocks your way. open gate. it’s locked. hmm, well, so much for that."
43483,Sheldon,"in leonard? oh, even the sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely."
43559,Sheldon,"no, just because i’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean i’m delusional. and since it is 2003, i don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before i call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
39589,Sheldon,you’re being impossible.
39126,Sheldon,fine. thank you for asking. i love you so much.
34592,Sheldon,me? i’ll give you a hint. neeeeooooowwwww!
44855,Sheldon,"someone call george r. r. martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
40329,Sheldon,"excellent, yeah. that was a ruse. they’re not the best. physics is the best. and by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. all right, so i see here you’re from des moines, iowa. uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from stanford university. oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. i hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss."
38787,Sheldon,"well, i don’t want to go to a party."
35651,Sheldon,no. i quit. 
36904,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i got bored and drifted off. where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
39308,Sheldon,that’s the great thing. it doesn’t matter. my mind is freed up to think about more important things.
38492,Sheldon,i was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of betty and veronica.
35714,Sheldon,come on! don’t nitpick!
37604,Sheldon,"thanks, shorty,i’ll take it from here. all right, you people ready to have some fun? you have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? well, then here come the jokes. why did the chicken cross the mobius strip? to get to the same side, bazinga! all right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? the bartender says, for you, no charge. hello? i know you’re out there. i can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. dr. randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. ba-da cha! i kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause i have no respect for the field. let’s get serious for a moment. why are we all here? ‘cause we’re scientists. and what do scientists study? the universe. and what’s the universe made of? i am so glad you asked.  there’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
38003,Sheldon,defend.
38311,Sheldon,"that seems fairly conclusive.  no, gorn, no. that’s where i sit."
43010,Sheldon,ha. keep dreaming.
45104,Sheldon,"really? uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
42896,Sheldon,"for a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump."
43386,Sheldon,after all these years. i’m really happy for the two of you.
43354,Sheldon,whenever you’re ready.
41610,Sheldon,"it smells wonderful. is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? because i, too, know…"
38906,Sheldon,"that game? excuse me, penny, but doodle jump is a game. angry birds is a game. world of warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game."
34696,Sheldon,"that’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
37482,Sheldon,"really? i would point out that i am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
37794,Sheldon,morning.
40964,Sheldon,"yeah, and some thanks i got. the assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami."
40100,Sheldon,"yes, yes. what did you decide?"
37510,Sheldon,"yes, there is. oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
36522,Sheldon,"smell that? that’s the smell of new comic books. oh, yes!"
39885,Sheldon,this is not your office. it hasn’t been assigned yet.
39429,Sheldon,does this mean you’re not going to sing soft kitty?
37154,Sheldon,it’s not. that’s why leonard does it.
44009,Sheldon,i’m afraid it can’t. the trip is tomorrow. and i have more apologies to make.
42619,Sheldon,excuse me.
37654,Sheldon,all right.
43419,Sheldon,you hear that? raj is devastated.
43640,Sheldon,it’s like it was yesterday.
42437,Sheldon,who’s the bobblehead of?
38335,Sheldon,more or less.
40956,Sheldon,"uh, hello again. um, yeah, i don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. while i was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, i happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. uh, dr. rostenkowski, dr. fowler, are you there?"
44383,Sheldon,you’ve heard of french toast?
42365,Sheldon,why would you do that?
44740,Sheldon,you never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
36599,Sheldon,"yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. now where do we stand on the freezer?"
44830,Sheldon,"well, i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
36348,Sheldon,i believe i’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
40152,Sheldon,it’s not bad. unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
41691,Sheldon,yes. i’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. lucky duck.
35544,Sheldon,"damn, this is hard.  "
35781,Sheldon,really? despite the sign that says “do not leave laundry unattended”?
43903,Sheldon,why?
45029,Sheldon,i was acting odd intentionally.
39141,Sheldon,"not all germs. just the ones that will kill me. it’s the same way i’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
38286,Sheldon,yes.
40414,Sheldon,what’s a hickey?
36920,Sheldon,"that’s exactly what my father said. come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time i was five until i went off to college. longest seven years of my life."
38072,Sheldon,i’ll go as high as 40.
42665,Sheldon,you’re acting odd. why?
42010,Sheldon,but i occupy the moral high ground.
34718,Sheldon,a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
35112,Sheldon,"well, it was a number of things. first the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
45340,Sheldon,"all right, either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races."
37639,Sheldon,the part where i tell you i’ve engineered a rematch with stuart’s team for tonight.
45620,Sheldon,uh-uh-uh. 
35005,Sheldon,the jewish people.
43344,Sheldon,"i’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? still, you need to consider how successful leonard’s brother and sister are."
36721,Sheldon,we haven’t established that i’m wrong once.
40323,Sheldon,"that’s a good point. my time is much too valuable. you know, perhaps i should find someone to do it for me. you know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour."
43888,Sheldon, birthday girl.
35119,Sheldon,it’s still my turn.
40739,Sheldon,nope. the only thing left to do now is assign blame.  nice going.
45012,Sheldon,"yeah. and i don’t understand why you’re taking her side. by being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too."
37029,Sheldon,"oh. well, that’s understandable. you may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. uh, lot and his wife, perseus and medusa, orpheus and eurydice."
39701,Sheldon,"it’s called non-fiction for a reason, leonard."
42904,Sheldon,come on. click the mouse with me.
36114,Sheldon,"my expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. the rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. or her own protection. take some."
44628,Sheldon,how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
41382,Sheldon,"my apologies. i chose my words poorly. i should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. anyway, thank you for watching it. it’s one of my all-time favourites."
37933,Sheldon,this is an interesting topic. how many sexual encounters have you had?
40783,Sheldon,i can’t go in today. i’m sick.
42353,Sheldon,"awful. they’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
38540,Sheldon,"you missed chief science officer, chairman of the board, and head of the secret santa committee."
41270,Sheldon,"aquaman? oh, this isn’t a gag gift, stuart."
38332,Sheldon,alcohol.
39144,Sheldon,a heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
39834,Sheldon,"will they, leonard? "
37645,Sheldon,"attention, all bowlers. i’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
42459,Sheldon,"and we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out."
45219,Sheldon,"all right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call bert."
36314,Sheldon,and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
40094,Sheldon,"okay, look, how about this? just give him my paper on the higgs boson. if he sees the incredible breakthrough i’ve made, he’ll reach out to me."
45788,Sheldon,"no, you can’t. wait. come back. halt. authorized personnel only!"
40389,Sheldon,"so, with all those antioxidants, what if i run out of oxidants?"
39815,Sheldon,of course you get a card. it’s leonard’s day.
38795,Sheldon,"oh, dear!"
39991,Sheldon,"well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
35672,Sheldon,i never eat in strange restaurants. one runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
43523,Sheldon,what if that burning food attracts animals?
36981,Sheldon,"yes, i want you to apologize to leonard."
35386,Sheldon,"oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
42938,Sheldon,"of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. it not only entertains, it informs."
38219,Sheldon,i heard a woman laughing.
39584,Sheldon,pardon me. excuse me.
34477,Sheldon,thank you.
45211,Sheldon,"no, they’re private."
43333,Sheldon,you remember my mother.
41963,Sheldon,hello.
40226,Sheldon,"of course. i just explained it to you. now, where do you stand on it?"
45822,Sheldon,"aw, nuts."
43513,Sheldon,what was that?
44974,Sheldon,not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express?
40884,Sheldon,it’s too late. i call dibs.
39818,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i think i’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. physics mad-libs. now, give me a number."
39239,Sheldon,i miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
44109,Sheldon,congratulations on a successful live show.
42430,Sheldon,kind of? it does it perfectly.
45693,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow."
36101,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, you know i can’t do that."
42303,Sheldon,"no, i’m not okay. uh, i’m wearing borrowed pants, i don’t have i.d., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs."
36536,Sheldon,at times.
38105,Sheldon,"all right, if you’re not going to remove it, i’ll remove it for you."
37015,Sheldon,"well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, i would certainly think so."
41175,Sheldon,"well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? uh, you know star trek. should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
43842,Sheldon,good. because i love you.
39674,Sheldon,how does that work?
37690,Sheldon,which one picks last?
35939,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, leonard."
37106,Sheldon,perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
37399,Sheldon,"i’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. at least once a day i ask how you are, even though i simply don’t care. i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing."
39060,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re up. i’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. i’d like you to sign it."
38975,Sheldon,have you learned anything?
38735,Sheldon,"you know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
37155,Sheldon,a good question.
34721,Sheldon,sorry i’m late.
37959,Sheldon,"not for me. thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night. tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
37139,Sheldon,"no, fig newtons are named after a small town in massachusetts. don’t write that down!"
44312,Sheldon,"oh, never have i ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
39216,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
44191,Sheldon,"great, so they own my idea for a t-shirt that says dumb as a bag of geologists."
42283,Sheldon,"you know what? i don’t always recognize sarcasm, but i do right now, and i don’t appreciate it. i’m sorry for your loss. but you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster."
35205,Sheldon,"you can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint."
41195,Sheldon,wow. no wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
35991,Sheldon,do you realize what this means? all i need is a healthy ovum and i can grow my own leonard nimoy!
44703,Sheldon,yes. i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
35394,Sheldon,"i’m a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase because leonard, get this, has a date."
42616,Sheldon,why would you say that?
39490,Sheldon,you didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
37085,Sheldon,i never admit defeat.
35900,Sheldon,great. new topic. where are you in your menstrual cycle?
41412,Sheldon,"my father used to say that all the time. that and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? but what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
40836,Sheldon, good buddy leonard.
44629,Sheldon,you truly are the goofus to my gallant.
40073,Sheldon,"well, i believe i’ve done it. and i’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet sam houston, i did it."
41851,Sheldon,"i hate every word in that sentence. including in, at, we and a."
40840,Sheldon,"leonard, please. you know amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for."
43014,Sheldon,thank you.
34512,Sheldon,"you’re a lucky man, leonard. "
44756,Sheldon,"is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
37181,Sheldon,very well. shall we switch topics to isaac newton v. gottfried leibniz?
37263,Sheldon,"right, games. they took halo 1, halo 2, halo 3, call of duty 1, call of duty 2, call of duty 3, rock band, rock band 2, final fantasy 1 thru 9, the legend of zelda, the legend of zelda: ocarina of time, the legend of zelda: twilight princess, super mario brothers, super mario galaxy, mario and sonic at the winter olympics and ms. pacman."
38283,Sheldon,not particularly.
38112,Sheldon,yes?
35797,Sheldon,"oh look, saturn 3 is on."
40704,Sheldon,"good to know. yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the council of ladies.  hello. i see. uh, what time? very well, then. huh. that was the human resources department at the university. apparently, my assistant alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace."
37680,Sheldon,"well, my existence is a continuum, so i’ve been what i am at each point in the implied time period."
42138,Sheldon,"well, she talks a lot. she always wants to hold hands."
40475,Sheldon,"amy, i can’t just ask wil wheaton to leave. he’s a minor celebrity. once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."
45402,Sheldon,"it’s called fitting in. by the way, good luck."
36780,Sheldon,"obviously, waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. bazinga! you know, using positive reinforcement techniques, i could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
44274,Sheldon,"yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room."
38671,Sheldon,how shall we begin?
43647,Sheldon,i can’t find that quote on the internet. did you make that up?
37738,Sheldon,"i told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. i like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
39566,Sheldon,you are free to believe whatever you like. and unfriend rajesh koothrappali.
38360,Sheldon,there’s no switch. just listen and learn.
41600,Sheldon,"ugh, fine, i’ll go. but if her food is delicious, thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you."
39892,Sheldon,"oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. and for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
42469,Sheldon,"perfect. now, i’m considering investing in stuart’s comic book store."
35054,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is technetium."
40824,Sheldon,one vintage mr. mxyzptlk action figure. that’s leonard’s.
38863,Sheldon, leonard?
43318,Sheldon,"what did they feed the lions, mother?"
34532,Sheldon,you did this?
37254,Sheldon,"so, why is it no longer a specialty? did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? and look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. what is mobster sauce?"
45374,Sheldon,of course not. i’m too busy to be sick.
35635,Sheldon,"just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? there’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
36383,Sheldon,welcome to the building.
35707,Sheldon,so we can communicate through the wall.
39280,Sheldon,"oh, well, then i guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. all right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
38633,Sheldon,can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
38373,Sheldon,hugh.
39492,Sheldon,"point of order. as you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. but i’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. how do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
35948,Sheldon,i understand. all i need is for you to authorize these tests.
39050,Sheldon,remarkable. aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
41227,Sheldon,"well, i really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus."
36605,Sheldon,"alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the arctic circle."
42236,Sheldon,"well, stick to your guns. there will be a lot of pressure."
36569,Sheldon,"of course not. i’m a theoretical physicist, a career i chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if i’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, i will be the scientist to confirm string theory. people will write books about me. third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
41567,Sheldon,"that seems like a reasonable request. although so did, hey, leonard, would you mind returning that dvd?"
39568,Sheldon,and unfriend howard wolowitz.
38130,Sheldon,"you know, when my grandfather died, and meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. it’s very nice. they discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
40958,Sheldon,heard you the first time.
36177,Sheldon,"so, what do you think?"
45309,Sheldon,"you know what? i’m proud of us. yeah, with penny and leonard taking in raj, and stuart living with howard and bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
40505,Sheldon,"amy deserves better. you know, when we buy the planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the brazil nuts so i don’t have to look at them. she’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel."
38781,Sheldon,right. i’ll make tea.
34254,Sheldon,"you? no, you’ll only make it worse."
37809,Sheldon,"dr. plimpton, i’d like you to meet my colleagues, dr. rajesh koothrappali"
37927,Sheldon,"simple extrapolation. in the three years that i’ve known you, you were single for two. during that time, i saw 17 different suitors. if we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…"
44607,Sheldon,"he said start with it, not end with it."
38054,Sheldon,"you didn’t break up, she dumped you."
40882,Sheldon,"wow. oh, this is truly remarkable."
34629,Sheldon,"one on one? we don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. one on one!"
36984,Sheldon,"all right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, leonard is wrong."
35661,Sheldon,"good morning, gentlemen."
44933,Sheldon,but you don’t even understand its symbolism.
41870,Sheldon,you’re right. that was insensitive of me. i have to go back to my table now. you should join us.
37892,Sheldon,you mean dating?
40533,Sheldon,"i’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes i like. you’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes."
34706,Sheldon,it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession. 
41098,Sheldon,"yeah, that, too. big cheque."
36954,Sheldon,"look on the bright side. as the result of penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of research lab. would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
45777,Sheldon,"oh, perhaps it’s amy coming to her senses."
34805,Sheldon,"well that’s not much of an apology, but i’ll take it. "
39360,Sheldon,"no, leonard, this is your last chance. one day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with dr. sheldon cooper? and you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, i was, but i chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from stand by me that no one remembers."
41957,Sheldon,remember the old days when i used to point out that your check engine light was on?
43786,Sheldon,i’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
41214,Sheldon,back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case. leonard did it.
34966,Sheldon,"oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. goodbye. "
44655,Sheldon,"oh, i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
36660,Sheldon,i don’t have a sad song. i’m not a child.
41168,Sheldon,"i believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. while the others pillage the corpse, i lead you to a secluded area where i attempt to remove your leather armour.  it comes off."
42631,Sheldon,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. just because i love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room."
40178,Sheldon,"oh, you brain monkeys kill me. dip away."
35973,Sheldon,"no. no, i brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. i’m going to need a ride to the mall."
42986,Sheldon,"yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. we’re scientists. we can conduct our own research. i propose that we imprison two street people and…"
36368,Sheldon,"you’re tricking me. you tell me the truth, what do we get?"
37999,Sheldon,"all right, i’m ready for my next question."
44020,Sheldon,"i caused that fight, i feel terrible. wait, i can do that better. i caused that fight. i feel terrible. yeah, wow, i don’t know which one i like more."
35856,Sheldon,"fine, whatever works."
42180,Sheldon,i’m fine.
43085,Sheldon,"oh, maybe you’re right. he is kind of a lump."
42655,Sheldon,"you don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? and your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at disneyland."
36649,Sheldon, leonard.
34975,Sheldon,"oh, god, now even you’re smarter than me."
42798,Sheldon,"well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown."
45330,Sheldon,fire away.
43097,Sheldon,an article was just published in scientific american about our theory.
38086,Sheldon,"oh, lord, will this day never end? as i’ve explained repeatedly to dr. koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the american idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
37403,Sheldon,you’re right. judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
35091,Sheldon,"for what it’s worth, i thought it was humorous. "
42007,Sheldon,"perhaps not. but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of ethan allen’s finest sofas."
40601,Sheldon,"actually, you can’t have that one either. it’s too good. sorry."
41310,Sheldon,you honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
39285,Sheldon,"okay, everybody calm down. there is a simple solution here. raj, take me to the train store, and then i don’t care what you people do."
38850,Sheldon,she’s also a bit of a know-it-all. mmm. this is good. whatever it is.
45602,Sheldon,how thoughtful. thank you.
34452,Sheldon,"look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
42801,Sheldon,"you know what? you think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. yeah, you think that i don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but i do. hmm? i have excellent peripheral vision. on a good day, i can see my ears."
44572,Sheldon,fine.  i don’t think i can go much longer.
40121,Sheldon,"well, i can’t help it. that’s an involuntary twinkle."
39362,Sheldon,brent spiner?
40291,Sheldon,"oh, i was having a little trouble sleeping and i just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk."
43394,Sheldon,good. don’t do it.
39752,Sheldon,"oh, no, of course. i understand. you’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. your secret’s safe with me."
39203,Sheldon,it’s not what it looks like. it’s not what it looks like.
34943,Sheldon,"please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
44101,Sheldon,"and actually, it was three different men."
36111,Sheldon,i’m never silly. here.
45447,Sheldon,you and leonard don’t have anything in common. maybe you should break up.
38820,Sheldon,"please, leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
34295,Sheldon,that was a valid hypothesis? what is happening to you?
43917,Sheldon,that sounds awful. raj?
44622,Sheldon,yes. i accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
37044,Sheldon,"oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. nailed it. while we have a moment, may i ask you a question?"
44218,Sheldon,"ah. yeah, i had to get a little creative because the s, r and m keys on my laptop stopped working."
39777,Sheldon,"‘sup? my apologies. i would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
34202,Sheldon,"leonard, i don’t think i can do this."
43855,Sheldon,"those are the robes of the jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy."
34895,Sheldon,"thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
41827,Sheldon,"you’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. you’re buying non-transferable tickets. and from a stranger, no less. not only can you get banned from comic-con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. you think about that while i’m warning james earl jones about the danger of posting his location on twitter. he got lucky this time. there are some weirdoes out there.  bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum… "
44360,Sheldon,i’ll be back.
38545,Sheldon,"in that case, may i offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
38166,Sheldon,i’m removing my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
41820,Sheldon,i didn’t even get to that part.
34415,Sheldon,okay.
44817,Sheldon,"all right, just warn me before you do it."
42350,Sheldon,"but if i’m a professor, then i’ll have to teach a class."
43035,Sheldon,"and i, you. and yes, that’s how you say that. yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, i’d say we have some hard choices to make."
35434,Sheldon,look on the bright side.
45345,Sheldon,that is a daring and insightful solution. 
40730,Sheldon,i found a hack online. i was able to upload mp3 recordings of my voice to your gps.
40742,Sheldon,maybe we’re better off. what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
36499,Sheldon,are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
39469,Sheldon,we are?
38630,Sheldon,leonard.
42411,Sheldon,"at our committee meeting, amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but i tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
41583,Sheldon,i don’t know why that surprises you. i’m a grown man. as should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
36759,Sheldon,"i can’t be impossible. i exist. i believe what you meant to say is, “i give up, he’s improbable.”"
35992,Sheldon,be right back.
43798,Sheldon,what is that?
42242,Sheldon,"well, now do you see the problem?"
34941,Sheldon,wait. will you please rub this on my chest. 
38526,Sheldon,oh!
36733,Sheldon,old comic books. i lost this to wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
35366,Sheldon,"it was rife with historical inaccuracies. for example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously germanic, but in 1487 the bavarian purity laws or rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. at best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
41217,Sheldon,"dear lord, you’re an astronomer. although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the milky way."
43027,Sheldon,"well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a formula one race car. so i’m just concentrating on that. plus, it’s easier around people that i’m comfortable with."
40945,Sheldon,we’re not. this time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
39575,Sheldon,"a date. you and me. dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
44154,Sheldon,is there a reason i had to leave my own apartment?
37288,Sheldon,bad idea.
42914,Sheldon,"look, i am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. and failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers."
40477,Sheldon,"come to think of it, i would! you, little lady, are on fire."
37391,Sheldon,sorry? i’ve been dreaming about going to the large hadron collider since i was nine years old.
38943,Sheldon,no.
34902,Sheldon,wait.  put this in the bathroom.
36801,Sheldon,"hi, leonard. hello, raj."
39081,Sheldon,"uh, do you know how i solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
40360,Sheldon,"it’s not a present, it’s the present. look. there’s you and me. there’s penny and amy. we’re playing pictionary. in the present."
40578,Sheldon,"he’s trying to kill me, leonard. video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence."
40441,Sheldon,"i humiliated stephen hawking in a game of words with friends. he stopped playing, and now we’re not friends anymore."
43751,Sheldon,"golly, she sounds too good to be true."
40272,Sheldon,"now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?"
39601,Sheldon,you asked penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
37393,Sheldon,"not so fast. you might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, penny."
42695,Sheldon,"yeah. tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. amy, you’re a neuroscientist. crack his skull open, spray some raid in there."
45627,Sheldon,the brady bunch? 
38995,Sheldon,this is remarkable. took less than 24 hours.
40916,Sheldon,okay.
40607,Sheldon,"me? no. no, i’m not that kind of doctor."
42656,Sheldon,"i do. i have the drive to the hospital right here. that is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. and don’t expect me to carry you, i do that enough in life."
35011,Sheldon,"hey, howard. you’re a jew. if there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? okay, it’s definitely me. "
35795,Sheldon,well played.
39094,Sheldon,i don’t know what colour lonely is.
34785,Sheldon,then why did you say it.
37606,Sheldon,"question one, where are my pants?"
34614,Sheldon,"happy halloween.  if it’s any consolation, i thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. "
41241,Sheldon,"well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. is that it? did i get it right?"
34291,Sheldon,"it’s okay. it wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
45425,Sheldon,where’s howard?
40472,Sheldon,really? he reminded me of a young william shatner.
43654,Sheldon,"well, he is. i’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. it’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. you’re a sketchy character in a parking garage."
43859,Sheldon,you’re right.
37402,Sheldon,"all right. this game is called traitors. i will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. benedict arnold, judas, dr. leonard hofstadter."
45711,Sheldon,"bazinga, punk. now we’re even."
35050,Sheldon,leslie winkle? 
39832,Sheldon,"i’m sneaking into work. now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
40203,Sheldon,"dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity."
35885,Sheldon,i suppose i could spare a few minutes. were you robbed?
34810,Sheldon,artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. 
40036,Sheldon,not this time. then they wouldn’t be special. thanks penny.
40817,Sheldon,"actually, i have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do."
42403,Sheldon,"he’s right. and given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, i’m sure you do suck."
36414,Sheldon,we don’t have thai food on thursday. we have pizza on thursday.
39173,Sheldon,"no, i can’t authorize that."
38319,Sheldon,"no, it’s a different leonard. he’s chinese, red hair, six fingers. good-bye."
35314,Sheldon,physiologically impossible.
36676,Sheldon,grateful.
44920,Sheldon,oh. remember when we got this at comic-con?
38634,Sheldon, raj? i need to sleep here tonight.
38523,Sheldon,howard doesn’t. he’s only an engineer.
43155,Sheldon,will our hotel room be ready?
40033,Sheldon,muon!
37220,Sheldon,what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
40776,Sheldon,very well.
35149,Sheldon,made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
37856,Sheldon,be more specific.
44151,Sheldon,"uh, mylar balloons, yes. latex balloons, no. water balloons, i will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
43224,Sheldon,we built a fort.
41754,Sheldon,i forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
34428,Sheldon,nothing.
41797,Sheldon,i’m willing to if you guys are.
43987,Sheldon,"our friends are jerks, and i’m mad at all of them."
44546,Sheldon,i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting.
35341,Sheldon,"actually, i’d say she’s a poor man’s madhuri dixit. "
44670,Sheldon,"for science, maybe you should."
40471,Sheldon,"oh, none that i could see. i saw a man who loved flags almost as much as i do. i got goose bumps."
45140,Sheldon,"gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
37251,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, they re-did the menu."
43177,Sheldon,"i can see the ranch, leonard. oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. i’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. i’m gonna make it. i’m gonna make it. they have tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… aaaaaaagh!"
39177,Sheldon,i never kid about safety.
34953,Sheldon,"can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
43988,Sheldon,can you believe they planned a trip to las vegas and didn’t invite me?
43072,Sheldon,"and in that future, are we on the same planet? because i’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work."
44319,Sheldon,"what, why did you get a party sub?"
41181,Sheldon,"fine, no more drowning talk. i’ll change the subject. oh. who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
38738,Sheldon,why?
43231,Sheldon,"perhaps you’d prefer this one. the itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
45673,Sheldon,you might want to lock the door behind me. this isn’t bozeman.
35180,Sheldon,"i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird. you know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended. "
37602,Sheldon,"i don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
43619,Sheldon,i’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
38629,Sheldon,i knew she wasn’t lead car material.
43312,Sheldon,"don’t worry, everyone in here is safe."
36334,Sheldon,wow.
40395,Sheldon,"oh, well."
39327,Sheldon,"two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? okay, let’s go for it."
34462,Sheldon,"well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. "
36271,Sheldon,i’m not in san francisco. i’m on a train. were you even listening to me?
35627,Sheldon,"i just don’t see why i need a driver’s license, albert einstein never had a driver’s license."
34665,Sheldon,"no more talking, everybody go. "
36391,Sheldon,how does one sort of…
39071,Sheldon,three.
38672,Sheldon,all right.
43180,Sheldon,"so, what are you in for?"
39441,Sheldon,be sure to check the mail.
45755,Sheldon,thank goodness i got it. now i can quit checking my stool.
38986,Sheldon,"interesting. a friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the sudan. it’s a lesson in context."
38669,Sheldon,nothing. i was acting.
36762,Sheldon,"boy, that does smell good. too bad it’s monday."
36234,Sheldon,"don’t say it like that, leonard, say it like: we’re taking the train!"
38842,Sheldon,no.
42566,Sheldon,it’s too late for koothrappali. let’s go.
38010,Sheldon,"oh, yes. you should’ve been here for the great jenga tantrum of 2008."
44661,Sheldon,"good morning. see? i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. so, how is everyone?"
36705,Sheldon,thank god.
41166,Sheldon,"more? i mean, look at us. it’s only been three years, here we are in bed together."
34759,Sheldon,"because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. which, if i were there, it would be. "
44330,Sheldon,"there’s a motion on the floor, i’m ridiculous. do we have a second? hmm? hmm? there is no second. the motion is denied. next time, make sure you have the votes first. that was embarrassing."
21815,Sheldon,"that’s correct. fyi, i would have accepted any answer other than procreating. come, i’ll show you the rest of the apartment."
38840,Sheldon,"all right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. who’s ready to play some vintage video games? and tonight’s selections include colecovision’s smurf rescue in gargamel’s castle, atari’s cookie monster munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, zork. pick me, pick me. i’m fun."
36968,Sheldon,"stop it, both of you. all this fighting, i might as well be back with my parents! damn it, george, i told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ i’d leave you! well, i guess that makes you a liar, ’cause i’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! stop yelling! you’re making sheldon cry! i’ll tell you what’s making sheldon cry! that i let you name him sheldon."
37752,Sheldon,is there too much pepper on your salad?
38572,Sheldon,"ah, a combination of all your names. very clever. i assume koothranardowitz was taken?"
39871,Sheldon,"excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. "
44952,Sheldon,"i do. and to show you that there are no hard feelings, i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
40718,Sheldon,"you, you dirty birdie. i-i thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and i realized i’m deeply offended. now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."
37438,Sheldon,"not my problem. i just don’t understand how this happened to me. i’m scrupulous about my hygiene. i regularly disinfect my hands, and i avoid contact with other people on general principle."
37965,Sheldon,"certainly. i’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent p.e. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
40921,Sheldon," penny. oh yeah, much better."
45358,Sheldon,"well, i’m not needed at both places at the same time. and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
39169,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! amy, i’ve never been touched like this before! oh! oh, my hands are magic!"
38375,Sheldon,"under normal circumstances i’d say, i told you so. but as i have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. therefore, i will be replacing it with the phrase i informed you thusly."
39234,Sheldon,"priya has moved back to india to pursue her law career. instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
34753,Sheldon,they found the remote controlled cars.
41451,Sheldon,did you know that los angeles has a little sri lanka?
38440,Sheldon,because you keep saying who.
43422,Sheldon,"amy, i don’t understand, are we broken up or not? it’s like you can’t make up your mind."
36633,Sheldon,not to worry. i hid it. bazinga! you’re in my spot.
40421,Sheldon,"and i’m happy for you, too. you are now friends with someone who is officially friends with stephen hawking. enjoy it, boys. you may have peaked."
36716,Sheldon,his name isn’t toby. toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
35279,Sheldon,"sorry, you diverted me. anyway, in 1935, erwin schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. "
36775,Sheldon,very good. chocolate?
43137,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley."
44839,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you are. i track your cycle. for the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
37612,Sheldon,"rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. and on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
43673,Sheldon,"yeah, but what if it’s property of u.s. government? there’s a national helium reserve in amarillo, texas. if this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime."
38799,Sheldon,is it about me or the dead pixels?
43516,Sheldon,i am getting too old for this crud.
37542,Sheldon,i won?
41636,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins."
37477,Sheldon,"good morning, your honour. dr. sheldon cooper appearing in pro se. that is to say, representing himself."
36825,Sheldon,bazinga! you’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. i’m your boss now. you may want to laugh at that.
36934,Sheldon,"thank you. i’d like to make a sandwich, but i’m out of bread."
44605,Sheldon,i can’t do it. i’m not as smart as i think i am. i’m so sorry. this is all my fault.
35251,Sheldon,"not surprising. penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex. the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk. "
35344,Sheldon,i don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
35417,Sheldon,"yes, the doctor doom to my mr fantastic. the doctor octopus to my spiderman. the doctor sivana to my captain marvel."
44551,Sheldon,hello.
42598,Sheldon,all the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. that means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
39595,Sheldon,feel free to retain a lawyer.
37302,Sheldon,"and you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. warm milk, penny?"
42264,Sheldon,wow.
42435,Sheldon,whoa. nobody said anything about watching the game.
34303,Sheldon,"you don’t need chopsticks, this is thai food."
44476,Sheldon,"i don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great."
34234,Sheldon,yeah. 
39326,Sheldon,"mm. tough decision. there’s no weaponry from lord of the rings, forged in a chinese sweatshop?"
34768,Sheldon,"no, once again, i’m throwing you a bone. and once again, you are welcome. "
36637,Sheldon,"mother, i have to go. yeah, love you. bye.  daddy’s home."
38658,Sheldon, penny.
44140,Sheldon,will you guys keep it down?
43351,Sheldon,"you’re right, you did kind of kill the mood."
38079,Sheldon,"you’re wrong again. if my superpower were arrogance, my name would be dr. arroganto."
43469,Sheldon,"on the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. we’re not friends with benefits."
40961,Sheldon,"well, now don’t you feel silly."
42891,Sheldon,it’s good.
35047,Sheldon,you’re welcome. one more thing.
37291,Sheldon,what if they cut the power?
36209,Sheldon,"focus is important. was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
38242,Sheldon,you’re far too short to be darth vader. at best you might be a turncoat ewok.
38831,Sheldon,"yes, you must be present to win."
35704,Sheldon,i formally request sanctuary.
41787,Sheldon,"a fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
37140,Sheldon,"now, if ma equals mg what does that imply?"
35390,Sheldon,you mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
43783,Sheldon,"i don’t know if i’d call it discussing. you kind of sat back and let me do all the work. let’s see, what’s next on the list. oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
36957,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll start with an easy one, um, isaac newton, madame curie and niels bohr."
38145,Sheldon,i did.
35646,Sheldon,"click. now, are there air bags?"
43792,Sheldon,i am.
37442,Sheldon,i’ve decided i’m going to have mr. lee sign my copy of this month’s batman.
36352,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. when i moved to california, i promised my mother that i wouldn’t start doing drugs."
44174,Sheldon,and it was sheldon cooper who said let’s speed this up. a lot of people want to talk.
34440,Sheldon,"i don’t want my job back. i’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. before that i spent four years working on my thesis. before that i was in college, and before that, i was in the fifth grade. this is my first day off in decades, and i’m going to savour it."
35284,Sheldon,"a mistake involving penny? okay, you’ll have to narrow it down. "
44970,Sheldon,"oh, i know, but just, leonard and penny think we’re doing it, and i don’t want to disappoint them."
45153,Sheldon,"oh, oh. and guess where we get to sleep? our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. on the first day, i get to drive a steam engine. oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. oh, and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as i want. so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
42685,Sheldon,you bet your sweet b i won’t.
42778,Sheldon,"oh, that wasn’t clear. try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, missy?"
39369,Sheldon,"to sheldon, sorry this took so long. your friend, wil wheaton."
39381,Sheldon,told you.
45282,Sheldon,"it’s nothing like that. i just, i thought about raj’s situation, and i had a change of heart. you know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did i. hello."
35037,Sheldon,"just look. i’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. the colours are based on star trek, the original series. the three of you will wear support red, and i will wear command gold. "
35008,Sheldon,"i really don’t understand your objections, professor goldfarb, why wouldn’t the senoran desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
41580,Sheldon,yeah. it’s great you’re here. i’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
41943,Sheldon,are you sure? we were making fun of failed careers. we didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is howard’s.
43882,Sheldon,"so, can you help me?"
40443,Sheldon,"wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. but i didn’t know that, and i played extract for 82 points. it’s all amy’s fault. she told me to play it. i have got to cut her loose."
44084,Sheldon,gentlemen.
41417,Sheldon,that’s a raging ogre.
37162,Sheldon,i do not. but if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this.
35452,Sheldon,the conqueror.
35791,Sheldon,"oh, good. hi, mom. how are you? but, mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. and, and she touched my food. okay, yes, i took her clothes, but she started it. no, that’s not fair. why should i have to apologize? yeah, i really don’t think this is the kind of thing jesus concerns himself with. no, you’re right, i don’t really know what jesus thinks about. all right, good-bye. did you tell on me?"
36463,Sheldon,"that’s preposterous. i do not resemble c3po. don’t get me wrong, i’m flattered, i just don’t see it."
42677,Sheldon,"that’s a good idea. penny, did you and leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?"
43113,Sheldon,all he had was an idea.
41200,Sheldon,"penny, we’re in the red zone. the white zone is for loading and unloading. we’re breaking the law."
40592,Sheldon,don’t rush it. we may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
37935,Sheldon,you were right. this was a very productive evening. i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight.
37648,Sheldon,"what? no! again, it’s not the wesley crushers. it’s the wesley “crushers.”"
39341,Sheldon,"and then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. love it."
37328,Sheldon,"not lima beans, carbon atoms."
44559,Sheldon,why would you do that?
38113,Sheldon,yes?
35079,Sheldon,"i know, it’s basic culinary science. "
42436,Sheldon,"i expected to see howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickey’s soundsational parade."
43135,Sheldon,hang on. physics today mentioned the paper.
34937,Sheldon,"it was tornado season. and it was an aluminium house. anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any english, when i finally managed to convince her i was sick, she said “möchtest du eine darmspülung?”"
44924,Sheldon,thank you.
41193,Sheldon,they lie so they don’t look petty.
42989,Sheldon,"in the interest of science, i’d be willing to."
36413,Sheldon,this is thai food.
35303,Sheldon,"well, for one thing, she was french. for another, it was literature. "
43566,Sheldon,"no, i do. eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when bernadette divorces wolowitz. or, or, or like when koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. or amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me."
36971,Sheldon,"i assumed that would be your attitude. hence, my true purpose in coming here."
37939,Sheldon,that’s no threat. my mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
44015,Sheldon,"raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. i hope that you can accept my apology."
34990,Sheldon,"if you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… i’m going. "
38743,Sheldon,it was a compliment. i believe in giving credit where credit is due.
41853,Sheldon,"oh, very well. what are the sleeping arrangements? we’ve only been dating for three years. if we were to share a room, people might talk."
37434,Sheldon,chicken?
42355,Sheldon,i can’t believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
41660,Sheldon,"that’s what makes their friendship unlikely,"
39533,Sheldon,"you’re biologists. biology is the study of living things. that’s a living thing, get cracking."
43831,Sheldon,"the list extends outside of science. painters like van gogh and pollock, chess champion bobby fischer, brian wilson of the beach boys.  i remember the song. it’s called darlin’ by the beach boys. oh, thank goodness. i’m not crazy. i don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride."
35052,Sheldon,formal protest.
43056,Sheldon,i can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
39563,Sheldon,"i’m in the matrix, leonard, i see everything."
44811,Sheldon,"al-ghazali was anti-aristotelian? boy, you think you know a guy."
35240,Sheldon,why? 
35000,Sheldon,huh. it can’t be a coincidence. there must be some causal link i’m missing.
34259,Sheldon,well this is an interesting development. 
39525,Sheldon,a minute.
39473,Sheldon,"what? no. you mean this was all a ruse? oh, how could i be so stu… ."
21802,Sheldon,that depends.
40365,Sheldon,"yeah, only after i eliminated all the obvious answers. you’re welcome."
35071,Sheldon,who?
44512,Sheldon,"what? but he’s a mediocre academic. and according to beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate."
39839,Sheldon,"it’s like i’m living in a dictatorship. you must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
41782,Sheldon,really?
42051,Sheldon,leonard?
38397,Sheldon,"trouble is my middle name, leonard. actually, it’s lee, but i prefer trouble."
36166,Sheldon,her reasoning is unassailable. it is one o’clock.
41717,Sheldon,you okay?
21833,Sheldon,12 hours? 
44458,Sheldon,"well, what a sad state of affairs. that you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you."
45752,Sheldon,"are you mad at me? oh, no, you’re mad at me. i’m so sorry. beep bop boop bop."
35873,Sheldon,"hi, stephanie. i’m sorry i’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
44113,Sheldon,"well, you be sure to let us know when you win the nobel prize for boysenberry."
38237,Sheldon,"in fact, you did, but i was referring to howard."
34447,Sheldon,"i’m taking a sabbatical, because i won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds. "
40082,Sheldon,try to put yourself in my place. imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. and then it turns out there’s another human being.
35839,Sheldon,"i don’t make the rules, leonard."
35359,Sheldon,"mom smokes in the car. jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell dad. "
42663,Sheldon,"although now that i think about it, leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."
40016,Sheldon,hah-hah!
42930,Sheldon,he’s right. i say we call this person back. we’ve got no reason to hide.
36446,Sheldon,"chinese food, vintage video games. after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday, this is friday night the way it was meant to be."
38482,Sheldon,"yeah, milk duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
37657,Sheldon,"be the ball, howard."
37533,Sheldon,waterfalls. crashing waves. babbling brooks.
40261,Sheldon,"yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace wolowitz, i need to know a little more about you."
43698,Sheldon,of course. excuse me. this will just take a moment.
36572,Sheldon,"i’m not good with cold, leonard. how often have we had to leave a movie theatre because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast? i can’t go."
40353,Sheldon,"you know, i am very disappointed that i won’t be able to celebrate howard’s accomplishment tonight."
44947,Sheldon,i’m being awful? you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
42608,Sheldon,"i may be an alien, but i have urges. if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, i will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. i’m not the best at reading facial cues, but i can see that you’re a little turned on."
43293,Sheldon,"so, can you get it working?"
35264,Sheldon,"ach, why not? we’re already through the looking glass anyway. "
40342,Sheldon,"uh, alex, a moment. i need a word with dr. hofstadter. do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?"
39064,Sheldon,"unless leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in india saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff leonard hofstadter."
38067,Sheldon,"yes, ma’am."
36456,Sheldon,of course i am. removing joe chill as the killer of batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
43806,Sheldon,"me, too. it’s comforting to know that she and i are able to function as friends."
37865,Sheldon,"as i will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. but for the record, i only drink hot chocolate in months with an r in them."
39048,Sheldon,you own a smoking monkey?
35761,Sheldon,march 18th. you violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
41437,Sheldon,"ah, sweden. yeah, home of my favourite muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. okay, the nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. boy, is his name gunderson or no-funderson?"
44162,Sheldon,thank you. this is all so thoughtful. excuse me.
38331,Sheldon,i don’t like the olive garden. they treat me like family.
43791,Sheldon,you mixed them. no wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. do you have any questions for me?
34609,Sheldon,i’m not. no offence. 
42998,Sheldon,"ah, that’s just as well. as much as i’d love to meet euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and i cannot look at toes during dinner. oh, i know, the person i’d most like to have dinner with is myself."
42953,Sheldon,"ugh, let it go. i have heard that my whole life. every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way i feel."
42578,Sheldon,"eh, well, very well. oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak."
42143,Sheldon,fusion and asians? i’m trying not to think about science.
35348,Sheldon,she’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
41236,Sheldon,you were.
41476,Sheldon,"did i? well, that can’t be right. no one’s ever done that before. except me, because i just did it. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain…"
34393,Sheldon,"leonard, listen to me…"
41418,Sheldon,"well, i appreciate your concern, but i won’t be seeing any more of amy than i already do. i assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
43984,Sheldon,"well, then raj and i will…"
44443,Sheldon,i’m back.
39694,Sheldon,"permission granted, commander."
43036,Sheldon,"gary con, do we fly or drive? do we wear costumes? and if so, who gets to be gary?"
37074,Sheldon,"excuse me, may i interject?"
39095,Sheldon,"red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
45401,Sheldon,"um, yes. howdy, partner. do you happen to recollect if i left a notebook in these here parts?"
38945,Sheldon,"thank you, penny."
43712,Sheldon,"no, not at all. no, i’m fine. you know, amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best."
42826,Sheldon, penny?
34413,Sheldon,me?
43713,Sheldon,"yes. oh, for example, three years ago when i discovered penny was eating all my pop-tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, i got a floor safe."
38976,Sheldon,"if you don’t mind, i’d like to stop listening to you and start talking."
40480,Sheldon,"yes, quite the kerfuffle."
42043,Sheldon,xbox.
42316,Sheldon,"oh, i have no idea. i never left the train station."
44353,Sheldon,cersei uses her body to manipulate men. penny just takes me to the lego store.
34467,Sheldon,"well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
41891,Sheldon,"oh, well, my new friend’s name was eric. um, amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
39215,Sheldon,"no, it’s not amy."
38024,Sheldon,"may i point out that for eight long months, i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore."
41203,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. we’ve been made."
40621,Sheldon,fine. then i’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
38916,Sheldon,carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
35760,Sheldon,"yes, baseball."
45514,Sheldon,what’s the occasion?
34831,Sheldon,"i would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, i’d recommend you have a cat scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
44160,Sheldon,"no. no, if i can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, i suppose i can do this."
44302,Sheldon,so i drink.
39993,Sheldon,"no, leonard, go ahead and mock. like my daddy always said, shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom."
34221,Sheldon,bye.
41537,Sheldon,it’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that i may have been annoying to you.
42307,Sheldon,"excuse me, officer hernandez? any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"
40702,Sheldon,"oh, yes. yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. all she did was get mad at you."
41989,Sheldon,nothing.
45141,Sheldon,"i’m looking at the math, and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
37751,Sheldon,do you have allergies?
44996,Sheldon,how did we get in the car?
42635,Sheldon,"oh, tesla."
43750,Sheldon,"and, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules."
38294,Sheldon,"i’m going to answer that with a visual aid. this is my nine-disc complete lord of the rings trilogy blu-ray set.  mr. wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping i wouldn’t notice. would you characterize that as responsible?"
44902,Sheldon,how do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
41344,Sheldon,i’m sorry. are we really doing this or are we tricking koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
44496,Sheldon,very well.
44200,Sheldon,"hey, leonard."
38983,Sheldon,and a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
35700,Sheldon,"please, please, i don’t have a lot of time. look, ramona finally dozed off, and i need you to help me get rid of her."
41272,Sheldon,don’t try and trick me into buying something i don’t want. now let’s talk aquaman. 
44430,Sheldon,remember when we camped out for the doctor who panel at comic-con?
34439,Sheldon,as do i.
34832,Sheldon,why? 
39258,Sheldon,"no, thank you. (sees insect. more appear and swarm all over him. he jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. jumps up and runs out to penny’s apartment."
38869,Sheldon,"pick a card, sheldon. now look at it, and put it back in the deck. now do you remember your card? of course i do, i have an eidetic memory. my apologies. now shuffle the cards. shuffling. wait here. processing image, cross-referencing."
43777,Sheldon,"i am. you know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, i printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."
34891,Sheldon,"i don’t need you to guess, i need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
44172,Sheldon,"little generic. keep thinking. we’ll circle back. wil wheaton, go."
43490,Sheldon,"you saw through that one, did you?"
38017,Sheldon,they can’t function without me. i’m the social glue that holds this little group together. you’re welcome.
45246,Sheldon,"so they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? that’s hilarious. i can’t wait to tell them."
39232,Sheldon,"oh, yes, priya. leonard, you know i make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
38700,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i just don’t buy it.
45634,Sheldon,this is not a tangerine bicycle. 
38607,Sheldon,"well, i must say, i am impressed."
39700,Sheldon,"it’s in her book, needy baby, greedy baby."
41969,Sheldon,"but i didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt."
34656,Sheldon,yes. if you use my toothbrush i’ll jump out that window. please don’t come to my funeral. have a good night. 
38828,Sheldon,"that’s very nice, stuart. zack?"
42670,Sheldon,"amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, i’m going there anyway."
39393,Sheldon,double stuf?
34513,Sheldon,you’re talking to one of the three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. 
44739,Sheldon,hmm?
38347,Sheldon,i’ll reprogram howard.
21845,Sheldon,i don’t like this spot. i have to keep turning my head.
38698,Sheldon,"shelly! shelly, how many times have i told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? goodness, i’ll never understand that boy. but then again, i’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
41510,Sheldon,i can’t believe i read this table wrong. i blame you.
44716,Sheldon,"yes. oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. or possibly penguins. her english is atrocious."
36457,Sheldon,au contraire.
40144,Sheldon,"i wish you could all be inside my head. the conversation is sparkling.  fine, i’ll tell you. a lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. if you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? hint, there is a right answer. none of you will get it."
44478,Sheldon,dr. hofstadter.
37548,Sheldon,i’m not accepting the award.
40549,Sheldon,don’t try to change the subject. this is about a parking space. it has nothing to do with cars.
45663,Sheldon,i’m still within earshot! you may want to wait for my door to close.
36401,Sheldon,even though the menu description specifies shredded?
40518,Sheldon,it’s a hypothetical containment field for a frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
44844,Sheldon,would you care for a brandy?
34661,Sheldon,well there’s one beloved children’s book i’ll never read again.
41578,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please. leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. he can’t walk in my actual shoes. he has the feet of a toddler."
44832,Sheldon,ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art german incubator.
34241,Sheldon,what’s the difference?
40383,Sheldon,"for goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt."
44995,Sheldon,"well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…"
38342,Sheldon,"to drinking.  nope. oh, if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt."
35670,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
34856,Sheldon,"we just leave the house on friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab."
37570,Sheldon,"sim city. more specifically, the sim city i designed, sheldonopolis."
37724,Sheldon,"oh, lord, i’m in jewish hell."
40000,Sheldon,"all right. i thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. these are cooper coupons. these are for various things i can do for you. um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. um, oh, this is fun one. this is an afternoon with me at the california science center, where i point out their mistakes."
41506,Sheldon,"i hate to pile on the bad news, but i just got a raise."
41130,Sheldon,"but they’ll know i’m not you. should i call myself professor proton, jr.?"
44395,Sheldon,"your name is bernatrix. you are a warrior queen. you’re strong, beautiful and tall."
45609,Sheldon,mommy.
37706,Sheldon,which way are you going?
41902,Sheldon,"think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home."
45797,Sheldon,i have an override switch.
38407,Sheldon,"well, who would ever guess that?"
39529,Sheldon,hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
40247,Sheldon,"good. now, i assume we’re splitting the cheque?"
43609,Sheldon,"well, we gave it a shot. how about you?"
43860,Sheldon,where are you going?
45015,Sheldon,"well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
40559,Sheldon,go ahead. that’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. it smells funny in here.
39378,Sheldon,of course she does. making me food is her way of saying i love you. making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying i really love you.
37215,Sheldon,you’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. i am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
39888,Sheldon,i found him. he’s in the bathroom. president siebert?
45545,Sheldon,and if you see any actors from game of thrones in first class?
41894,Sheldon,"i’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right."
40898,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. my apologies that this episode is coming late. i did shoot one last week, in honour of black history month, but i was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of george washington carver could be considered wildly racist. my heart goes out to the members of the african-american community, who, like me, have been kept down by the man. now, fun with flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. she’s had coitus many times. sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. once while he was trying to watch the incredibles. penny."
40332,Sheldon,"flattery will not get you this job, ms. jenson."
35772,Sheldon,"you can’t do that. not only is it a violation of california state law, it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy."
43540,Sheldon,"yeah, i know, top ten, pretty exciting."
36130,Sheldon,no.
44627,Sheldon,"you know, leonard and i were very happy before you came along."
37331,Sheldon,the plural of coccyx is coccyges.
39418,Sheldon,"look at the two of us. me, a highly regarded physicist. the kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. you, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. but deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. a regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. rain. another great equalizer. falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  smarty-pants."
42203,Sheldon,"when obi-wan came to luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. so, um, what do you got for me?"
35744,Sheldon,individual relish packets?
44427,Sheldon,you’re really going without me?
34777,Sheldon,it’s certainly preferable to my plan.
42743,Sheldon,"yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. maybe it’s time i teach her a lesson."
44895,Sheldon,"no. now that you know my weakness, i hate you more than ever."
45740,Sheldon,i still can’t sleep.
36526,Sheldon,"you told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. and once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
35777,Sheldon,"no problem, i’ll just do my laundry another night."
41732,Sheldon,"oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
40897,Sheldon,yeah. okay. stop ruining valentine’s day and order my pizza.
39306,Sheldon,a side of corn succotash. hmm. interesting.
44418,Sheldon,"oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases."
35952,Sheldon,i knew it! what do i do?
40257,Sheldon,"the big deal is i was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six."
36487,Sheldon,"sure, why not? and after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘cause today’s the day to stop making sense."
35315,Sheldon,so you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
39538,Sheldon,"i did it! i actually did it. okay, now flush him."
38575,Sheldon,"playing it. i’ve loved the theremin from the first moment i heard the original star trek theme. and it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
40038,Sheldon,oh dear lord. no!
37437,Sheldon,you don’t have to be mean. i’m sick.
42413,Sheldon,"no, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum."
45031,Sheldon,i don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
39547,Sheldon,"i know what this is about. given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. yes. and if i may suggest, consider changing disciplines. yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. one of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. you could have fun with that."
45137,Sheldon,"i did. you know, i’m not even sure how accurate it was. i took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
38547,Sheldon,"if you say so, boss."
36665,Sheldon,"because i am without friends. like the proverbial cheese, i stand alone. even while seated."
42782,Sheldon,"that’s easy for you to say. your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. boy, that’s a lot of panties."
44232,Sheldon,"yeah? oh, well, was this guy rick from computer solutions on colorado?"
34645,Sheldon,"well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if i could afford the rent i’d ask you to leave. "
42184,Sheldon,"amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
44866,Sheldon,fine. you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
44196,Sheldon,so stipulated.
39046,Sheldon,it’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. the name literally beckons.
42267,Sheldon,"i have real problems here, amy. i can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. mmm, yummy."
43360,Sheldon,"well, i just asked her if i should start watching the new flash tv series."
45543,Sheldon,and you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?
41669,Sheldon,i saw. and i just posted a retraction of my paper. now the whole scientific community knows i was wrong.
37280,Sheldon,may i come in?
43861,Sheldon,i wanted to let you know i’ll be spending your birthday with you.
39658,Sheldon,"yeah, me, too. triple digits, i’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
41651,Sheldon,"hello, president siebert. thank you for taking my call. i just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. oh, no, no, no, no. no need to thank mno, thank my friend, wil wheaton. for your information, i have nine friends, hmm? ten if we include you. nine it is. ah, it’s ten. i’ll count wolowitz. hello, friend leonard."
39705,Sheldon,"again, not enough evidence. for all we know, he’s being murdered. now, back to our game."
34796,Sheldon,"oh, please. i admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. but it was straight downhill from there. "
44230,Sheldon,"oh, oh, the guy. oh, pardon me. i didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4k display and a thunderbolt port?"
43345,Sheldon,while my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
45148,Sheldon,"congratulations. the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway. you are at the throttle. you are the engineer. you are running the locomotive. this doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. oh, dear, i have to tinkle again."
37633,Sheldon,"i’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip cathy. when she’s upset, she says ach and eats ice cream."
37390,Sheldon,but penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
39739,Sheldon,and i have flag knowledge that i have to get out of here!
41854,Sheldon,what if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
34552,Sheldon,who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table? 
43153,Sheldon,"so it’s like the musical equivalent of russell’s paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?"
34726,Sheldon,"no, no, princess punchali from the monkey and the princess. "
44931,Sheldon,but you don’t even like flags.
45338,Sheldon,"yeah, the math is so inelegant. i’m not even sure it makes sense."
36925,Sheldon,when i have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as galactica. is that what you’re wearing to watch football at penny’s?
38030,Sheldon,you take that back.
35419,Sheldon,"leslie winkle, penny. she belittles my research."
34671,Sheldon,"then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. "
35945,Sheldon,hang on. 130 over 80. a little high. we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
44834,Sheldon,"would you look at that? the image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
41576,Sheldon,"oh, did i forget to tell you? that store went out of business years ago."
43800,Sheldon,"i’ll start you off easy. electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp."
37964,Sheldon,"flattering, but sadly, no. i’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. aka jogging."
37031,Sheldon,ok.
40059,Sheldon,"perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular nebraska man-hands."
34250,Sheldon,"yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
44008,Sheldon,"all you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior."
41151,Sheldon,yay!
35092,Sheldon,i don’t know what you were worried about. i think it really works in the room.
40570,Sheldon,"i think you’re high on paint fumes. and boy, that’s a lot of band-aids."
44898,Sheldon,"yes, that’s right. i have amy. in the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. does it eat you up inside that i have her and you don’t?"
43390,Sheldon,oh.
44897,Sheldon,you know what? this isn’t gonna work.
45304,Sheldon,beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
38055,Sheldon,i was there. she dumped you.
41647,Sheldon,i do see what you’re saying. that helps.
35003,Sheldon,"something remarkable. since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, i’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize. look, i’m going to solve the middle-east crisis by building an exact replica of jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert. "
38879,Sheldon,"the wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. oh! excuse me, i’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. and your card was the five of spades. ta-da."
35564,Sheldon,"no. anyway, when i was eight, a montgomery-ward delivery van ran over our cat, lucky."
41378,Sheldon,"oh, that’s clever."
34735,Sheldon,i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can. 
39669,Sheldon,"hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that i’m not boyfriend material."
39740,Sheldon,"no, i’m a little rattled. but like the flag over fort sumter, i’m still here. and, take two. hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. over the next 52 weeks, you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
36837,Sheldon,caca?
43847,Sheldon,and i will continue to do so!
43579,Sheldon,"technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. swash referring to the sound of the sword. swash. and then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have."
40913,Sheldon,"no. i didn’t start yet, it’s fine."
41463,Sheldon,"well, i cannot give this stuff away."
44752,Sheldon,so?
37504,Sheldon,"of course not. and, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
43116,Sheldon,is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does?
37129,Sheldon,how are you going to take notes without a notebook?
42279,Sheldon,"your life? the university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. and now, the place i need to go when i’m sad is damp and smells funny."
34853,Sheldon,"yes, if she googles leopold houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
45131,Sheldon,yes?
37585,Sheldon,says the former member of the corn queen’s court.
45150,Sheldon,no idea. all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
44307,Sheldon,"no, he didn’t do anything. so i said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? you know? may, maybe i should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer."
34951,Sheldon,do you think penny will come here and take care of us? 
43485,Sheldon,"but enough about the czech republic. let’s talk about the time moldova made romania a birthday cake and romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. and yet romania gets dumped. i’ll pause here while you mull that one over. i know, right?"
35392,Sheldon,well alright then.
42941,Sheldon,"oh, no, me as well. uh, please e-mail it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz. why dot biz? because i just gave you the business. and also bazinga dot com was taken."
37806,Sheldon,"i must say, i’m shocked by this betrayal."
34947,Sheldon,"i’ll teach you. “soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” now you. "
42293,Sheldon,"good lord. padawan’s the student, not the teacher."
39348,Sheldon,"mohammed is the most common first name in the world, lee, the most common surname. as i didn’t know the answer, i thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
39958,Sheldon,"oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. but i see your point."
43697,Sheldon,i have many. my most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend penny. that’s her over there.
43864,Sheldon,it’s late. got to go. bye.
40804,Sheldon,yes.
35408,Sheldon,you mean like spock?
42337,Sheldon,"here, day one, uh, this was the seat i was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. as it was first class, i suspect ritz. this is the train bathroom. this is the imodium i took so i would never have to use the train bathroom."
43306,Sheldon,check.
34798,Sheldon,"okay, that is it. "
44081,Sheldon,yes.
35880,Sheldon,"you don’t see it, do you? we’re losing her."
36389,Sheldon,come.
42777,Sheldon,you should point out the hypocrisy of that.
41095,Sheldon,"it’s happening. leonard, it’s happening. professor proton is coming to our house."
45003,Sheldon,"oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? you know, i mean, god did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these sloppy joes."
41057,Sheldon,"oh, dear. penny, have you been recording shows on our dvr again?"
39463,Sheldon,really? that’s very unsettling.
34812,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. ."
40993,Sheldon,"it’s simple, really. it occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. the, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once."
45248,Sheldon,"well, if you haven’t noticed, i’ve been between them for the last ten years."
39494,Sheldon,and that made you feel sad?
41450,Sheldon,"oh, i had to take the bus home. fell asleep and missed my stop."
45144,Sheldon,i don’t want to go home.
39696,Sheldon,"mm. i want to build a road, but i need wood. do either of you fellows have wood?  i don’t understand the laughter. the object of settlers of catan is to build roads and settlements. to do so requires wood. now, i have sheep; i need wood. who has wood for my sheep?"
35786,Sheldon,i’ve done no stupid things.
37812,Sheldon,let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
36042,Sheldon,you answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. a b b a c. a b b a c.
41266,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. heck, you can even push the cart. please don’t take my looking forward to leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence."
34942,Sheldon,vaporub makes my hands smell funny. 
37078,Sheldon,"of course. first, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  a north and south pole. if you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
45158,Sheldon,"well, i would love to help you, but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, i don’t think i can go back to theory. i’m an engineer now. and, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. not that goofy kind you are."
37961,Sheldon,"in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, i need to change my diet."
38740,Sheldon,"penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
36338,Sheldon,"penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, i’d strongly recommend that we let leonard go."
42456,Sheldon,"on the bright side, that oxford study was right. one friend down. i wonder who you’re going to lose next."
44517,Sheldon,"you made god sad today, mom."
44833,Sheldon,"okay, fine. let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. although, we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours, so we win."
44182,Sheldon,"you know, i used to hate these hugs. now they’re just extremely irritating."
41846,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, who’s angie dickinson?"
34550,Sheldon,"yeah, the name always confused me anyway, soup plantation. you can’t grow soup. "
35519,Sheldon,can we talk about this later.
41386,Sheldon,"yeah, except for the fact that indiana jones is completely irrelevant to the story. with or without him, the nazis find the ark, open it and die."
42208,Sheldon,"and now you’re gone, too. it’s like all the men i’ve looked up to have gone away."
44880,Sheldon,"well, it’s a new day. i have a new outlook. you know, i realized i don’t need to worry about other people. i just need to think more about myself."
43924,Sheldon,still hasn’t bought milk even though i told him two days ago.
37594,Sheldon,go on.
44903,Sheldon,"i can’t. thank you, professor hawking. you are a gift to mankind. there should be statues of you everywhere. you know, the lincoln memorial has a big chair. we could swap you right in."
38997,Sheldon,i’m sorry. what pun?
35190,Sheldon,what’s the difference?
41439,Sheldon,"it’s a physical relationship, too. hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. ow. okay, here’s a new one. apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. how do you like it when i do it to you? not so much, huh?"
35131,Sheldon,we have to get rid of the time machine. 
35685,Sheldon,"you don’t tackle the big issues, ramona. you fence with them. en garde. riposte."
40938,Sheldon,"if you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time."
40520,Sheldon,i expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. gentlemen.
42425,Sheldon,"everything is quantifiable. that french fry? a seven. spider-man? a nine. the number nine? oddly, only a four."
41390,Sheldon,"of course. you know, why couldn’t she just like ziggy? yeah? that thing’s riddled with plot holes."
39027,Sheldon,the mean indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. congratulations. pizza night will now be at your apartment. order one.
37914,Sheldon,"then, this is my first date."
37923,Sheldon,big night? the winter solstice is a big night. it’s over 14 hours in southern california.
40418,Sheldon,"earlier today, i invited professor stephen hawking to join me in the popular online game words with friends. moments ago, he accepted my request. do you understand what that means?"
43309,Sheldon,then who is?
42099,Sheldon,"oh, there are so many exciting areas. black holes, dark matter."
43582,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure i have a dominant leg. they’re both pretty submissive."
44225,Sheldon,you’re too late.
34622,Sheldon,"if we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."
39453,Sheldon,i thought you were leaving the apartment.
40392,Sheldon,"for the record, he also thinks the walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world."
43858,Sheldon,by seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
40417,Sheldon,"paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. "
39265,Sheldon,"is not. is not, is not."
39981,Sheldon,just tell her i can’t come.
42514,Sheldon,ow. that was your fault.
44375,Sheldon,yes. and we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
45687,Sheldon,i’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
35046,Sheldon,"i see. well. at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
44615,Sheldon,"if you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it."
45281,Sheldon,a housewarming gift for raj.
37135,Sheldon,"yeah, give or take. as i was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece… yes, penny?"
38474,Sheldon,what are you doing?
44407,Sheldon,"well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. i can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot."
41419,Sheldon,why? so you can see the look on amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
38899,Sheldon,"what kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?"
34727,Sheldon,it’s a children’s story.
45647,Sheldon,"hello. nice work with the laser, by the way. looking out at your fresh young faces, i remember when i too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. of course, i was 14, and i’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava."
37725,Sheldon,"i told you, walking."
43969,Sheldon,"well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."
38327,Sheldon,"you’re tricking me. it really is, isn’t it?"
38626,Sheldon,no.
39405,Sheldon,"great. now, you’re going to love the perlmutter lecture. look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but i thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum amazing grace during those parts."
43373,Sheldon,okay. if you say so.
40162,Sheldon,here.
37937,Sheldon,using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
45410,Sheldon,you know exactly what i need.
40378,Sheldon,"no, that’s not fair either."
42716,Sheldon,"you do this, i delete your contact information."
42972,Sheldon,"i don’t understand why you’re mad at me. you should be mad at amy. like i was this afternoon. hey, look at that, i let it go."
45477,Sheldon,"okay. just to be on the safe side, am i in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?"
36711,Sheldon,"fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and i’ll take possession of your fantastic four."
45497,Sheldon,"i’m doing it. i’m doing it. i’m tall and i’m doing it.  ah, man."
45416,Sheldon,"mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. that’s just where we have dinner."
41755,Sheldon,can’t sleep?
45807,Sheldon,and i’m safe and sound in bed. who’s crazy now?
36009,Sheldon,"impressive as that may be, monte is not us. monte has no fear."
34998,Sheldon,yes.
35614,Sheldon,we had a difference of opinion.
37584,Sheldon,in the prom department.
36879,Sheldon,"it might also interest you to know that wil wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director joel schumacher, who nearly destroyed the batman movie franchise, and billy sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
44291,Sheldon,thanks.
38301,Sheldon,"oh, good. i was afraid you were going to fixate on that mars rover incident."
43755,Sheldon,one minute is a long time.
42259,Sheldon,where are you going to go?
37354,Sheldon,"don’t be absurd. that’s in washington. you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. no. i’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
45532,Sheldon,"no, it is. leonard pointed out to me that i’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
38365,Sheldon,see? howard’s on my side.
39729,Sheldon,this is a disaster. i distinctly ordered the leonard nimoy mr. spock cardboard standee. why would i feel safer with zachary quinto at the foot of my bed?
42629,Sheldon,"i love you, too."
39118,Sheldon,dear lord! have you been drinking it?
34324,Sheldon,"watch your fingers. watch your fingers. oh god, my fingers!"
41387,Sheldon,"oh, it turns out amy’s beloved pride and prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. he’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works."
37204,Sheldon,"oh, yes. i just discovered i don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a linux partition, so you and i are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
37375,Sheldon,yes.
44220,Sheldon,"oh, but i like this computer."
41622,Sheldon,do you mind? we’re having a moment here.
38381,Sheldon,"oh, i informed you thusly. i so informed you thusly."
34300,Sheldon,they would be gastronomically redundant. i can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
40340,Sheldon,stems removed?
37448,Sheldon,"i don’t trust banks. i believe that when the robots rise up, atms will lead the charge."
37304,Sheldon,i’m fine. although i’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
44792,Sheldon,"well, i suppose we could find a whole new place. you know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in pasadena. we could, we could move to altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena."
39902,Sheldon,"well, of course. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons spock, spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves spock, spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
40640,Sheldon,"oh, a scroll. i like scrolls. they’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. after stone tablets and skywriting. you have all been summoned to join a thrilling dungeons and dragons adventure. your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. i like where this is heading. your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. oh, that’s a saucy twist. that leader’s name, santa claus. no, no, no."
40785,Sheldon,see?
39579,Sheldon,i’m the guy.
35082,Sheldon,"i wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. "
42470,Sheldon,no.
43221,Sheldon,"g-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
42019,Sheldon,you may have a point. i love my mother. even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
36781,Sheldon,"if you let me use negative reinforcement, i can get it done before we go to bed."
40553,Sheldon,"yeah, that was five weeks ago. how much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"
42045,Sheldon,thank you again for dinner.
39235,Sheldon,yes. i read recently about a fellow in kansas with an enormous ball of twine. i bet you could give him a run for his money.
41929,Sheldon,hello.
35812,Sheldon,where?
35732,Sheldon,"time. alright klingons, pencils down."
44706,Sheldon,that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny.
39338,Sheldon,i’m not surprised.
43283,Sheldon,"all right, that seems simple enough. initiating calibration sequence. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. well, i suppose ten is technically at least ten. but they’re still getting at least one angry letter."
38336,Sheldon,"i believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. let’s see. harvey wallbanger. eh. sex on the beach. i hardly think so. rob roy, silk slipper, mad hatter. ooh! i’ll have a rosewater ricky."
34977,Sheldon,"yes, but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. "
43099,Sheldon,you know how the pennysaver only has my name…
40008,Sheldon,"oh, don’t thank me. thank wireless technology. i realized, i can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
45299,Sheldon,"well, then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed. raj, i let my emotions get the best of me, and i unfairly took it out on you."
34275,Sheldon,no i don’t. and neither do you.
35589,Sheldon,penny. didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends?
37261,Sheldon,"oh god, oh god, oh, god! it’s all right. they didn’t take my comic books."
40713,Sheldon,"i don’t see why i’m the one being persecuted here. dr. hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. you know, and howard wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. oh, and at the office christmas party, i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar."
40689,Sheldon,"okay, look, it’s not really about ricardo and tondelaya. it is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because dr. einstein von brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things."
44684,Sheldon,"when we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. one night, it got so bad i almost grabbed toto "
44247,Sheldon,"sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis."
41408,Sheldon,"if you do that, i’ll scream."
36950,Sheldon,uh-oh! industrial accident.
45096,Sheldon,"well, it certainly would be easier. you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
41454,Sheldon,"yeah, i thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice."
44039,Sheldon,"uh, roses, bengay, and dr. scholls’ foot powder."
37459,Sheldon,"i am not guilty. i only have a learner’s permit, penny was the teacher. when the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so i went, went, went."
36225,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard. but revenge is a dish best served cold."
42607,Sheldon,"well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then i’m open to it."
43300,Sheldon,"mm. sorry. ah, maybe it’s for the best. i hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados."
40465,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. before we get started, i’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. but i can’t. the only entry was from gameygamer75, and i know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, star trek. and to help me, i’m pleased to introduce internet personality, former star of star trek: the next generation, and the only guy i know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. set phasers to fun for my friend, wil wheaton."
37355,Sheldon,of course it is. even talking to you is sufficiently menial that i can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
39634,Sheldon,then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
39784,Sheldon,"you moved up one. my pen pal in somalia was kidnapped by pirates. so, uh, how are you?"
35218,Sheldon,"you mean, like a sweater? "
44365,Sheldon,"well, bernadette, looks like saturday night, it’s you and me."
43602,Sheldon,"look at this blister. like it or not, we’re athletes now. besides, a bar is where i belong. i’m having female problems."
44810,Sheldon,"huh. yeah, i wonder if that’s related to the 12th century persian philosopher, al-ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
38967,Sheldon,"all right, get this. bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard."
35866,Sheldon,"i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. when i was 12, i got to ride there in a helicopter."
43757,Sheldon,uh-oh. what if it’s jennifer lawrence?
42873,Sheldon,"or do i, hmm? sir isaac newton wrote his principia while convinced he was an armadillo."
35622,Sheldon,why penny?
40538,Sheldon,the first forty-three parallel universes i’ve checked proved to be empty. i see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
35093,Sheldon,"the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor from victorian england into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling eloy. "
40399,Sheldon,"oh, oh, on the contrary. couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. now imagine this, you and i entering stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see america’s most beloved and glamorous couple."
44411,Sheldon,"no, it did at first, but then i talked it through with frank and alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective."
41337,Sheldon,"which reminds me. this came in the mail, and i want you to have it."
37885,Sheldon,"all right, everyone pay attention. yes, i have a friend named amy farrah fowler. yes, she is female. yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
38531,Sheldon,"then it hits her. how is she going to survive? i mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. and then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend howard."
34466,Sheldon,"well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
39572,Sheldon,penny.
43134,Sheldon,"you see, penny, the israelites were in the desert…"
45037,Sheldon,"it says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. and that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. bernadette, you are doing a good job."
45546,Sheldon,and don’t forget to skype me when you arrive.
35640,Sheldon,aced it.
37922,Sheldon,muggles.
37397,Sheldon,"he can’t kill me, even if i turn."
43857,Sheldon,yes. but she knows how important star wars is to me.
44592,Sheldon,"just, please, bear with me if i display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
38963,Sheldon,"leonard, the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. we have to do our part, too.  that was uncalled for, but i’ll play along. ow! i had an unusual experience with amy last night."
36758,Sheldon,"i’m sure that will happen soon enough. but in the meantime, i still want oatmeal."
35559,Sheldon,fine. 
39116,Sheldon,i knew i should have given my pope the jet pack.
44054,Sheldon,isn’t that the best? she’s like grandma spider-man.
43339,Sheldon,"well, now i have to correct you. as a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. so i believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler."
43226,Sheldon,"oh, come on. i really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in."
36671,Sheldon,"oh, you think you’re so clever. well, let me just tell you, while i do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
41326,Sheldon,you’re right. which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
45746,Sheldon,"yes, i’m starting my own comic book convention, and i thought that your client, robert downey jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. oh, well, now, why are you saying no? you haven’t even asked him yet. you know, excuse me, but i sat through iron man 2. i believe he owes me two hours of his time. they hung up on me."
42005,Sheldon,how long have you been involved with him?
44917,Sheldon,"wonderful, longclaw is mine. and how about you keep our avocado plant?"
40966,Sheldon,how come i never get to do anything i want to do?
45685,Sheldon,i would hardly call that dialogue!
43850,Sheldon,"and you do realize i bought my ticket when amy and i were broken up? i hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed."
44492,Sheldon,you realize you and i could become brothers.
39010,Sheldon, penny?
35437,Sheldon,that’s a temporal anomaly. corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
41544,Sheldon,"well, that really hurt. "
41664,Sheldon,"don’t you dare use science against me. science is my best friend. oh, good, i’m back up to eight."
40554,Sheldon,"no, no, this is a slippery slope, leonard. it starts with a parking space, where does it end? it’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."
35033,Sheldon,"the objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if i know them, why shouldn’t i give them? "
43970,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m dying."
35920,Sheldon,"if i am permitted to speak again, dr. sheldon cooper for the win."
38366,Sheldon,drat. now i’m 8 for 27.
39103,Sheldon,yellow. go ahead.
42409,Sheldon,"if you’re free tomorrow night, i’d love to have you join us on a double date."
44802,Sheldon,yes.
42618,Sheldon,thank you.
42490,Sheldon,i’m sorry. is that a no?
44713,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be. you get your hopes up, i knock them down. that’s called teamwork."
40947,Sheldon,how is it sexist? my character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
38189,Sheldon,why would i change?
43122,Sheldon,"indeed. penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day."
41093,Sheldon,"well, i’m e-mailing him right now."
34707,Sheldon,what’s not to love?
37460,Sheldon,"you don’t need to reimburse me because i’m not paying. on thursday, i will have my day in court and justice will be done. in fact, i’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
38058,Sheldon,"mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
42995,Sheldon,correct. you’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
39848,Sheldon,i have plenty of experience in biology. i bought a tamagotchi in 1998. and it’s still alive. let’s do this.
34877,Sheldon,"no. we’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
45440,Sheldon,"i’d say she’s copying you again, but i’m getting tired of sitting in the hall."
42245,Sheldon,hello.
42137,Sheldon,amy’s sick.
39148,Sheldon,"howard, i have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
38457,Sheldon,the alternative would be to think backwards. and that’s just remembering.
39756,Sheldon,flags.
43964,Sheldon,no. but i knew that his yay was sarcastic. not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
44102,Sheldon,"well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. the flag of the isle of man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
39972,Sheldon,"amy, what do you think?"
41355,Sheldon,but we haven’t finished the puzzle.
42828,Sheldon,"well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard."
42445,Sheldon,i go to the bathroom like everybody else.
40056,Sheldon,"very well. cooper to enterprise, one to beam up. energise.  ah. tiny spock. help."
37626,Sheldon,"well, well, well. if it isn’t wil wheaton, the green goblin to my spider-man, the pope paul the fifth to my galileo, the internet explorer to my firefox."
38670,Sheldon,"yes. in preparation for today’s studies, i read stanislavski’s an actor prepares, stella adler’s"
39540,Sheldon,"my phone’s on the desk over there. take a picture of us together. make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. if you were a dove, i’d call you lovey-dovey. oh. who am i kidding? this isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. you’re just my little lovey-dovey, aren’t you?"
34564,Sheldon,what about comic-books?
41924,Sheldon,it is hideous.
36248,Sheldon,whee!
34870,Sheldon,"you didn’t read the bio, did you? he’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
37326,Sheldon,"structure, constant structure. one atom…"
45192,Sheldon,you want me to look at him and listen to him?
34540,Sheldon,"boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. "
40451,Sheldon,how can it be okay? stephen hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. it’s everything i’ve ever wanted in a friend.
42221,Sheldon,"ah, very good. because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust."
37696,Sheldon,"excuse me, i’m thirsty, so i’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
35103,Sheldon,time machine. 
42958,Sheldon,can i think about the spiny anteater?
36985,Sheldon,"considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
36702,Sheldon,that is a snowy tree cricket. oecanthus fultoni. i was done with latin by fifth grade.
37644,Sheldon,"all right! fence mended, problem swept under the rug. time to bowl! yes, i was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
40170,Sheldon,"ah, much better."
39212,Sheldon,"subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
37235,Sheldon,"in brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
39624,Sheldon,a little bit? the man super glued hershey’s kisses to your nipples.
43893,Sheldon,"no, no, no. it’s your birthday. as long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, i’ll be fine."
40035,Sheldon,well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
34800,Sheldon,"you hit me. you saw him, he hit me."
34838,Sheldon,"simple. if she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. "
38716,Sheldon,"i don’t care, it’s demeaning. and i refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the texas state fair. which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a star trek ensign’s uniform."
45046,Sheldon,"if you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. i’ll win in five moves. i’ll win in one move."
34921,Sheldon,"i’m sick, thank you very much. "
38485,Sheldon,that’s very hurtful.
42017,Sheldon,what did you do?
34872,Sheldon,fine.  we’ll talk in the morning.
40031,Sheldon,"knock, knock."
39358,Sheldon,"oh, of course you would have to believe that. evil always thinks it’s doing right. excuse me, stormtrooper. these are the droids you’re looking for."
35522,Sheldon,i had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
35847,Sheldon,no.
38512,Sheldon,i’m kermit. you’re scooter.
42951,Sheldon,why would she do this to me?
44224,Sheldon,what?  hello?
44633,Sheldon,you’re really okay with that?
44614,Sheldon,don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
40646,Sheldon,"wait, svaty vaclav was the duke of bohemia."
44112,Sheldon,"oh, i heard about that. why didn’t you discover it?"
42300,Sheldon,"hello, leonard."
21861,Sheldon,you’re welcome. 
38207,Sheldon,drop axe. brilliant.
45485,Sheldon,i’m returning this stuff to howard.
35768,Sheldon,"all right, that’s it. strike three."
34883,Sheldon,"how could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. "
40446,Sheldon,"blonde women, huh?"
36091,Sheldon,"so uh, kripke, i was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
37947,Sheldon,killed by badger.
41311,Sheldon,"excuse me. this changes nothing. except the halloween costume i’m wearing this year. amy, you’re going to be olive oyl. lay off the doughnuts."
35842,Sheldon,"penny, hello."
44445,Sheldon,did you see that? he just cut the line.
35706,Sheldon,it’s morse code.
41306,Sheldon,"well, leonard, i think it’s high time you and i address the tweepadock in the room."
37720,Sheldon,"well, my new shoes are not made for running."
40128,Sheldon,humorous. now will you please present my paper to professor hawking?
41003,Sheldon,"uh, penny, i, i have a couple of questions about your closet. is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?"
40732,Sheldon,"oh, they shot a lot of star trek episodes out there."
34585,Sheldon,"well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “how wasted am i?” which is met with an approving chorus of “dude.”"
42550,Sheldon,he doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. he combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
43951,Sheldon,"all right, way to go, cat poster. you hang in there."
38989,Sheldon,"did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
44549,Sheldon,fine. ooh. can i use text-to-speech software?
41528,Sheldon,that’s even worse. using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. pervert.
44266,Sheldon,thank you. i wouldn’t even know how to begin.
44796,Sheldon,i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
44252,Sheldon,"just wait. you know what? actually, yes, thank you. welcome to my fortress of shame."
41850,Sheldon,"people usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
38277,Sheldon,"mango, caterpillar. what are you doing? you said you liked it!"
41317,Sheldon,"you say you’re from new jersey, but how can i believe you?"
42852,Sheldon,"i ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it."
39115,Sheldon,when it’s done charging. or you land on the time machine. obviously.
44257,Sheldon,"i used to collect them as a child. the spiral of scales open in the fibonacci sequence. a fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head."
39896,Sheldon,kripke. come in. i’m making tea. would you like a cup?
36353,Sheldon,i have complete faith that you will make them. good night.
45270,Sheldon,i suppose that’s acceptable.
35966,Sheldon,"no, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia."
34793,Sheldon,"you continue to underestimate me, my good man. "
36718,Sheldon,"hang on. voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka oecanthus fultoni, which is latin for i’ll suck nothing. of course i’m joking because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
35123,Sheldon,"i’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. "
44064,Sheldon,"well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. you have to like each other. well, we have a 4:30 reservation at applebee’s."
41061,Sheldon,"no, that’s the season two finale. that was quite the cliffhanger. i’m going to re-watch it before season three starts."
35977,Sheldon,that presupposes penny is tense.
41760,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry."
45562,Sheldon,let’s sit somewhere else.
44004,Sheldon,"my goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?"
36945,Sheldon,"pay attention, leonard. that’s why she can’t play on sunday."
41879,Sheldon,excuse me. i think you’re being a little rude.
45541,Sheldon,it’s hard to say. i’ve never really lived by myself. what if i become strange and eccentric?
39999,Sheldon,"now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party."
35116,Sheldon,i disagree. your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. that failure clearly stands on its own.
45644,Sheldon,hmmmm?
45496,Sheldon,you’re so cute. i’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
34899,Sheldon,leonard! if i’m going to get ahead of this thing i need to find out what’s growing in my throat. 
45357,Sheldon,"i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. and for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom."
44184,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you’re an engineer. end of joke, burn."
44216,Sheldon,what? i didn’t sign it yet.
43991,Sheldon,i don’t know. a music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
37180,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure about interesting, but…"
41632,Sheldon,who? give me their names. i bet it’s wolowitz.
43424,Sheldon,will someone take me home?
38924,Sheldon,that’s uncanny.
40026,Sheldon,"well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
42093,Sheldon,"it was. this seemed so elegant at the time, but now i realize i was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
43716,Sheldon,"oh, not at all. as i said, the entire point of emulating spock was to rise above human emotion, which i’ve spent a lifetime mastering."
35852,Sheldon,the statement stands for itself.
39667,Sheldon,"it’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
44969,Sheldon,"i’m not sure. earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels."
44723,Sheldon,"would you like one, mrs. petrescu?"
35053,Sheldon,the velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
39590,Sheldon,"fine. amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
41425,Sheldon,"last week, you told leonard he couldn’t wear his wookie jacket out in public."
41403,Sheldon,"fine. i’m mad at you. not only did you ruin raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
41219,Sheldon,"i want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
35608,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, there you are, i’m ready to go home."
35923,Sheldon,then it must be a tumour.
39375,Sheldon,"frankly, mom, i’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
34965,Sheldon,nope. goodbye. 
45221,Sheldon,"oh, i know that now. at first, i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."
44619,Sheldon,"historically, i don’t do well with change."
42546,Sheldon,"well, i pray when i’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal."
44919,Sheldon,"oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
40072,Sheldon,"leonard, do you recall when i said that i was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the higgs boson particle, and you said, sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
39021,Sheldon,"yes, and when franconi’s went out of business, we switched to graziano’s."
35449,Sheldon,alright then.  
39693,Sheldon,"oh, i would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. we could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. oh! my life-size cardboard mr. spock is here! i know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
34716,Sheldon,"yes, "
41719,Sheldon,"to quote han solo, i know."
34816,Sheldon,i think that’s a week from tuesday at six. 
38443,Sheldon,how about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
35874,Sheldon,"we’re going to the movies. what movie? what theatre? what time? if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job."
43982,Sheldon,i can consider a place america’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
44069,Sheldon,"i’m gonna opt out of that one, too."
34424,Sheldon,"it’s time travel, leonard, i will have already done that. "
43049,Sheldon,that was a lot of puppies.
42668,Sheldon,amy. what’s going on?
39779,Sheldon,"you’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? oh, where’d the magic go?"
34597,Sheldon,what?
34904,Sheldon,"no, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
43827,Sheldon,"oh, no, he’s drinking it."
34235,Sheldon,"if by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at mit, sure."
41498,Sheldon,stop it. stop celebrating me.
44872,Sheldon,"ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…"
36279,Sheldon,put down the letters!
38168,Sheldon,thank you. i’ve also sent amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
36562,Sheldon, leonard.
36018,Sheldon,indeed. we are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  that’s new.
40767,Sheldon,"yes, cocoa. do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?"
39655,Sheldon,"all right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. any new business?"
44067,Sheldon,"my mother gave it to me, and i had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up."
42139,Sheldon,"well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
41363,Sheldon,the next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
41491,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not get lucky.
39788,Sheldon,"oh, i’m so sorry for your loss. on a cheerier note, i have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. what do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
43397,Sheldon,is penny crying?
42710,Sheldon,i have no idea. because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock.
44422,Sheldon,"all right, back to learning."
44708,Sheldon,"i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. it, it was unnecessary. this is warm. oh, and also, i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
43642,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. this is highly unethical."
41314,Sheldon,"who knows? uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. you say you’re taking me to work, but for all i know, i’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. or a cornfield maze. or a back alley dog fight. you tell me."
43401,Sheldon,why did i just hear amy’s name?
40159,Sheldon,doubleazinga! i do! good luck following that.
41932,Sheldon,"yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
34446,Sheldon,"never mind, you won’t get it right, i’d better come with you."
38833,Sheldon,"jacuzzi is a commercial brand. hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are jacuzzis."
44441,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. oh, beverly, good to see you. i’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. amy? a proper apology requires three steps. step one, an admission of wrongdoing. amy, i was wrong. step two, a promise never to repeat said action. amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. amy, i hope you can forgive me. and i hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an uber waiting downstairs, and i don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver ganesh."
44566,Sheldon,"it’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. nighty-night, y’all."
37016,Sheldon,i don’t drive.
43887,Sheldon,"oh, sure. well, you’re fun to look at."
40934,Sheldon,she is. but when do they get to the part about streetcars?
36927,Sheldon,"oh, yes. canine football fans are a common sight in texas. cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. my sister found that out the hard way."
38914,Sheldon,the name and the address drip with evil.
38872,Sheldon,yes. i’m using their cray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
40976,Sheldon,"oh, dear. my mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city."
45188,Sheldon,"msn search, altavista, and ask jeeves. you?"
41301,Sheldon,aha. 
37915,Sheldon,"i have a master’s degree and two doctorates. the things i should know, i do know."
42987,Sheldon,you didn’t even let me finish.
39272,Sheldon,penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
40912,Sheldon,um…
34455,Sheldon,"interesting. anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb."
38244,Sheldon,you know i can’t keep a secret.
40574,Sheldon,"actually, i have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says i can. give up, wolowitz. you’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. there is nothing you could possibly do to… "
34292,Sheldon,well you got me out of my pants.
42054,Sheldon,"thanks, grandma."
36824,Sheldon,"oh, pulling strings, are we?"
41670,Sheldon,not to me. the only other retraction i ever had to issue was when i was seven and i conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in east texas. but that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
44082,Sheldon,thank you.
35864,Sheldon,"hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. where did you do your medical internship?"
38749,Sheldon,no. but thank you for asking.
44208,Sheldon,"oh, please. any contract i sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
35088,Sheldon,yeah. 
45533,Sheldon,"the salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
44345,Sheldon,"hmm, what do you think?"
36928,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
44500,Sheldon,"oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
39780,Sheldon,"well, if amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled you’re welcome, mankind. all right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. uh, dentist. okay, we can circle back to that one. um, well, who wants to take me wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? anyone? oh. that one had hoot written all over it. um, all right, uh, dermatologist? allergist? podiatrist? supercuts? okay, okay, here’s a fun one. um, i need a new picture frame and i have a hankering for swedish meatballs. who wants to spend the day with me at ikea?"
45428,Sheldon,"ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and i have more physics jokes."
40419,Sheldon,"i’ll walk you through it. the game is not called words with strangers. no, it’s not even called words with acquaintances. it is called words with…"
37122,Sheldon,the one with the frogs.
37562,Sheldon,"i see. well, i assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. go ahead, howard. dazzle me."
38559,Sheldon,i see. and is that open for discussion?
39604,Sheldon,and that’s how it’s done.
40227,Sheldon,strongly pro.
36697,Sheldon,"is this it? it was inappropriate to discuss leonard and penny’s sex life in front of leonard and penny.  oh, good! now i can eat."
38122,Sheldon,i sense judgment on your part.
37582,Sheldon,that’s a lot of money for only one colour.
44261,Sheldon,"because i’m a fraud. no. i purport to be a man of the mind. i’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can i leave my body behind and become one with the internet when i’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?"
36895,Sheldon,"you betrayed me, wil wheaton. now i have my revenge."
38653,Sheldon,for instance?
44334,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. theon greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
41038,Sheldon,so am i. his passing makes me feel bad.
44697,Sheldon,"i was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
36300,Sheldon,but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights?
37170,Sheldon,"if i can interject here, obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
34802,Sheldon,"oh we’ll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
36316,Sheldon,good. let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
38980,Sheldon,"i’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. at johnson elementary school, the phrase shelly cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
37089,Sheldon,"oh! how about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? he’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
45710,Sheldon,i need a tissue.this one got wet.
35013,Sheldon,"screw him, he was weak. "
40735,Sheldon,none of you will get it. it’s eisenhower.
42161,Sheldon,oh. that’s a lot of incense. or someone set a hippie on fire.
42579,Sheldon,why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? we can both play this game.
37801,Sheldon,"wonderful. meaningless pleasantries accomplished. elizabeth, leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
36433,Sheldon,"no, you!"
38937,Sheldon,are you todd zarnecki?
40671,Sheldon,i understand.
36849,Sheldon,i looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
40064,Sheldon,"wait. it was me. i opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you."
34761,Sheldon,"no we don’t. we have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. "
37245,Sheldon,hulk sad.
39605,Sheldon,is this the fellow who peed in your hawaiian punch?
41788,Sheldon,do you see me drinking lemonade?
35313,Sheldon,"secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. one has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when i try to deceive, i myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  it’s a joke. it relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. i made it up myself. "
44277,Sheldon,"it’s nice to get back to nature. why don’t i do this more often? what a beautiful forest. hello, little butterfly. what’s your na-oh!"
37487,Sheldon,that’s the toilet?
42699,Sheldon,"hello. i’m doctor sheldon cooper, and welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags, the final episode flagtacular. i knew it was coming. still scary. now, i’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? who will stand between us and flag ignorance?"
37109,Sheldon,howard?
41011,Sheldon,"while i disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. you know, i’m like the sun. can’t turn this off."
39415,Sheldon,"oh, there it is. it always comes back to monkeys with you. just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
35838,Sheldon,"howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. he intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
39425,Sheldon,"i know, it filled in last year. i didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
41357,Sheldon,"well, i hope you’re wrong. i really want to go to the train store."
42072,Sheldon,"maybe it’s because i’m not an elitist. what i’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? you know? who’s looking out for joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?"
41743,Sheldon,excellent.
42328,Sheldon,amy just hurt my feelings. i want to break up with her.
44701,Sheldon,"we locked eyes, i ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
44955,Sheldon,"this is for you. i was going to wrap it, but touching scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
36590,Sheldon, penny.
42590,Sheldon,"yes. if you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure."
41208,Sheldon,"you’re dodging the question, i knew it was you. what was that?"
41813,Sheldon,"not sunday, i love sunday."
41500,Sheldon,"oh, no, they found the element.  no, no, stop it. i don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. how do i make them stop loving me?"
37351,Sheldon,einstein.
43679,Sheldon,"well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. that’s all i’ve got on me."
34431,Sheldon,well here’s an interesting turn of events.
41325,Sheldon,you don’t get a hey. you get a hmm.
43408,Sheldon,very well. you seem to be headed somewhere. may i walk with you?
39122,Sheldon,he drank from leonard’s glass. words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
41586,Sheldon,"please. ha-ha, oh."
42419,Sheldon,not as well as we do.
35684,Sheldon,ramona pointed out that i’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
35525,Sheldon,if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that.
43412,Sheldon,"oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? that’s sad."
36016,Sheldon,never. i’d rather see monte dead than in your hands.
42366,Sheldon,"oh, howard. i appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. i don’t think you’d understand a single thing i was talking about."
43919,Sheldon,"well, then it looks like we have a winner. congratulations."
45611,Sheldon,i’m not hungry. 
37446,Sheldon,"yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
38124,Sheldon,i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. you have none.
42829,Sheldon,and to clarify?
34538,Sheldon,"inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. "
41730,Sheldon,i think i’m hysterical.
44544,Sheldon,"all right, you were on jeopardy. allow me to alex trebek this and put it in the form of a question: who has been a complete waste of our time?"
43615,Sheldon,i’m doing all right. i tried fencing today.
37137,Sheldon,"project gorilla, entry two. i am exhausted."
42167,Sheldon,"ha. the opposite. she’s a neurobiologist, and i’m a theoretical physicist. my spirit guides can go suck an egg."
42117,Sheldon,it’s not my friend. nothing happened.
40731,Sheldon,"shh, he said it’s interesting."
45623,Sheldon,welcome dennis kim. 
40376,Sheldon,"all games are made up. they’re not found in nature. you don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of rock’em sock’em robots."
39912,Sheldon,"ah, the spoils. i see why victors love them."
37934,Sheldon,i should think so.
38077,Sheldon,"thank you, amy. here’s your cat. and here’s your $20."
37084,Sheldon,i refuse to sink to his level.
38467,Sheldon,"yes. this is dr. sheldon cooper. is this the zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny? sorry to bother you. hello. i’m looking for a zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny. coitus. it means intercourse. and i have a feeling i’m speaking to the right zack. this is sheldon cooper. fine. shelly. yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. no, it doesn’t bother me. yes, smelly shelly does bother me. let me tell you why i’m calling. i’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with amy farrah fowler. amy farrah fowler. yes, that is a girl’s name. good grief. it’s like trying to talk to a dolphin."
34541,Sheldon,do you realise i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call?
39692,Sheldon,"as you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. but they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. so, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. i love my mind."
45312,Sheldon,"oh, very well. what have you been working on? and feel free to honk during the boring parts."
41059,Sheldon,why would the chinese make our dvr record paul blart: mall cop?
38165,Sheldon,"as if one of the plants from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
35070,Sheldon,"that trophy is meaningless, i forfeited, therefore you did not win. "
43774,Sheldon,"oh, and forget what i said about the myanmar catfish. my list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
43084,Sheldon,why? the theory he came up with just got mentioned in scientific american. he ought to be thrilled.
40202,Sheldon,"289, right between the game show network at 288 and the east coast feed of the disney channel on 290."
45656,Sheldon,"there once was a brave lad named leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. he faced a fearsome giant, while raj just wanted to pee."
41529,Sheldon,"yes, i have. and my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
39556,Sheldon,"am i okay? leonard, i’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a nobel prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a german train schedule. am i okay?"
42078,Sheldon,i couldn’t sleep.
35318,Sheldon,sure.  i’m batman. see.
21837,Sheldon,but what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
41671,Sheldon,"no, no, no, that’s okay. i can fight my own battles. isn’t that right, bawwy."
41792,Sheldon,"because he’s not like us, penny. we’re dreamers."
36523,Sheldon,i believe it is. the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
34544,Sheldon,i don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky. 
39877,Sheldon,that my genius…
38299,Sheldon,"that was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
41893,Sheldon,i can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
40021,Sheldon,"oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
44800,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. now, do amy and i continue living together? or do i move back in with leonard?"
34635,Sheldon,"okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
34852,Sheldon,"well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. while you were sleeping i was weaving an un-unravelable web. "
34389,Sheldon,the internet’s been down for half an hour. 
39088,Sheldon,"yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. if he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines."
43444,Sheldon,do what makes her happy? she plays the harp and her car is paid for. how much happier can she be?
44836,Sheldon,"oh, i am. and you realize what the next step is?"
36128,Sheldon,all right.
42911,Sheldon,read another one.
41481,Sheldon,"now give me that cookie, i discovered an element."
38839,Sheldon,"when he finished, he shouted eureka!"
35157,Sheldon,"i didn’t say it was fascinating, i said it was noteworthy."
38576,Sheldon,"that’s all right. i can barely hear you over my theremin.  well, that was a little uncalled for."
35387,Sheldon,"well, statistically speaking…"
39056,Sheldon,no.
39708,Sheldon,"uh, can’t complain. thanks for asking. well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?"
43365,Sheldon,"oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
42061,Sheldon,but what if i’m wrong?
34580,Sheldon,"i’m confused. if there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? "
40826,Sheldon,"one game of thrones collector’s edition longclaw sword. oh, leonard and i bought that together. that’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. eh, i’ll keep it."
37881,Sheldon,yes?  peace?
39666,Sheldon,had a rough night. i thought i’d go for a walk and clear my head.
43668,Sheldon,"leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
43458,Sheldon,i’m currently single.
37303,Sheldon,"fine. good night to you, sir. miss."
37247,Sheldon,time for bed.
45021,Sheldon,you managed the situation?
35943,Sheldon,like hippies.
39087,Sheldon,"and a third person. it’s three-person chess. i must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. you should reflect on that."
40664,Sheldon,play through the pain.
42075,Sheldon,really? did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
34982,Sheldon,"but, since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless, i just have to find something else to focus on."
42531,Sheldon,interesting. you’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
39731,Sheldon,"no, can’t do it. sorry, quinto, you’re going back."
44403,Sheldon,"using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. you slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. as you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. the end."
36991,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re home. i need you to do me a favour."
38665,Sheldon,are you going to help me or not?
44258,Sheldon,"i’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time i think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and i get butterflies in my stomach. and then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…"
35297,Sheldon,"please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. "
36168,Sheldon,i know. although i’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
35513,Sheldon,"yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for penny."
41428,Sheldon,"well, then, you have my permission."
21860,Sheldon,give me that. 
36677,Sheldon,plateful.
41900,Sheldon,"you know, i’d love to, but, um, i’m too busy falling back in love with windows 98."
42297,Sheldon,of course you are.
37790,Sheldon,good. i’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. i’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. you’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. it’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
44658,Sheldon,"no, dr. feynman. if i solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
41466,Sheldon,"my point is, we’re a couple, and i like you for who you are, quirks and all."
44779,Sheldon,qu’vatlh 
43837,Sheldon,yes. she’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. i have to go.
43554,Sheldon,"but i met with 11 people, and they all walked out. and that hollywood phoney chris pratt never tweeted me back."
44567,Sheldon,"i know, i was there."
37353,Sheldon,"when albert einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
41667,Sheldon,"no, no, of course you have to publish. that’s your responsibility as a scientist. doing otherwise would be unethical. you have no choice."
43495,Sheldon,"well, that was fun. good for you, leonard."
36041,Sheldon,"your questionnaire, very disappointing."
40107,Sheldon,you make sissy on your belt buckles? mee-maw’s forks never had that.
38601,Sheldon,no.
45706,Sheldon,"if your video’s frozen, try resetting the tcp/ip stack."
37682,Sheldon,"he seems all right. although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. oh, but now that i think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
41430,Sheldon,"howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with sheldon misunderstood. that’s a dead giveaway."
40957,Sheldon,thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
35016,Sheldon,you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? would you ask picasso to play pictionary? would you ask noah webster to play boggle? would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish? 
45086,Sheldon,"of course you’re fine. not every member of a species finds a mate. sir isaac newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
42799,Sheldon,is that true?
35841,Sheldon,"look i’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. i’m out."
42461,Sheldon,i’m sure she did.
35410,Sheldon,"if you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato, or as i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology."
39711,Sheldon,where?
42615,Sheldon,"oh, everything. getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. pointing out that kings aren’t elected. it’s gonna be off the hook."
35397,Sheldon,no popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
36659,Sheldon,that’s for when i’m sick. sad is not sick.
43504,Sheldon,"leonard, don’t be fooled. i’m from texas, me-hi-co is spanish for mexico."
37976,Sheldon,thank you. they’re my mother’s.
37267,Sheldon,i’m not crazy. my mother had me tested.
39718,Sheldon,"it’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. did you?"
38061,Sheldon,"oh, that’s preposterous. i’m not pining over anyone."
45066,Sheldon,"wow, and i remember when you loved playing games with me. maybe penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
38529,Sheldon,of texas.
41585,Sheldon,"there’s nothing to tell. maybe i purchased a book entitled don’t sweat the small stuff and i followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
35132,Sheldon,"yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big. "
37212,Sheldon,"if outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
44366,Sheldon,"well, it makes perfect sense. because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. i don’t like to. you can’t have sushi. i don’t like to. you can’t go in hot tubs. i consider them vats of sweaty people soup."
43108,Sheldon,i did.
39803,Sheldon,i’m making s’mores. i wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
44886,Sheldon,"you know, i’m not sure. you know, you’d have to ask him. excuse me.  aah. leonard, i hurt myself again."
42500,Sheldon,"unlike hot tub time machine, this couldn’t be more simple. when biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which marty and doc brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. therefore, in the new timeline, marty and doc never brought the time machine…"
44155,Sheldon,but who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
42000,Sheldon, mother?
36661,Sheldon,really? did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing stolen from you?
36912,Sheldon,agreed. most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. a female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
40915,Sheldon,"yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and i found your suggestions extremely helpful."
38731,Sheldon,"okay, i see what’s happening."
43431,Sheldon,wasn’t mary magdalene a woman of ill repute?
44863,Sheldon,"i hope you’re happy making me read this. bert’s work is remarkable, and i’m more upset than ever. this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining."
39500,Sheldon,"neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
41215,Sheldon,"no, wait. perhaps i should sleep here so you don’t miss leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it."
42907,Sheldon,does it smell like blueberries?
35927,Sheldon,"leonard, there’s one more thing. under article one, section three of our roommate agreement, i’m calling an emergency meeting."
38265,Sheldon,"may i point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying maggie mcgeary, she sounds lovely."
42479,Sheldon,"oh, very much so. listen to this. this is from two days ago. hi. hope you’re having a good day. who has time for this constant sexting?"
38315,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i don’t recall you saying no backsies.
35729,Sheldon,"more pad thai, please."
43508,Sheldon,"how can you be sure? vhs was king when feynman drove this van. for all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with jane fonda workout videos."
43337,Sheldon,did i misspeak about the ring?
35252,Sheldon,i’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
37169,Sheldon,"well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
35280,Sheldon,"well of course you don’t get it, i haven’t made it yet. you’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
43457,Sheldon,"glad you asked. as i see it, there’s a simple solution. your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. it seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. and by dally, i mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
45166,Sheldon,"okay, but this is the last time. nice try, blockheads."
43119,Sheldon,"hi. hello. oh, and a special hello to leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name."
36810,Sheldon,nailed it.
37591,Sheldon,"ah, the talking cure. classical freudian, good choice. if it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard rorschach ink blot test are a, a bat, b, a bat, c, a bat, and d, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
45030,Sheldon,"well, there’s really not much left to tell. i decided that my mother views me as a child because i never went through a rebellious phase, so, i got an earring.  and here we are."
35710,Sheldon,all right.
41816,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have the solution to our comic-con problem. we don’t need them. i’m starting my own convention."
40149,Sheldon,"well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
44825,Sheldon,"what stimulus should we introduce it to first? light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s"
35648,Sheldon,thank you.
37786,Sheldon,"in here, you’ll find emergency provisions. an eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of star trek: the original series on a high-density flash drive."
40015,Sheldon,"dr. rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. in the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go."
44198,Sheldon,you bet i did.
37803,Sheldon,"that’s preposterous. tell her, leonard."
39872,Sheldon, amy?
44055,Sheldon,"oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. i’ll get your room ready."
39723,Sheldon,"we were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and i was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, i’d be obligated to do so."
41080,Sheldon,"lucky for you, ’cause i wished you were dead."
42511,Sheldon,"wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?"
34882,Sheldon,there have been studies.
43781,Sheldon,bakersfield. i see. where has this list been all my life?
39449,Sheldon,stop talking like that. you’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
39195,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
43587,Sheldon,"en garde, leonard. prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."
38679,Sheldon,"hey, you taught me something. who would have thought it?"
39945,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
39795,Sheldon,power failure. implementing power-failure protocol.
34330,Sheldon,straightening up.
44034,Sheldon,"stuart, now."
36245,Sheldon,"he is referring, of course, to third class on indian railways’ magnificent ranakpur express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction."
44899,Sheldon,"i didn’t punch him. he turned around, and i gave him a captain kirk karate chop. i’m not even sure he knows i did it."
40645,Sheldon,i open the chest.
35515,Sheldon,"no, of course not. no, i used trickery and deceit."
43062,Sheldon,is there anything i can do to cheer you up?
43110,Sheldon,"well, i know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it."
40674,Sheldon,i’m getting three trains.
41445,Sheldon,aw. embarrassed you?
40857,Sheldon,we’re not home right now.
41198,Sheldon,thank you.
37077,Sheldon,"my pleasure, ira."
42827,Sheldon,you sounded in distress. i was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. like a murder. or spontaneous coitus with leonard.
38767,Sheldon,would you be sleeping over again this evening? because you’re welcome to.
40711,Sheldon,"oh! i see the confusion here. no, no, alex thought i was singling her out. no. i meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? even you. you’re a slave."
40669,Sheldon,santa?
42748,Sheldon,"that’s right. so stay on my good side, or i’ll get you a little something, too."
38306,Sheldon,"well, i did mention the mars rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance."
35072,Sheldon,alright that is very immature.
38586,Sheldon,is it better than your idea to move to los angeles and become a famous actress?
35331,Sheldon,"if you’ll excuse me, i’m going to pack. "
35260,Sheldon,why me? why not koothrappali or wolowitz?
36063,Sheldon,i’m making friends with this little girl. what’s your name?
45528,Sheldon,"am i? yesterday i had an air force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend raj right across the hall."
38574,Sheldon,playing the theremin.
40454,Sheldon,i can’t. losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
40183,Sheldon,"da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
35985,Sheldon,"it is, isn’t it? is it okay if i hide them in your room? the smell makes me nauseated."
38116,Sheldon,yes.
35406,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i am not going back to the renaissance fair."
39620,Sheldon,"technically, howard’s the gear head. leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
35537,Sheldon,i often forget other people have limitations. it’s so sad.
36524,Sheldon,"oh, clever! playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
44437,Sheldon,"i suppose so. but if i get out of the line, i’ll lose my spot."
39909,Sheldon,what do you propose?
40868,Sheldon,have you seen the one where lori dies?
34678,Sheldon,i’ll know. 
40215,Sheldon,"i bought you and bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. which places me in your debt and i can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man."
39623,Sheldon,"leonard, i platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
38056,Sheldon,"you don’t have to sell me on cats, leonard. i’m already a fan. all right, fellas, who’s in the mood for fancy feast? well, that’s not fancy at all."
38507,Sheldon,yes. you’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
39208,Sheldon,"hey. leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
43223,Sheldon,"it would, but you know how much i admire preparedness. how did you know we’d be in the living room?"
35677,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
42101,Sheldon,have you ever even seen a picture of tesla?
43189,Sheldon,i’ll take your word for it. i was too busy trying not to defecate.
35089,Sheldon,"then i have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. "
41019,Sheldon,even you. you’re a slave.
40688,Sheldon,"no, uh, no, i’m sorry. who’s talking about leonard and alex?"
38027,Sheldon,i brought amy here to show her some of the work i’m doing.
38503,Sheldon,don’t. he’s making our case.
39789,Sheldon,"yes. and now, i can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
39810,Sheldon,"counter-proposal. we reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of mother’s day or father’s day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. we could call it leonard’s day."
43873,Sheldon,"well, i said a chance, you know. when you tell them it’s your birthday at bennigan’s, they make a fuss. i don’t see why the philharmonic would be any different."
44045,Sheldon,"oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. no, i had my sister slip it in her bag so that i can track her like a sea turtle."
37580,Sheldon,don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
44738,Sheldon,"no, i mean it. i mean it. it’s like you have the soul of a label maker."
44704,Sheldon,"well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
38200,Sheldon,you might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
37456,Sheldon,so you betrayed me?
38592,Sheldon,real cocoa?
36847,Sheldon, raj.
43316,Sheldon,"oh, thank you, mother."
38772,Sheldon,"that’s remarkable. if pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace german shepherds at our nation’s airports."
42494,Sheldon,"if we could figure out the scientific basis for marty’s hover board, that would have universal application."
44388,Sheldon,"when i was five, i ingested a z gauge locomotive. i spent the next three days saying, i think i can pass it, i think i can pass it, i think i can pass it."
40656,Sheldon,what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
39271,Sheldon,cholera is water-borne. you’re mocking me.
41302,Sheldon,leonard?
40794,Sheldon,"i’ll do what i can. but it’s not going to be easy, because when i’m with amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic"
41126,Sheldon,name it.
34496,Sheldon,i got my job back.
37422,Sheldon,"oh, good. bye-bye."
35125,Sheldon,"what’s the number, i’ll match it. "
42773,Sheldon,"and since you’re green this time, i can be it next time."
43824,Sheldon,"dear crazy future sheldon, this is a thermostat. it controls the temperature of the apartment. the ideal setting is 72 degrees. if you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. a straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. now, this is your spot. you’re very protective of it. when anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. it sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. people are also delighted by your love of pranks. for example, leonard has no idea what i did to his coffee. it wasn’t replace it with folger’s crystals, i’ll tell you that much."
41556,Sheldon,can i invite you in for tea?
39361,Sheldon,"oh, good. you picked me, you picked me."
42802,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, too. and if you want to live with penny, then i think you should."
34533,Sheldon,cool?
37552,Sheldon,"i was valedictorian and expected to give an address. even now, i can remember that moment when i walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. there must have been thousands of people. my heart started pounding in my chest. i began to hyperventilate. my vision became blurry, and before i knew it… oh, dear. "
40245,Sheldon,"all right. please. amy, when i look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because i feel stronger and weaker at the same time. i feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. the truth is, i don’t know what i feel, except i know what kind of man i want to be."
41966,Sheldon,oh. yay.
44498,Sheldon,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
38985,Sheldon,hey.
38134,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll bow to social pressure. hey!"
41526,Sheldon,and to think i idolized that man. and why? at the end of the day he’s just another hollywood phony.
42214,Sheldon,you’re back.
41860,Sheldon,"oh, my. well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
41961,Sheldon,"leonard, would you wrap it up? we’re waiting on you."
34248,Sheldon,i resent you saying we don’t have company.
40098,Sheldon,"hey, fellas, i’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
44280,Sheldon,"well, how would i know?"
38896,Sheldon,"that’s from avatar, world of warcraft takes place in azeroth. goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
36546,Sheldon,it won’t work. no way to mount it.
40316,Sheldon,"no, that’s my potty training journal."
38498,Sheldon,we’re going to be late. i’m pacing nervously.
41163,Sheldon,and now what?
39715,Sheldon,seems unlikely. did you bring your asthma inhaler?
43432,Sheldon,"wow. well, marriage must agree with you. well, you are just glowing."
45712,Sheldon,she sounds weepy. i don’t like weepy. let’s go.
37377,Sheldon,nope.
39247,Sheldon,i’ve been sitting in garbage!
41809,Sheldon,no.
43740,Sheldon,"all i’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. she should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight."
39791,Sheldon,‘sup?
40166,Sheldon,"yes, of course that’s why it’s tight."
45074,Sheldon,"very well. hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, i’ll show you how godzilla gets drunk."
36566,Sheldon,do you remember the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic north pole?
41547,Sheldon,"no, i said you were teaching someone a lesson. now let’s go."
36079,Sheldon,"yeah, i don’t think i can."
38717,Sheldon,ugh!
34985,Sheldon,"oh, sure you do. now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
41489,Sheldon,"amy, i was off by a factor of 10,000. "
45762,Sheldon,"hello, mother."
35682,Sheldon,"oh, great. she’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
45434,Sheldon,"bert, rebecca. i’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
38390,Sheldon,no!
37165,Sheldon,"december 25, 1642, julian calendar, sir isaac newton is born. jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. his birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
45441,Sheldon,your first date? did you even measure her walls?
41415,Sheldon,"not as relieved as i’m about to be. it’s a brave new world, little lady."
40970,Sheldon,"uh, just a couple more items. howard, i found this letter from your dad in a box. now, based on the content, it could either be filed…"
41501,Sheldon,the national science foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
36137,Sheldon,"leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
43957,Sheldon,"well, it took a little negotiating, but i wore him down. uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and i have children, they all have to be named rajesh."
40980,Sheldon,"well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. you know. that doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and i’m a trash can full of sweets."
37616,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, i’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. you bowl like your mama. unless, of course, she bowls well. in which case, you bowl nothing like her."
40416,Sheldon,it was a compromise. i lost.
45371,Sheldon,"oh, i had an accident at work, i slipped and fell on my soup sack."
45197,Sheldon,"oh. well, now i’m sorry i asked."
42659,Sheldon,"i don’t know, i’m smart and scrappy, i think i’d find a way."
40218,Sheldon,"would you like some aloe vera? you just got burned. all right, my turn. howard, bernadette. daq tu’ tah daq yin tlhej ghajtah."
35910,Sheldon,"fyi, i was defrosting a steak in there."
40880,Sheldon,but she’s got google maps on her phone.
40361,Sheldon,it’s a quark-gluon plasma.
42640,Sheldon,very well. i’m done talking about it.
35399,Sheldon,what do they have?
37232,Sheldon,i’m sheldon. how do you do?
38556,Sheldon,"when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
43188,Sheldon,see?
37229,Sheldon,okay. what is your game?
37583,Sheldon,hmm. . this is pretty sharp.
35752,Sheldon,you and i have a standing tv schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
34705,Sheldon,you seemed confused.
45294,Sheldon,"beverley, you know i hold you in high esteem. can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
35634,Sheldon,no.
37091,Sheldon,"mountain dew. ah, refreshing. now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
39099,Sheldon,"then as a mental exercise i invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. can you believe this guy? social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
40304,Sheldon,"all right then, so we’re all on the same page. yes."
34278,Sheldon,"leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a tv. "
34228,Sheldon,to what end?
40205,Sheldon,"thank you for the invitation, but i have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something i’ll enjoy."
37234,Sheldon,hello.
45608,Sheldon,oh boy.
38695,Sheldon,very well. i’ll set the scene.
21856,Sheldon,won’t work.
42602,Sheldon,"next time i might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank."
41472,Sheldon,"ooh, somebody call the burn ward. and back to the zone."
43536,Sheldon,"you know what they don’t sell at the container store? something large enough to contain my disappointment. although, if anyone did, it would be them."
38865,Sheldon,as you wish.  did you pick one?
37829,Sheldon,"i wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. although, i suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
43376,Sheldon,things are good right now.
40301,Sheldon,please don’t hurt my friend.
34470,Sheldon,it’s an experiment. 
38088,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous.
35723,Sheldon,"oh, you want me to share credit?"
43063,Sheldon,what if i play the star trek theme on my nose?
41069,Sheldon,"yeah, but i just told you, i don’t have a problem with closure."
43192,Sheldon,"it was. and even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the tasing. no, i got nothing."
37236,Sheldon,thank you. have you chosen one to copulate with?
38848,Sheldon,"yes, please. your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered."
42207,Sheldon,"of course, my grandfather died when i was five. my father died when i was 14."
41944,Sheldon,"yes, and hawkeye’s in the avengers, but no one ever says help, hawkeye."
34370,Sheldon,and if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. 
43073,Sheldon,okay. does that planet have to be earth?
38324,Sheldon,"yes, but before you get upset, i want you to know i went to the fbi and retracted my statement."
45812,Sheldon,he’s a lamb. you’re not.
40796,Sheldon,of course.
38409,Sheldon,"if it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
37930,Sheldon,although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
43532,Sheldon,"age is a state of mind, leonard. in here i’m 90. why are you taking your bins over there?"
38488,Sheldon,"in the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
38181,Sheldon,of course. would you like to join me for chinese food?
45242,Sheldon,"i should hope so. when she called me an insensitive jerk, i’d like to think she meant it."
36067,Sheldon,"see, my initial approach to kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued stu the cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
37876,Sheldon,"today, it’s a chinese food retrieval robot. tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill sarah connor."
35574,Sheldon,"good morning, leonard."
37272,Sheldon,"oh, how i wish i could."
41923,Sheldon,"wait, wait, now, hang on. you think he manipulates me?"
37769,Sheldon,i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
38036,Sheldon,amen to that.
38033,Sheldon,i agree. i move our relationship terminate immediately.
45326,Sheldon,"okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, i have the final say. in matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. unless i disagree. oh, here. number two, when we publish,"
42552,Sheldon,please keep this channel clear for emergencies. thank you.
44046,Sheldon,"uh, for the hundredth time, i smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart."
40589,Sheldon,"yes. according to information i gleaned from yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. i believe i may have a similar problem. this cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle."
37293,Sheldon,"what if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
37748,Sheldon,"thank you, penny."
37050,Sheldon,"cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. okay, medical history. have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
37274,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
35238,Sheldon,"okay, we don’t have that in stock, but i can special order it for you."
42100,Sheldon,don’t feel bad. neither does he.
44950,Sheldon,"leonard, i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
44526,Sheldon,"well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
44573,Sheldon,i had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
41473,Sheldon,zone.
36028,Sheldon,"hey it’s true, kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that i need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
38392,Sheldon,you know what? i’m going back to i told you so. i told you so.
38589,Sheldon,"oh, penny, where do i begin? the simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
36472,Sheldon,"thank you. hello, neighbour."
37619,Sheldon,"we would indeed. in this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
37058,Sheldon,"possible tourette’s. all right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. soup tattoo on right buttock."
42190,Sheldon,"okay, here we go. episode i: the phantom menace."
45810,Sheldon,"you think you have me stymied, don’t you?"
39637,Sheldon,"as a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. i said it would be nice, i didn’t say we should do it."
40052,Sheldon,"no. if i got on the bridge of the enterprise, i would never, ever leave."
37038,Sheldon,where is the passenger side mirror?
36943,Sheldon,"you’re a natural at this, penny. and as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday."
42540,Sheldon,"uh, let’s see. 704? no, wait, it’s on clock. uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees."
34297,Sheldon,not to mention imaginary.
39112,Sheldon,"they sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
39078,Sheldon,i suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
39943,Sheldon,"i can’t help it, i feel like a teen heartthrob."
42400,Sheldon,young’s modulus.
45691,Sheldon,"the stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of texas."
42927,Sheldon,"i told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere."
43147,Sheldon,"i suppose it is. in fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, i’d be okay with that."
36031,Sheldon,"really? that seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. why don’t you take some time to reconsider?"
39686,Sheldon,nonsense. i look like a train conductor. under what pretext did you lure her here?
41178,Sheldon,great. i’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
41384,Sheldon,"oh, i see your confusion. you don’t understand. indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
40914,Sheldon,"well, i was thinking about you helping me out last night  penny."
42750,Sheldon,"hmm. let’s see, what do i know about amy? she loves medieval literature, chaucer’s her favourite. and her eyes sparkle when she watches old french movies. i enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along."
40473,Sheldon,"well, you’re my girlfriend and i don’t want you to be upset. then again, wil wheaton’s my friend and i don’t want him to be upset. hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  what do you think?"
34277,Sheldon,so we get to have a scene with him?
44850,Sheldon,"you guys are aroused, right?"
37978,Sheldon,what about your pedometer?
36908,Sheldon,"you’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
44265,Sheldon,what good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
38350,Sheldon,"howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?"
45427,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
40510,Sheldon,just tea. s’the best tea i’ve ever had.
41434,Sheldon,hello.
34252,Sheldon,you’re lactose intolerant. 
34675,Sheldon,"have you seen penny eat chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. "
36174,Sheldon,"it’s surprising because i generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
42756,Sheldon,"uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?"
43902,Sheldon,why are you shaking? are you cold?
39526,Sheldon,this would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
41070,Sheldon,"oh, quite sure.  that proves nothing."
42650,Sheldon,"remember when i said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
43143,Sheldon,"i’ll begin. uh, i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
40372,Sheldon,lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
36763,Sheldon,"easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. we then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. next we look at…"
42568,Sheldon,his statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
35766,Sheldon,you’re sitting in my spot.
36666,Sheldon,it’s going to take more than i’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
37476,Sheldon,maybe you should put on your juicy pants again.
38323,Sheldon,howard. the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
34657,Sheldon,"every saturday since we have lived in this apartment, i have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on bbc america and watched doctor who. "
42040,Sheldon,"no, see? well, you absolutely would not. and furthermore, the xbox one now comes with a kinect included."
21818,Sheldon,"when you have to? i’m sorry, i don’t rent to hippies."
36830,Sheldon,top desk drawer.
36833,Sheldon,of course i understand. and who are you to tell me about outer space?
44977,Sheldon,wowza.
45215,Sheldon,"no, you didn’t. but keep in mind, i felt extremely important."
36066,Sheldon,oh good! you’re just in time. i believe i’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
41389,Sheldon,"and i think i’ve got it. consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. why do they keep him?"
43961,Sheldon,"my fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a yosemite waterfall."
36611,Sheldon,it’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
41772,Sheldon,no. i was just tricking you.
41955,Sheldon,thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
37445,Sheldon,there’s neosporin and band-aids in my top desk drawer.
36198,Sheldon,i’m not unhappy.
34758,Sheldon,i know. i read it before i threw it out. 
43762,Sheldon,yes.
45133,Sheldon,"oh. well, i thought we were going in order."
41167,Sheldon,"well, no. hold on. my elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. we wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through."
37971,Sheldon,"so this is how it ends, with cruel irony. just as i make the commitment to preserving my body, i am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. do you know the original purpose of the appendix, leonard?"
41912,Sheldon,okay. i think we’ve found the problem here. it’s not the table at all. it’s you.
38239,Sheldon,and raj.
42915,Sheldon,he just left another comment.
45142,Sheldon,"shame on you. where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? i’ll tell you. we would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics."
38854,Sheldon,fine. give me a second.
39629,Sheldon,"oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
36095,Sheldon,the problem appears to be unsolvable.
36294,Sheldon,you have to sign this.
41157,Sheldon,"oh, then i’m out."
38171,Sheldon,darn! she found me!
44404,Sheldon,"oh, the fun doesn’t stop. you’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
42524,Sheldon,i miss the old days when i couldn’t tell.
38329,Sheldon,hello.
36942,Sheldon,oh! great roll! now you can demolish your soviet-style cyclotron and build the large hadron collider.
40665,Sheldon,"but first, i cast a spell of paralysis on stuart and howard."
41875,Sheldon,i never want this day to end.
41511,Sheldon,you distract me. i’ve been distracted since the moment i met you. 
37226,Sheldon,but she’s female. isn’t that the game?
34581,Sheldon,telepathically?
45614,Sheldon,"i’m not staring, i’m mulling."
34520,Sheldon,"yes, but i was eleven."
42658,Sheldon,you know who else said that? every cocky t. rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
44518,Sheldon,"well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. i mean, look at us. we took things remarkably slow. you and i, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
41572,Sheldon,you wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way i feel.
35067,Sheldon,that’s your opinion.
34191,Sheldon,thank you very much.
39397,Sheldon,"it is nice, isn’t it?"
40263,Sheldon,equally ridiculous. let’s go.
37385,Sheldon,in switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
44913,Sheldon,"yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, i can hang it right now."
39908,Sheldon,"use the force, sheldon. use the force.  i’m gonna need more force."
38585,Sheldon,with you?
40278,Sheldon,i can’t tell you why i can’t tell you. so i guess there’s two things i can’t tell you.
37284,Sheldon,"it’s not what i want, it’s what evolution wants. human beings are primates. primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
41697,Sheldon,"no, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the stone age and a cave wasn’t available."
34332,Sheldon,"because it was immaculate, i mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
34627,Sheldon,oh good grief.
43515,Sheldon,leonard?
42708,Sheldon,"crikey, what flag do we have today?"
35223,Sheldon,because of the two additional ethernet ports.
21854,Sheldon,why not?
35440,Sheldon,alright then.  
42696,Sheldon,"oh, i ordered it before your surgery. it’s the urn i was going to put you in."
43359,Sheldon,yes.
37474,Sheldon,"there’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
34878,Sheldon,"subtextually, of course.  morning penny."
42201,Sheldon,be careful with that.
42950,Sheldon,"well, it would be, except that i left string theory because i decided it was a dead end. yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. my rival, no less. i’m sorry you had to see that."
40866,Sheldon,"well, the evidence does support that."
35209,Sheldon,"possibly, but unverified."
41951,Sheldon,very well. how do you propose we move forward?
42960,Sheldon,how does that work?
38016,Sheldon,it’s how they lure you in. i believe it’s called bait and switch.
38308,Sheldon,interesting. so you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
39408,Sheldon,"well, i’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
39052,Sheldon,thank you. may i share something with you that’s troubling me?
41480,Sheldon,"oh, more testing, more success, more fame. yeah, but don’t worry, i will remain the same down-to-earth humble joe i’ve always been."
37244,Sheldon,hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
43999,Sheldon,i want you to know that that is sincere. i do feel bad. i’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
39955,Sheldon,"no, i’m not all right. it’s been six days since i was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
44144,Sheldon,"just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? i suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? you know, the answer, it may surprise you."
37702,Sheldon,"all right, say hello to your mother for me."
38208,Sheldon,"hold on. i have to figure out how to get the bucket, so i can carry the mud past the dragon."
45709,Sheldon,me neither.
36291,Sheldon,it’s eleven am.
45278,Sheldon,"i realize it’s irrational, but with raj moving in there, i’m feeling a bit replaced."
42853,Sheldon,"yeah, well, then do it."
35102,Sheldon,"if i remember correctly, captain kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stardate 5027.3, which will be january 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
40196,Sheldon,i know. and it gets worse. her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
35659,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i know that now."
40294,Sheldon,"yeah. did you know that while leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s north korea, he’s downright average. hey, talk about a keeper."
41994,Sheldon,"i have to. how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i don’t tell her how disappointed i am, and that i’ll never forgive her?"
43254,Sheldon,"you didn’t let me finish. and also regarding the bat, it has sonar."
40317,Sheldon,yeah. and forgive my crude penmanship. i didn’t start typing until i was six.
39093,Sheldon,"blue, as in depressed."
37830,Sheldon,i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
40933,Sheldon,"it’s about streetcars? oh, great. i won’t need this. "
35741,Sheldon,"all right, pencils down! i have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. anybody got those?"
37826,Sheldon,"leonard, leonard. what is that? what is that?"
36189,Sheldon,"the mrow, that sounded to me like an african civet cat."
36228,Sheldon,"stop. we can’t do this, it’s not right."
42179,Sheldon,"but, that’s star wars day."
45284,Sheldon,"well, i had some of my best ideas in that room, and i’m sure you will, too."
41485,Sheldon,this is the very copy of the handbook of chemistry and physics in which i looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
21849,Sheldon,and i said yes. and i settle all ties. change seats with me.
34588,Sheldon,"oh, i hardly think so. "
41023,Sheldon,the tragic history of slavery in america. fun for the whole family.
35002,Sheldon,"no, no, please, come in. yeah, i think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting."
38631,Sheldon,although road trip god does have a certain ring to it.
43869,Sheldon,keep it up. i got nowhere else to be.
38309,Sheldon,excuse me?
35849,Sheldon,her name is dr. stephanie barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.
40753,Sheldon,"well, i say that’s the last time we ever go outside."
45732,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in bed?"
44623,Sheldon,"well, now, don’t be surprised if, like star trek, it’s cancelled in three."
36786,Sheldon,come again?
40521,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
44424,Sheldon,creepy old dude from dancing with the stars.
35086,Sheldon,"i’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? "
40809,Sheldon,toys? i do have a model rocket next to my bed.
38803,Sheldon,"yeah, right on, man. right on. oh, look, it’s harry potter and 98% of the sorcerer’s stone."
43357,Sheldon,been there.
39069,Sheldon,eight.
34199,Sheldon,"so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. if it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
41889,Sheldon,it was wonderful. 
42388,Sheldon,what are you doing?
35621,Sheldon,department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? but i don’t have a problem.
41776,Sheldon,but.
38538,Sheldon,"leonard, please, we can talk during our break. we have one coming up at midnight. we’ll need snacks."
37401,Sheldon,very well.
41220,Sheldon,"penny, did you ever wonder how starfleet captains…"
42363,Sheldon,"no, it’s fine. now i can devote all my time to dark matter."
43271,Sheldon,"leonard, who’s really in charge? the person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
41779,Sheldon,leonard told me to stay.
43908,Sheldon,"oh. it was amazing. i, i saw it a few days later. what a movie."
45190,Sheldon,not at all. amy?
43270,Sheldon,"i sure did. oh, my goodness. well, from jabba’s head to ice cream with darth vader, i’m having a heck of a ride. yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when i’m in charge. now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
45241,Sheldon,"i’m always honest with amy. the other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and i said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. when there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
42275,Sheldon,what happened?
39894,Sheldon,you’re in my spot.
42878,Sheldon,"and then she threw me out. me, her very own boyfriend. when all i’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in."
36181,Sheldon,"the pharmacology department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids."
38252,Sheldon,"you’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, i am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so i’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. you couldn’t have spent last night with priya, because you were with another woman."
41185,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll do it."
35375,Sheldon,oh no.
40983,Sheldon,"well played. sometimes i don’t give you enough credit, penny."
40820,Sheldon,where are you going?
45793,Sheldon,"very well. i don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like knight rider."
39961,Sheldon,"hello, leonard, do you like my bongos? bet you didn’t know that i had bongos."
41005,Sheldon,"if i could keep my gmail account, i’d be okay with that."
37763,Sheldon,"a, i rarely kid. and b, when i do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
43885,Sheldon,"this is an important night for us, and i’m worried i might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
38521,Sheldon,we’re the justice league of america. there’s only one thing we can do. turn around and slowly walk away.
42473,Sheldon,"well, i guess it was too good to be true."
41102,Sheldon,"professor proton, it’s an honour to meet you."
44557,Sheldon,why would your bernadette thing make me feel better? at least mine was educational.
40843,Sheldon,um…
36430,Sheldon,a far less impressive feat.
34326,Sheldon,"a little messy? the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. i’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale. "
41148,Sheldon,i ready my quarter-staff.
39761,Sheldon,"all righty! an 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. the streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. oh, excellent choice. now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
44745,Sheldon,hit it.
34608,Sheldon,"because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be the flash. "
37743,Sheldon,"and now, as promised, the tangent. sheldon and the hell hound, or how i lost my hot dogs."
42654,Sheldon,fine. what about epilepsy?
45335,Sheldon,"biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. oh, i know what i want my treat to be."
42349,Sheldon,"wow. pouting and running away actually worked. i must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. so, um, what is the solution?"
39206,Sheldon,"no, you weren’t listening. she said, it’s not what it looks like."
44335,Sheldon,"tonight i’ll be watching a show rated m.a., and that stands for mature audiences, buster."
34388,Sheldon,"well, no."
44352,Sheldon,now it’s a fun fact.
42876,Sheldon,"hmm, perhaps. but i’m not taking the cap off."
41885,Sheldon,"let’s see. what’s next? oh, kissing’s romantic."
38421,Sheldon,clarify something for me. isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? an opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
36574,Sheldon,listen to you. how can i possibly go?
44169,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. i, i’d like to apologize for my behaviour. i hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. so, please, enjoy yourselves. oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
45463,Sheldon,boy teenagers.
42641,Sheldon,i believe it was your turn in the game.
38632,Sheldon,please tell me you’re not having coitus.
41948,Sheldon,"in any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. to this day, i still get a monthly copy of granny on granny. which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth."
44543,Sheldon,"this must be how you practice law in boca raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say."
43472,Sheldon,"we made one heck of a team, huh?"
44047,Sheldon,meemaw. i’m so happy to see you.
43694,Sheldon,"dr. sheldon cooper, theoretical physicist, caltech."
45458,Sheldon,"no, but it’s not just video games. i downloaded the new o.s. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
44305,Sheldon,"well, i’m not proud of it, but i jaywalked."
36221,Sheldon,leonard?
34628,Sheldon,"and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing halo. "
34364,Sheldon,check.
36911,Sheldon,"well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
40984,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. if i was prone to sarcasm, i’d say i was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets."
37178,Sheldon,it’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. we discussed it at length during our last video chat. although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
39484,Sheldon,"the telephone. you know, leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. voice mail. curiouser and curiouser."
40486,Sheldon,"you’ll appreciate this. leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. tell him you’re not mad at me. go ahead, set him straight."
41336,Sheldon,"and i’m glad you and i are friends again, too."
43537,Sheldon,thank you for letting me come speak with you.
35364,Sheldon,"i know, most of your work is extremely derivative. don’t worry, that’s not a secret. everybody knows. "
38712,Sheldon,"that depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
44577,Sheldon,"huh, what?"
37105,Sheldon,"oh, sure. and while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
40158,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. . as is the tradition, i have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at howard’s expense. prepare to have your ribs tickled. howard, i always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. am i right? let’s see here. oh, seriously though, howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people i know. and that’s a zinger, because you’re not. i’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which i don’t see as likely. hacha! okay, let me see here. okay, kidding aside, howard, you are a good friend. and i wish you nothing but happiness. bazinga, i don’t!"
34327,Sheldon,no.
43574,Sheldon,interesting. sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. and i would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
41025,Sheldon,"because you want to start watching it right now. copy that. let’s see. up next on the tenure committee is professor wu. well, get ready for the complete works of jackie chan."
34909,Sheldon,on sunday? 
35471,Sheldon,that girl needs to get a life.
38654,Sheldon,"hmm, no. one slip of the hand, and suddenly i’m sitting in the engineering department, building doodads with wolowitz."
38505,Sheldon,"i’m the flash. i just knocked 30,000 times."
38320,Sheldon,raj. have you seen howard?
34649,Sheldon,"he’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. it’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and i do not appreciate it. "
42295,Sheldon,i will.
34969,Sheldon,get him out. 
40172,Sheldon,keys! keys! keys!
40801,Sheldon,it’s a possibility.
40925,Sheldon,"yeah, but now, wait. do whatever i want? or whatever i have to want?"
40758,Sheldon,would it come with kung-fu grip?
35161,Sheldon,"i don’t understand. yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways. "
37634,Sheldon,"if you were a cat, i would have brought you a lasagna."
40807,Sheldon,i was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
37932,Sheldon,"so we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. let’s round that up to 31."
41184,Sheldon,"oh, gee, i don’t know. my schedule’s a little busy."
41115,Sheldon,"mr. jeffries, i need to show you something. :14:11,446"
45417,Sheldon,"so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. how, howard, flashback sounds."
44711,Sheldon,"we have people over all the time. we have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that ups driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
41934,Sheldon,um.
43797,Sheldon,"it’s called food, friend, fight. one of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle."
43556,Sheldon,"they didn’t used to be. you and leonard and penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. i was like the tin man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."
40428,Sheldon,"amy. why would you give me a word? now, if i play extract it would be cheating."
34224,Sheldon,we never invited louis-slash-louise over.
41876,Sheldon,come on.
44186,Sheldon,get a load of this guy.
40041,Sheldon,spock?
40831,Sheldon,wait. here who is where?
43939,Sheldon,"yeah, me, too. i was stuck for a metaphor."
41483,Sheldon,"and that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in physics today? i’ll give you a hint. you measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
44094,Sheldon,"allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. uh, uh, yes, i really am a doctor. uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend."
38925,Sheldon,"sea world is better. it has shamu, who is literally tons of fun. but for the moment, let’s stay focused on todd zarnecki."
39255,Sheldon,really?
38784,Sheldon,"un momento. oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid.  where are you going?"
39072,Sheldon,two.
43430,Sheldon,"then no, thank you."
34345,Sheldon,i am not leaving until i’m done.
42311,Sheldon,"you know, sherlock holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. but i’m sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick."
42211,Sheldon,i do. after i make them go back and watch one through five first.
36745,Sheldon,hardly.
40450,Sheldon,no. it would appear as if i’ve lost him. stupid brain.
34501,Sheldon,"we don’t eat here, i don’t know what’s good."
43320,Sheldon,"of course not. i love you. i’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say."
43687,Sheldon,absolutely. but don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
37917,Sheldon,don’t bother. i’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
34387,Sheldon,of course not. 
45287,Sheldon,"i know, i know, good grief was originally said by charlie brown, geez."
36693,Sheldon,why? why would we change? we had a perfectly good palace. tandoori palace is our palace.
35591,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i didn’t realize i was interrupting your morning prayers. when you’re done, we’ll go."
42358,Sheldon,"yeah, well, of course i do. listen to it. it’s like an earful of melted caramel."
43573,Sheldon,"had me at flag, lost me at football."
36731,Sheldon,"well, apparently, i was wrong. congratulations."
39431,Sheldon,"well, i know, but he means well. sing."
38387,Sheldon,"listen to what mr. wil wheaton is tweeting. best seats in house for raiders screening. suck on that, sheldon cooper."
37836,Sheldon,well it’s not a great question. how could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? that’s a great question.
42858,Sheldon,"well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. you know, who has the best cervix. which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
36683,Sheldon,"evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
37090,Sheldon,"all right, how’s this for revenge? a solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
36050,Sheldon,the skills are transferrable. i just have no interest in going in the water.
37800,Sheldon,"leonard, penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
34989,Sheldon,alright.
41047,Sheldon,"i don’t know what you’re doing, but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with raj’s mother for a dollar."
45431,Sheldon,is she a geologist?
41824,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
41183,Sheldon,"leonard, you’re being selfish. we need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
37535,Sheldon,"oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. i have to pee."
40899,Sheldon,"so, penny, i understand you would like to learn more about flags."
40488,Sheldon,"precisely, i didn’t do anything. now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?"
40752,Sheldon,"yeah, well, we’re not. we’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. and to tell you the truth, i’m starting to feel like one. i want to go home now."
36046,Sheldon,what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
35428,Sheldon,"oh mario. if only i could control everyone the way i control you. hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
41550,Sheldon,i’ll get leonard.
44822,Sheldon,"oh, just let me look. oh, my goodness. i see quivering black lines. those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful."
41323,Sheldon,hello. so i guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
40583,Sheldon,"oh, of course, come in.  this is an authentic chinese throwing star, and i must warn you, i have seen many people throw them in movies."
40759,Sheldon,don’t waste my time.
39857,Sheldon,"aw, nuts! one…"
34312,Sheldon,"uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells."
45725,Sheldon,this is dr. sheldon cooper. experimental log. wormhole generator test forty-four.
35813,Sheldon,you brought a girl to the mars rover control room?
44431,Sheldon,"stuart, what are you doing here?"
36932,Sheldon,what’s funny about cylon toast?
43793,Sheldon,i believe you. i’d believe you more if you threw a few apple jacks in here.
43407,Sheldon,"the lord of the rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. i made you watch that, you said it was an eternity."
35497,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah, enough debate, i’m going to take action.  excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
39504,Sheldon,"you clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! you make them apologize to amy and set things right. i am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
41971,Sheldon,why are you getting annoyed?
41812,Sheldon,"oh, sunday’s the worst. everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only t-shirts they have left are small and xxxxl."
42262,Sheldon,"well, then, i’m all out of guesses. what? me move across the hall. why would you even suggest such a thing?"
40561,Sheldon,"well, i’m not giving it away. "
38994,Sheldon,pun intended?
35586,Sheldon,leonard’s asleep.
37083,Sheldon,did you laugh?
38391,Sheldon,this is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
39225,Sheldon,"excuse me. it’s major sheldon cooper. with my last breath, i awarded myself a battlefield promotion. it’s kind of a big deal."
35302,Sheldon,"oh. well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a phd in french literature. "
41199,Sheldon,it did not kill me when you went to space. monkeys went to space.
44865,Sheldon,that’s a good idea. i guess everyone’s having them now.
40404,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. the dishes themselves are in no way halloweenie."
35372,Sheldon,i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
45781,Sheldon,"amy, quick, lock the door."
40141,Sheldon,what do you mean wrong?
34493,Sheldon,wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
36741,Sheldon,hello.
42368,Sheldon,how would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
35298,Sheldon,"oh, hi penny. fyi, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so i’d avoid using that for your delicates. "
42103,Sheldon,she’s right. i’m too hot.
38692,Sheldon,"now, in this pivotal scene, sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the united federation of planets, mr. spock, the role i will bring to life."
42272,Sheldon,"no. here’s a thought. you’re not moving in, leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. and by the way, i saw you make this strawberry quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder."
44262,Sheldon,like what?
44181,Sheldon,"oh, you’re singing. well, i’m sorry."
42235,Sheldon,have you had intercourse?
43296,Sheldon,"well, don’t worry. he went to mit. he can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a russian man’s colon."
36257,Sheldon,you don’t understand. my flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of m-theory effects in the early universe that i was going to give to george smoot at the conference.
34547,Sheldon,"you know, i think i may have misjudged this restaurant. "
41037,Sheldon,you’re here.
40023,Sheldon,"yeah, i hate wedding receptions. i wish the bride and groom would take a cue from bilbo baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
40691,Sheldon,"well, what should i do?"
39256,Sheldon,it certainly looks okay. has a strong toxic chemical smell. that’s reassuring.
41016,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not do cozy.
21842,Sheldon,"i assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an ipod when microsoft comes out with theirs."
43204,Sheldon,"you know what? i used to be a fan of evolution, but i’ve since evolved, and now i think it’s dumb."
45088,Sheldon,what? he said he was fine.
43597,Sheldon,how dare you.
36793,Sheldon,"yes. since their relationship became carnal, penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
43720,Sheldon,"because when i speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that i’ve put this amy nonsense behind me."
37495,Sheldon,"no, no. i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to have gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime. the moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
45590,Sheldon,of course.
43269,Sheldon,"oh, i recommend that, too. that was a magical experience."
34876,Sheldon,"well, you see, while leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
45259,Sheldon,not necessarily. i have four months to find some new friends.
41972,Sheldon,like when?
35039,Sheldon,why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
37883,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
45462,Sheldon,at the hands of those teenagers.
41190,Sheldon,i’m not jealous. i’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
37868,Sheldon,curse you.
43378,Sheldon,seriously? airborne worms?
44490,Sheldon,i don’t like this at all.
9279,Howard,do you really think you should be drinking right now?
11461,Howard,so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny?
9870,Howard,of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
7127,Howard,really?
6735,Howard,i don’t know what you’re talking about.
11449,Howard,you’re right. it sells itself.
9190,Howard,give me back my iron man helmet.
6697,Howard,that’s what they said to neil armstrong about the moon.
6341,Howard,that’s a negatory. but there’s a planet of the apes marathon at the new art today. 
6780,Howard,that doesn’t count. do over! do over!
10703,Howard,ha-ha.
11045,Howard,no.
9936,Howard,"but it got the way it was through change. the-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. i bought this couch. me. so explain why that change was bad and this change was good."
9124,Howard,do you expect me to build this?
7555,Howard,"oh, that’s perfect. bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating."
9424,Howard,"hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. this isn’t sex."
11236,Howard,"yeah. cap’n crunch with crunch berries, move on."
11686,Howard,thank you.
9720,Howard,nope. bernadette told me it isn’t nice and i’m not allowed.
10759,Howard,and i wish leonard never told me. he’s the bad guy here.
8549,Howard,wild west and witches? what kind of loser cares about a showdown between billy the kid and the white wizard of the north?
8443,Howard,he’ll text you.
11941,Howard,"okay, the good news is, we have a wonder woman."
7928,Howard,didn’t see it? what were you doing?
8760,Howard,"no, you said, would it help if i said i’m sorry?"
11693,Howard,"hang on. bernie, can i outsource my chores to an indian guy?"
8446,Howard,really? that’s the first thing you want to say?
9764,Howard,"um, i don’t know. probably in a wad in her cheek."
10797,Howard,how could archie defeat predator?
11974,Howard,"if i didn’t have you, life would be blue, i’d be dr. who without the tardis."
7998,Howard,nope. he’s gone.
10752,Howard,i did.
11329,Howard,i was counting on that money. i need to make as much as my wife so i don’t have to try so hard in bed.
10442,Howard,no. i need to do it. this is on me.
11822,Howard,"she didn’t say much of anything. but she said a lot.  hi, bernadette, remember me?"
10285,Howard,also mine.
9770,Howard,what’s with you?
6214,Howard,"have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
9598,Howard,"yeah, they kind of do."
11570,Howard,"not me, paternity leave."
8470,Howard,"yeah, this is a bad idea. we should go."
11808,Howard,"okay, well, how about, oh, i teach you some close-up magic."
10485,Howard,"okay, we’ll do it."
9058,Howard,fine.
9011,Howard,"ma, who is in there?"
7205,Howard,you’re such a girl. they’re just bugs.
10264,Howard,"i get that. i, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. it was one of the few things we did together."
9205,Howard,"all right. sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, i had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…"
10407,Howard,"oh, yeah."
11813,Howard,no.
9907,Howard,you okay?
11424,Howard,"it’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know."
7225,Howard,"yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
10648,Howard,"well, raj and i always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so i taught myself and i’m putting this on instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. say cheese."
11824,Howard,"well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
8100,Howard,"i’m just thinking. if you had sex with that guy, i mean, there’s nothing i can do here that will make any kind of impact."
11276,Howard,yeah. he still has an aol address.
10277,Howard,it wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
9837,Howard,and chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
8826,Howard,"hi, bernie, it’s me again. please call me back."
9699,Howard,"no, i want this to be romantic."
9248,Howard,wish i had known that before i posted all those pictures on facebook.
9559,Howard,it must’ve killed you when i went to space.
11593,Howard,"you if it’s at mit, i can make some calls. maybe we can get sheldon a prototype."
10787,Howard,great. he’s pushing with his uterus.
11440,Howard,"it’s got a rearview camera, there’s a dvd player, oh, and check this out. it’s like we’re living in the future."
9402,Howard,all right. thanks for ruining lobster for me.
7697,Howard,"see you, buddy."
9850,Howard,"star wars audition, take one, starring howard joel wolowitz, real-life astronaut. vader is here, now, on this moon. i felt his presence. he’s come for me. he can feel when i’m near…"
9984,Howard,thank you.
8097,Howard,"no. i guess not. what is he, like, six-four, six-five?"
6877,Howard,"how about that, you were right."
9479,Howard,so is tenure.
11261,Howard,"yeah, hey, buddy."
6758,Howard,"oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
7638,Howard,we’re getting to him.
6688,Howard,"isn’t it obvious? every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future mrs. howard wolowitz."
11257,Howard,"oh, good."
6852,Howard,guilty as charged. i’m out.
9057,Howard,"you know what, guys? never mind. i just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again."
7129,Howard,"we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him, are we?"
9159,Howard,that stuff’s radioactive.
10574,Howard,"oh, man. this is the boutonniere from my high school prom. a piece of cake from my bar mitzvah."
11681,Howard,what you doing?
10924,Howard,thanks. you got to be kidding me.
8888,Howard,"not exactly. listen, if you don’t mind, i’m not really up for chatting. i’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. that went really quick. let me try it again."
10623,Howard,"wuh, uh, who’s your father?"
10026,Howard,maybe. but how great is game of thrones?
9627,Howard,"hey, you know what this could mean ."
7977,Howard,"actually, indian monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. just fyi, that was racist."
10956,Howard,"could you imagine? what a cool way for us to meet. he’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
10119,Howard,then why do i smell coffee on your breath?
8858,Howard,"well, too bad, you already did. it’s a done deal. oh, well. but i forgive you."
6710,Howard,that’s what i meant.
8920,Howard,it’s the groom.
6295,Howard,worked for my parents. 
8122,Howard,"i know. the only thing is, i’m gonna be gone for two years."
7106,Howard,"no good. i mean, it might work for the japanese and the americans, but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there? this thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
10320,Howard,"wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
9761,Howard,"maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. she should quiet down soon. i gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her."
8317,Howard,"what can i tell you? after i found the courage to put her pants back on, i was unstoppable."
11282,Howard,not the stick chair. you look like an idiot on that thing.
12001,Howard,"i feel for ya. i’ve got a psychotic mommy, too."
11615,Howard,"okay, i’ll tell you what. i’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and bernadette, you and i can give it a go."
10750,Howard,i don’t know. it’s a mess. they had a huge fight in vegas.
8962,Howard,"yes, i read you, sheldon."
8725,Howard,but i worked hard to get this armour.
8501,Howard,little bit.
10583,Howard,"i just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion."
6899,Howard,"ah, they left me here to die. what about yours?"
9945,Howard,hang on. that was just me joking around.
11400,Howard,"well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
8069,Howard,"there’s your answer, free food."
9615,Howard,"wow, you’re really good at puzzles."
10071,Howard,"well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit."
11928,Howard,"what’s up, my nerdizzles? raj, sheldon, i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette."
7211,Howard,"they’re called tattoo sleeves. look. i bought them online, raj got a set, too. fantastic, right? put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and i can still be buried in a jewish cemetery."
6666,Howard,"to watch, right?"
6425,Howard,"all night long, y’all! "
8305,Howard,you mean adolf and eva? not yet. one goose step at a time.
9327,Howard,"i know, right? and, thanks to photographs and a little 3-d modeling, here comes the bride."
11084,Howard,this isn’t a joke.
11120,Howard,"oh, i don’t think there will be."
8591,Howard,"yeah, so?"
6840,Howard,"alright sheldon, why is tapioca…"
10600,Howard,"that’s not fair, she has upper body muscles."
10348,Howard,that’s jeanie.
10336,Howard,how is this helpful?
9500,Howard,why don’t you put her in a kennel?
6290,Howard,"don’t worry, you’ll thank me.  you may now thank me. "
11079,Howard,"i’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father."
6233,Howard,the blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and lesley winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. 
9781,Howard,sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
9466,Howard,"that’s pretty cool. thank you, guys."
9527,Howard,"come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play d&d like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?"
9015,Howard,you’re a dentist.
6684,Howard,"a house, where?"
11320,Howard,why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? it has to be bad news.
9726,Howard,sorry we’re late. i wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
11305,Howard,"i’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam."
8101,Howard,"yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, i wouldn’t have a chance, right?"
11205,Howard,"well, not right now. but we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat."
10178,Howard,"i’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. why not?"
6872,Howard,"come on, leonard, let’s go"
11971,Howard,"hey, what’s up?"
11688,Howard,yeah.
6675,Howard,yeah.
6631,Howard,"well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning english."
10517,Howard,why don’t you just clean out the whole room? take the string art clown i made her in third grade and the ribbon i got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
10959,Howard,"come on, trent, you’re better than th-ah."
9704,Howard,you’re sure you’re okay?
9148,Howard,just keep an eye out. i’ll have this open in a minute.
8319,Howard,my family is the history of heart disease. there’s a cave painting in france of one of my ancestors doing this .
6743,Howard,"oh, if it isn’t mrs. dead to me."
11465,Howard,"it just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juh qachhom dotlh sov ‘iv "
7581,Howard,"yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples."
6878,Howard,"so, dr. hofstadter, leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister."
8095,Howard,oh! that’s a relief.
8880,Howard,you really think so?
11490,Howard,"no, it’s not. check it out, he says fun stuff."
11756,Howard,and i forgot to give her the message.
10836,Howard,my name is darth vader. i am your father. prepare to die.
9493,Howard,just a little? that’s great.
8385,Howard,"hey, leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
7599,Howard,he said we could call him stan.
8383,Howard,"when you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
11912,Howard,"you’re right, that’s a great idea."
7439,Howard,"okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
11100,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
8670,Howard,what are you doing here?
7031,Howard,it’s my comic book!
8226,Howard,and was your card the jack of diamonds?
7829,Howard,what?
7197,Howard,are you crazy? we can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
6725,Howard,"yes, i was bad. maybe she’ll spank me. can we please move on?"
11469,Howard,this isn’t complicated. do you love amy?
6171,Howard,see-ka-tong-guay-jow.
6465,Howard,"ha-ha, not your eyebrows? "
9072,Howard,i love you.
9469,Howard,yeah?
11134,Howard,"bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out."
6457,Howard,"sorry i’m late, i’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
8080,Howard,no. it’s a little tricky. i’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
7138,Howard,"okay, why?"
9390,Howard,"oh, you’re kidding. let me see. well, i’ll be. look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf."
8450,Howard,"she says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”"
8011,Howard,why?
7490,Howard,then get the regular!
11436,Howard,"but it’s the safest crib you can buy. and if you don’t like it, we can return it."
7313,Howard,"so, penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. that’s pretty great, what are you studying?"
8372,Howard,i’m sorry. what?
10972,Howard,check. wait. screw it. i’m holding it.
10249,Howard,that does sound fun.
9440,Howard,no.
7814,Howard,nice to see you.
11463,Howard,i’ll take that as a yes. she’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
10488,Howard,"well, i don’t think that’s gonna help at all."
8265,Howard,beyonce? really?
6806,Howard,"the carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. but as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot."
6588,Howard,are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
11600,Howard,try another one.
8788,Howard,"funny thing is, i only have one belt. anyway, i’ll let you get started. oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, i tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back."
11432,Howard,hi.
10923,Howard,"no fair, i was meditating."
8230,Howard,"i’d love to see that. how about you, raj?"
11935,Howard,i love watching raj and sheldon try to work together.
11497,Howard,i’m conducting a quick survey. do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
10369,Howard,what are you talking about? we’re fine. and raj’s parents probably split up because of raj.
7888,Howard,"well, not real girls."
11519,Howard,i love you.
6506,Howard,no problem.
11873,Howard,"i think mrs tishman’s got her eye on you. i’ve been there, you’re in for a treat. "
10578,Howard,"yeah, i’m okay. let’s get started."
10354,Howard,why would you even come to this? didn’t you know i’d be here?
11533,Howard,"so, what are we gonna name this kid? now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for wally wolowitz."
9798,Howard,"no, she always looks like that. because she married an idiot."
9003,Howard,"sweetie, we don’t have to do this now."
8082,Howard,we’re going to be hundred-aires.
10449,Howard,it smelled too much like blue jay.
9336,Howard,tell me about it.
8507,Howard,"if you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
10112,Howard,it’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
10841,Howard,"if you need liquid helium so bad, i know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions."
11000,Howard,no. you’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
9893,Howard,do what?
9062,Howard,fine. two weeks ago i was an astronaut.
8208,Howard,yeah.
7397,Howard,"look, they gave me homemade cookies."
9968,Howard,i really don’t think we do tha…
9079,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. not to mention, your american accent is terrible."
7417,Howard,and she was my second cousin.
7963,Howard,so. are you sure you don’t want to come with us to raiders?
7698,Howard,are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
11178,Howard,i didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
10656,Howard,all by myself.
6160,Howard,"think back, leonard, the littlest things can set women off. like, hey, the waitress is hot, i bet we could get her to come home with us. or, how much does your mom weigh, i want to know what i’m getting into."
11635,Howard,great. we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
9095,Howard,i know.
8713,Howard,"oh, i love you so much."
8130,Howard,you take this one. i spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
8318,Howard,they’re running tests. i don’t know. it may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
6912,Howard,"oh, yeah, sorry about that."
6828,Howard,and then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. which brings us to tenth grade.
7157,Howard,"well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
9833,Howard,"you didn’t let me finish. here you go, mother."
8373,Howard,i don’t see anything.
6883,Howard,"oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad."
8570,Howard,"little snarky there, cello lessons. and we have this completely ordinary cylinder. if you’d like to examine it?"
11845,Howard,i found it right next to these kisses.
9168,Howard,it better be. it’s the spare camera for the mars rover.
7471,Howard,"have no idea. hey, leonard."
7575,Howard,i’m sorry i couldn’t hang with you last night. i had a date with bernadette.
7319,Howard,either.
7077,Howard,"grow up, raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. just go, i’ll catch up with you."
8827,Howard,"it’s not your fault, it’s mine. i did all that stuff, not you."
7352,Howard,i brought you a little gift. new kite.
8282,Howard,"oh, i love you so much."
10555,Howard,great. neither of those. try a hammer.
10363,Howard,you don’t look okay.
9672,Howard,i don’t know. sounds kind of heavy.
6428,Howard,then guess.
6407,Howard,fire away. 
21703,Howard,and you just assume you’re always right?
10491,Howard,"okay, so it’s one vote emily, one vote cinnamon. penny, you’re the tiebreaker."
7939,Howard,"hey, buddies. guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?"
9375,Howard,terrific. couldn’t be better.
7458,Howard,no.
7899,Howard,the greasy old fat guy in facilities management?
10962,Howard,they’re not supposed to be available yet.
8132,Howard,why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
11988,Howard,"raj, who’s at the door?"
11163,Howard,it’s not a problem.
10368,Howard,"as you can see, we’re here to cheer you up."
8997,Howard,gesundheit. you okay?
8137,Howard,"hey, put your tie back in your pants."
7565,Howard,"sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
9416,Howard,"no, but i did go to the international space station."
11229,Howard,why do you get to pick?
6906,Howard,hey.
10991,Howard,no one.
10163,Howard,she did?
7914,Howard,why the hell would you cross ebola with the common cold?
8944,Howard,you can’t catch a computer virus.
10556,Howard,it’s fine. you just need two more nails.
6525,Howard,"no, you don’t understand."
10482,Howard,"okay, emily or cinnamon? check it out, i got us matching sweaters."
11264,Howard,"well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems."
11660,Howard,"come on, raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just waiting to exhale. yeah, i knew you could do it."
9799,Howard,"well, i keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone."
9828,Howard,more.
8996,Howard,"oh, i get it. they’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. don’t worry, i can act surprised. "
6719,Howard,i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch.
8002,Howard,hey.
9037,Howard,"but you know what wasn’t a party? that hotel in kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. i mean, it’s your last night on earth. you’d think you’d get one porn channel."
11191,Howard,just supportive. not over-the-top in any way?
8194,Howard,you have hypo-allergenic detergent?
9678,Howard,that’s not true.
7909,Howard,"i know all your shirts. that’s not one of them. you were pretending to work at the genius bar to pick up women, weren’t you?"
10880,Howard,"because when my dad left, i promised myself that if i ever had a chance to be a father i’d always be there."
6547,Howard,once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. 
10990,Howard,"you know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
8865,Howard,i’m not sure.
11256,Howard,i know. what are they gonna talk about?
11347,Howard,"well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
7131,Howard,i could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills sheldon.
8980,Howard,"love you too. hey, bernie? before you go, can you do something for me?"
6614,Howard,"oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
11323,Howard,why do i bother talking to you?
7703,Howard,"whoa, whoa, whoa. you heard the man. where’s your throat cultures? kidding. sit down."
11602,Howard,you’re so stupid.
6902,Howard,all the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
6732,Howard,"erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
9268,Howard,"that was amazing, sheldon."
6660,Howard,"plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. that’s right, honey, have another calzone, daddy can wait."
21713,Howard,three. i designed the engine myself.
10868,Howard,"yeah. yeah, i feel like an archaeologist. indiana jones and the single-family dwelling. hey. look. found a seashell."
6483,Howard,okay. 
7979,Howard,yeah. this man is not my father. i’m being held hostage. so i’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
10561,Howard,thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
8607,Howard,yeah.
9101,Howard,"now that you mention it, i was thinking tomorrow might not be great."
6977,Howard,"but before i go, would you mind if i just take one picture of us together for my facebook page?"
8412,Howard,"yeah, well, i’m sorry i didn’t run it by you first."
9918,Howard,say what?
10000,Howard,what’s wrong?
10946,Howard,cool name.
7202,Howard,shiksa. shik-sa.
9185,Howard,my iron man helmet. koothrappali saw you take it. give it back.
6654,Howard,what?
6497,Howard,can you just let us in.
7965,Howard,"oh, shut up."
6342,Howard,"look at this, everyone went chimp. "
7163,Howard,what are you doing?
6172,Howard,"oh, he speaks english, he just can’t speak to women."
7503,Howard,hi.
9352,Howard,you wore my pyjamas?
6498,Howard,"well, raj got him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture based on alex ross’s definitive batman, and i got him this amazing autographed copy of the feynman lectures on physics."
8820,Howard,"oh, please shut up."
8795,Howard,"it’s not her fault. she’s getting hormone replacement therapy. makes her crazy horny. check this out, i got sheldon to wear the french maid’s costume."
10595,Howard,we’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
8448,Howard,i don’t know how to spell it.
8840,Howard,"so, is the wedding still on?"
9333,Howard,what are you talking about? we make plenty of money.
9717,Howard,you don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
10434,Howard,"yeah, i do."
11233,Howard,"tell me about it. i’ve had it with raj, too."
8852,Howard,"yeah, well, why wouldn’t i be? you know, i’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and i finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  oh, hang on. oh, it’s nasa. wolowitz. oh! hi, dave. what’s up? no kidding. really? well, that’s great news. great, great news. all right, i’ll watch my e-mail for the details. okay, talk soon."
8479,Howard,who’s mohammed lee?
11603,Howard,"no, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
6471,Howard,bye missy.
8057,Howard,"no, we can still make this work. leonard, you talk to penny."
6566,Howard,"did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? "
11412,Howard,"damn, so did i."
8393,Howard,"yeah, you got it, you got it."
6591,Howard,"it wasn’t your fault, raj, he was dressed as a green orion slave girl."
7464,Howard,"bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles."
8548,Howard,"a new one? unbelievable. they just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. it’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid."
10350,Howard,"she is my second cousin. we were 15, i just said, don’t say it."
9371,Howard,"yeah, i know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. what are you and penny doing?"
7525,Howard,"well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
8729,Howard,"that’s my ride, got to go. "
6579,Howard,what about lee meriwether?
7371,Howard,"oh, take all the time you need."
7552,Howard,"hey, look who’s back!"
9785,Howard,don’t worry about it.
7419,Howard,"so two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “what the heck was all that about?”"
11477,Howard,"i can keep this, right?"
10213,Howard,"hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game."
7103,Howard,"classified, leonard."
9378,Howard,i said i’m sorry.
8070,Howard,why am i listed as your executive assistant?
11948,Howard,i wish to discuss your theories of black holes. meet me at the randy’s donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
9470,Howard,that’s terrible.
10298,Howard,negative reinforcement is really wrong?
6926,Howard,"you know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here.  nobody cares where you’re going to sit. you’re not crazy."
8476,Howard,try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
9581,Howard,hey.
9563,Howard,"come on, you can talk to girls now. it shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new."
7178,Howard,"you don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended."
6954,Howard,that’s summer glau.
11401,Howard,"well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
9388,Howard,"you didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?"
9112,Howard,sometime around the third almond joy.
10061,Howard,"ah, it’s all right. they could’ve filled the bowl a little more. excuse me."
8395,Howard,why do you have to make everything weird?
7723,Howard,i’m out.
11096,Howard,i’m not finding anything either.
9548,Howard,"leonard, i may have gotten you a job."
11732,Howard,you should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with penny you don’t want to.
10955,Howard,no. let him spot us.
7522,Howard,seen it.
9006,Howard,bernadette? bernie? bernie?
9646,Howard,damn. how’d you swing that?
8472,Howard,"hey, bernadette doesn’t mind where i get my motor running, as long as i park in the right garage."
9094,Howard,"you know, it’s kinda late. why don’t we just spend the night here?"
11796,Howard,it’s halley. unless somebody else put an x on the bottom of their kid’s foot.
11766,Howard,it doesn’t?
7544,Howard,it doesn’t mean any of that! it’s a typo.
7364,Howard,"good. i’m glad. oh, man. did you see the way she smiled at me?"
10023,Howard,were you like this when i married you?
9419,Howard,"quick, pull the fire alarm. let’s get out of here."
8594,Howard,"well, yeah."
8701,Howard,"yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
11231,Howard,and i’m gonna eat it all.
9092,Howard,"yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks."
7797,Howard,but it’s frozen.
7125,Howard,godspeed.
10223,Howard,there’s no way this is sixty feet.
6394,Howard,"yeah, let’s go with that. "
7672,Howard,i guessed premature. does that count?
7875,Howard,"will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?"
9086,Howard,you ever hear back from hawking?
9196,Howard,"those aren’t gonna help you, sheldon,"
6900,Howard,sorry.
8411,Howard,"i got it! oh, hi."
8712,Howard,what are you doing here?
8576,Howard,yeah. i started when i was a teenager. i thought i could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
6665,Howard,"sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
10429,Howard,"you know, maybe i’m best friends with raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me."
10514,Howard,you really did a nice job.
8427,Howard,"yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning."
7359,Howard,"no. you know what? maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. you’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself."
11930,Howard,how the hell do i know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
8967,Howard,"oh, it’s okay. space is beautiful. earth is beautiful. same old, same old."
11192,Howard,astronauts saw him carrying that.
6818,Howard,i don’t want to talk to her.
7598,Howard,"you’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, stan lee took stuart and us out for gelato."
6848,Howard,gee. why can’t sheldon make friends?
11324,Howard,"i don’t know. they take the invention away, and i get nothing?"
8303,Howard,bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the old town deli.
11801,Howard,"okay, challenge them again."
7179,Howard,"what’s there to learn? you get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. easy peasy."
6238,Howard,morning ma’am. 
7847,Howard,bernadette? what are you doing here?
9534,Howard,"a satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like al pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  you’re playing d&d. you’re playing d&d. this whole apartment is playing d&d."
9557,Howard,cheers.
7854,Howard,"and with that mental picture, i think we’re done for the evening."
9579,Howard,"i’m sorry, i’ve been kind of snippy lately. it’s probably this stupid diet i’m on."
10114,Howard,maybe you’re right. anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
6788,Howard,"don’t feel bad, penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. my first hanukkah with sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights."
10665,Howard,the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
11636,Howard,but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations. 
9572,Howard,looks like she accepted your apology.
8878,Howard,"um, okay."
9660,Howard,"i’m just saying, i’d never want to work with bernadette. can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
8289,Howard,fine.
7677,Howard,what?
7911,Howard,"just fyi, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. i mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that."
10941,Howard,what should we write?
8398,Howard,on three?
11574,Howard,"well, i put the rug down. it didn’t help."
9286,Howard,"i’m sorry, i’m a feminist, i don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has."
10897,Howard,congratulations.
11836,Howard,"although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be penny."
8537,Howard,what?
6176,Howard,so you’ll think about it?
6801,Howard,"oh yeah, they still got the full monte."
8780,Howard,"yeah, i know, i’m just trying to figure out how much i want to punish him."
10607,Howard,she’s my champion.
6830,Howard,i guess.
8661,Howard,everyone in the world of science knows who richard feynman was.
8466,Howard,here’s some other fun news on the raj/emily front. he gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
7751,Howard,what?
8381,Howard,hand me the tuna melt.
9822,Howard,"i’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. sorry, i thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen."
9226,Howard,"oh, you like to fish?"
8328,Howard,"it’s the circle of life, sweetie. one day our son will marry someone and it will kill you."
9511,Howard,"of course we can. especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little cinna… son of a bitch, she’s gone."
8133,Howard,i’m in!
6445,Howard,why?
10812,Howard,who cares? i thought the whole point of footprints on the moon was to write songs that make people think.
8971,Howard,you can see it if you want. it’s on youtube. google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
8677,Howard,"why don’t i talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
6454,Howard,don’t think so. i followed her here from the parking lot. 
6552,Howard,"good idea. sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. "
9819,Howard,i’ve never done this before. it’s kind of fun.
6664,Howard,i do. i love me a cup of joe.
7137,Howard,you heard the man. hold him down and i’ll cut him open.
7793,Howard,it’s a robot arm.
10157,Howard,or in her neck. listen. you staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.
6901,Howard,"well, we’re surrounded, so i guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
11605,Howard,like this one?
7387,Howard,"there’s no one there. you’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
10900,Howard,"and no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
9021,Howard,"oh, stuart, thanks. what are you doing here?"
7908,Howard,what’s with the t-shirt? you working at the apple store now?
9941,Howard,sure.
9492,Howard,what’s going on?
10548,Howard,why were you looking in it?
7809,Howard,is that steve wozniak?
8688,Howard,it’s the 21st century. you can’t have a duel.
10643,Howard,"yeah, absolutely. you need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities."
9751,Howard,"you know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin."
11797,Howard,guess who’s home from the aquarium?
7554,Howard,have you tried rebooting him?
10620,Howard,nope.
6373,Howard,"no, i thought of it all by myself. "
10960,Howard,let’s just go.
7044,Howard,"all right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo."
6401,Howard,recognise. 
11979,Howard,why are you being so bossy?
6398,Howard,maybe they had to go to a clinic. imagine spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
7949,Howard,"oh. sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts."
6307,Howard,that would be me. 
7721,Howard,he’s right. the numbers are shaky enough as it is.
6196,Howard,"raj, blow up the gates."
11920,Howard,"what’s going on, day dwellers?"
10547,Howard,so?
6545,Howard,well it’s not.
6488,Howard,okay. 
8206,Howard,"raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time sheldon got punched by bill gates?"
7830,Howard,more like yoko and yoko.
6182,Howard,get used to it.
8643,Howard,that’s actually not a terrible plan.
21700,Howard,"i can’t speak for these guys, but i’m sitting on my tushie. it’s a joke."
10293,Howard,"oh, i can’t argue with him. it’s right there on the screen. austria does look like a wiener."
8990,Howard,"no, no, i’m fine. no anxiety. we should probably talk in code. from now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. so, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home."
10730,Howard,you mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
9886,Howard,"oh, and i thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over."
7335,Howard,it’s a date.
9908,Howard,"well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos."
7996,Howard,we’d come visit you.
11004,Howard,i can’t believe i miss stuart.
7551,Howard,"oh, come on. so you were the victim of a crime. that’s part of life. when my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the lower east side of new york. you know what happened? every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. but, those people moved on, and so should you."
8692,Howard,the growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? yep.
8743,Howard,"okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy."
7938,Howard,they’re just doing a background check on me.
6784,Howard,so? we’re in a rock band.
11003,Howard,that was pretty cute.
11700,Howard,there’s more than enough in there to cover comic-con.
10949,Howard,"oh, he’s our fan."
11656,Howard,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
8256,Howard,"yes, he does live with his parents. here’s a google earth shot of their house."
8994,Howard,"whoa, thank you. great to be back on earth."
10098,Howard,"thanks for lifting my spirits. next time, try lifting the box."
10966,Howard,"well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  "
8121,Howard,i just got offered a fellowship at the weitzmann institute in israel.
7233,Howard,not particularly.
6310,Howard,forget the parties? what a nerd. 
9748,Howard,"hey, what’re you working on?"
9633,Howard,love on the rocks. 
9624,Howard,find something you like.
9883,Howard,"not the same hulk. ferrigno, bana, norton and ruffalo."
8471,Howard,wow.
7537,Howard,au contraire. it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
10951,Howard,and at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
11453,Howard,"oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags."
7177,Howard,"okay, who had leonard flames out with penny in less than 24 hours”?"
10516,Howard,not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
7174,Howard,"sheldon, you’re wrong. wolverine was not born with bone claws."
10511,Howard,"well, i’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if i’m lonely?"
8630,Howard,i don’t get to pick it. the other guys have to give it to me.
7217,Howard,"hello, it looks like blood. did you even read the wiki how link i sent you on being goth?"
7577,Howard,i’d take sheldon to switzerland.
6413,Howard,he compared sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve. 
8524,Howard,"hey, sheldon."
11586,Howard,"it’s a tradition of my people.  if i were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
6564,Howard,and some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
10883,Howard,"speaking of making babies, what do you say i wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
11015,Howard,apology accepted.
9362,Howard,"hey, you wanted a woman in your life. now you got one."
7164,Howard,"well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, i’m running away."
9036,Howard,that’s not true. at the walgreens i was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
8895,Howard,what?
8632,Howard,"emergency drill night last night, huh?"
10457,Howard,"so, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
11825,Howard,which is?
8650,Howard,"yeah, my ring tone. kind of my favourite song, rocket man."
10769,Howard,right now.
8229,Howard,really?
8325,Howard,"well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
8859,Howard,but what about all the plans and the guests?
9380,Howard,"yeah, maybe tonight. but a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his xbox. well, he will."
8016,Howard,there you are.
8043,Howard,"no, i know bullying. he left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
9073,Howard,i don’t know. raj sent me some video of buzz aldrin.
7463,Howard,"leonard, penny, you know my girlfriend bernadette."
7207,Howard,"well, could you look at toby?"
9343,Howard,"hey, i got a favour to ask."
7348,Howard,"all i know about saks is, my mother shops there."
8031,Howard,"that’s for a footrace. if you want to race, we have to go outside."
11910,Howard,"uh, pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings."
9141,Howard,what the hell is he up to?
8067,Howard,"well, hang on. let’s see where he’s going."
8861,Howard,"no. i, uh, i should talk to him, man to man."
8756,Howard,"sheldon, i have a working understanding of physics."
11720,Howard,he also never had sex in that room. that’s something else to look forward to.
6433,Howard,"don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping."
10307,Howard,there were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition scotty from a smoke-free home.
9044,Howard,"boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. did i tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?"
7385,Howard,"for god’s sake, i don’t need to hear that! can’t you just say, i’m busy?"
7592,Howard,"okay, he’s going to jail."
6357,Howard,no.
11754,Howard,"oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
6396,Howard,"wow, i almost didn’t recognise him."
6583,Howard,"koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so i gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. but he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it. "
7040,Howard,"no, he may not."
10715,Howard,"i mean, for a while, everything was vampires. now it’s all zombies. i wonder what the next monster fad will be."
9631,Howard,"they’re coming to america, they’re coming to america."
11413,Howard,"what are we gonna do, e-mail 911?"
8288,Howard,okay.
11729,Howard,nice. 174 diapers. that ought to get us to wednesday.
8020,Howard,"a jar with a big spider in it, of course. bravery test. first one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
6249,Howard,"i’m going to use the mirror technique. she brushes her hair back, i brush my hair back, she shrugs, i shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together."
8734,Howard,"no, uh, i don’t think so."
8586,Howard,"okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
7494,Howard,really? he said that?
6745,Howard,lisa?
7042,Howard,wrong again!
11532,Howard,"uh, stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back."
8331,Howard,no!
9684,Howard,sorry we’re so late. bernadette got stuck at work.
9381,Howard,"me, too. how about we blow off dessert, go home early, i’ll do that laundry."
7014,Howard,may i say you look very comely tonight?
11936,Howard,"no, no, no. he won. suck it up."
7858,Howard,in a nutshell.
11074,Howard,"it is crazy. oh. i mean, how do you prepare for something like this? i’m not even sure i’ve held a baby before."
6649,Howard,"sheldon, why are you arguing with the dmv?"
8123,Howard,"that’s what we’re here to talk to you about. you see, bernadette has needs."
9711,Howard,bernie’s having a girls’ night on friday at our place. you want to do something?
10111,Howard,as advertised.
8988,Howard,"oh, a lot better, thanks. one sec. listen close, i don’t have a lot of time. i need you to go to my house. in my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. i want you to take it and bring it back to your place."
8597,Howard,"i don’t know. i can’t see a life where i don’t have kids. i mean, people have kids. i mean, even donkey kong had donkey kong jr. so he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at italian plumbers."
8336,Howard,yeah.
11735,Howard,"uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
9577,Howard,"what were they thinking, putting doctor octopus’s mind in spider-man’s body?"
6792,Howard,"excuse me, we’re ready."
10318,Howard,"ooh, laser tag, laser tag."
7896,Howard,son of a bitch.
7757,Howard,why?
10186,Howard,hey.
6886,Howard,say what?  that’s basically what i just said.
11869,Howard,"no, no, look at my fingers, they’re like vienna sausages."
8478,Howard,"it gets better. someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
8138,Howard,you’re kidding.
6167,Howard,so she’s available for coitus?
11575,Howard,did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
7500,Howard,"yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
6845,Howard,"hear him out. if he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at comic-con, make a fortune."
7901,Howard,yeah. i think i’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
7973,Howard,"you want to talk brave, how about captain america’s undocumented mexican gardener?"
11369,Howard,why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
8641,Howard,like how?
8313,Howard,"bernadette and i are getting married. ma? you too busy bearing down? ma?  son of a bitch! ma, help!"
8380,Howard,hang on.
10680,Howard,now i rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
7367,Howard,you think so?
11975,Howard,"okay, great. bye. our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
8382,Howard,thank you. how’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
7874,Howard,"well, for all we know, glissinda the troll wasn’t even a real woman. i mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in new jersey."
6700,Howard,"that’s it. there’s the house, i found america’s top models!"
10113,Howard,"no, it’s not."
7277,Howard,guess i should have called.
9179,Howard,yeah.
7056,Howard,you’re weighing me down. i’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
6319,Howard,uh-huh?
11741,Howard,four.
10126,Howard,"she’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
7659,Howard,"leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
8235,Howard,bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
10677,Howard,yeah.
6300,Howard,and you have no wrath. 
11284,Howard,"hmm, maybe not. leonard?"
8835,Howard,"tell her i’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, i get it. but what i really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that i’m disgusted by, too. but that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. so, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
7801,Howard,"he said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life."
9737,Howard,you’re right. i didn’t realize i was making you feel that way. it was very brave of you to tell me.
6814,Howard,i don’t have homework. i’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
6726,Howard,"yeah. no. i’m sorry, but something’s come up. kind of a mars rover, mars rover, can howard come over, situation. so my friend leonard is gonna take you home."
6624,Howard,i have a master’s degree.
10988,Howard,wow. i thought i was done getting lucky tonight.
6920,Howard,"oh, great."
10843,Howard,hey.
9498,Howard,"however long you think the foreplay should be, triple it."
8487,Howard,this isn’t the reaction i expected when i told you i was gonna be an astronaut.
11107,Howard,"thank you, pasadena. good night."
7159,Howard,"actually, it was his idea."
11755,Howard,"hmm, let’s see. mm. okay, here we go, six years ago, i got a call that bernie’s great-aunt, trixie, died. "
9802,Howard,"yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park."
7969,Howard,i guess we’d better go after him.
10405,Howard,"yeah for you, not for me. i went to space. i’m covered."
10746,Howard,i’m not taking sides.
11504,Howard,and i think you’re cute.
7670,Howard,"hey, i just wanted to tell you i’m a big fan."
9651,Howard,that’s it? no compassion?
10263,Howard,"i know, but all the guys are doing it. we’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money."
11139,Howard,what’s to think about? we have an invention and want to move forward.
10627,Howard,"you know what, i’m being a bad host. let me get some more coffee."
10882,Howard,i really believe i’d be a great dad.
8060,Howard,check it out. those guys are breaking into that car.
10676,Howard,"step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
10630,Howard,"i don’t know. i, i’d just like him to go away. i can’t deal with this."
9601,Howard,you think?
9824,Howard,"fine, then go talk to her on your own."
6301,Howard,"i’ll tell you what just happened, i just learned how to pick up indian chicks. "
8096,Howard,"that green bag is dr. cooper’s. here’s an extra five. make him wait. oh. right to the nap, huh? okay? uh, so, this glenn guy. you say you went out with him for, like, a year."
6628,Howard,that would be cool. i’d go to that reception.
11761,Howard,love you more. 
11506,Howard,"hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. i mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
9448,Howard,what?
7405,Howard,it was my uncle murray’s funeral. we were all back at my aunt barbara’s house. our eyes locked over the pickled herring. we never meant for it to happen.
11334,Howard,and my cousin’s a lawyer.
11875,Howard,"ola, nerd-migos. "
8406,Howard,why would she move out? it’s her house.
7382,Howard,"hey, don’t bring my mother into this!"
6916,Howard,can i assume that you likewise found the experience…
7238,Howard,"yeah, i’d like the mean little skull, please."
7393,Howard,"oh, this sucks, i’m switching back to real sex."
11520,Howard,"oh, man, this is really happening. you doin’ okay?"
7147,Howard,i can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
11138,Howard,what are you doing?
6403,Howard,what? why?
9290,Howard,so what’s our first pose going to be?
7484,Howard,of course.
8199,Howard,"what? it’s fun. if i have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat."
7078,Howard,"alright, where are these amazing shrimp?"
7683,Howard,hold on. i’ll walk down with you.
7840,Howard,"so, my dear, we meet again."
6377,Howard,the only thing we need to do is make this kim kid lose his focus.
9797,Howard,yeah. so what do you feel like making?
7156,Howard,"that’s why i added the tator. and then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
11932,Howard,"oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too."
11080,Howard,i shouldn’t be raising a kid. i don’t even eat my own vegetables.
10476,Howard,that’s nice.
10283,Howard,okay. no. leonard’s right. we’re here to focus. didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
7880,Howard,"oh, no, that’s okay. how have you been?"
10824,Howard,"no, bernadette got me a fitbit so she can track how much i’m exercising."
6698,Howard,"well, my fellow americans, before this year is out we will put a wolowitz on one of america’s top models."
11173,Howard,what is he doing in there?
11459,Howard,and how single are you right now?
7959,Howard,who’s there?
9193,Howard,what the hell are you doing?
10651,Howard,with my honeybunch.
9146,Howard,it’s locked.
11356,Howard,maybe that’s because it’s classified.
10261,Howard,it’s to help reopen the comic book store.
11879,Howard,"you girl’s talk, i’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin. "
7786,Howard,"okay, i can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. no pulling, no saws, no torches."
7902,Howard,"short jokes? really? you’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me."
9459,Howard,"oh, honey, i am in no mood to have sex tonight. i’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… oh. what are you guys doing here?"
10062,Howard,i need some fresh air.
7074,Howard,"first row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
10445,Howard,"i might argue a hanukkah miracle, but i’ll take it. come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. get the curtain."
9384,Howard,"damn it, it’s in the washing machine."
11418,Howard,"maybe. how ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
7384,Howard,"i’m busy too, you answer it."
7520,Howard,"no, it would just freak him out. listen, before we leave, i should warn you, i’m a passionate man and i tend towards public displays of affection."
6448,Howard,"hang on, i need that to complete my justice society of america collection."
7642,Howard,something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
8779,Howard,i do.
11479,Howard,"damn, the macarthur genius grant."
7704,Howard,what the hell are you doing?
10393,Howard,roger abbott sounds just like roger rabbit.
11841,Howard,"oh. yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world. "
6632,Howard,so you’re just going to sit around here and mope while penny is out with doctor apu from the kwik-e-mart?
8258,Howard,and me.
11771,Howard,"should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? oh, howie, i don’t need food as long as i can look at my phone."
9127,Howard,we should figure out where he goes.
6205,Howard,i’m a romantic.
10300,Howard,"how does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?"
7090,Howard,is that supposed to be funny?
7111,Howard,"sheldon, i know what i’m doing."
7173,Howard,again.
9366,Howard,"yeah, one second. come here. i want to show you something."
8608,Howard,"yeah, we’re good."
9211,Howard,"yeah, so?"
11348,Howard,i’m not even sure that’s possible.
9596,Howard,seriously?
8387,Howard,"well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with kama sutra coloring books."
11389,Howard,it’s unbelievable.
11013,Howard,no.
8818,Howard,"okay, buddy, that’s it. sit down."
6677,Howard,"kreplach, a hearty klingon… dumpling."
11853,Howard,and now the movie just got rated r.
6308,Howard,i’m with you. i just have to make sure if i’m a synthetic human i’d still be jewish. i promised my mother. 
10207,Howard,all right.
10400,Howard,"yeah, i’m not even sure if it’s the right word."
11482,Howard,here he comes.
9180,Howard,"sheldon, someday, if you get a car, i’m sure they’ll give you another parking space."
7198,Howard,let’s open her up.
6317,Howard,"that would be me. hey, check it out, it’s a featured video. . "
11763,Howard,"no, no, nothing. okay, well, maybe i’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
11546,Howard,"i’m gonna get back. thank you for staying up, i can’t wait for halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
11762,Howard,"sure, sorry. "
9752,Howard,i believe this is yours.
7091,Howard,"okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, i’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."
10330,Howard,"oh, yeah, she loves that place. every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. that’s why i don’t take her to seaworld."
10204,Howard,"which archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?"
11137,Howard,excuse us.
11232,Howard,so what the hell happened?
11171,Howard,"we went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
8438,Howard,with dungeons and dragons dice?
7932,Howard,mmm.
10402,Howard,we were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
10544,Howard,just playing video games while bernie does the taxes.
11539,Howard,"thank god you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today."
8816,Howard,"actually, barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight."
6351,Howard,"no, you’ll be on your hands and knees. now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon’s room. "
11129,Howard,"okay, great."
11523,Howard,i’m the father.
10706,Howard,battery charged?
6245,Howard,"what, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
8099,Howard,no. it’s just…
7815,Howard,"ah, ah."
8706,Howard,"no. i slept in a hole i dug in the ground with my bare hands. and at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
8417,Howard,"only when it’s fatty. well, don’t be jealous, babe. someday you’ll get to cut it for me."
11810,Howard,"and it’s hard, isn’t it? so the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. hmm?"
11601,Howard,"oh, god. you went through with that? what is wrong with you?"
10530,Howard,are you kidding me? you lost my mother’s ashes?
7246,Howard,yes. and i wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
11214,Howard,"i know. scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
6637,Howard,"so, not a puppy?"
7306,Howard,a hot friend.
7018,Howard,"come on, the whole idea behind anything can happen thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately."
11765,Howard,"aha, you are upset. i don’t know a lot about women, but i know i upset them."
9425,Howard,they’re just coming over for dinner. no one’s gonna look in the closet.
8170,Howard,"no, we agreed they all have their merits. this was about bernadette."
7032,Howard,i have got to learn how to draw. hey!
6390,Howard,"oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. "
11483,Howard,do you?
11734,Howard,"it said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. it’s not my fault you didn’t listen."
10929,Howard,"sorry. it’s just, you’re you, you know? and i really want you to adopt me."
10274,Howard,getting penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
11499,Howard,yeah
10762,Howard,"bernadette and i have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things."
7900,Howard,how’d he know about it?
6539,Howard,"oh, right, it’s your birthday, i had no idea it was your birthday, i completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it’s all over now."
8778,Howard,you walk away.
11199,Howard,i feel like i just made a horrible mistake.
6393,Howard,i guess times have changed since we were young. smart is the new sexy. 
10540,Howard,ma? i’m sorry i didn’t take you to the airport. i just want you to know that i’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. and i promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
7846,Howard,"maybe it committed suicide! leave me alone! now, where were we?"
6520,Howard,excuse me.
8232,Howard,what’s with the wand and the beep?
6418,Howard,"gentlemen, i believe i’ve found the solution to all our problems. "
7942,Howard,you?
10510,Howard,"mmm, she loves it. she finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on stuart because he might be lonely."
11525,Howard,"no, we’re keeping it a surprise."
8203,Howard,thank you.
6504,Howard,just do it. 
9239,Howard,"i don’t know, for them to die of natural causes."
11782,Howard,"look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out."
10560,Howard,what happened to snooping is wrong?
10391,Howard,"don’t feel bad. someday someone will be throwing out your work, too."
11352,Howard,we didn’t. sheldon did.
11062,Howard,how can it be fine? i just got attacked by a clearly anti-semitic wild animal.
10786,Howard,what are you doing?
10889,Howard,i think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating web site out there.
10971,Howard,t minus 15 minutes.
8045,Howard,"you started it, we just piled on."
10142,Howard,was that a little weird?
8717,Howard,they called the cops because of the smell. they thought we were dead.
9074,Howard,"okay, i get it."
10887,Howard,but what are you looking for?
11187,Howard,i’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
6554,Howard,"what, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?"
21708,Howard,"yeah, we can go over to my place."
9663,Howard,"okay, fine. i did say that, and i think it’s true. i think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other."
10253,Howard,you say things like that all the time.
9207,Howard,thank you.
11007,Howard,"hey, she came all the way here…"
9818,Howard,that is not… he’s doing it again. 
7264,Howard,"well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
10433,Howard,are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
7144,Howard,"yeah, wow."
6681,Howard,"oh, look, the’s the future mrs. wolowitz. no, wait, that’s the future mrs. wolowitz. with her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. it’s the future mrs. wolowitz."
9949,Howard,you’ve got to get me out of this.
6751,Howard,"oh, i don’t think you can."
7110,Howard,"hang on, i think i’ve got this. help me see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod."
7181,Howard,ashamed? horrified? repulsed?
6513,Howard,"oh my god, do you smell gas."
9668,Howard,"oh, well, come on, where am i supposed to look when i lie to you?"
7625,Howard,you brought a lawyer?
6429,Howard,he doesn’t have it. he’s got squat.
6616,Howard,he can feel sadness?
7518,Howard,"if it helps, we’re all good with your breasts."
9628,Howard,that’s it. 
7237,Howard,"you know  hi ho, i’m on howard’s butt!"
7410,Howard,me too. check and see if we have any more pudding.
7862,Howard,would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
8901,Howard,you proposed to penny?
7922,Howard,let’s just agree they’re both hot.
11850,Howard,"well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the fda shut down your project?"
9677,Howard,"yeah, well, i didn’t handle it so great, either."
7629,Howard,you do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the syfy channel. 
7960,Howard,"olive you, too."
9576,Howard,so nothing.
6353,Howard,it means go straight.
10984,Howard,i know. it’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his japanese porn cartoons.
7926,Howard,i have a girlfriend now.
7244,Howard,"yeah, i think i covered that."
6754,Howard,and a three hour dinner with penny.
11659,Howard,"ha, you’re interested. you’re out ten bucks."
8850,Howard,"hey, i was thinking. for our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from dirty dancing?"
10341,Howard,you know exactly who it is. he’s gonna bring my mom. why did you even invite him?
10499,Howard,"well, um, we were just kidding around."
10914,Howard,maybe i’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
10846,Howard,"hey, i want to try."
9379,Howard,"i told you, turn them inside out."
7871,Howard,her name was glissinda the troll. bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the bridge of souls.
7152,Howard,"yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the north pole."
9892,Howard,okay. we’re officially not going to comic-con.
7895,Howard,really?
7585,Howard,why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
9987,Howard,"oh, this is nothing. i experienced way worse when i was plummeting back to earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. okay, that was a big one."
8846,Howard,"well, their technology isn’t that bad."
10981,Howard,fear of failure.
8457,Howard,"it’s a funny story about a puppy. just smile and laugh. quick, quick, stop smiling."
11095,Howard,you think so?
6736,Howard,"well, that does sound like me, but no."
9499,Howard,i don’t know. go with hockey.
9951,Howard,"hi, ma. how are you?"
7058,Howard,"shut up. let’s just get koothrappali and go.  hello. i am sanjay wolowitz from bombay. okay, i’m stumped."
8782,Howard,i’ll give your paper to professor hawking.
8618,Howard,let’s see the new phone.
11658,Howard,"yes, he is."
7251,Howard,whatever.
8197,Howard,you don’t have to take me. you get to take me.
9422,Howard,milady.
11851,Howard,"okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
8958,Howard,"you don’t have to shout, raj. it’s not like i’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. oh, wait, i am."
9140,Howard,can’t you face the other way and listen?
8267,Howard,why did you bring that?
11500,Howard,what do you think?
6189,Howard,these instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. this right here is why sweden has no space program.
7243,Howard,"no, i haven’t, look.  i’m sorry, i’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
9658,Howard,are you crazy? you don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. hell clam.
8667,Howard,"you know what, it’s not a big deal. she makes more money than me. she wants to protect her financial interests. it’s completely reasonable."
8707,Howard,"but i did it. i survived. i wasn’t sure i was going to when the sandstorm hit. i just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. but somehow as i sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, i found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
11654,Howard,that’s a turbo.
11230,Howard,don’t tell me where to go.
9820,Howard,howdy.
6335,Howard,chocolate milk and eggoes please! 
7049,Howard,"you got it, sir."
11684,Howard,"ha ha ha, never gets old. okay, there is something i want, but it’s not a big deal."
6798,Howard,"featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
10851,Howard,not really. visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
9306,Howard,"well, i wanted everybody to know i love my wife. and nobody to know i forgot to turn off the laser."
7765,Howard,ask me to pass the soy sauce.
9023,Howard,"okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?"
9099,Howard,the lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
10309,Howard,let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
11291,Howard,"look. the system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation."
10611,Howard,six. seven. eight. nine. ten-five.
8142,Howard,hey. how was dinner?
7505,Howard,"i was just repeating what sheldon said. let’s not get off topic, bernadette, i need to apologize. i was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
7925,Howard,"so, you got any special plans with your sister?"
10507,Howard,"yeah. dr. dmitri plancovik of moscow university said dis paper great, i love it more than wodka."
10992,Howard,yeah. a grown man moving into his own apartment. crazy times. see ya.
9921,Howard,check it out.
11073,Howard,"oh, my god. this is incredible. we’re gonna be parents? we’re gonna get to board planes first. finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall."
9976,Howard,it’s not every day you get to tour nasa with a real astronaut.
10736,Howard,"bernie, stuart just pulled up. so remember, the key is to be firm. show no weakness."
6222,Howard,oh yeah.
10050,Howard,please don’t say it.
9604,Howard,stop it.
7893,Howard,"what do you mean, whose fault was that?"
11609,Howard,"uh, basically, she traded you for bruce wayne."
10915,Howard,wipe that smug smile off your face.
11648,Howard,"oh, you’re a genius."
9845,Howard,that stinks.
11865,Howard,"great. anybody’s better than, mmm."
7686,Howard,okay.
8246,Howard,"all right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
6908,Howard,"oh, uh, no big deal. they gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
10503,Howard,it wasn’t that bad.
9567,Howard,how’d it go?
11450,Howard,"if childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. are we there yet?"
10101,Howard,she’ll use it. all i need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a honeybaked ham.
6663,Howard,"you know, the pishkin-wolowitz liquid waste disposal system is turning a few heads as well."
9784,Howard,"well, sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and i tried to tell them about how sad i was when my dad abandoned…"
11847,Howard,ooh. sounds serious. have i been a bad boy? am i gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.
11487,Howard,i found him in an old box.
9389,Howard,"i’m sorry. that’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off."
9297,Howard,good idea. why don’t you get started on that?
7114,Howard,"hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
9437,Howard,do whatever you want.
7220,Howard,i’m actually much morelost than he is.
9387,Howard,we’re worried about you.
10232,Howard,"okay, thanks for the pep talk."
11983,Howard,"all right, leonard, hang in there. talk to you tomorrow."
11058,Howard,he is. should we name him?
11775,Howard,she already likes soap bubbles more than us.
7214,Howard,"well, in case i snag one on someone’s nipple ring."
7338,Howard,whoa! did you see that?
9475,Howard,you guys going to professor tupperman’s memorial?
10115,Howard,"hey, i’m a very paternal person. i’d be excellent at taking care of a baby."
7343,Howard,i would’ve caught up to her if i hadn’t pulled a hammy.
8653,Howard,"no problem, fruit loops."
6576,Howard,"for god’s sake, ma, i’m 27 years old. it’s not even a school night!  comfy now?"
10844,Howard,"if you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money."
8738,Howard,nice to meet you.
8941,Howard,"i mean, it’s not, like, hd quality."
8682,Howard,they’ve got a phone.
6213,Howard,"that’s true. have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
8844,Howard,why?
6281,Howard,guess whose parents just got broadband. 
11780,Howard,what are you making?
10653,Howard,"in social groupings, i just naturally wind up in charge."
9656,Howard,"i know. it was dumb, i shouldn’t have done it. and it’s making me feel sad. so sad. you know, why don’t you take a bath? i’ll do the dishes."
9430,Howard,"hey, guys, come on in."
7898,Howard,did penny tell you about that?
9940,Howard,massimino? why are you here?
10256,Howard,"yeah, and i’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
9067,Howard,"no, i’m not. they’re all being rude. and you’re being rude."
8679,Howard,okay.
6730,Howard,"hang on, there’s got to be other options."
11116,Howard,"okay, i gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?"
11649,Howard,that’s right. we figured it out all by ourselves. wasn’t even that hard.
9049,Howard,"so, i did this amazing thing and i’m never allowed to mention it?"
10646,Howard,"oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
9817,Howard,"oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
9223,Howard,had no idea you were the chatty one.
6220,Howard,howard wolowitz.
10848,Howard,unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
6444,Howard,"lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
7981,Howard,c-7.
7201,Howard,"that is not toby, this is toby. raj, what do you think?"
6405,Howard,"how about the perpetual motion squad? it’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. "
7118,Howard,not enough bread crumbs.
9363,Howard,"gee, i wish i could tell you no. all right, well, thanks again for helping me out."
8344,Howard,"if you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely."
8285,Howard,i’m not going to help you. this is hilarious.
9841,Howard,we’ll be there.
11113,Howard,"sheldon, i don’t think everyone…"
11304,Howard,are you kidding? they’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
11867,Howard,you done trying to make yourself feel better?
9566,Howard,of course. you’re my friend. i want you to be happy.
7427,Howard,"okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? it’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
11133,Howard,"well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
10297,Howard,hey.
8552,Howard,"mmm, make it two."
11721,Howard,what are you doing here?
10568,Howard,it’s all defrosting.
8777,Howard,that’s an interesting idea. why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
8693,Howard,"lookie here, i got my travel orders."
11652,Howard,"but if you really want to learn the mechanical side, i can teach you anything you want to know."
10188,Howard,okay.
6714,Howard,"mock me if you will, but it works. you show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs."
11543,Howard,"tired, but great. they’re both great."
10122,Howard,thanks a lot. now i have to go rub her belly again.
8409,Howard,don’t listen to her. go to the movie theatre.
11288,Howard,we’re near the front of the line. we’ll get in either way.
11621,Howard,"fine. look, i’ll exercise right now. one, two. these are crunches, by the way."
10891,Howard,you seriously think women would fight for you?
9486,Howard,keep reading. what does it say?
9757,Howard,"come on, it’ll be fun."
10604,Howard,"yeah, what?"
7966,Howard,too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
11964,Howard,"oh, hi."
8017,Howard,let me ask you a question. what are you most afraid of?
10034,Howard,"like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, i don’t say anything?"
6894,Howard,"i told you my mom has spider veins, i had to take her to the laser clinic."
10742,Howard,you need to take that?
9189,Howard,he wasn’t using it. and i needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
11046,Howard,i’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
6409,Howard,don’t you think i should answer the engineering questions? i am an engineer.
9588,Howard,you’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
6343,Howard,take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. 
7328,Howard,you live with your mother?
6921,Howard,"i’m busy, ma!"
6541,Howard,are you mad?
9007,Howard,"well, that was quick, and a little gross. now, i know how she feels."
10598,Howard,i would do that.
7473,Howard,like hanukkah in july.
11583,Howard,mm. except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
7380,Howard,i said i’m sorry.
8416,Howard,"so, dinner went nice."
9291,Howard,"sheldon, how is that a fight pose?"
7826,Howard,"and someday, when you have varicose veins, i’ll show you how to massage them."
9625,Howard,"yeah, i love neil diamond."
10018,Howard,and the healing begins.
7054,Howard,"i do, all the time."
9358,Howard,what were we thinking? we should have just done it the regular way.
7133,Howard,and you think you can put up with sheldon?
9016,Howard,one to beam aboard?
10278,Howard,my cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
8140,Howard,i’m gonna go hit the bar.
7506,Howard,"look, i know i come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is i’m not."
8982,Howard,"oh, baby, you’re killing me."
6650,Howard,"okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up."
8876,Howard,"oh, i am. and just so you know, i’d still be an astronaut, even if i didn’t go to space. i’ve got an i.d. card and a nasa golf shirt."
11832,Howard,but the movie did just get good.
7097,Howard,"yeah, see, that’s the code red. it’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box."
8697,Howard,"quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from i’m going"
10687,Howard,"boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces."
10729,Howard,"that’s not the same thing. emily’s a person. stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for."
8893,Howard,"really? well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand."
10334,Howard,like you and your dog.
6427,Howard,it looks like something they found on the ship at roswell. 
10989,Howard,what?
7414,Howard,"you don’t need forks. it’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
9113,Howard,"yeah, i guess. hey, would you do me a favour? go on ahead. i just want one last moment alone in my old room."
10903,Howard,you thought she was great in x-men.
6802,Howard,it’s a big deal. there’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. perhaps you’d like to come with me. i know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
9826,Howard,"doesn’t matter. bernadette still would’ve been working at the cheesecake factory, and i still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. you would’ve been all over me."
9832,Howard,i know you’re starving. the neighbours know you’re starving. there’s starving people in africa who know you’re starving.
8793,Howard,"no, no, no, mon petit cherie."
6922,Howard,"don’t come in, ma!"
7832,Howard,we’re all a little worried about sheldon.
6284,Howard,it’s the entire premise of fiddler on the roof.
8430,Howard,oh.
11028,Howard,what are you doing? you have a girlfriend.
6846,Howard,have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
10351,Howard,raj.
11757,Howard,"the terrible part is, ever since then, i’ve been sending bernie christmas cards from trixie."
9181,Howard,"fun story. meanwhile, you still don’t have a car."
10853,Howard,"oh, no, not this again."
6515,Howard,"this granola bar, there’s peanuts in it."
8415,Howard,see? she’s good with it.
11639,Howard,i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us.
7084,Howard,"cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?"
8642,Howard,did it work?
11332,Howard,"you know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
9314,Howard,i have always wanted a 3-d printer.
6561,Howard,"good, ‘cos they don’t work. "
7121,Howard,meatloaf.
6733,Howard,thank god for plan b.
9763,Howard,i was gonna make raj do it all by himself.
11769,Howard,"look, i don’t know what the best decision is, either. but whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
8744,Howard,"well, yes. but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, bernadette’s or my mom’s."
10382,Howard,"i love that i’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that."
11340,Howard,"anyway, like i said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on thursday. do you have any advice for us?"
8656,Howard,i wonder what he wants.
9706,Howard,"well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and i wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
8970,Howard,"well, like for instance, the other day when i was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. when i woke up, i screamed for like nine minutes."
8695,Howard,you read it as oh eight hundred.
8704,Howard,"we did overnight survival training in the wilderness. big fun. big, big fun. i was gonna freshen up for you but i blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
8117,Howard,sheldon still moping?
11209,Howard,"hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?"
11010,Howard,we should all take a trip or something.
8830,Howard,i don’t know what my next move is.
7095,Howard,"look, i was going over the schematics on my zero-g toilet, and i made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
7062,Howard,"so, where were we?"
9412,Howard,"yeah, last time i was here, i was just a scrawny little nerd."
7602,Howard,sweet.
11742,Howard,"son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
10994,Howard,"no kidding. oh, okay, i’m about to suck something up. what do you think this object sounds like?"
10662,Howard,sure.
10077,Howard,"oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie."
11145,Howard,"sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. it’s, it’s with how you treat me."
10248,Howard,"all i know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. i mean, four-ply. if his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?"
7995,Howard,it might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
7737,Howard,"yeah, right."
9052,Howard,i don’t care. get the tardis.
11777,Howard,how about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
11842,Howard,"i’m happy about it, but, i mean, it’s not like i did much. i mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
9114,Howard,"fine, let’s go."
10054,Howard,"i’m sorry. i tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
9176,Howard,"oh, they’re not the same thing."
9554,Howard,"i’m proud of you, leonard. working out on the north sea for months, that’s really something."
11174,Howard,you know what wasn’t anti-climactic? the end of the movie. get this.
8751,Howard,"so, i got the craziest e-mail this morning."
7327,Howard,my mother calls me at work to see if i had a healthy bowel movement.
11325,Howard,what’s the point of that story?
8810,Howard,"sorry, i can’t."
6959,Howard,"fine, go ahead. take a shot."
7691,Howard,"bye. actually, i’m this way. do i smell hot dogs?"
7431,Howard,"in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
11703,Howard,"raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and i wrote india."
10554,Howard,does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
10965,Howard,got ’em.
7906,Howard,hey.
11628,Howard,what’s wrong?
9229,Howard,"no, no. we know each other well enough. he’s been talking my ear off all night."
7383,Howard,"boy, what got him so upset?"
11564,Howard,oh. this is new.
11811,Howard,"uh, hold on. there’s an old saying in juggling."
11090,Howard,"i don’t know, all apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
8126,Howard,"raj, is that you?"
10303,Howard,so what did you want to know?
11017,Howard,"wait, that’s an option? i didn’t know that was an option."
8668,Howard,"yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. i have assets to protect, too."
10702,Howard,"there’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
9690,Howard,"look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. i’m writing a song, and i was hoping we could all play it for her together."
10660,Howard,"well, well, well, did you hear that, sheldon?"
9685,Howard,"wait, maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
9859,Howard,"so, what is she doing today?"
11987,Howard,"i’m fine. be right out. am i an american hero? well, that’s a good question, jim. don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the earth? okey dokey. i think i have time for one more question."
9489,Howard,should i go?
6948,Howard,"yeah, cool. seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much."
11528,Howard,"i’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?"
6553,Howard,remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm. 
6897,Howard,i had to take her! it’s almost bathing suit weather!
9999,Howard,they are only from me. you said the gift of you was enough.
8898,Howard,they invented blintzes. i’ll be fine.
6493,Howard,did someone say party? 
11627,Howard,those are just the things i say out loud.
10708,Howard,give me the number. probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual i have. 
6270,Howard,"so, what do you say, you wanna repair to castle wolowitz? "
9910,Howard,she’s right. 
6450,Howard,will you forget dibs! 
11653,Howard,"and with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. you’d be the king of the train store."
8498,Howard,thank you.
7492,Howard,i’m already on vibrate.
8425,Howard,"and we have splashdown. wait here, i’m gonna go light a candle. and then we make passionate love."
9004,Howard,you okay?
10074,Howard,sure.
11661,Howard,and the car ride puts her to sleep.
7616,Howard,"no, but it’s close. look at the markings inside. those are production markings. nine rings were made for use in the lord of the rings movies. three were given to members of the cast. the rest were destroyed. except one. one was stolen. gentlemen, this is the one ring."
7122,Howard,that’s classified.
8076,Howard,we’re not quitting on leonard.
7627,Howard,then let go!
8164,Howard,"i’m not having this conversation with you, ma!"
6438,Howard,"not necessary, i have a masters in engineering, i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. when the mars rover started pulling to the left i performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  no, that baby’s broken. "
9539,Howard,"seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. the-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now ogre thanksgiving is ruined."
7358,Howard,"hey, at least i can talk to women without being drunk."
10006,Howard,"well, don’t do it on the phone."
10527,Howard,"uh, that was my aunt. ma took a nap. she never woke up."
10342,Howard,"i didn’t take her, she was a chaperone."
7332,Howard,more wine?
6535,Howard,thy will be done. 
8554,Howard,very.
11290,Howard,"oh, my god. it’s working."
11927,Howard,"…bernadette! thank you, cheesecake factory!"
7679,Howard,jews don’t have hell. we have acid reflux.
7309,Howard,great. so what did you tell her about me? did you mention the body fat?
8831,Howard,yeah?
9979,Howard,you just went to the bathroom.
6761,Howard,nice. cotton?
7021,Howard,"yeah, that one. you can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in los angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what i call the wolowitz coefficient."
9434,Howard,"whoa, you opened this?"
7146,Howard,there’s no time for a crossbow. find me an icicle.
11271,Howard,but i got a baby on the way. i got to make some money.
8291,Howard,"it’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?"
10803,Howard,"it was for this power trio i tried to put together in junior high, but i was short two friends."
7172,Howard,sorry. i’ll take a diet yoo-hoo if you have it.
9992,Howard,should we stop holding hands now?
8330,Howard,"sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. i’m not taking you home."
11537,Howard,hm. she would’ve been the best grandma.
9789,Howard,i promise i’ll help out the rest of the week.
11207,Howard,"all right, here we go."
6737,Howard,okay.
8564,Howard,you wore underwear? you fool.
10528,Howard,i don’t know.
6638,Howard,"sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point."
6374,Howard,"something’s got to be done about him, leonard."
7375,Howard,"no, i mean, she’s obviously way out of line."
6731,Howard,"ok, i guess we have to turn to plan b."
7294,Howard,"well, i guess game’s over."
7566,Howard,"i bet if we all chipped in, we could buy sheldon a van."
11589,Howard,"bigger problems, i felt something pop. "
21715,Howard,i haven’t seen your oreos! just take your bath without them! 
9147,Howard,"yes, i’m sure. now, you stand guard, i’m going to…"
8545,Howard,"all right, sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
10852,Howard,"howard? uh-oh. make room, visigoths. ‘sup?"
8054,Howard,"relax. no one’s going to be looking at her hair. ow! i mean, ow."
7562,Howard,"not this time, i promise."
8768,Howard,out!
6299,Howard,"every year at comic con. every day at disneyland you can hire snow white to come to your house. course they prefer it if you have a kid, but… "
8114,Howard,"so, how’d the lecture go?"
8458,Howard,"the puppy died, it choked on a doll head. sad face, sad face!"
11670,Howard,that’s understandable.
7962,Howard,i have a girlfriend and you don’t.
9969,Howard,isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
11772,Howard,you want to hear my stuart? it’s been a while since i’ve gone on a date. you mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
8769,Howard,it was great. we talked about movies.
9288,Howard,"look, leonard, there’s a bridge. drive off it."
7568,Howard,that’s not true. my happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
10057,Howard,"well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you."
6559,Howard,"no, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so i’m going to slow down and spit it out.”"
9553,Howard,"calm down, bernie. you’re very scary."
11931,Howard,"yeah, i miss you, too, sweetie. listen, i got to go, but i’ll see you tonight? okay. bye-bye. yeah, bye-bye. no, you hang up first. hello?"
7789,Howard,don’t come up here!
9745,Howard,and the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
8316,Howard,i was filled with adrenaline. it happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
7754,Howard,"well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
7882,Howard,"you wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? yeah, forget it. not important. so, are you seeing anyone?"
7037,Howard,really?
9098,Howard,"thank you, i only put it on the list two weeks ago. okay, i see what you’re getting at. how about this weekend i’ll box up all my things and move them to our place."
10132,Howard,"oh, come on, give her a chance."
6272,Howard,anything you want.
8924,Howard,"ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
8946,Howard,"okay, here it is. bernadette and i are starting a life together and…"
8894,Howard,"no! when i eat froot loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
6399,Howard,"gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. fishman, chen, chowdry, mcnair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. "
9768,Howard,so your wife’s in arizona with the grandkids?
11672,Howard,what if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?
11626,Howard,"well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly i know my way around tiny things."
11569,Howard,good night. i love both my girls.
7104,Howard,you don’t know what this is?
11996,Howard,wondering how it all began?
8636,Howard,you can’t do buzz. buzz is taken.
7392,Howard,"alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed."
11109,Howard,that’s funny. let’s do that.
9509,Howard,"yeah, that’s what i was doing."
7750,Howard,four thirty.
11840,Howard,"no. then you’ll get all sexed up and i’m not in the mood. i mean, an entire year wasted."
8261,Howard,that’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
11878,Howard,"ladies, ladies, i’m sure there’s a middle ground."
10522,Howard,that is a good point. but i didn’t marry you for good points. i married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous i’m being.
11985,Howard,"indy’ whip snapped, thor’s hammer missed."
9648,Howard,you sound kind of proud of it.
6815,Howard,"cherry, please!"
8748,Howard,i told everybody.
8377,Howard,damn those sons of bitches!
8444,Howard,maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
8595,Howard,i’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. i always thought i’d be a dad someday.
8975,Howard,"hey, bernie, guess what? i stood up to the other astronauts like you said and i got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week i got a good night’s sleep. "
8767,Howard,get out.
7120,Howard,"well, they’ve deployed our solution. let’s just all hope it works."
10726,Howard,right. you’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. can you believe this guy?
8943,Howard,"hey, ma. you know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer."
10276,Howard,you admit amy’s a distraction?
11929,Howard,do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
9103,Howard,"my religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good."
10823,Howard,"oh, one sec."
11989,Howard,"all right, we got a problem."
11454,Howard,"oh, right. "
11665,Howard,"well, how much do you spend on food?"
10389,Howard,i did. it’s all outdated or disproved.
8009,Howard,they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
10719,Howard,"for your information, i twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck."
11360,Howard,it’s pretty late. you think i’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
11969,Howard,"come on, guys. let’s do this."
11081,Howard,"and then there’s this nose. i mean, what if he looks like me? or worse, what if she looks like me?"
11330,Howard,"oh, yeah. how do you think i stay this thin?"
7222,Howard,i’m howard.
11310,Howard,hang on.
11784,Howard,i guess. it wasn’t until college that i learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
8951,Howard,"now, can we please change the subject?"
9731,Howard,"you know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where i can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your dna in it."
10954,Howard,"so if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy."
6255,Howard,i’m supposed to give him a ride home.
10626,Howard,"bernadette, weird things are happening out here."
7805,Howard,"thank you, sir."
8004,Howard,way to go shutting up.
9398,Howard,"oh, come on, raj."
9626,Howard,"riddle me this. arrah, arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. he multiplies n by the number of he, and in this room the thing you’ll see."
11668,Howard,wait. why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
7241,Howard,what comes after the stencil?
9729,Howard,"okay, who’s up first?"
7112,Howard,because this is not a spare part from the space station. this is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
9458,Howard,why?
6945,Howard,"okay, see you."
7450,Howard,ouch.
9108,Howard,that was just for her benefit. i’ll move tomorrow. i love you. don’t leave me.
10802,Howard,"you know, i’ve actually had one i’ve been sitting on for years."
6972,Howard,"and did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the german words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?"
7623,Howard,"if you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great aunt ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat."
11743,Howard,"hey, what’s for dinner?"
11976,Howard,what do you want?
10898,Howard,then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire.
9960,Howard,i didn’t do anything. i was just sitting here.
10056,Howard,"yeah, yeah, i get it."
8286,Howard,"okay, i’m still trying to work this out. how did penny meet an astronaut?"
6708,Howard,"you know what? if it’s creepy to use the internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, i’m creepy."
6294,Howard,"no, no, let’s see how long it takes him."
9162,Howard,"that’s forty-two, dumb-ass."
8539,Howard,"so, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of amy. she’s kind of upset."
8434,Howard,great. we spent five hours last night at macy’s registering for gifts. looks like i’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish i’ve always wanted.
11185,Howard,oh. that’s cool. can we try it?
8369,Howard,"hey, if i wasn’t engaged to bernadette, that totally could have been me."
6306,Howard,"the monster truck is out of austin, texas, and the blue viper is being operated from suburban tel aviv. "
6809,Howard,thanks for the heads up.
7432,Howard,"hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
10958,Howard,why is he looking at it?
8422,Howard,"come on, take a break! bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
9810,Howard,"what are you talking about? remember last week, when i asked you if you were wearing spanx and you weren’t? how’s that different?"
6192,Howard,"perfect, leonard, why don’t you and sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, raj and i will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
8603,Howard,"don’t worry, ma. i will, as soon as i can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
6961,Howard,"no, no, no, that always creeps girls out. i need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature."
7047,Howard,"nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedar-sinai for a week."
9795,Howard,why bother? she spends half the time licking her butt.
10346,Howard,do you like her because you both have red hair?
11444,Howard,yes.
10010,Howard,while you confront your mother about her sex life? i’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
10945,Howard,"so, who is this guy?"
11949,Howard,"bernie, you okay?"
11411,Howard,we should call the police.
9889,Howard,why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
6604,Howard,i do that too. but probably in a different way.
8932,Howard,they do. that’s why we marry them.
6289,Howard,just give it to me. 
7288,Howard,"oh. i get it, i’m the third wheel. sorry, i should have seen that. i’ll get out of your way. uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
11078,Howard,"yeah, um, in a minute. i actually need to tell you guys something."
8514,Howard,"nope. she says if i don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. it would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still."
8371,Howard,who?
9010,Howard,all right. woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. suddenly she’s not decent?
6510,Howard,"no, you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. they say it completely changes the tone of the film. "
9009,Howard,"yeah, well, bernie’s not feeling well, so i thought i’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it."
9163,Howard,we should stop. i’m exhausted.
7064,Howard,"great, just start."
9172,Howard,"oh, my god!"
7820,Howard,"think about it, raj. where did the movie rocky take place?"
8260,Howard,"yeah, she’s kind of a wheel savant."
8146,Howard,you lucky duck.
7438,Howard,"well, you know, more like megan fox from transformers, or katee sackhoff from battlestar galactica."
10327,Howard,it’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
7772,Howard,you kidding? they still think it’s in a secure locker at jpl.
6829,Howard,look at me. what chance do i have if i don’t try too hard?
6837,Howard,"hey, i’m thinking of growing a mustache."
9008,Howard,"hey, ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. ma, the chain’s on the door."
10039,Howard,"me, too. i just hope he doesn’t blow it."
8264,Howard,"yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?"
10068,Howard,hey. thanks for coming to hang out.
6461,Howard,"was it perhaps destiny, i think it was destiny. "
10356,Howard,yeah.
10020,Howard,why do you have to choose? date both of them.
9616,Howard,"if it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake."
9482,Howard,what?
11204,Howard,"no, raj, you’ve been great. i just, i need to start doing my part around here."
9117,Howard,"i know. it’s just ever since my dad left, i’ve felt responsible for her."
7883,Howard,"not for me, thanks."
11359,Howard,"oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
11566,Howard,do you need help getting out?
8581,Howard,you’ll do fine. hand me those rings? see? you nailed it.
8625,Howard,"yeah, what are we eating?"
8292,Howard,sure.
9335,Howard,yes. and can you please make that out to bernadette? i was taken off the joint account until i learn the value of money.
8026,Howard,you got a better idea?
9932,Howard,"sit down. nasa called. the telescope mount i installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it."
9917,Howard,he said it.
7039,Howard,"well, if i get lucky, i don’t want to be caught in my aquaman briefs."
10910,Howard,"oh, i can’t. i’m going to the soup kitchen, too."
6375,Howard,then our problem would be solved. 
7608,Howard,one ring to bring them all.
11612,Howard,"thanks, ladies, this was fun. let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
9031,Howard,"yes. yes, i am."
8216,Howard,is that your card?
8315,Howard,"no, i did what any son would do."
10306,Howard,"for your information, i just bought the last one i needed on ebay."
11951,Howard,i’ll get it!
7550,Howard,"don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
6169,Howard,bon douche.
10055,Howard,"look, i have felt terrible about this for years, and i’m glad i have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry i am."
8255,Howard,"well, quite a bit, actually."
8536,Howard,why are they asking me about this stuff? what guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? 
6803,Howard,"well, that may be a slight exaggeration. you’d be the only doable girl."
7749,Howard,"right. so, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
11153,Howard,scientifically? a little over a year ago. legos? last week in my room.
9507,Howard,"she really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
7322,Howard,how about computers? do you like computers?
11249,Howard,i bet you’d like a drink right now.
9082,Howard,"there’s the problem. you can’t beat hawking like that. he hates to lose. everyone knows the guy’s a big baby. i mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller."
9912,Howard,i am.
11431,Howard,are we even in a good school…? ow!
11030,Howard,really? you don’t think she’s attractive?
11682,Howard,"oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. i’m such a lucky guy."
9090,Howard,good for you.
8628,Howard,"check it out, press release from nasa."
8755,Howard,"hm, it’s no big deal."
6256,Howard,"watch this, it’s really cool. call leonard hofstadter."
11677,Howard,what if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?
8484,Howard,"i hope not too tired, because i’m feeling particularly masculine right now. all systems go, if you catch my drift."
8919,Howard,"yeah, so?"
6839,Howard,"oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
7285,Howard,"by the way, i couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. bravo, leonard."
9606,Howard,"so, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?"
6316,Howard,more often than you’d think.
8092,Howard,yes. bernie sure is.
10150,Howard,"no, not like us. creepy chummy, like you and your dog."
7289,Howard,ill just hang out with my mom. that’s always fun.
6927,Howard,"i’ll pick you up in ten minutes. gentlemen, adieu."
11534,Howard,debbie? no. she hated that name.
10977,Howard,hi.
8860,Howard,"you’re right, he is! your dad’s gonna be furious. there’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. well, we tried."
8233,Howard,"that’s pathetic. let me show you how a real magician does it. raj, take a card. don’t let me see it."
10452,Howard,now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
10644,Howard,"ooh, how about a 3-d tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?"
8832,Howard,i’m not calling the girl from comic-con.
11226,Howard,"oh, please. what could you possibly have that i would be jealous of?"
10857,Howard,"oh. making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died."
9887,Howard,and that’s where darth vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
11048,Howard,"you’re welcome. um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?"
8577,Howard,"ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
10712,Howard,"well, i’m not flying it."
10007,Howard,"that’s some tough talk, i may need to cut you off."
8790,Howard,"sheldon, these look great. they’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. how’d you get them so shiny?"
8449,Howard,he likes your eyes.
11501,Howard,"all right, we’re done. it’s offensive."
10257,Howard,he’s right.
10830,Howard,yeah. i already ran 18 miles today.
6570,Howard,shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? 
7978,Howard,is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? that happens with me and my mom all the time.
10431,Howard,"well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out."
6585,Howard,"i don’t care what the bosoms say, sheldon, i just want to be part of the conversation."
7455,Howard,"wait, bernadette, i need to talk to you."
6960,Howard,"i will, i’m just working on my opening line."
8631,Howard,are you not listening to me? the other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
7478,Howard,"wow! you really are a piece of work. it’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
8757,Howard,yep.
7785,Howard,what? no saws! one circumcision was enough.
7495,Howard,me? no. i may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
11803,Howard,kids are always better at video games.
7226,Howard,oy vay.
10701,Howard,hey.
6706,Howard,what are you complaining about? i’m the one who has to take the class again.
11814,Howard,so you told her she was being dumb?
6446,Howard,"screw his balcony, i’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage. "
7628,Howard,i say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
7687,Howard,you said you were going for a walk.
9722,Howard,"oh, that’s actually pretty nice."
9027,Howard,"absolutely. see you, stuart."
8359,Howard,why?
6240,Howard,"as in, costumes? "
10317,Howard,"i want that, too."
7976,Howard,"don’t be oversensitive. he’s calling you illiterate, not your race."
6252,Howard,"no, seriously, you can, i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
10281,Howard,here we go.
10398,Howard,"ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. we could start with basic cryptanalysis."
11640,Howard,"i don’t know, but if he yells it’s alive, we run."
10378,Howard,not important.
11322,Howard,"calm down, try not to think about it."
11731,Howard,you sure you don’t fit in? you sound like a catty bitch to me.
11587,Howard,"so, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. watch. it’s easy,"
8509,Howard,"well, those big kids were rocking it."
10523,Howard,"i’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy."
10524,Howard,hold that thought.  hello?
11581,Howard,is that supposed to be funny?
8420,Howard,ready for bed?
11834,Howard,this is all very upsetting.
10832,Howard,he’s a righty.
7690,Howard,i parked my scooter down the block.
10094,Howard,yeah.
8500,Howard,what choice did i have? she went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
9517,Howard,nice.
11889,Howard,if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon. 
11576,Howard,"yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why i bought the rug. "
6243,Howard,"i’m not peter pan, i’m robin hood. "
10778,Howard,"oh, not a problem. if anything goes down, we just put koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
10589,Howard,you guys ever notice sometimes bernadette sounds like my mom?
8200,Howard,"whoa, whoa, whoa! where did that come from?"
10839,Howard,what’s up?
8974,Howard,no. my mom already tried that. it only made things worse.
10709,Howard,"what happened to me? when did i become an old man baffled by modern technology? next thing you know, i’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to."
11029,Howard,"so, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
7004,Howard,"i’ll take the apartment upstairs. i can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift."
10591,Howard,"all right, amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75."
8664,Howard,"i know, it’s not on my wedding diet. i don’t care."
10289,Howard,"hold on. pause. something doesn’t make sense. look, in 2015, biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. but as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that marty and doc were in."
9385,Howard,"i’m telling you, something’s wrong. i can always feel it when raj is in trouble."
10199,Howard,"i’m smart enough, sheldon. asking me a bunch of questions about a topic i’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. i could do the same to you."
9808,Howard,"um, is this getting weird?"
11644,Howard,all right. hmm. feel free to jump in. hmm is all i got.
7558,Howard,"boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?"
10817,Howard,"oh, please. your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you."
11225,Howard,just drop it.
8075,Howard,howard wolowitz. why not world’s greatest engineer?
6278,Howard,"so, halo night, huh? "
9809,Howard,"so, yes."
10697,Howard,one toy at a time.
10426,Howard,"well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?"
9919,Howard,he said it.
10255,Howard,"hey, what difference does it make? you’re the one she wants to marry."
7633,Howard,i’ll call you back.
11505,Howard,"this is very nice stuart, thank you."
11645,Howard,maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
9688,Howard,"i want to do something special, and i was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
7967,Howard,"let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
7523,Howard,"yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and leonard. these broncos have been saddled."
7699,Howard,"yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
10725,Howard,"well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge."
11387,Howard,mm.
7712,Howard,"that’s why we moved halo night here. look, i brought my mom’s chicken soup."
8785,Howard,you should be so lucky.
10250,Howard,"you know, when i was a kid, i loved going there, but i could never get a ride."
8699,Howard,"oh, wow, where do i even start? i got to experience zero gravity."
11142,Howard,is the foetus helping you? ‘cause that’s cheating.
10386,Howard,we’re just saying all the things we love about each other.
11963,Howard,you’re right. i suppose that could be considered offensive.
8647,Howard,"no problem, dr. massimino."
10015,Howard,"yeah, she was dating this guy, and i was kind of a jerk to her about it."
8089,Howard,what could we do? he’s the travel supervisor.
6209,Howard,"there are pitfalls, trust me, i know. when it comes to sexual harassment law i’m… a bit of a self-taught expert. "
11849,Howard,i know and i’m sorry.
9925,Howard,okay. thank you. we’ll be in touch. you’re not gonna believe this.
10766,Howard,"leonard, wait."
6744,Howard,sheldon?
6473,Howard,"so what, you’ve already got penny. "
7160,Howard,thanks. i call it the clooney.
10758,Howard,"and you have every right to be mad about those things. so, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? i mean, don’t even look at it."
9265,Howard,who the hell is svaty vaclav?
10634,Howard,"well, i hope i get to see you again."
7071,Howard,i say vegas baby!
9025,Howard,so i’d be sitting by myself?
9455,Howard,it’s okay. sorry i ran off like that.
11091,Howard,"maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
8062,Howard,a few extra bucks would be nice. i could finally move out of my mother’s house.
6752,Howard,look at leonard’s record. 27 days with joyce kim.
6835,Howard,"oh, no. a little electrical tape, some solder. are you insane? i’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
7472,Howard,thought i’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
9698,Howard,e-ni-ni-ni-ni-no.
6757,Howard,yes.
8784,Howard,are you familiar with the 12 labours of hercules?
8573,Howard,don’t be so hard on him. it’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
11430,Howard,do we? look at you. willy wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
7027,Howard,"yes, but i saw it from the front."
11485,Howard,you busy? there’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
9890,Howard,why do you think i told him to come to your place?
9724,Howard,be right back.
6594,Howard,"yeah, so, be a tool. go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
10506,Howard,yes.
11674,Howard,you actually think penny will have fun at comic-con?
6323,Howard,wow.
8504,Howard,tell her i’m not home!
10950,Howard,"uh, did you forget? we’re in a band."
8055,Howard,"well, actually."
6955,Howard,that’s it.
10829,Howard,and maybe a little princess bride.
8626,Howard,yes. his phone.
9160,Howard,"ah, it took him two years to put together that lego death star, i’m not worried."
6992,Howard,we add bluetooth!
10302,Howard,i didn’t think they were going to. i just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting leonard’s feelings.
10387,Howard,doesn’t professor abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
11522,Howard,sorry. i know you were just trying to help. i love you.
8606,Howard,me?
11551,Howard,what did we miss?
7844,Howard,"okay, if you insist."
6723,Howard,"no, there were three other guys with eye patches, iit was a fiasco. what did work was, “how’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”"
6917,Howard,"that wasn’t quite the word i was looking for, but sure, i’ll do this pass-fail."
11691,Howard,hey.
8758,Howard,not on your life.
10347,Howard,"oh, my god."
9034,Howard,"oh, hey, stuart, i got you a little souvenir from my trip to space."
11296,Howard,i can’t believe i was so naive. the military is just gonna take over the whole project. and you know what happens if we object? we disappear. like off the map. like every american idol winner since season four.
6336,Howard,"hang on, call waiting."
6305,Howard,public access enabled. 
8102,Howard,yep. loser.
7993,Howard,"three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 rupees, six, seven, whoops. can’t go any further. there’s a sacred cow in my way."
10030,Howard,you’re reading cosmo?
10156,Howard,it’s not that precious.
9973,Howard,you’re the reason i’m doing it.
9328,Howard,i thought you might.
7571,Howard,"i understand your point, but given a choice, jews always go with chinese food."
9693,Howard,great. will you play the ukulele?
10450,Howard,will you please relax?
9026,Howard,"no, no, you guys go. have fun."
6712,Howard,follow mrs. wolowitz.
10808,Howard,"oh yes, definitely. hang on. thunder clapped as thor raised his mighty hammer. indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma."
6354,Howard,"you don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true. "
7676,Howard,"so would ben affleck. the point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. you’re either on team leonard or team penny."
7569,Howard,"although, i’d be lying if i said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk."
9682,Howard,thanks for getting me in trouble.
9301,Howard,i’m with leonard. i’m done.
11393,Howard,screw it. i’m calling and finding out.
8083,Howard,we have.
6581,Howard,"please, i’m begging you, go to sleep."
8528,Howard,whatever. 
10863,Howard,yes. so back me up. the house is good the way it is.
10682,Howard,"no red and yellow, no red and yellow."
9836,Howard,"aw, he’s already taking after uncle shelly."
10821,Howard,"raj, wait."
11242,Howard,"um, guys? were there any nuts in that food?"
6562,Howard,"let’s go to the tape. look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
10734,Howard,"agreed. when he gets home, i’m dropping the hammer."
11611,Howard,"well, like you gals, i had to suffer through him to find bernadette."
9456,Howard,"uh, pictures of my dad and me when i was a kid."
7990,Howard,"yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
8231,Howard,okay.
7011,Howard,yum. starving.
11866,Howard,"we should call guinness, that might be a record."
8068,Howard,"hey, i…"
9840,Howard,"if you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, i could set you up with my mom."
8938,Howard,"hey, look, this pen is floating. how crazy is that?"
10618,Howard,"yeah, i bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass."
6314,Howard,"it’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine. "
11377,Howard,no.
8050,Howard,"yeah, she seems happier. why wouldn’t we be?"
7741,Howard,you’re kidding. an actual woman?
11349,Howard,four months?
8239,Howard,"oh, that’s too bad. figure out the magic trick yet?"
10087,Howard,"since we all agree episode i isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time."
11646,Howard,"hey, i came up with that and hmm. you haven’t pitched anything."
6303,Howard,are we ready on the stereo? 
10134,Howard,"well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months."
8752,Howard,"believe me, i know. the e-mail i got was from the office of stephen hawking."
9472,Howard,you ph.d’s gonna go suck up like kripke?
11657,Howard,"yeah, we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it."
11335,Howard,give me a second to call my cousin.
6456,Howard,"i know, i’m disgusting, i should be punished. by her, oh look, i did it again. "
7641,Howard,we stand up.
10871,Howard,"oh. okay, so we must be under the dining room."
6705,Howard,voila!
8173,Howard,"yeah, some work thing. anyway, my mother seems to think that bernadette…"
10636,Howard,that’s not what she meant.
11630,Howard,"sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. go home."
8989,Howard,"step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. i’ll leave the door unlocked."
10361,Howard,"oh, my god, i, i’m sorry. i mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here."
8039,Howard,"you pathetic fool! if there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch rat-man?"
8870,Howard,"so, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. now, i know what you’re going to say, i made a commitment to bernadette and to your family and i’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. well, message heard and understood. mission cancelled. thank you."
6437,Howard,if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. 
11902,Howard,"hey, it’s me again. howard. listen, my cousins from fort lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant."
9283,Howard,"relax. everything’s gonna be fine. before i met bernadette i was in here every other day. uh, little tip, turn off your i like big butts ringtone before you go in."
8945,Howard,"what do you want, ma?"
8728,Howard,i’ll miss you more.
11702,Howard,i’m gonna go check on dinner.
9816,Howard,you made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
8032,Howard,"oh, for crying out loud. what kind of superhero needs a jacket?"
11441,Howard,"imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am i gonna open this trunk?"
11623,Howard,"hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
6244,Howard,"just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky i’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. "
11548,Howard,"hey, guys."
11071,Howard,are you serious?
6618,Howard,"oh crap, that’s terrifying."
10531,Howard,"all right, fine. where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? the first, well,"
7377,Howard,"come on. at the very least, when she found out leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off."
10471,Howard,"here we go, my first hindu temple."
11452,Howard,"i’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one."
9050,Howard,"okay, no problem. it won’t happen again."
11221,Howard,"actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
8321,Howard,it’s not important.
7096,Howard,it’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
7235,Howard,she’s not going to see it. she takes my temperature orally now.
8711,Howard,no. wait. send more underwear.
10385,Howard,and i love how your hair is always on the soap. it’s like washing myself with a hamster.
9304,Howard,"leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler."
7428,Howard,"you know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
8107,Howard,"interesting. i think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry."
8837,Howard,do you want me to go?
9208,Howard,"wow, okay. well, thanks. i don’t know what to say."
8812,Howard,"kangaroo, uh, i’d be a kanga-jew. the first of my people to dunk a basketball."
10229,Howard,why shouldn’t i do it?
9307,Howard,"easy. his family’s loaded, and bernadette has a great job. my wife came with both fun bags and money bags."
7399,Howard,cookie?
6962,Howard,"do you believe him? normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. put one beer in him, and he’s m. night charmalarmalon."
11298,Howard,"oh, please, that’s not how it works. you saw e.t., avatar, jurassic world. the military just shows up and takes over."
11222,Howard,"oh, i wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
8249,Howard,our troll just walked in! i got him!
7314,Howard,"oh, cool. so you could study me."
6184,Howard,"yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
8749,Howard,"well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
10295,Howard,we could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
8161,Howard,look at us planning a future together.
6386,Howard,i don’t think you mean we can’t. i think you mean we shouldn’t. 
7151,Howard,"okay, sheldon, sit down."
8494,Howard,well why not?
11884,Howard,"howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. why are you calling at this ungodly hour? "
8338,Howard,yeah. do you?
7024,Howard,"alright, but next anything can happen thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar."
8486,Howard,"oh, i get it. you’re worried about me. that is so sweet. you know, there’s a saying we have at nasa. what makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
11277,Howard,let’s do it.
8481,Howard,"oh, well, it’s really cool. you fly to moscow, they take you out to kazakhstan, and then you get into a russian soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. or just sits there on the launch pad because the kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
9644,Howard,wow. sex at work?
8086,Howard,"actually, i was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap."
6376,Howard,"we don’t have to go that far, there are other means available."
10501,Howard,"uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
9618,Howard,have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
9085,Howard,"i can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry."
7347,Howard,it’s not a little scooter. it’s the second biggest vespa they make! are you watching football?
10866,Howard,"look, uh, i don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing."
7474,Howard,no.
6197,Howard,"don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
9891,Howard,i can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
8899,Howard,wow. okay. let’s get married.
6592,Howard,like who?
10019,Howard,both great.
7418,Howard,you’re a real douche.
7747,Howard,"well, him about to find out about her."
11456,Howard,"i’m serious, jpl’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us."
9038,Howard,"anywhere but the space station. on a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. but, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view."
8977,Howard,"hey, bernie."
7989,Howard,"oh, i, i’m sorry, galileo drank diet sprite. look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. you know, like you and my mom did."
8160,Howard,"we wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom."
6219,Howard,right. sorry.
11662,Howard,"oh, no, now we have two."
7048,Howard,"possible, very possible. do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
10116,Howard,"i’m coming, you big baby."
8927,Howard,"hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! until i met you, i couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. and now i can’t imagine spending one day of it without you."
11512,Howard,that’d be great.
11368,Howard,thanks again for breakfast.
8754,Howard,i was actually thinking about bringing him along when i go over there so he can meet the great man.
10573,Howard,okay. then how about this? let’s invite everyone over to dinner. it’ll be like ma’s feeding us one last time.
11402,Howard,"honey, how ya feeling?  so that’s good news, right?"
10225,Howard,"that’s your help? that’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
9421,Howard,please be cinderella. please be cinderella.
6833,Howard,"yes, i slipped and fell. in the bathroom. bounced right off the tub."
10637,Howard,it was actually just a mechanical hand.
8705,Howard,"uh-huh. except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset sabbath service like they do at camp hess-kramer."
11568,Howard,"good job, mommy. i’m proud of you."
7863,Howard,i just have a question. does bernadette ever talk about me?
9143,Howard,i think we’re more like ninjas.
11846,Howard,i missed you.
6569,Howard,who is it?
9948,Howard,really?
11474,Howard,"hey! i saw your car… oh, sorry. am i interrupting?"
10940,Howard,why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
7480,Howard,"not so far, but that’s not the point!"
10017,Howard,all i’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
8279,Howard,"i know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but i just have to tell you, from the moment i…"
8184,Howard,uh…
10451,Howard,"nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
7624,Howard,"so, sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
10655,Howard,right. i couldn’t change if i wanted to.
9184,Howard,give it back.
9404,Howard,"come on, if i was any good at convincing women to do stuff, i wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower."
11315,Howard,"that’s great, now they know where i live."
6397,Howard,"ooh, more details about the new star trek film. there’s going to be a scene depicting spock’s birth. "
6895,Howard,no go. the dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory.
10076,Howard,"beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets."
8366,Howard,hey.
8559,Howard,"ooh, a sheriff’s badge."
6849,Howard,"okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… "
7136,Howard,"oh, boy, am i gonna get sued."
11243,Howard,well just a feeling.
10091,Howard,that’s what good friends would do.
10151,Howard,"i mean, he calls her debbie, she calls him stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. and believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out."
10467,Howard,"so, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?"
10770,Howard,"wow, okay."
6328,Howard,"i know it’s the phone, ma, i hear the phone."
10013,Howard,"you know, i, i sort of went through something like this myself."
6589,Howard,"so, how do you explain the ten years before penny?"
9109,Howard,"boy, if these walls could talk."
11202,Howard,is it baby hormones or actually sad?
8499,Howard,"i love you, too. so, sex now?"
10130,Howard,why?
8724,Howard,"i had no choice. last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the arboretum. and i said, well, no, i promised the guys i was going to play a video game with them all weekend. and she said, that sounds like fun, can i come, too? and then i didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? and then i bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now."
7817,Howard,"um, tell us about your work, amy."
8900,Howard,"i mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us."
11940,Howard,he says he’ll wear it if you’ll be aquaman.
8646,Howard,"yes, please listen to mr. big shot astronaut. hey, good morning."
6587,Howard,"thanks, my mom made it. penny with a new guy, tres awkward."
10454,Howard,a story can do two things.
9219,Howard,i’m sensing a theme. you ever really think about the spider-man theme song? how’s that dinner coming?
7170,Howard,thank you kindly.
10691,Howard,i’m an mit-trained engineer. i’ve built components for the space station.
10942,Howard,someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
8396,Howard,"oh, yeah."
7113,Howard,where are you going?
7498,Howard,"i was in bed with bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
11112,Howard,can we just all agree we’re worried about affleck?
7646,Howard,"yeah, the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
10465,Howard,"well, because i’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in god, and last diwali i watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a brazilian steak house."
6796,Howard,why couldn’t you have just done what leonard did and get penny a new boyfriend?
6261,Howard,"well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
11031,Howard,you weren’t there. he was really flirting.
11273,Howard,because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
8340,Howard,"well, based on the available evid…"
9691,Howard,sheldon?
8589,Howard,just give me the pitcher. behold! wrong pitcher.
9228,Howard,"you know, i hadn’t thought of that.  help me."
10260,Howard,"oh, come on."
7654,Howard,"oh, that’s not a good name."
6858,Howard,"okay, i guess we only have one option."
6236,Howard,"yes, but you don’t have to lose to kyle bernstein’s bar-mitzvah party. "
8828,Howard,what is this?
11991,Howard,for joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
10916,Howard,so we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
8041,Howard,ice dragon.
7681,Howard,i wish you were aquaman. then i could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
11544,Howard,we have named her halley.
6869,Howard,"leonard, wait. take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little."
10148,Howard,"he was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. and honestly, i’m kind of glad. it was getting a little weird."
6793,Howard,this one. let’s go.
10569,Howard,"it’s not just food. this is the last food my mother ever made. this is her last brisket. this is her last meatloaf. this is her last. i have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one."
9853,Howard,hi.
6263,Howard,"in the shower. oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t."
6490,Howard,"well i love birthdays, waking up to mom’s special french toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
7732,Howard,horse.
9319,Howard,"do you realize, by owning a 3-d printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in china?"
9134,Howard,"hey, alex, do you know where your boss just went?"
10861,Howard,i want to change my answer.
8798,Howard,"oh, come on, the man torments me. i’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
9697,Howard,make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and i don’t want to blow the surprise.
6887,Howard,"just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship."
7050,Howard,"no, we have a little prep work to do. put this in your mouth. we walk past them, you stumble a bit. i say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then i start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. get it? i mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires."
7970,Howard,"where did he go?  we’re looking for sheldon, not marmaduke."
11915,Howard,"fine, i’ll stay! you happy, crazy lady? i sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!"
6640,Howard,"and he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties."
8355,Howard,what’s up?
9318,Howard,we don’t need malibu koothrappali’s dream house.
8356,Howard,"sure, but i’m going out with bernadette. it’ll just be you and my mother."
10645,Howard,i am making molecular cocktails. this sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
8078,Howard,eureka!
7001,Howard,"sorry, guys, but secret agent laser obstacle lunch is just stupid."
6958,Howard,"well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
7303,Howard,"leonard, a pact is a pact. you have to get penny to fix me up."
9156,Howard,what kind of secret does sheldon have to encrypt?
9331,Howard,not just for a couple of dolls. for as many dolls as we want. and whistles.
6288,Howard,give me the phone.
9549,Howard,"no, in a couple of weeks, stephen hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the north sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. one of their experimental physicists dropped out, and i recommended you."
7771,Howard,"no, not peace. hang on."
10969,Howard,ready to go?
10135,Howard,"well, what if we use our vacation time?"
10323,Howard,"oh, come on. it’s a replica."
8088,Howard,"no, see, it’s not…"
7195,Howard,shh!
6347,Howard,well?
11647,Howard,you really figured it out?
7933,Howard,"hey, i didn’t see you giving back your snoopy snowcone maker."
7292,Howard,unless you have the carrot power.
10669,Howard,you know what? you’re right. i should have asked you.
6933,Howard,"yeah, gee, i’d really rather not."
9619,Howard,it’s the comic book store. let’s go.
7315,Howard,microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
6262,Howard,"oh, yeah, sorry, i’ll have it cleaned."
6981,Howard,"too bad. you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess. uh, leonard died again, sheldon. you’re up."
9783,Howard,they don’t want me.
9694,Howard,"or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
11982,Howard,can i help you?
6179,Howard,do i look puffy? i feel puffy.
6186,Howard,been there.
10922,Howard,"huh. okay, i’ll try it."
7848,Howard,"no, i’m not."
9372,Howard,"oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, i think my gift hits it right out of… "
7436,Howard,"i do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and i’m not sure she’s my type."
9332,Howard,it’s kind of dawning on me now.
9033,Howard,"yes, please.  perfect."
11286,Howard,five.
8361,Howard,so do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
11871,Howard,"oh boy, i was afraid of this."
7940,Howard,"apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. you guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?"
9341,Howard,not exactly. they spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
7881,Howard,"same. i took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out i’m terrified of the ocean."
10788,Howard,exactly. i’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
8375,Howard,fine with me.
10270,Howard,"excuse me. ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and stuart is not your bubala, i’m your bubala. you can’t have more than one bubala."
7857,Howard,no. stop asking.
8801,Howard,"gears and springs from his wheelchair. pretty cool, huh?"
10743,Howard,"well, that’s understandable. you forgot. it’s called happy."
9186,Howard,"sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and i want it back."
9796,Howard,"no, we were waiting for you."
9353,Howard,"okay, raj, listen to me. you need to get out of there."
10479,Howard,i invented a game. you want to play?
11343,Howard,hello.
11829,Howard,"all right, you’re freaking me out."
6508,Howard,how’s it going?
8399,Howard,"all right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go.  yeah, well, now it means her."
10311,Howard,talk about wasted money. what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
9131,Howard,"well, where are you going?"
9924,Howard,"well, that’s the last time i play with that.  i have to take this. hello? 00:04:24,137"
10197,Howard,you reported me to human resources?
9800,Howard,i thought of you the whole time.
11069,Howard,we? what is this?
7827,Howard,the highlight of the evening was when you showed us your bollywood break dancing skills. 
9952,Howard,"go, go, go."
11833,Howard,but why would you do that?
8304,Howard,"hope so. of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl."
11945,Howard,"no, it’s not necessarily proportional. shut up!"
10784,Howard,"wow, this one’s really stuck."
7093,Howard,just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
10700,Howard,"it’s not about the money. it’s about solving a problem. it’s why i became an engineer. it’s what i like to do, it’s what i’m trained to do. it’s who i am."
6682,Howard,why is that mrs. wolowitz crying?
10359,Howard,"so i found this fencing school in burbank that has a jedi class. and if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are."
8152,Howard,"well, gotta go."
11278,Howard,"in fact, that’s usually the trick to it. what time do we need to get there?"
10724,Howard,"like, a random person or somebody she knew?"
8436,Howard,"really? so we’re playing dungeons and dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? isn’t that a little on the nose?"
11415,Howard,is that the hot tub?
9063,Howard,who cares?
7918,Howard,not that i’ve ever seen.
10141,Howard,you call her debbie?
8877,Howard,but what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
6713,Howard,"noticed the eye patch, did you? it’s all part of a technique i’ve been studying for picking up women. you employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable."
8675,Howard,"no. i’m not mad at you. i just wish you would have come to me, so i didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
11268,Howard,"me, too."
9847,Howard,fake a laugh? do you ever do that with me?
9220,Howard,i like rare chicken. let’s do this.
6334,Howard,"for god’s sake, ma, i’m twenty six years old."
11984,Howard,"we will, we will percussive shock you."
11633,Howard,"we can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him."
9316,Howard,"well, the prices have been coming down."
11767,Howard,"oh. okay, well, i get that. it was hard for me when i went back."
10423,Howard,why do you keep assuming it was me?
11908,Howard,it’s hot in here. it must be summer. it’s hot in here. must be summer. it’s hot in here. must be summer.
8269,Howard,19th-century technology.
10720,Howard,"you’re right. it’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. bernie, i made a mess."
11125,Howard,"come on, let’s go."
7199,Howard,"don’t push me, sheldon. i may be small, but i took kung fu when i was 13, and i remember a good deal of it."
11275,Howard,"okay, then. geez, how much wine did you drink?"
9257,Howard,great couple of gals.
7210,Howard,"no, no. i’m going out like this. "
8761,Howard,"sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. why on earth would i want to do something nice for you?"
7100,Howard,"hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
10890,Howard,"if you don’t want to use dating web sites, what do you suggest?"
8879,Howard,"all right, look, i’m gonna level with you. i’m terrified about going into space. what if i don’t make it back?"
10397,Howard,sure. we could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
7997,Howard,hold on. he could come back.
6389,Howard,"interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. "
8904,Howard,"i got this. excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? see, i’m an astronaut and i’m leaving for russia on sunday so i can take a soyuz rocket to the international space station."
10810,Howard,"oh, man, that rocks."
10234,Howard,let’s do it.
11495,Howard,"fine, i will."
10035,Howard,"oh, that’s what it says on the box. right next to dishwasher safe."
10973,Howard,he’s right.
10041,Howard,"in a bad way, very bad."
6199,Howard,"sheldon, he’s got raj, use your sleath spell. sheldon! sheldon!"
10460,Howard,"i’m happy to. i think getting out of the apartment will do you good. so, where we headed?"
11774,Howard,stop looking at that. the day care’s great. it’s on campus. my office is two minutes away. there’s nothing to worry about.
10004,Howard,"well, did she see you in the window?"
10978,Howard,what kind of doctor is she?
9348,Howard,i told her around seven.
6532,Howard,"leonard’s fine. i’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way. "
9309,Howard,what?
6768,Howard,"you know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?"
10164,Howard,"you’re right, i’m not. i think it’s weird."
6919,Howard,"you know, most people don’t get that."
6619,Howard,try less teeth. 
8638,Howard,no.
10497,Howard,you look like you got some rest.
9867,Howard,"no, don’t."
11584,Howard,"okay, space a3, here we go. it’s squeaking. mark it."
9914,Howard,sorry.
10717,Howard,sorry we have to do this.
11405,Howard,how ’bout we stay here? we don’t even have to tell anyone. it’ll be like a secret vacation at home. 
9640,Howard,because her life wasn’t enough?
10147,Howard,i just want to pop in and make sure ma’s okay.
8250,Howard,"so, how do you guys want to play this?"
9249,Howard,"wait, now we’re shooting things?"
11663,Howard,maybe your dad’s right.
7766,Howard,mostly with asian and jewish astronauts.
9543,Howard,it’s a hit. the dragon collapses to the ground.
6326,Howard,"so, road trip to long beach."
11994,Howard,"oh, wow. don’t let him get away."
7317,Howard,do you like science-fiction?
11181,Howard,and it just got weird.
8913,Howard,leaking? what’s leaking?
10948,Howard,look at this. trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
6764,Howard,a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. see the blonde over there? i can hit on her and you can’t.
9657,Howard,"wait, wait, if it wasn’t for indiana jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. "
8014,Howard,"first of all, if we had superpowers, i wouldn’t be the sidekick. you’d be the sidekick."
8147,Howard,how was she?
11819,Howard,i went to see your mom.
10649,Howard,you betcha. the very one.
8135,Howard,"excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. my mother does."
11990,Howard,wanna see a movie?
7183,Howard,you are the authority on just fine.
10519,Howard,"well, maybe i should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. then i could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother."
8012,Howard,"yeah, but who’d want to become rat-man?"
9771,Howard,really? that dumb-ass she used to date? that’s hysterical.
11585,Howard,mm. i hope she has the same amount of sex in it i did. none. next square.
8244,Howard,"whoever did this knew what they were doing. he got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint."
10930,Howard,"oh. i made my wife come down, too."
9436,Howard,"if i wanted to know, i would’ve opened it years ago. the closet looks great. let’s get out of here."
10021,Howard,"what do you mean, yes?"
10211,Howard,"all right, here we go."
9547,Howard,"the love spell takes effect. when sheldon looks at amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. when amy sees sheldon, he looks, well, just like sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. what do you do?"
9100,Howard,let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
9607,Howard,thank you.
10220,Howard,how about now?
9844,Howard,"i’m serious. go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary."
8175,Howard,that’s not really necessary.
7143,Howard,crossbow.
8435,Howard,you mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
6424,Howard,sheldon. 
6296,Howard,"i’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. "
9383,Howard,so where’d you hide it?
9338,Howard,great. come on in.
7886,Howard,"penny, can we have a little privacy?"
8243,Howard,"yeah, he’s gonna win the nobel prize."
8614,Howard,i’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with penny.
7945,Howard,your apology is not accepted.
7280,Howard,want me to leave?
9546,Howard,oh.
6941,Howard,how so?
11448,Howard,"you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair. which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
10090,Howard,or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
7196,Howard,shh! elevator shaft.
8341,Howard,where are you going?
8238,Howard,hey!
10723,Howard,one more time?
10355,Howard,yeah.
9939,Howard,"um, okay. i know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons."
11527,Howard,"all right, enough with the camera."
6980,Howard,"oh, very nice. what’s leonard going to do? does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?"
8658,Howard,"how about florida? they’ve got cape canaveral, they’ve got disney, they’ve got my aunt ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
7534,Howard,are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent cylons?
6686,Howard,and they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
9236,Howard,ew!
10546,Howard,what’s wrong?
11009,Howard,"you know, amy took some time off from him. really improved their relationship."
10536,Howard,"no, i’m not leaving without her."
7855,Howard,i did a stupid thing.
9104,Howard,and i will.
10265,Howard,"well, i don’t like to talk about it."
10694,Howard,"relax, it’ll be fine."
10943,Howard,"something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. we’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’."
10104,Howard,you mean a forklift?
9523,Howard,you have her?
10609,Howard,"okay, this is the match that decides it all. first to 11 wins. serve switches every five points. and just so you know, when this started, i was going to put the tardis in a discreet corner of the house, but i’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. game on."
7486,Howard,"no, no, don’t move. hey, ma, can i have lamb stew for dinner?"
8094,Howard,please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
7105,Howard,good. get out.
6540,Howard,maybe.
10238,Howard,‘cause i’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
10183,Howard,"since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. however, i know you believe in the many worlds interpretation, so i’ll say that. now do you think i’m smart enough?"
8222,Howard,so you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
11419,Howard,"nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings."
8773,Howard,you’re kidding.
10246,Howard,"yep, i wish stuart would reopen. i hate this place, too."
11047,Howard,"sorry, but too hot is the only temperature i come in."
8155,Howard,"oh, honey, i’m sorry. what can i do?"
6975,Howard,"so here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where i could ask you out and you’d say yes?"
9931,Howard,"no, not that. although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs."
7005,Howard,"yeah, i thought about renting this apartment, but i’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy."
11067,Howard,"no, when i sat on the mute button and thought i’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
8918,Howard,what?
10658,Howard,"hang on. not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?"
9321,Howard,amazing. you realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
7734,Howard,"no, it’s not… never mind. he is right, though. if you want, i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found."
7658,Howard,"okay, forget giant ants. how about giant rabbits?"
6187,Howard,"really? you? rajesh koothrapali, spoke to penny?"
7373,Howard,hey! look! amazing spider-man 183.
10925,Howard,"y, you’re elon musk."
7459,Howard,i prefer to think of myself as quirky.
9587,Howard,like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
8156,Howard,"okay. like, what, another five, ten minutes?"
6247,Howard,"no thanks, peanuts, i can’t afford to swell up in these tights. "
7154,Howard,he’s speaking about it.
9047,Howard,i don’t talk about it every minute.
8339,Howard,and are you?
9368,Howard,check it out. i used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
11237,Howard,i don’t know. i like the pain of others.
9755,Howard,hey.
7647,Howard,didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
9107,Howard,"all right, i’ve had enough of this. i’m a grown man, i have a successful career, for the love of god, i’ve been to space. i will move out when i’m ready, and i don’t need anyone badgering me into it."
10139,Howard,"i just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
11429,Howard,"oh, god, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. we don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
6161,Howard,wait till you see this.
6469,Howard,you still have to wear a helmet. 
11690,Howard,yeah.
7250,Howard,"fine, they smelled good."
6580,Howard,well i’m glad that’s settled. 
10244,Howard,i don’t want to talk about it.
9216,Howard,"great, thank you."
6763,Howard,"uh, leonard, huge mistake. there’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
11428,Howard,"oh, i mean, i know you’re pregnant. i just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
9965,Howard,"uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other."
7411,Howard,"okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. easy target. big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
11292,Howard,yeah. i do. it’s proof of concept. we’ve got a workable guidance system.
9562,Howard,i’m proud of you.
10189,Howard,i am.
11555,Howard,"hey, he got her to stop."
10783,Howard,every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
11588,Howard,"then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea."
9526,Howard,"the ladies are away, the boys will play."
8652,Howard,my mom. sorry.
7648,Howard,"uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
6349,Howard,"it’s all right, wireless mini-cam and bluetooth headset. we’ll be your eyes. "
8829,Howard,"no, but what is it?"
10422,Howard,and admit that we contaminated the clean room?
6241,Howard,"gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
7729,Howard,happy now? i’m moving the dirty sock.
8190,Howard,"wow, indeed."
8814,Howard,"what can i tell ya, i’m not into that stuff any more."
6474,Howard,so i can have penny?
11914,Howard,"okay, i get it, you’re angry. you don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest."
6676,Howard,"well, as it turns out, it’s also a klingon word."
10364,Howard,"knock, knock."
9902,Howard,"i’m sorry, what?"
7295,Howard,not ka. ka-ah.
10933,Howard,"a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? with elon musk, you bet i do."
11022,Howard,"oh, that’s what i said an hour ago."
7796,Howard,you think you could be a little more discreet?
6692,Howard,"okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence."
11488,Howard,i didn’t buy it. i made it.
9395,Howard,"okay. but i gotta warn you, raj is a proud, passionate man. if you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history."
11624,Howard,"please. when you see the ring i pick out, you’re gonna melt."
7588,Howard,you’ve also got something from the pasadena municipal court.
8493,Howard,no?
7312,Howard,what?
9996,Howard,"oh, boy."
8925,Howard,you’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
11493,Howard,"you’re crazy. i’ve worked with hawking. he’s got a great sense of humour, and i think he’d like it."
10469,Howard,"well, of course he believed in god. he slept with marilyn monroe."
7865,Howard,"she saw that, huh?"
10038,Howard,you took ballet?
6609,Howard,"that would be me. come to poppa, you un-kosher delight.  i’m not necessarily talking to the food."
6701,Howard,"look, on the roof, anais and giselle are sunbathing. european-style."
8714,Howard,"don’t worry, once she falls asleep, i’ll spoon you like an armadillo."
8209,Howard,i think it’s like beetlejuice. we said his name too many times.
7630,Howard,"you know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
10695,Howard,calm down.
7318,Howard,role-playing games?
10502,Howard,"how are you today, mr. can-you-believe-these-jack-asses?"
9530,Howard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like nicolas cage. he says,  travel with caution. these woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
10613,Howard,"don’t listen to her, just hit the ball."
10893,Howard,"well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist."
7034,Howard,so what are you kids up to?
7589,Howard,"sheldon, this is a summons."
7219,Howard,"just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
9174,Howard,but what are you doing in there?
10585,Howard,that’s not true. we’ve got tomatoes right here.
7482,Howard,huh?
11309,Howard,he’s flashing his lights. what’s that mean?
11709,Howard,"hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you."
10196,Howard,is that gonna be on the test? because i don’t think i can do that again.
9680,Howard,"well, we’re real close to finishing off the new batman game."
11886,Howard,i’ll talk to you later. 
7590,Howard,looks like you ran a red light on marengo avenue at 9:30 p.m. on november 16. they got you on a traffic camera. nice picture.
8574,Howard,how is that not amusing?
9059,Howard,"to tell you the truth, i’m not really in the mood."
8150,Howard,you know it’s meant as a compliment.
6459,Howard,yeah. 
8186,Howard,yep. i moved out of my mother’s house. cord is cut. i’m all yours.
10214,Howard,"for your information, i also gave leonard one hell of a high five."
7606,Howard,looks like someone drew a penis on him.
11234,Howard,interesting. maybe my male cycle synced up with raj’s actual period.
7059,Howard,"okay, are you from star wars universe?"
9285,Howard,that is not true. all i did was build a robot.
6571,Howard,maybe you’d be happier on a park bench? 
11051,Howard,"good, i don’t know where we keep the strainer."
9173,Howard,"yeah, really sorry."
6923,Howard,"oh, there’s the arrhythmia."
8593,Howard,"yeah, no, we all got that. but don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?"
6475,Howard,"i’m a fancy indian man, we invented pajamas! "
9167,Howard,"okay, picture’s up. looks like the camera’s working."
10121,Howard,"well, whose fault is that? i wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, i’m nice, i want to take care of people."
11105,Howard,i love you. mmm. and i’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
11303,Howard,"you’re right. we turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us."
11443,Howard,"uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
9005,Howard,okay.
11460,Howard,"don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face."
7420,Howard,"well, see, it took two years for the snail to…  not important."
6898,Howard,"oh, leslie, thank god."
10222,Howard,are you kidding me?!
7547,Howard,"now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
10435,Howard,"okay. one, two, three."
10072,Howard,a straight-up gore-fest? you hate this stuff.
11800,Howard,"then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about tiggers button."
7549,Howard,"i’m sure he would have if i had asked. ironically, their security isn’t all that good."
8587,Howard,"okay, we’re going to stick this in here  and then i’m going to pour in the milk. i hope this works, because i didn’t bring a change of pants."
9683,Howard,pull.
8183,Howard,"no, wait. you didn’t let me finish."
8485,Howard,"all right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. what is it?"
10362,Howard,you sure you’re okay?
21705,Howard,why?
8116,Howard,"fyi, i think that’s what darth vader said just before he started building the death star."
7738,Howard,he didn’t find a wife. they built him a wife out of dead body parts.
8358,Howard,"i don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy."
6693,Howard,"you can get them removed early, but you have to take his class."
10182,Howard,"i’d use feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign."
8579,Howard,i just gave it to her!
10551,Howard,raj was snooping through emily’s drawers and broke one.
8966,Howard,"hey, bernie."
6695,Howard,so based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the hollywood hills.
10227,Howard,heads up! watch out!
11997,Howard,for information and entertainment.
9702,Howard,"yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine."
7374,Howard,remember this one? spider-man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. want me to get it for you? it’ll help take your mind off things.
10814,Howard,"you played it for emily, didn’t you?"
6823,Howard,"hey, i’m a big boy. i’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. i mean, get over yourself."
11118,Howard,"see, he’s not wearing a tie."
6274,Howard,"who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept!"
8561,Howard,"oh, yeah. now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, i can’t believe i waited this long to make my own potpourri."
9545,Howard,"oh, yeah? well, when we get home, i’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure."
10675,Howard,maybe we should recalibrate it.
10825,Howard,"yeah, i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i die young."
6790,Howard,"you’re kidding. you’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick."
11726,Howard,"i’m sorry, i spaced. are we still talking about the spoon?"
7408,Howard,no! what about slim jims?
9300,Howard,"okay, i just talked to my mom. she arranged for us to get a rental car."
7533,Howard,"seventh base with shirt off. well, my shirt. how’d things go with penny?"
21716,Howard,nice.
10420,Howard,it’s all i could find. it’ll work.
8163,Howard,i was out with bernadette.
10444,Howard,"oh, he blinked his eyes. he’s alive."
8516,Howard,"yep, that’s the last jew who did sit-ups. and look where it got him."
9617,Howard,have you ever played a game with bernadette?
10127,Howard,"two, and i know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them."
11917,Howard,he says they didn’t do it.
8431,Howard,i don’t need any butter.
11828,Howard,"that’s enough, put her away."
10862,Howard,i guess we didn’t use it very often. unless we had company. which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
9852,Howard,anybody home?
10845,Howard,what was wrong with that guy?
7489,Howard,always le seur peas with lamb stew!
11706,Howard,"i know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
7362,Howard,"really, now? with the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. the tar pits. let’s go."
9880,Howard,damn.
9958,Howard,is that book called lies i tell to get sex?
11749,Howard,you sure?
10765,Howard,then i won’t say i’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
6770,Howard,good for you.
8854,Howard,"uh-huh, wonderful. yay."
6779,Howard,"doesn’t do anything for me. if i was gonna go that way, i’m more of a zac ephron kinda guy."
6453,Howard,shhh! hot girl in sheldon’s office. 
9671,Howard,"i mean, you know, sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if i hadn’t tried to help you."
6227,Howard,i’ll take the heart smart platter.
9137,Howard,this is where he goes? what’s in there?
11164,Howard,and now you’ve made it a problem.
10042,Howard,"whatever you hear tonight, just remember i love you. hey."
8947,Howard,ma…
8357,Howard,"ma, can rajesh sleep over?!"
7889,Howard,isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
7271,Howard,what do you mean you didn’t get the job? how could you not get it?
9354,Howard,"if you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life."
6971,Howard,i’ll give you a little clue. my favourite sandwich? salami on pumpernickel.
7223,Howard,"nice to meet you, bethany."
11188,Howard,raj just pulled up. i’m gonna say something to him.
11740,Howard,"seven? look at the board, it’s four."
8386,Howard,"are you insane? with high-speed internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
11950,Howard,"okay, the eagle has landed."
7402,Howard,"so, when do the meteors get here?"
8332,Howard,is she okay?
6530,Howard,i don’t think i can. 
6824,Howard,"and then, when i was 14, i met marcy grossman. she was so beautiful. she just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. it was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. i didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but i dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show."
8212,Howard,"now spread them out on the table face down. pick one, look at it."
7596,Howard,that’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
8247,Howard,maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
10870,Howard,sorry. do you have a sense of where we are?
7108,Howard,speaking of what goes around comes around…
6893,Howard,but what about the creek bed?
6789,Howard,it’s happening to us.
9324,Howard,"all right, you can suck it in a little bit."
11798,Howard,she does look happy.
8547,Howard,"oh, that reminds me, i get fresh sheets tonight. yay."
6734,Howard,"no, you’re mistaken."
21711,Howard,"no, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!"
8746,Howard,so you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
11341,Howard,"marty, let me call you back."
9370,Howard,"mmm, about twelve hours. i pulled an all-nighter."
6280,Howard,"son of a bitch, medpack, i need a medpack! "
8666,Howard,i don’t know.
7546,Howard,"all right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
6283,Howard,i bet they love scrubs.
6174,Howard,"this is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
7150,Howard,damn his vulcan hearing.
6577,Howard,so don’t look at it.
9580,Howard,i’ve put on a couple pounds. had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
7971,Howard,"come on, short round."
9811,Howard,"yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like raj. "
8864,Howard,"family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person."
8030,Howard,one-two-three-go? that’s for babies.
6612,Howard,do i get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
7020,Howard,really? are you familiar with the drake equation?
8993,Howard,the jewish prayer for eating bread! we don’t have one for falling out of space! we did it! we’re on the ground! we survived!
7123,Howard,"just imagine. if he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without sheldon."
9068,Howard,you’re my wife. you’re supposed to be on my side.
6225,Howard,"hang on, honey. shiva and ganesh? the hindu gods against the entire union army?"
8198,Howard,it’s not weird. there’s lots of kids there with their moms.
8766,Howard,get out of my lab.
6361,Howard,"hey, i’m damaged too. how about a hug for howie? "
9247,Howard,no good? the guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
8622,Howard,look at that. there’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
7355,Howard,stipulated.
11050,Howard,"uh, you turn off the jets, i’ll get a strainer from the kitchen."
8578,Howard,"well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. she made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
10622,Howard,yes.
10427,Howard,you know what i think your problem is? you’re jealous because you and i used to be best friends until koothrappali came along.
9125,Howard,have you guys ever noticed that sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
6384,Howard,all he has to do now is hook up with one of them. 
7442,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
7451,Howard,i’m taking a bath!
7645,Howard,what’s your point?
11251,Howard,"actually, it’s making me dizzy."
9454,Howard,in here.
8612,Howard,why?
9250,Howard,"sir, i’m flattered that you invited me, and i really want you to like me, but i don’t think this trip is the way to do it. and i can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them."
9830,Howard,not exactly.
8262,Howard,"new puzzle, ma. same name. one n, two d’s, three o’s."
8999,Howard,"bernie, you okay?"
11607,Howard,"not a chance. so, you were telling us how raj was terrible in bed."
10670,Howard,"okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to skywalker ranch without us."
10749,Howard,everything’s gonna be okay.
10146,Howard,what are you talking about? no one’s paying attention to you.
9276,Howard,you look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.
6452,Howard,i guess that makes me large breasts. 
10453,Howard,"i know. i get it. when i was in the soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward earth at 17,000 miles per hour…"
11094,Howard,"and since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence."
7531,Howard,hey.
7086,Howard,you already gave her the money?
9582,Howard,"you’re kidding, right? i mean, you know i’m trying to lose weight. god, i thought we were partners in this marriage."
8215,Howard,"okay, october is the tenth month. so ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. turn over the seventh card."
8392,Howard,close. really french it.
10349,Howard,don’t say it.
6482,Howard,you want to go again? let’s go. 
9192,Howard,"well, we appear to have reached an impasse. and you know, i have to say, i thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk."
11318,Howard,"yes, hello. uh, this is howard wolowitz for colonel richard williams."
11263,Howard,"yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
8035,Howard,i’m legally obligated to inform you that i took a karate lesson when i was 11. i’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
10335,Howard,"fine, it bothers me. you happy?"
6630,Howard,"i’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis."
10831,Howard,"when you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?"
7947,Howard,not really.
11285,Howard,i’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of raj.
11541,Howard,do you want me to get the nurse?
7904,Howard,"you said, well, the move, remember?"
11114,Howard,"okay, then, uh, sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. and it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend."
11561,Howard,"shh, i don’t hate you. "
11089,Howard,"okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas."
8074,Howard,"it means after we play handball, i’m showering at home."
9144,Howard,"fine, i’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar."
6302,Howard,"gentlemen, i am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local isp, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to san francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon, portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in halifax, nova-scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our isp and the x10 receiver attached to this . "
7101,Howard,"all right, this is an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system as deployed on the international space station."
11395,Howard,call you back.
6503,Howard,try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention. 
9294,Howard,son of a bitch.
9153,Howard,"don’t worry, i’m one step ahead of him."
9450,Howard,what? us? who else knows?
6521,Howard,"no, listen, see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and i’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours."
6542,Howard,"yeah, that’s why i did it. "
8053,Howard,i had to walk. i couldn’t get raj on the back of my scooter.
6996,Howard,"oh, god, we’re never gonna finish in time. who made sheldon the boss anyway?"
10324,Howard,"oh, i think i just cheated on my wife."
7139,Howard,"doctor and mrs. koothrappali, namaste. i understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until i was 17."
7253,Howard,"okay. we got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
9468,Howard,"we thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong."
10108,Howard,we get a nurse. preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
6746,Howard,"leonard, stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!"
11194,Howard,but we have to set some boundaries.
11697,Howard,"yeah, that’s working out great for me."
8167,Howard,i’m still leaving! i just forgot my claritin.
8921,Howard,"okay, uh, fine. bernie, i have to go pick up my mother. i’ll be right back."
7413,Howard,"oh, my god, could it be? yes! my mother put an i love you brisket in my backpack."
8671,Howard,what happened to your thumb?
6441,Howard,i was going to put down a towel. 
7149,Howard,great.
11610,Howard,"wait, hang on. i just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. even at the risk of being humiliated. and i, for one, think that’s very brave."
10936,Howard,wait a second. how could you do that without consulting me?
10580,Howard,no. i want to do this.
9165,Howard,sounds good.
10215,Howard,they’re doing space day and nasa asked me. i felt like i couldn’t say no.
6950,Howard,it can’t be. what would summer glau be doing riding the train?
8942,Howard,who is it?
11699,Howard,sure. this is for you.
7868,Howard,but it’s embarrassing.
10678,Howard,sheldon.
9444,Howard,yep.
6443,Howard,"and even if you can make it to boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to mrs bell, “hey mrs bell, big fan of your husband, can i come in and watch him invent the telephone?”"
6661,Howard,"howard wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the international space station’s liquid waste disposal system."
7769,Howard,"okay, here we go. passing the soy sauce. put out your hand."
11372,Howard,why don’t you just go home?
6485,Howard,"i’m fine, thanks for asking. i’ve come to call on missy. "
6584,Howard,renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. they’re about taking chubby girls who work at kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
7357,Howard,"getting shot down by the girl at hot dog on a stick. but in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. it was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
7325,Howard,"i’m torn. she might be dying, and, you know, i wouldn’t want to miss that. on the other hand, if i let it go to voicemail, i could play it over and over."
8073,Howard,"again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
6670,Howard,her loss. let’s go.
9879,Howard,great.
8496,Howard,"change your mind about sex? i’m still mad, but i’ll do it."
10696,Howard,"okay, i think i’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip."
11921,Howard,"yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. come on, i want to stop at walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
10679,Howard,just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
9813,Howard,"i do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when i’m going and getting them."
10171,Howard,what a sick use of science.
11289,Howard,"i can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair."
9313,Howard,"oh, yeah? how’s that?"
11549,Howard,"the baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?"
8855,Howard,"th-they did. but nasa really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch."
8741,Howard,"what do you mean, she’s a lesbian?"
8489,Howard,do you realize what a big deal this is? what an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
7395,Howard,"oh i don’t know, 50, 55."
11973,Howard,can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
7725,Howard,"you got it. oh, raj, no. billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows."
9266,Howard,what are we supposed to do?
6177,Howard,turn left on lake street and head up to colorado. i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
9541,Howard,"but wait., he’s not dead. he crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack."
11530,Howard,"just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. stuart, stop driving like an old man. speed it up a little."
8791,Howard,way to go the extra mile. your mee-maw would be proud.
11398,Howard,wrong number.
8490,Howard,"i’m sorry. you’re right. okay, let’s try this again. bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and i’d like to discuss it."
7656,Howard,what’s with him?
7853,Howard,"great, ma!"
10904,Howard,maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
9105,Howard,i will. i’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. i’m not a child.
7752,Howard,"okay, what if i were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
6755,Howard,"based on the geometric progression, his relationship with stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes."
10722,Howard,"yes, i cleaned it up all by myself. honestly, i don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe i missed one spot. just leave."
11215,Howard,i know. imagine if we were actually moving.
9555,Howard,maybe your lifetime. i went to space.
10441,Howard,great. do it.
6502,Howard,told you not to ask. 
10777,Howard,you don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to mexico.
9438,Howard,"yeah, i just couldn’t sleep."
9397,Howard,"not even a little? i mean, we could have a pants party. go put some on."
8349,Howard,what?
10538,Howard,the day she left for florida. she asked me to drive her to the airport. i was too busy. and i made her take a cab. i was too busy.
11966,Howard,"baruch atah, adonai, eloheinu. melech haolam, hamotzi. lechem min haaretz"
8709,Howard,"no, i don’t think it’s possible. i’m severely dehydrated. my pee is like toothpaste."
7810,Howard,"on the potty? what are you, five?"
9464,Howard,yeah. i’m terrific.
9569,Howard,"i heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
9435,Howard,"i couldn’t be less interested. now, come on, i’ll take you home."
6636,Howard,"okay, dead cat named lucky, continue."
7576,Howard,"so, what did you end up doing?"
10192,Howard,"if you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then i’m gonna be a crappy student.  uh, uh, ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause i never been defeated and i won’t stop now…"
9081,Howard,tell him he sounds like that.
8049,Howard,he is the only person we know with actual muscles.
10326,Howard,stick your head in there and find out.
11380,Howard,"we, we’re thinking, two years."
7258,Howard,could happen.
9457,Howard,"i got to tell you, as angry as i am at sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. look at this. photos of wolowitz family before father left forever. check out nine-year-old howie with cornrows. neither race was happy to see me with those."
11421,Howard,"well, clearly, i lied."
10296,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. sheldon, i vote that is not a tangent."
6359,Howard,good. from this point forward you will have to crawl. 
10672,Howard,nice. where were you when i was single?
8006,Howard,uh-uh.
7912,Howard,you that desperate?
10864,Howard,hey. what’s going on?
6847,Howard,i can fix it.
6468,Howard,"do you like motorcycles, ‘cos i ride a hog. "
10268,Howard,i’m always welcome.
11708,Howard,"let’s hope he thinks so, too."
8335,Howard,"don’t worry, you’ll be fine. let’s just hide mr. cross. if it touches her, it burns."
7701,Howard,"a, are you kidding me? and b, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
7398,Howard,"relax, i said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap."
7635,Howard,that’s not gonna better pull out the big gun.
8277,Howard,"hey, everybody, i got something i want to ask bernadette, and i can’t think of a better time than when i’m with all my friends."
8091,Howard,hi. ow. hi.
11297,Howard,"am i? am i? what, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and i’m no longer in it? that chess club picture is now just david zimmerman and elaine cho."
10109,Howard,not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
11900,Howard,"hey, steph, it’s me again, howard. listen, if you’re free friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. my mom cooks a hell of a brisket. let me know. it’s howard."
8196,Howard,"well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. oh, before i forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist."
8300,Howard,"hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?"
6332,Howard,it’s leonard.
7526,Howard,good job not making fun of her.
11301,Howard,"one sec. i’m just afraid if i respond, then they’ll know i got it."
10980,Howard,social anxiety.
9866,Howard,that’s how you reject a guy.
10774,Howard,i bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
9603,Howard,"that’s so great. if you guys prove the existence of unruh radiation… hey, hey, hey, hey. my eyes are up here."
10005,Howard,then don’t say anything.
9878,Howard,it’s been ten minutes. we’re running out of time.
6318,Howard,"uh-oh, here comes “the talk.” "
9659,Howard,would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
8428,Howard,"oh, wow. so you guys are getting along?"
8217,Howard,a magician never reveals his secrets. but surely a future nobel prize winner can figure it out.
7586,Howard,"sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
11826,Howard,"tammy jo st. cloud. oh, and i’m a dork for juggling."
7662,Howard,"oh, but something happened."
6507,Howard,what if they’re women?
9218,Howard,good. fine is good. how you liking retirement?
10105,Howard,i’m sorry. i just can’t deal with this right now.
6841,Howard,what a jerk.
11768,Howard,of course. i missed you and the baby and being able to watch ellen every day.
9804,Howard,what are you doing? are you trying to make me look bad?
7678,Howard,"oh, god, this is good."
10493,Howard,yes.
7548,Howard,i got a buddy over at the department of defence.
8849,Howard,"make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what i almost did."
9077,Howard,"sheldon, i know stephen hawking. i worked with him."
7982,Howard,"how could that be a miss? c-6 was a hit, c-8 was a hit. part of your starship has to be on c-7."
8418,Howard,"hey, ma, how about a little privacy?"
9997,Howard,i was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
7727,Howard,"oh, it’s very simple. leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
10813,Howard,"where’s this coming from? a few hours ago, we both loved this song."
10800,Howard,what kind of music are you thinking of?
8270,Howard,"no, not a clue."
10408,Howard,"yeah, she works at a law firm in new york."
9519,Howard,cinnamon!
8223,Howard,"yeah, i was talking to raj."
9411,Howard,"well, they’re actually pretty excited. i’m their most famous alum. if you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes."
8019,Howard,spiders! you’re afraid of spiders!
8908,Howard,i told you we are not recreating the wedding from the sound of music.
7593,Howard,"wow. uh, stan lee, or you in court? uh, if this was sophie’s choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. no."
7376,Howard,"but if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. so the only question is, how long until you fold?"
10594,Howard,"well, i guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind."
8520,Howard,"come on, admit it. we got you, sheldon."
10562,Howard,"well, it’s hard. a lot of ma’s stuff brings back fond memories."
6575,Howard,we’re just talking ma. 
10553,Howard,"well, i think you broke the dowels. you’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it."
7340,Howard,"yes, she did."
6195,Howard,"stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of azeroth."
8193,Howard,not as good. you can’t make strings with it. remind me to put it on your shopping list.
11258,Howard,"no, two minutes."
9568,Howard,check it out. mrs. davis from human resources is here. she’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
9255,Howard,"really? thank you, sir."
9963,Howard,"listen, i was thinking you and i could probably try to be better friends."
7674,Howard,"leave me alone, sheldon."
10353,Howard,"‘cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship."
7910,Howard,"so, how’d it go?"
9667,Howard,"my point is, i’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
9821,Howard,really? sheldon not being here is the main reason i’m in this room.
11815,Howard,"i don’t know, maybe."
8562,Howard,"here’s a radical thought. go old-school, challenge stuart to a fight. i mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
8324,Howard,"what you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, i’ve been the whole world to my mother. i mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t."
8029,Howard,fine. how do you want to start?
9243,Howard,"yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday."
9439,Howard,it’s this stupid letter.
11494,Howard,i have no problem calling him.
11223,Howard,don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
11319,Howard,"hi, colonel williams, how can i help you? what? oh, uh, yes, he is from india. no, i don’t know his immigration status. relax, i’m still on hold. speaking. okay, sure, i can meet with you on thursday. caltech is fine. yeah, and may i ask what this is about? i may not?"
7041,Howard,i’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
9687,Howard,next week is the anniversary of my first date with bernadette.
11560,Howard,"she doesn’t hate you, stop saying that."
6914,Howard,"okay, one way to look at this is that i’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. but a better way to look at this is that i’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful."
7798,Howard,"no, you see, it’s more complicated than that.  winnie the pooh is out of the honey tree."
6191,Howard,"hold on, honey, men at work. the pvc comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
11446,Howard,"oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the gps can take us to the nearest emergency room."
10463,Howard,you love that movie.
7711,Howard,what do you mean what? it’s halo night.
6352,Howard,stay low. bear left. now keep true.
6574,Howard,just get in the bed!
9838,Howard,"oh, yeah"
7350,Howard,"i mean, quidditch, sure. but football?"
7330,Howard,"oh, wow. you didn’t, did you?"
11039,Howard,"and made up my mind, i’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke."
7985,Howard,"it’s in hawaii, but raj controls it from here. he’s hoping to see epsilon eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it."
6699,Howard,i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena.
6582,Howard,oh for god’s sake.
6859,Howard,see ya.
6231,Howard,how can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.
7917,Howard,"seriously? i was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual i met on j-date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten."
9002,Howard,oh. are you kidding? every minute of every…
11346,Howard,"oh. well, hey, me, too."
7622,Howard,"clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah."
10612,Howard,"it was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over."
9718,Howard,"it’s true, you’d rust."
7512,Howard,because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
9843,Howard,"if you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
7736,Howard,"tons. i’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. and twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
6777,Howard,no.
6522,Howard,"no, see, the only way i could get him to leave is to tell him i ate a peanut. because i’m allergic to peanuts. "
9093,Howard,"what are you talking about? all i have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. oh, got this at the goodwill store for 50 cents. can you believe it?"
11650,Howard,it’s a manifold.
10233,Howard,"thanks. i’m proud of me, too."
10896,Howard,"me, too. and we’ve seen the prize."
11438,Howard,"it’s for the baby, and i didn’t buy it. the dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
6528,Howard,we can’t go home. 
7403,Howard,"stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
11518,Howard,"oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, i can do this. we have a plan. somebody please tell me the plan."
11632,Howard,"i don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
10129,Howard,because you had sex the other night?
9128,Howard,colonel koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
8623,Howard,she is gonna break his heart.
10208,Howard,what’s that about?
11055,Howard,"um, taking care of injured rabbit. okay. make sure it’s comfortable and warm. well, it was just in a hot tub. i’m gonna say check."
10584,Howard,"good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
10458,Howard,the man who crashed his stationary bike.
10219,Howard,great. you take this and say when to stop. how much further?
8866,Howard,"how about that. anyway, sir, i need to talk to you about something."
6188,Howard,she hugged you? how did she hug you?  is that her perfume i smell?
7920,Howard,this is the worst cobbler i’ve ever eaten. i mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
6337,Howard,hello.
11481,Howard,"and he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
9858,Howard,there you go. 
10739,Howard,"hey, you got a minute?"
11926,Howard,testing. check. check two.
7441,Howard,"hey, i’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is halle berry?  yes, you’re delicious caramel, too."
11239,Howard,she does not.
11108,Howard,you have any idea what you’re getting sheldon for his birthday?
8119,Howard,labradoodle?
11269,Howard,same reason i don’t talk about ass cancer. it’s not a pleasant topic.
7231,Howard,did you bring the black condoms?
6856,Howard,there are too many variables. it would take forever.
11590,Howard,i thought things were going well. what happened?
6974,Howard,"okay, i’m going to just go for broke here and say i like you."
7415,Howard,maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
6652,Howard,i haven’t configured it yet. let’s see… bradley tank… transport truck…  batmobile…
8686,Howard,it’s numbered.
7663,Howard,"what’d you do, romeo? you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
7324,Howard,of course it did.
9630,Howard,never looking back again. 
11279,Howard,"if you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
10565,Howard,"yeah, well, i tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him."
8750,Howard,her. we thought you two would hit it off.
9136,Howard,come on.
11545,Howard,"exactly. also like the comet, bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
6586,Howard,hello.
11619,Howard,"if you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?"
9662,Howard,"no, no, listen to me. sheldon misunderstood. what i meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
9710,Howard,"ever since i met you, you turned my world around. you’re my best friend and my lover. we’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. you can’t have one without the other. i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you, bernadette."
9585,Howard,"‘cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? this was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back."
10230,Howard,but it’s for a good cause. what about all the kids that’ll be there?
11748,Howard,"well, i don’t know, you seem a little upset."
10621,Howard,"hey, i grew up in this house, okay? no one’s knocking anything down."
7744,Howard,nope. why don’t you ask him?
8437,Howard,"eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
7496,Howard,"i didn’t say anything like that. i said leonard has to ask my permission.  come on, i don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. damn, i was this close on the bra."
6210,Howard,"oh, then you’re probably okay."
7055,Howard,"wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?"
6742,Howard,did someone just feel a cold breeze?
10174,Howard,why is it your last name and her first name?
8515,Howard,what do you say?
11890,Howard,if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon. 
21712,Howard,"she grows any more hair on her face, yes."
8583,Howard,"oh-ho-ho! i haven’t seen this trick in years. it’s called the dove pan. you let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. and then you open it and produce a live… don’t look in there."
7532,Howard,"had a great night last night. i don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
10663,Howard,"building on what sheldon said, i could go for chinese."
8541,Howard,"well, hey, i’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. you tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and i never repeat it."
6605,Howard,"mmmm, testify. "
7603,Howard,"my guess is, “hey, four minutes! new record!” that’s why i’m the funny one."
11131,Howard,this contract looks good to me.
6702,Howard,"of course not, i got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over."
9495,Howard,"is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
8930,Howard,"i’m excited to talk to you, too."
10095,Howard,obviously.
6385,Howard,or can we?
10586,Howard,certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
8736,Howard,yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
9035,Howard,it’s my official nasa portrait.
10438,Howard,"uh, maybe it’s just stunned."
10162,Howard,"now, i never thought i’d say this, but i’m kind of excited to see sheldon."
9842,Howard,really? i never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
8347,Howard,"congratulations, honey."
10714,Howard,hey.
8503,Howard,obviously.
7276,Howard,am i interrupting?
7950,Howard,you’re giving me a couch cushion?
8903,Howard,"i’m sorry, ma… bernadette. ma… burna… you’re ma bernadette."
7278,Howard,tonight’s the night i usually go line dancing with raj at the palomino.
8806,Howard,give me a compliment.
10117,Howard,"shh, i just got her to sleep."
8128,Howard,"raj, i don’t have time. now, pay attention. my last wish is that you look after bernadette."
6543,Howard,"no, it’s wo de ming zi shi sheldon. "
10100,Howard,crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
7604,Howard,they were closing up. we got this whole box for sixty bucks.
7782,Howard,"please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
7535,Howard,"all right, i was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but i can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon."
11638,Howard,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
10521,Howard,"it’s my mom’s furniture. it belongs in the house i grew up in, next to that pile of tv guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art."
10673,Howard,why would he own a t-shirt cannon?
11238,Howard,"no, she doesn’t."
11513,Howard,get stuart or raj to do it.
8131,Howard,you’re thinking of 28 days later. 28 days is where sandra bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
8364,Howard,i’ve been up all night. i had a fight with bernadette.
6193,Howard,done.
8113,Howard,"well, picture the hindenburg meets chernobyl meets three mile island meets tron 2."
9361,Howard,you’re still at my mother’s?
6683,Howard,house? what house?
10282,Howard,oh. i never saw that.
7186,Howard,sounds like a cricket.
8201,Howard,"nobody wants to do that to you, ma."
10381,Howard,thank you. and i love that you’re strong and independent.
8445,Howard,"no joke. oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late."
9537,Howard,the dungeon master’s supposed to roll.
10763,Howard,"dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that i have to tell you everything that goes on."
8296,Howard,he drank from leonard’s glass.
6794,Howard,"i’m sorry. uh, this one. let’s go!"
11367,Howard,sorry i have to work all weekend.
11054,Howard,"well, how do we do that?"
11818,Howard,"you know what? i’m with leonard, this isn’t cool."
11363,Howard,"well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights."
6776,Howard,"leonard. now, raj. now, sheldon."
9993,Howard,"okay, good."
9708,Howard,"ever since i met you, you turned my world around. you supported all my dreams and all my hopes. you’re like uranium-235 and i’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you bernadette."
10542,Howard,those are business expenses. you can write those off.
11919,Howard,"yeah, exactly. not bad, but not great."
9944,Howard,you’re supposed to do that.
6915,Howard,"well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
9337,Howard,"nah, i blew my food allowance on pokemon cards."
9650,Howard,how about i take a bath with you and see what happens.
9990,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
11830,Howard,"phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
11676,Howard,why don’t you just tell her not to come?
6982,Howard,"hey, you know what’d be a great idea? we get some girls over here and play laser obstacle strip chess."
10337,Howard,hey.
9928,Howard,"and i’m gonna miss you, too."
9157,Howard,it’s paprika.
6885,Howard,"it’s just temporary, i pay rent."
6655,Howard,"fine, what colour do you want?"
9574,Howard,"okay, fine. let’s say there was a moment."
9535,Howard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. what are you doing in our dungeon? you shall die!"
8259,Howard,"i am. she’s just bleaching her moustache. check it out. hey, ma! before and after! four words, 17 letters, two n’s, one v."
6599,Howard,let her rip.
6383,Howard,smooth.
8397,Howard,check it out. free chair.
9325,Howard,"oh, good, you’re home. got a little surprise for you."
8565,Howard,"that’s quite a list. i can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?"
11883,Howard,"no, i’m lost too, i think she skipped a step. "
7456,Howard,"this will only take a second. you asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and i did. bernadette? will you marry me?"
10487,Howard,"oh, maybe i am. who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair."
9013,Howard,"if you’re busy, i can come back."
10629,Howard,"not really. this guy shows up out of the blue, and now i have a brother? my father has another family?"
7284,Howard,"well, usually, on sundays, i go with raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with sheldon, so i thought i’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. it’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour."
7579,Howard,"trust me, you can’t. i’ve tried."
8220,Howard,"oh, really? so how did i do it?"
11203,Howard,i’ll go get him.
6990,Howard,"actually, i’m thinking about this one stripper named vega. but sure, calcium sulphate could work."
6985,Howard,hold on. what are you using as a bonding agent?
11486,Howard,"say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control stephen hawking."
7430,Howard,"greetings, homies, homette."
8144,Howard,yes!
6529,Howard,"becauth  becauth-th-th. brissket, brissket! water, need water. "
10779,Howard,i don’t know. have you watched the olympics with me?
9344,Howard,my mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
9120,Howard,where we going?
10448,Howard,we can’t do that.
7305,Howard,"leonard, come on."
7556,Howard,what could be better? we’re in.
11200,Howard,"but on the other hand, i didn’t kick him out of our lives. i just asked him to back off a little."
10191,Howard,that’s where i’m a little fuzzy.
9340,Howard,"no, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. it’s part of a bonus she got."
9790,Howard,"yeah, but if i told you a week, would you have said yes?"
9233,Howard,i’ve never even been fishing. this is gonna be a disaster.
7694,Howard,you might want to stand back. i’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
10912,Howard,"six hours? oh, god, i don’t want to complain for that long."
10228,Howard,"hey, mike. listen, nasa asked me to throw out the first pitch at an angels game. you got any advice?"
11422,Howard,he’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
11371,Howard,maybe we should break for lunch. what time is it?
9967,Howard,no.
9230,Howard,"well, hang on a second, bernie. next weekend, we have that thing."
10999,Howard,i’ll give it to him next time i see him.
11604,Howard,"hey, you went out with him. i didn’t."
9515,Howard,cinnamon!
7825,Howard,i do this for my mom all the time. see? with the grain.
9382,Howard,i love you.
6994,Howard,"they didn’t quit. they were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry mexicans."
6864,Howard,ugh. this mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
8845,Howard,"yeah, so?"
10190,Howard,it’s an inverted cycloid.
8753,Howard,"he’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
8195,Howard,"better put it on the list. if you wash my underwear with regular soap, i get little red bumps on my tuchus."
7481,Howard,"i hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. i’m crazy."
9323,Howard,stop holding your stomach in. i’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
7254,Howard,we say they’re in a very intimate area.
11489,Howard,what’s the big deal?
8985,Howard,"it’s delayed. we’re gonna be here at least another week. maybe ten days. it’s the russians, so you don’t know. they left dogs up here in the sixties."
11197,Howard,thanks for understanding.
11473,Howard,"so, when do we meet her?"
6595,Howard,you mean like you and richard the slave girl?
10550,Howard,"you know what, you sound busy, i’m gonna let you go."
10804,Howard,footprints on the moon.
9827,Howard,"mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum."
7843,Howard,"why are you in bed with me? if we start to question this, it all falls apart."
11876,Howard, hi this is howard wolowitz.
8534,Howard,yeah.
10805,Howard,so did i.
11035,Howard,"fine. i had reservations about you, too."
11880,Howard,"is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless. "
10224,Howard,you realize this isn’t one of those times i want you to exaggerate how long something is.
6931,Howard,bye.
8669,Howard,i’ve got some rare comic books. the vespa’s almost paid off. and ma and i have a primo double cemetery plot at mt. sinai right near the guy who played mr. roper on three’s company.
7268,Howard,so?
9767,Howard,really?
6646,Howard,"ooh, i want to go to the comic book store. "
11246,Howard,‘cause we’re not in it for the stuff. we’re in it for the groupies.
7052,Howard,"i can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine."
9097,Howard,there’s some underwear in the hamper.
11357,Howard,i guess this is it. 
11457,Howard,"oh. well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
6331,Howard,"dear lord, not milky green! "
8875,Howard,"right, right."
11491,Howard,his eyes also light up in the dark.
8822,Howard,"yeah, it was great. and low-key, like i promised. no hanky-panky, no strippers. just the guys telling jokes."
9732,Howard,yeah. see bernie’s engagement ring? that came right off my mom’s back.
9152,Howard,"yeah, so?"
6499,Howard,"okay, well, he might like that, i’ve seen him… chilly. "
8363,Howard,you bought me a rolex? how much did this cost?
7816,Howard,"okay. toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?"
10757,Howard,doesn’t matter. what are you mad about?
9946,Howard,"come on, how is that not a joke? you got to get me out of this. shoot me in the foot."
21707,Howard,fine. and it’s a dickey.
9778,Howard,thank god.
11582,Howard,"okay, this grid represents the room. all we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
21706,Howard,"so, i get the draft?"
7394,Howard,"okay, the best i can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
9923,Howard,not when i said mute and pointed it at her face.
7213,Howard,"okay, how about you two? look, i’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
10733,Howard,"yeah, right. sick. he didn’t have jaundice. he just looks like that."
9623,Howard,"hey, how about some music?"
10760,Howard,"and you let penny marry him. compared to that, who cares if i bought a george clooney limited edition manscaping kit?"
10816,Howard,the past was lunch. you know what’s really happening here? your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
8141,Howard,"it was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. the old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond."
10029,Howard,she is. but i like that attitude.
9986,Howard,here you go. be creative. what’s the matter? scared of a little turbulence?
10642,Howard,good for you.
6368,Howard,"when this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. "
11957,Howard,he’s not talking about your shirt. your shirt is fine.
6567,Howard,did you make fun of trains? 
6315,Howard,"let’s roll. hey, nice suit."
8283,Howard,"that’s interesting. can you just switch restaurants like that, priya?"
9330,Howard,"koothrappali and i bought a used 3-d printer for $5,000."
8179,Howard,"hey, bernadette, can i talk to you for a second?"
9355,Howard,"trust me, you’re not jewish. that’s how they get you."
11244,Howard,hey.
7337,Howard,good guess.
8696,Howard,"you know what does have an oh in front of it? oh, my god, i’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy."
10741,Howard,his middle name is david. go.
9222,Howard,"so, mrs. rostenkowski, you took that trip to the grand canyon. how was it?"
9408,Howard,not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. and have enough milk left over to open a baskin robbins.
10876,Howard,that would be nice.
10854,Howard,"oh, honey, of course it’s your house. why else would you be cleaning it all the time?"
8821,Howard,"thank you for picking us up. there’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. you cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
11399,Howard,as soon as i get home. we’re hoping to make it before dark.
6740,Howard,how do we decide that?
7257,Howard,"yeah. hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
11809,Howard,"hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. have you ever tried to juggle?"
11786,Howard,"i told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
11151,Howard,"that’s very generous, sheldon."
9707,Howard,"a candle without a wick, a watson without a crick, i’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. i’d be cheese without the mac, jobs without the wozniak, i’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. i’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and i’d probably still live with my mom."
7668,Howard,i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
7388,Howard,how much time do we have?
10692,Howard,"it worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet."
7867,Howard,"oh, i’d rather not say."
8842,Howard,"yes, yes, i’ve been doing my push-ups. i’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
9065,Howard,"well, i’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, i went to space! space, space! space! space, space! space!"
7470,Howard,"hey, fellas. this is my girlfriend bernadette. my girlfriend bernadette."
8685,Howard,so sad.
6678,Howard,did you pay your cable bill?
6578,Howard,no kidding?
7924,Howard,yes.
8342,Howard,"is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?"
8467,Howard,"what the hell? the last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
11937,Howard,"excuse me. that’s my girlfriend, bernadette. i assigned her her own ringtone, bernadette by the four tops. hello, bernadette."
11420,Howard,maybe this is why people get fish tanks. who just turned the porch lights on?
6842,Howard,even twenty thousand of ’em.
9920,Howard,"hey, how come we never get that option?"
7346,Howard,but i had a shot with that jogger.
9043,Howard,you know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.
10468,Howard,no. there’s also apu from the simpsons.
9713,Howard,you’re going to girls’ night.
6993,Howard,and i’ll bet lesbians love bluetooth.
8687,Howard,"sheldon, stop. he’s screwing with you."
7640,Howard,"no, actually, i wouldn’t mind going, too."
9738,Howard,"oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?"
6517,Howard,"don’t yell at me, i’ve got to go to the emergency room. "
11160,Howard,"well, hang on. what movie is it?"
6949,Howard,"come on, raj."
8871,Howard,i’m sorry. may i be excused?
7735,Howard,you sure? they say they can find a match for anybody.
9471,Howard,"show a little compassion, a man died."
11270,Howard,take a step back? i’m not a young man any more.
10081,Howard,"let me get this straight. so, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her."
11802,Howard,"no wonder they beat us, they’re jocks."
8611,Howard,no.
6282,Howard,"neither do i. doogie howser’s been off the air for like, twenty years. "
8886,Howard,"no, it’s ’cause i live with my mom and she makes me froot loops."
10461,Howard,"buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to judaism. i mean, i know i make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels."
10473,Howard,"yeah. just, uh, is there anything i should know before i go in?"
11196,Howard,"oh. okay. yeah, i get it. i’ll back off."
8301,Howard,"right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons."
8388,Howard,"oh, come on, tell me i’m wrong."
8580,Howard,"she’s not stacked like you, ma! she never steps on hers!"
9909,Howard,i’m going to the lego store to get a big-ass r2-d2.
8542,Howard,i’m pushing play.
10624,Howard,sam wolowitz is my father.
9597,Howard,fine.
9244,Howard,you’re right. oh! i should do this.
11455,Howard,"aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny."
11896,Howard,"penny, look, i’ve got a problem."
11953,Howard,"emily, this is our friend raj."
7612,Howard,just a guy. i know a guy.
8480,Howard,"it’s me, sheldon. it’s me. i’m going up in space! technically, i’m an astronaut."
7057,Howard,"don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
11023,Howard,you should’ve seen us after the good dinosaur.
11235,Howard,yeah.
9322,Howard,"okay, give me a superhero pose, and i will scan you into the computer for your action figure."
10794,Howard,"yeah, i saw it on mythbusters."
10512,Howard,"yeah, well, sometimes you work late."
7591,Howard,you are guilty.  that one i liked.
9769,Howard,"you know, my mom’s been to arizona. she rode one of those mules down in the grand canyon. long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘cause she’s so fat. i’ll get the door while you finish laughing. hey, guys."
7259,Howard,"ooh, we’re honey now, are we?"
10909,Howard,"oh. cool.  hey, siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
10545,Howard,"she doesn’t have to, i filled up on jelly beans."
10024,Howard,"he’s gonna die alone, right?"
11321,Howard,that’s really stupid advice.
11854,Howard,how’s sheldon doing with amy gone?
6362,Howard,antonio salieri?
8188,Howard,"i love you, too. so what’s for dinner?"
11617,Howard,i don’t know. what difference does it make?
7513,Howard,"no, really. i have a girlfriend now."
7316,Howard,and i said you could study me ’cause i’m a tiny living thing. it’s a joke.
7706,Howard,she doesn’t know she takes them.
9089,Howard,so do it.
6999,Howard,you can’t be serious.
10375,Howard,"okay, okay. i really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel."
7491,Howard,sorry about that.
11326,Howard,at least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
11821,Howard,"well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, i got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
10755,Howard,"ooh, brownies for girls’ night!"
10110,Howard,sounds like a job for a loving person. would you like me to play some polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
7379,Howard,"okay, sorry."
6952,Howard,"you’re overlooking something. i have 11 hours with her in a confined space. unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is howard wolowitz."
10299,Howard,jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man.
7400,Howard,not much to tell. they had a vw microbus and were wearing tie-dyed grateful dead shirts.
10840,Howard,sounds like you on cinco de mayo.
11701,Howard,"you know what, i’m not gonna go either. i’m a father now. i’d rather spend time with my family."
8311,Howard,"yeah, that’s probably it. so, what do you think? do you like her? she’s great, huh?"
10504,Howard,what are you doing?
10266,Howard,that’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
9487,Howard,it’s exactly what it’s like. keep reading.
11435,Howard,"okay, well, i may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety. "
10399,Howard,"oh, let’s do that."
9029,Howard,"hey, guys, guess who’s back from space."
8000,Howard,no!
8839,Howard,"couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. i’ll tell you later."
7007,Howard,"i won’t lie, it’s pretty dope."
6997,Howard,"1,000 friggin’ penny blossoms."
9637,Howard,"cherry, baby"
6224,Howard,"not so fast, remember the south still has two infantry divisions, plus superman and godzilla."
7051,Howard,depends. are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
8245,Howard,whoa! somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
6402,Howard,kryptonian villain. long story.
9483,Howard,cool. anything juicy?
8127,Howard,"shh, shh. listen to me. i’m not gonna make it."
9747,Howard,you had to be taught not to play with cobras?
8483,Howard,you’re really quiet. is everything okay?
11571,Howard,"with pay, sucka. forgot the baby, still new to this."
6371,Howard,sheldon.
8051,Howard,she and her lab team are under quarantine. seems at the christmas party they were doing jell-o shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
9024,Howard,"sound of music sing-along? that used to be our thing, but that’s cool."
6519,Howard,"oh god, oh god, oh god, oh….  okay sheldon, what was it supposed to be? fine, it’s out of the washer. i’ll call you when it’s in the dryer. "
9675,Howard,"tell me about it. one time, i swear i pooped out a stick of chalk.  i’ll get it."
10654,Howard,you don’t think i’m a leader?
6369,Howard,"no, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf. "
7509,Howard,it was a full turtleneck. why aren’t you helping me?
8665,Howard,a pre-nup? wow.
10198,Howard,"well, i dropped your class, so i hope you’re happy."
8162,Howard,"sex criminals don’t have keys, ma."
10557,Howard,in emily’s eyes.
6870,Howard,"yes. koothrappali’s going to wet himself, i’m gonna throw up, sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. shall we synchronize our watches?"
7462,Howard,"i want to dedicate this number to a great gal who i’ve done wrong.   bernadette, i am so sorry for trying to propose to you, bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing i do. i know now it was too soon to talk of love. it was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. but, bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet bernadette, i’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet bernadette, i dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet bernadette. sincerely yours, howard wolowitz, bernadette…"
10173,Howard,"so, penny, when’s the new job start?"
10140,Howard,you sure?
11403,Howard,"there she is. who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
7067,Howard,"of course i had feelings for her, i saw her naked for god’s sake!"
9070,Howard,just plain old howard wolowitz again.
11124,Howard,"wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and i get nothing?"
11894,Howard,what if guests show up?
10401,Howard,are we sure this is the place?
9241,Howard,"fine. sorry, mr. worm. sherm. sherm the worm."
6603,Howard,me too. but probably in a different way.
11856,Howard,"i mean, not me, i’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on instagram."
6653,Howard,"here we go, red 2006 ford taurus on the streets of pasadena."
8802,Howard,"yeah, i made an adjustment on the motor drive and when i was putting it back together i could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
9998,Howard,"okay, give me the flowers and pie."
6672,Howard,i have chorrr.
11557,Howard,"oh, good."
11458,Howard,"you heard him, guys, don’t ask."
6778,Howard,"did, too."
11462,Howard,"so, if i actually know something right now, and i do, you don’t want me to tell you?"
11117,Howard,is the impression that your first name is pee-wee?
7813,Howard,"what do you do in the potty, wee-wee?"
7406,Howard,"to this day, i can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. oh, cousin jeanie."
6946,Howard,"okay, raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver."
11374,Howard,"well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
7515,Howard,"honest to god. leonard, tell her i have a girlfriend."
7423,Howard,"a jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
7142,Howard,what?
8928,Howard,i have strongly mixed feelings.
8600,Howard,"huh, it’ll kill her. on the other hand, if i don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. so, either way, on the mom front, i’m golden."
8042,Howard,"oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. what do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"
6715,Howard,"a neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “normally, i’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” i’ve got a whole list of ’em. who wants to be my wingman?"
8022,Howard,"oh, really? what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
7710,Howard,hi.
11407,Howard,you bet i did.
7870,Howard,"well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
10635,Howard,"hey, i threw out the first pitch at an angels game."
9686,Howard,"guys, listen up. "
11806,Howard,"boy, it is neck and neck right now."
9978,Howard,what now?
10596,Howard,"we’re not selling it, it’s mine."
9494,Howard,"oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. rig the game."
8922,Howard,she doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so i’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
11437,Howard,"in our new minivan. hey, what’s for lunch?"
10509,Howard,"how do you do, mr. i’ll-admit-that’s-pretty-cool?"
11978,Howard,"everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!"
11140,Howard,"all right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then i don’t know if i want to talk to you. okay. i get it. and it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but i can take care of myself."
6194,Howard,"alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the gates of elzebub."
6426,Howard,"760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
11391,Howard,but how delightful was it when i pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? it’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
11397,Howard,okay. here we go. it’s ringing.
10859,Howard,that is reasonable. but what room?
9518,Howard,"when this all blows over, remember that voice. it’s kind of a turn-on."
8403,Howard,can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
7650,Howard,turns out the great sheldon cooper has stage fright.
9807,Howard,give me that. just stop showing me up.
8018,Howard,"no. something very specific that we both know you, rajesh koothrappali, are terrified of."
9259,Howard,i’m your idiot. forever.
11959,Howard,"ooh, eight thirty. you and penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
8168,Howard,i need a place to crash.
6850,Howard,how much time you got?
6548,Howard,you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey. 
8273,Howard,it’s a bernadette thing.
7919,Howard,gagh!
8360,Howard,"yeah, ha-ha. first of all, i’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. i’m proud of her. and secondly, i have my own career."
9575,Howard,"there wasn’t. but, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
11870,Howard,"grab a napkin, homie. you just got served. "
11595,Howard,"well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
10768,Howard,"actually, we’re not going to the movies. we are here to kidnap you."
6667,Howard,"not sheldon. over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. i’m an advocate of mytosis."
6749,Howard,son of a bitch.
6388,Howard,"no, i have allergies. "
11136,Howard,can i talk to you in the hall?
11707,Howard,"well, we can make some space in the garage. maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
11033,Howard,no. never.
6781,Howard,there are always do-overs when my people play sports.
6940,Howard,because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
7794,Howard,i only built the arm.
8702,Howard,"no. yeah, i would have laughed, too, but i didn’t want the vomit to come back out. anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
9018,Howard,"yeah, well, bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist."
8663,Howard,check it out. look at the size of that rice krispie treat. same price.
7573,Howard,that’s the one.
10938,Howard,"all right. this thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together."
7675,Howard,what’s wrong with you? you can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. that’s totally uncool.
10025,Howard,only without the sex.
10772,Howard,"well, sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting."
7072,Howard,"sea world, baby!"
6367,Howard,a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle. 
6729,Howard,anything?
10616,Howard,"i’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?"
9933,Howard,what do you think i said? i said yes. why do you look surprised?
11353,Howard,"no, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and i broke it by saying okay."
11965,Howard,oy vay!
6479,Howard,"is it ‘cause i’m jewish, ‘cause i’d kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
10599,Howard,"yes, but i mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the transformers and the thundercats for control of a bra i had found in the woods."
8660,Howard,i don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
9282,Howard,oh.
7784,Howard,"no, no! i loaded the wrong program. the hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. if you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting."
7023,Howard,"i’m a horny engineer, leonard. i never joke about math or sex."
6942,Howard,"so, bottom line, i’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy."
10344,Howard,"stuart, we have to talk. this thing with you and my mom, i hate it. it’s making me crazy. you and i were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party i’m going to? what the hell?"
9906,Howard,"a world i don’t want to live in. seriously, i no longer want to live in this world."
6765,Howard,she’s not my type.
7617,Howard,"well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…"
8590,Howard,"yes, you did. oh, i think my crotch is starting to curdle."
7076,Howard,"okay, fine, i’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know i dumped her."
8847,Howard,"all right, well, whatever. i wasn’t worried."
10811,Howard,yeah?
11625,Howard,"okay, i’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
9064,Howard,"you’re right, the party’s fantastic. please, tell me more. i haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old."
8033,Howard,"all right, how about this? ready, wrestle."
7022,Howard,"neediness times dress size squared. crunching the numbers, i come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
6969,Howard,"hi, i’m the small package good things come in."
7161,Howard,"if i may abruptly change the subject, did you and penny finally… you know."
9215,Howard,"thanks, sheldon. i’ll try that with my father-in-law."
6221,Howard,"excuse me for being so bold, but i now see where sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
11995,Howard,kind of busy.
8644,Howard,"all right, test my ring tone. that really is a good song."
10934,Howard,really? why?
11723,Howard,never should’ve had all these kids so close together.
9056,Howard,"okay, here it is. bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. is that true?"
11266,Howard,"yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons."
11339,Howard,"and this is my friend, raj."
11745,Howard,"oh, cool. hey, i was thinking maybe we take halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
9759,Howard,sheldon.
10003,Howard,"does a brisket count? i’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. but didn’t she know we were coming?"
8887,Howard,"thanks, we decided to do it before the launch."
11001,Howard,too busy to call? he wasn’t too busy to binge-watch hot in cleveland with my hulu password. what is happening? are we missing him?
9102,Howard,"no excuse. it’s just, you know, i’m jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the sabbath. so this one’s on god."
11262,Howard,we’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
9028,Howard,at least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
9481,Howard,why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? i need your laptop so i can configure the software.
6989,Howard,"it’s a common stripper problem. they dance, they sweat, they clump."
7877,Howard,"you know, i’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. i always thought it was because i wasn’t the son he wanted."
6333,Howard,sheldon’s sick.
11331,Howard,"sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
6421,Howard,"dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. "
9001,Howard,okay.
10418,Howard,"great, we’re turning on each other. that’s just what the bird wants us to do."
9367,Howard,"well, i was trying to come up with something really romantic to give bernadette for valentine’s day since she’s been such a pain in the ass."
9964,Howard,"seriously, i was talking to bernadette last night and she made some great points. you and i have known each other a long time, and i didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off."
11516,Howard,"hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
9529,Howard,ready whenever you guys are.
8309,Howard,"besides food, did you get along? did you talk?"
6791,Howard,"come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! you got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation."
8390,Howard,"what? you’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. this is your answer. there are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. you have one, priya has one in india. when you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. see? internet kissing.  give it a try."
7128,Howard,"we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him, are we?"
7166,Howard,"hello? i’m wearing a red turtleneck. plus, it was the only boys’ large they had."
8268,Howard,"yeah, he walked right into our trap."
10699,Howard,thank you.
10588,Howard,"well, i guess, as an engineer, i lean towards execution. i spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real."
7188,Howard,"okay, you were right about wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket."
7435,Howard,did she say something?
11379,Howard,we’ve hit a bit of a snag. we’re already behind schedule.
10158,Howard,"it’s weird, right? a grown man in his thirties living with my mother."
8046,Howard,leonard’s buying.
9506,Howard,classy dog.
9447,Howard,i am.
9258,Howard,"but i have to go. we play as a group. if-if i’m not there, then everyone will blame you. they’ll be all, bernadette ruined everything. she’s the worst. so, you see? i have to play dungeons and dragons for the marriage."
10833,Howard,"oh, god, i am going to feel this tomorrow."
8923,Howard,"okay, i’ll see you later, ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. i really got to watch that."
7992,Howard,what?
9959,Howard,"hey, i work at the same university you do."
10533,Howard,the world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
6350,Howard,"one more thing. this is a subsonic impact sensor. if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. at that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
8732,Howard,"anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
11426,Howard,that’s a kick. that’s an actual kick.
9525,Howard,nice guilt trip. you are gonna be an amazing mom.
6741,Howard,sheldon.
8290,Howard,"i’m not grilling you, i was just curious."
10243,Howard,since when do you read social science?
8619,Howard,"really? me? that’s, like, the best part."
10668,Howard,he was dressed as princess leia. it made a nice picture.
7204,Howard,"all right. tell you what, let’s go down to the entomology department and let professor"
9415,Howard,"the thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. i mean, look at me. i went to this very school. those desks you’re sitting in, i was once superglued to one of them."
9744,Howard,is the point that you’re an idiot?
10154,Howard,"ma, i hope you’re decent. raj is here. you just started seeing naked women again, and i don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be."
9560,Howard,"buddy, you okay? oh, man."
9293,Howard,"oh, my god. leonard, someone’s stealing your car!"
8957,Howard,"oh, i’m never going back."
10610,Howard,"one-zero. two. three. four. five-nothing. wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
9812,Howard,"yeah, yeah. he packed me a lunch this morning. and there was a note inside that said go get ’em."
8058,Howard,"you got her to have sex with you. obviously, your superpower is brainwashing."
7460,Howard,fair enough. when’s your break?
9122,Howard,can’t we talk about this?
11789,Howard,she’s great. look.
8833,Howard,i need to talk to bernadette.
8771,Howard,he even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
8916,Howard,"hey, guys, before i forget, i got you a little groomsman present."
9433,Howard,juggle.
9762,Howard,i have a better idea.
7708,Howard,"‘cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
11986,Howard,"baby, i need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. baby, i need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’."
6934,Howard,"when i go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. i don’t know what i would do with a date."
9834,Howard,"eh, tomato, tomahto. the important thing is she’s dead."
11281,Howard,"we’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?"
10428,Howard,stay out of this.
8825,Howard,"okay, just to set the record straight, i didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. shame on you, raj. that is not how we treat women in this country."
8402,Howard,which side do you come down on?
10796,Howard,"you put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match."
10011,Howard,"hey, can i come in?"
6491,Howard,actually that was last year. 
6876,Howard,not a clue.
9347,Howard,"yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. you pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. you push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. your children, grandchildren. meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote beverly hills chihuahua. then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to marie callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot."
9573,Howard,"oh, please, you did not have a moment."
11746,Howard,"speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
10080,Howard,"oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her."
7975,Howard,that’s a stupid question.
11695,Howard,there’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
8368,Howard,i got his back.
6455,Howard,well she’s free to examine my briefs.
9589,Howard,fine. i’ll wear gloves next time.
9123,Howard,"oh, you silly doodlebug."
10792,Howard,yep. a six-foot wiener in a flash t-shirt.
9177,Howard,thanks. guess who picked up his new car this morning?
6286,Howard,let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.
11970,Howard,okay. okay. okay. okay. okay! okay.
7988,Howard,"well, he was italian. it’s a reasonable assumption."
8698,Howard,i miss you.
10366,Howard,"so, how you doing?"
9873,Howard,t minus 45 seconds.
11807,Howard,"all right, this is everything. what do you want to learn?"
9673,Howard,"ooh, shrimp was spicy."
7180,Howard,"okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? because we can totally see it not being great for her. am i right?"
6658,Howard,oh god!
8953,Howard,who can tell? she yells everything. she might have been upset. she might have been hungry.
9414,Howard,nothing.
10820,Howard,then get out of my house.
10664,Howard,i saw the menu. they have soy cheese.
7730,Howard,preparing to fire laser at the moon.
8929,Howard,"i can hear you without the phone,"
8310,Howard,"no, she never mentioned it."
10921,Howard,just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
8149,Howard,"i do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t i?"
11714,Howard,what?
8036,Howard,"oh, yeah? won’t matter, you’re going down!"
8348,Howard,"please, this isn’t about me. i’m proud of you."
10707,Howard,all right. all systems go. in five…
11901,Howard,"hey, it’s me again. just want to let you know the head count for dinner friday has gone up. my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs. oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-jewish on your mother’s side. okay, call me. it’s howard."
10684,Howard,"okay, now all i have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off."
11311,Howard,"i’m telling you, i’m not on drugs. the government’s out to get me."
7527,Howard,why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? we’re gonna make out back here.
11216,Howard,you’re exhausted? try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
8963,Howard,"you’re out of your mind,sheldon."
8172,Howard,there’s no room. his sister is staying with him.
8983,Howard,"uh, no, not really."
9488,Howard,"oh, i think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when i put up that camera."
7968,Howard,i guess that’s that. let’s go home.
10834,Howard,my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
9977,Howard,buzz aldrin.
11150,Howard,i should’ve known.
10085,Howard,you sure. not even coffee? we have r2-decaf. maybe a nice cafe au leia?
10563,Howard,"yes. it reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."
10489,Howard,"yes, we can."
6486,Howard,the amazing howard. do you like magic?
7453,Howard,"yeah, i came to talk to bernadette. she’s working today, right?"
9418,Howard,"no, i’m an american hero. your uncle brings people nuts, okay?"
9956,Howard,you mean tings like moo-stache?
9403,Howard,i got whine.
6164,Howard,"yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
9955,Howard,"went to space? i don’t think so. now, pass the soy sauce. hey, not the green one, the red one."
11260,Howard,really? nothing?
8007,Howard,"yeah, i get it now."
11559,Howard,it has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
7637,Howard,all right. i’ll bet your meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. i bet she had sex because she liked it.
11011,Howard,bernie would love that.
9183,Howard,nope.
6907,Howard,"that’s great, leslie. thanks."
8851,Howard,"no, come on. how cool would that be? me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
11909,Howard,"good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?"
8956,Howard,i know.
6527,Howard,"bad, very bad. "
10403,Howard,seriously?
10345,Howard,"oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?"
9669,Howard,bernie…
7386,Howard,"you know what? i hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
9045,Howard,"so, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. what to do? what to do to you? astronaut wolowitz, reporting for booty. preparing thrusters. we have liftoff. are we clear to jettison that nightgown?"
7803,Howard,"oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars."
9198,Howard,get out of my spot.
9326,Howard,say hello to my little friend.
11240,Howard,"well, she did. and human resources."
8910,Howard,"okay, so we know we’re going to do it sunday morning. now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us."
7584,Howard,"ow! damn, paper cut. nothing worse than a paper cut."
6449,Howard,well you can’t just call dibs.
8523,Howard,did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
8085,Howard,really? you want to see the keynote?
7953,Howard,"i got to tell you, sheldon, i understand why you chose this spot. i mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. i can see the television, but i can still talk to…"
10290,Howard,what?
7823,Howard,gimme.
9512,Howard,"i don’t know, she didn’t leave a note."
8809,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
8047,Howard,"uh, no, it’s an indictment of the american education system."
10771,Howard,i told you to put tape on his mouth.
9915,Howard,there’s a car with a glass roof. want to go look at the stars?
10352,Howard,"so, my mother’s okay with this?"
7187,Howard,"oh, give me a frickin’ break. how could you possibly know that?"
8787,Howard,that’s nice.
6312,Howard,oh no he dit’nt!
11882,Howard,"oh boy, group hug."
7434,Howard,"excuse me, i have a master’s degree in engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology. it required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
7000,Howard,"penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives."
10273,Howard,no one wants to hear it.
9854,Howard,you’re both into rock?
7443,Howard,so nice you could join me this evening. you’re looking lovely as always.
8362,Howard,"oh, bernie, no. you didn’t have to."
8024,Howard,how did you get so brave all of a sudden?
7892,Howard,yeah.
7864,Howard,she does?
6257,Howard,no. call leonard hofstadter.
11553,Howard,what happened 
6501,Howard,too late.
8543,Howard,"if we don’t start soon, george lucas is going to change it again."
7510,Howard,"bernadette, please, i’m asking you to give me another chance."
6420,Howard,hit that thang. 
7134,Howard,"oh, damn it. peer pressure. fine."
6395,Howard,"unbelievable. components i built are on the international space station, and i get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. "
7812,Howard,"oh, and potty is okay?"
6254,Howard,"he’s not the marvel comic story, he’s the original norse god. "
10997,Howard,"well, what do you think we should do?"
11718,Howard,it was really no problem.
6173,Howard,he’s kind of a nerd. juice box?
9815,Howard,are you kidding? you’re the best. i know what the problem is. it’s him.
6968,Howard,you tell me.
6724,Howard,"i need you and raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch, and i need you to get stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. she doesn’t exactly have clearance."
10968,Howard,"oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. wil, want to go to star wars thursday?"
8308,Howard,"no, i mean lunch, today, with bernadette."
6411,Howard,"alright, that’s it."
6526,Howard,"okay, i get it, i know how the world works, how about if i were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people. "
9292,Howard,"okay, what’s next?"
8955,Howard,"to infinity and beyond, baby."
11152,Howard,i appreciate that.
10576,Howard,"no, that’s noodle kugel."
7457,Howard,"no. i’m serious. i’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
11790,Howard,see? nothing to worry about.
11503,Howard,what is going on? did you upgrade his software last night?
11812,Howard,"no, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. yours we think, but we do not say. all right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
9271,Howard,great. let’s do it. 
7759,Howard,"good god, what have we done?"
11705,Howard,you want to let him live here?
8103,Howard,sorry. i just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
6492,Howard,"you think? go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. "
6644,Howard,and it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
8939,Howard,"okay, okay, i know you’re upset, but let me share something i’ve learned since i got here. you realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better."
8118,Howard,"yeah, leonard and i are fine, but i think raj needs to meet a girl really soon."
9970,Howard,will you please sto…
11511,Howard,"it’s pajamas, there’s no cape."
8052,Howard,i’m batman.
11008,Howard,he was being a jerk to everyone. don’t take it personally.
7964,Howard,ooh. can’t wait for that to start.
10447,Howard,can’t do what?
10392,Howard,that’s intense.
9621,Howard,"yeah. you know, i bet you and i have more in common than we think."
7286,Howard,"what do you guys think? want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
7894,Howard,i didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
10360,Howard,what?
9386,Howard,you in there?
10484,Howard,hold on. what’s in it for us?
11725,Howard,"unless it was singing be our guest, i doubt it."
8513,Howard,"thanks, but i watch the charlie brown christmas special every year, so i get the gist."
7445,Howard,"thank you. so, shall we get started?"
11573,Howard,"yeah, got to get her hooked on tv or someday she’ll want me to play outside. boy, that floor is so squeaky. i’m surprised i didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
6223,Howard,"hey, look who’s come out…."
8221,Howard,i thought you had more important things to think about.
11816,Howard,"yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
7563,Howard,"thanks. you, too."
11466,Howard,"you’re up, blabby."
7440,Howard,"hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean i have to."
9725,Howard,look who’s here to put the jew in jewellery night.
11451,Howard,why is it taking so long?
11099,Howard,maybe you’re right.
10379,Howard,"anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another."
9954,Howard,"look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? drop it."
11599,Howard,"okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. not other things you’re feeling, like, what have i done with my life?"
11753,Howard,"well, i know she’s mad at me about something."
11641,Howard,how’d you even get that up the stairs?
10205,Howard,because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!
8352,Howard,"no, ma! it’s raj!"
6805,Howard,"please, leonard, not now. once again, penny and i have begun our little tango."
7944,Howard,"are you kidding me? you’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with i’m sorry?"
8169,Howard,big fight with my mother.
8459,Howard,"look, pretty stars. this is her car. she hopes she can see you again sometime."
9312,Howard,"please, i’m working."
10078,Howard,and the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
8786,Howard,"well, i thought i’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
8680,Howard,"got it, got it. will you e-mail me that list?"
6671,Howard,"sheldon, you’ve already had four servings."
7559,Howard,i thought i smelled popcorn.
10970,Howard,i know.
10952,Howard,really? you want to go down there and meet him?
8297,Howard,where are you going?
7601,Howard,would you just let it go?
7361,Howard,come on. let me take you someplace nice.
10321,Howard,we know.
8365,Howard,she gave me a beautiful watch.
11037,Howard,"me, too. and i think you’re even more beautiful than this rose."
11759,Howard,"hey, how’s it going?"
10195,Howard,so i can shoot you with a spitball.
7012,Howard,"oh, my god! girl fight! "
6287,Howard,so who wants to rent fiddler?
6707,Howard,"god bless you, google street view registered trademark."
9857,Howard,maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. does he know you’re dating sheldon?
8998,Howard,"great. just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting."
8525,Howard,"that’s not my mom, it’s bernadette."
9829,Howard,i lived with her to save money.
10049,Howard,please don’t say it.
6228,Howard,and walks in quiet beauty like the night. 
8027,Howard,ding!
11799,Howard,we can’t get through.
9950,Howard,check my blood pressure again. i can get it higher. just give me a second.  
6874,Howard,maybe we should have your head notarized.
21709,Howard,you’re not going with us.
11552,Howard,so what did you and leonard do?
9014,Howard,what are you doing here?
6382,Howard,we need a hot fifteen year-old asian girl with a thing for smart guys. 
9679,Howard,"oh, wow. yeah, no, i get that. i’m so sorry. starting tomorrow, i am turning over a new leaf. time with you is my number one priority."
8720,Howard,"look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. you’re a grown man. act like one. tell amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. maybe she’ll dig it. women like a firm hand on the tiller."
11019,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. if you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?"
11911,Howard,someone’s in the kitchen i know-ow-ow-ow
9345,Howard,"she’s huge. it was funny. anyway, i was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay."
6339,Howard,"it’s my own fault, i forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06. "
10526,Howard,my mom died.
11947,Howard,"oh, great. it’s my cousin david about the ring. hey, david, what’d you find? oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. her freakishly small hands make anything look big. it’s one of the reasons i love her."
9060,Howard,"yeah, some friends. they all think i’m boring. maybe you should go without me."
8441,Howard,she says it’s nice to meet you.
11087,Howard,"if i’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, i need to come up with a big idea to make some money."
9753,Howard,"you can’t let her know you’re hurting. you know, the key is confidence."
8556,Howard,wait a minute. are you telling me that sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
8659,Howard,i don’t think i could ever let a guy give me a massage.
7275,Howard,hello.
10650,Howard,i know. that’s why i’m spending tonight with you.
11861,Howard,that ain’t sheldon.
11852,Howard,so?
7426,Howard,you’re kidding.
11390,Howard,i don’t know. maybe the surprise will make it more fun. like magic tricks. remember how disappointed you were when i explained the never-ending hanky?
10464,Howard,i’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
11515,Howard,fine. who wants to drive me to the store?
6925,Howard,yes!
10566,Howard,"wait, when did it go out?"
11433,Howard,"oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
21717,Howard,what’s happening?
8792,Howard,"oh, my dear boy, no. okay. next, this is a sexy french maid costume i bought for bernadette. i thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but i was wrong and really wrong."
8868,Howard,from nuts?
6442,Howard,"good choice, alexander graham bell invents the telephone and calls out for dr watson."
12000,Howard,hey.
9234,Howard,do either of you guys know how to fish?
7242,Howard,"aaaaaargh! okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
8936,Howard,"i’m amazing. i mean, this is even better than i dreamed. i look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable."
9696,Howard,"so, what happens next?"
7984,Howard,"oh, great, you made it. come on in. i invited her."
11434,Howard,you’re gonna love it.
6494,Howard,"i suppose that’s possible, but for the record, i’ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one."
7245,Howard,"we’re not goth, we’re just guys."
10128,Howard,a bowl full of m&m’s with a few ambien tossed in.
10592,Howard,excuse me. why is there a sticker on this? it’s my tardis from doctor who. i was planning on moving it in the house.
8645,Howard,"ma, i told you i have a video conference with nasa. i said don’t bother me!"
11968,Howard,"oh, howie, stop talking about space so much. nobody likes it."
7345,Howard,"oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
7777,Howard,"oh, god, that feels so good. yeah, that’s the spot. oh, baby."
10661,Howard,i suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
9540,Howard,"the dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano."
11300,Howard,"i don’t know what to do. it’s the air force. i mean, should i respond to their e-mail? ignore it?"
10325,Howard,"still lives with his ma. yikes, right?"
10088,Howard,"okay, so you’d lose most of jar jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching c-span with monsters."
10027,Howard,and?
6773,Howard,"yeah, what about kryptonian pit stains?"
7838,Howard,"okay, i get it. we’re worried about sheldon."
6175,Howard,"yeah, i’ve had him since level ten. his name is buttons. anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
7115,Howard,"i got your back, sister. all right, i think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. hand me that tupperware."
7651,Howard,where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
7954,Howard,maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. that’s how i learned.
8419,Howard,"relax, it’ll be fine."
7381,Howard,"yeah, well, you think i was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “have you ever peed so much in your life?”"
8505,Howard,you can. i have nothing to say.
11227,Howard,"wait, what is going on?"
9426,Howard,could work out. for all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
8023,Howard,"oh, come on. that’s never gonna happen. now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick."
11184,Howard,"all right, if you say so. what’s in the box?"
9982,Howard,"i’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things."
8204,Howard,"that’s got to be fun for you, huh? watching hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?"
7764,Howard,"that, dear lady, is the wolowitz programmable hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the international space station."
10874,Howard,"i don’t know why she’s lying to you. she’s the one who doesn’t want kids. in fact, every time i bring up the subject…"
6659,Howard,really? why?
7248,Howard,"okay, wait, how about this? we say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
9201,Howard,can you believe this guy?
8154,Howard,"it’s not just the wig. it’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. it’s a two-person job."
7477,Howard,inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
7611,Howard,"you know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn lieutenant uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
8662,Howard,isn’t that just feynman’s idea?
7302,Howard,why not?
7249,Howard,what’s that got to do with the story?
9550,Howard,"yeah, i’ve worked with hawking. i talked you up. he knows your research. i think this could happen."
6674,Howard,and kreplach.
6884,Howard,"next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. okee-day?"
7929,Howard,"really, you, and where, where did you go?"
11904,Howard,i’ll call you back when we firm up the details. it’s howard.
8689,Howard,sheldon was higher.
9138,Howard,what could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
11043,Howard,does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
11158,Howard,you want to come with us?
7356,Howard,"i know, i know."
10963,Howard,same here!
11373,Howard,you can’t develop a problem that fast.
9503,Howard,how’d you get him to come to your house?
6170,Howard,it’s french for good shower. it’s a sentiment i can express in six languages.
9080,Howard,"this is what you sound like. i think i’m talking in an american accent, but it really sounds like i’m wearing a set of giant dentures."
6538,Howard,i really don’t think the colonoscopy was necessary. 
7469,Howard,what?
7252,Howard,"no, no. look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
9911,Howard,i had a little to do with it.
7560,Howard,want my corn?
11804,Howard,"oh, so our love is not real?"
7524,Howard,"flesh-eating bacteria. and yet, i still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
10167,Howard,"well, i didn’t say i was your father."
9727,Howard,"well, last week was a blast. plus, i thought you might like having a guy here. "
6998,Howard,that’s your entire profit margin.
8889,Howard,close your eyes. put out your hand. i got you something special.
10867,Howard,when is your visa up?
11475,Howard,hi. howard wolowitz.
8404,Howard,"first of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. and, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
11218,Howard,you sure you don’t want to come watch game of thrones with us?
9175,Howard,"hey, fellas, what’s going on?"
10247,Howard,"yes, i am. you know, i can’t even watch game of thrones now without thinking of mother saying, stuart, which one is thrones?"
7639,Howard,what are you doing?
10587,Howard,i wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of thor.
9281,Howard,"wait, you got called in, too? what is going on?"
6251,Howard,"if that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat."
8613,Howard,why?
11956,Howard,"sorry i’m late. uh, i got great news. nasa picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the international space station this spring."
6799,Howard,"all right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something."
7587,Howard,but there must be thousands of dollars here. why don’t you put it in the bank?
6324,Howard,"no, it’s okay, it’s your millenium falcon, you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do. me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. "
7574,Howard,"oh, man!"
10483,Howard,what do you mean?
8185,Howard,i choose you.
9039,Howard,not really.
6408,Howard,"hey, i buzzed in. "
9251,Howard,‘cause bernadette made me.
8546,Howard,it’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
9445,Howard,i do.  great. neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
11577,Howard,that sounds expensive.
6204,Howard,"kissing, what kind of kissing? cheeks? lips? chaste? french? "
10304,Howard,you didn’t have to say so much more.
9602,Howard,"thank you. i really needed to hear that today.  ooh, brie’s ready."
11287,Howard,"uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know."
9443,Howard,something i should have done a long time ago. 
11739,Howard,the rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.
6215,Howard,i smell robot. 
11673,Howard,"oh, better luck next time, pink cheeks."
10961,Howard,nope.
9897,Howard,he just parked. he’s on his way up.
6720,Howard,on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield. where do you think? on mars!
10486,Howard,let’s see. how about emily or cinnamon?
7521,Howard,"there might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and i don’t want bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and penny made out, too."
10016,Howard,"well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of temple beth el. anyway, she broke up with him. and she’s basically been alone ever since. she never said it, but i always felt i was the reason why."
11823,Howard,i can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.
8408,Howard,"wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
7274,Howard,"tell you what, we’ll skype."
8394,Howard,whoa! you just bit my tongue!
7818,Howard,"raj, do you have any questions for amy?"
8343,Howard,colossal serpent.
10798,Howard,"hey, stuart."
10193,Howard,okay.
8926,Howard,bernadette maryann rostenkowski.
9723,Howard,"you know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. you’d be able to make much cooler stuff."
6370,Howard,"sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering."
8655,Howard,i haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day leonard made that multiplication error.
9926,Howard,that was nasa. they want me to go back up to the space station.
11554,Howard,"hey, i found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies."
8678,Howard,done.
9695,Howard,"seriously, congratulations, sheldon."
8976,Howard,what’s wrong? you look upset.
8604,Howard,"i was upset. my mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of bengay doesn’t burn your eyes."
7412,Howard,"hot dogs, buns, s’mores, i mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
8367,Howard,"yeah, how could you do that?"
7594,Howard,"okay, i’m cutting. i’m not gonna talk to stan lee after you cheese him off."
9756,Howard,"mmm. i’m gonna say not. that’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to thanksgiving at her house."
10241,Howard,what? you’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
9522,Howard,what?
10577,Howard,"ma always kept it on hand, in case i got sick. she thought she could cure anything with her cooking. even the time i got food poisoning. from her cooking."
10462,Howard,"oh. okay. it’s not like indiana jones and the temple of doom, right? some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out."
6523,Howard,"look, all i need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so i can pretend i had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. "
6939,Howard,"okay, i’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable."
8378,Howard,what are you going to do in nebraska?
7866,Howard,let me ask you something else. is she seeing anybody?
9467,Howard,"me, too. if i’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats."
10713,Howard,i don’t know. must be getting a wifi signal from somewhere else.
7822,Howard,you’re not doing that right.
10869,Howard,oh.
6800,Howard,"gentlemen, goggles."
11776,Howard,they’re highly-trained educators with background checks. they’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.
7341,Howard,hold my line.
8838,Howard,i get that.
9622,Howard,i don’t know. tell me some things you like.
9133,Howard,should we follow him?
10287,Howard,"no, it vibrates. keep going."
10974,Howard,i know. we’ve been waiting so long for this.
9985,Howard,no.
8759,Howard,"i told you, no."
10328,Howard,yes.
6804,Howard,how is doable anything but a compliment?
8166,Howard,that’s it. i don’t have to take this. good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
6203,Howard,"stealing snail mail, very old school, i like it. "
10911,Howard,"if you can’t support me when i’m lying, why are we married?"
10202,Howard,"that was a hard one. all right. how does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? you don’t know, do you? what’s the matter, smart guy? don’t know poiseuille’s law?"
7572,Howard,i heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
9989,Howard,"i’m sorry, too. it’s all my fault."
10409,Howard,i agree.
9750,Howard,sure.
10284,Howard,"mm, that was mine."
9231,Howard,"you know, the thing."
10475,Howard,"i know you’re under a lot of pressure, so i’m gonna let that pass."
11132,Howard,"yeah, one sec. i just need to sign this contract."
8715,Howard,you’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
7657,Howard,are you saying he’s man-struating?
8056,Howard,"okay, i guess we just go without a wonder woman."
10541,Howard,how are the taxes going?
9766,Howard,does he?
8187,Howard,i don’t know. she hasn’t responded to my email yet.
10419,Howard,"okay, here’s the plan. i’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up."
8676,Howard,you really want me to sign a pre-nup?
6769,Howard,"oh, yeah. it’s beyond contemptible."
11831,Howard,what the hell?
8719,Howard,"yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
9676,Howard,"oh, hi."
10901,Howard,i’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
10492,Howard,it’s just so perfect that we’re both libras.
9692,Howard,so i’m almost done writing the song for bernadette. are you cool playing the cello?
6320,Howard,okay. so what’s up? 
8079,Howard,fine. let’s say it together.
6772,Howard,i don’t know. kryptonian mustard.
9154,Howard,are we good?
10329,Howard,"yeah, that was very uncool. get the hammer. get the hammer."
8807,Howard,"no, about my job. i want you to tell me i’m good at what i do."
9277,Howard,huh. i just got called in to human resources.
8575,Howard,"look, i made sheldon disappear. ta-da."
6406,Howard,"perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
10498,Howard,"yeah, no problem."
7653,Howard,"my power is the ability to pretend like i give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. and that’s 24-7, buddy."
8937,Howard,"oh, yeah? that’s nice."
11711,Howard,"it is our pleasure.  hey, can you hold on one sec? hello?"
6218,Howard,"hey, what up, science bitches? may i introduce my special lady friend, summer. "
9934,Howard,are you kidding? it was the greatest experience of my life.
9075,Howard,"yeah, i wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now."
6264,Howard,more precisely we used your loofah. i exfoliated her brains out! 
6983,Howard,you underestimate me.
11447,Howard,aaaaah. what was i thinking? wolowitzes are not a lifting people. we tip the lifting people.
6304,Howard,"no problem, turning it down.  et voila. "
10305,Howard,"i brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too."
10069,Howard,"okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine."
10855,Howard,may i say something?
6348,Howard,i’m not going in there.
9413,Howard,"so many memories. i mean, how many times in these hallways was i tripped, punched and spit on? oh, look, here’s my old locker. i have a masters in engineering and i still can’t figure out how scott kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  hey."
6673,Howard,nekhmakh.
11063,Howard,"it says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely."
6514,Howard,"yeah, no. "
6722,Howard,"yeah, i picked her up in the bar. she’s a doctor. one free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not jewish."
11764,Howard,"prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
10388,Howard,"makes you think. oh, well."
11381,Howard,that’s it? you’re okay with that?
9441,Howard,"of course i’m curious. i haven’t seen the man since, oh, i was a little kid. and a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? what’s that about?"
9531,Howard,"we’ll be fine, watch. suddenly, a spectral shape rises from koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  well, i’m just a tree, but if i were you, i’d listen to your ghost friend."
9775,Howard,"oh, i love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. get it? ‘cause it sounds like blintz."
9302,Howard,maybe thor’s hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
10106,Howard,"bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?"
8510,Howard,really?
8978,Howard,"okay, i guess. it’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me."
8824,Howard,"bernadette, listen…"
7915,Howard,i think she likes you.
6843,Howard,"c’mon, don’t let him get to you. it’s kripke."
8469,Howard,"he’s not going to listen, he’s in love."
11076,Howard,"are we in a good school district? you’re catholic, i’m jewish. what religion do we raise it? and if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? people say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket."
11685,Howard,"well, comic-con tickets go on sale this friday, and i was hoping i could go with the guys. but before you say anything, i’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, i mean everything. i’m even gonna answer for you. yes, howard, you can go. "
9187,Howard,fine. i’m taking your diploma.
8401,Howard,neither of them are close.
8181,Howard,isn’t that great?
6309,Howard,"i don’t know, sheldon, those topical conferences on bowes-einstein condensates parties are legendary. "
10931,Howard,is that a job offer? ‘cause i really want to go to mars. assuming i can bring my wife. she hardly takes up any room. she’s basically a carry-on.
6911,Howard,in the paintball shed! twice!
11514,Howard,"mm, i know. it’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
9922,Howard,"yeah, i can control all sorts of stuff."
6771,Howard,what if he gets something kryptonian on it?
11176,Howard,"hey, where you been?"
6865,Howard,"hey, do i mock you with the bhagavad-gita every time you scarf down a whopper?"
10201,Howard,"yeah. okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?"
11492,Howard,"okay, raj, i’m gonna show you something. now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. but, i’m not going to tell you who likes it."
7903,Howard,i had a good time.
11338,Howard,"well, i married a little catholic girl, so we’re even. anyway, this is leonard and sheldon. the three of us came up with the guidance system."
8136,Howard,what about sheldon?
11312,Howard,maybe to you. you didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
8241,Howard,i’ll show you one more time. raj?
7583,Howard,that’s crazy. stan lee had nothing to do with batman.
7907,Howard,"oh, hey. i hope you didn’t hear that."
10606,Howard,"this is ridiculous. i want a new champion. amy, were you serious about being able to serve?"
6820,Howard,i’m fine.
6211,Howard,"sheldon, if you were a robot, and i knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?"
8453,Howard,you really want to ask her that?
7600,Howard,not just the finger. the moving finger.
11507,Howard,when would you move in?
10231,Howard,"well, maybe i’ll do a good job."
7130,Howard,"easy. instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an nsf expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the arctic circle with an anal nutbag.”"
8421,Howard,"oh. yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. hang on. ma, give up! tonight’s not your night!"
8491,Howard,i’ve been offered a chance to go up to the international space station for three weeks. what are your thoughts on that?
9861,Howard,"oh, i’ve heard those words so many times. from linda nosenchuck, tammy rosenworcel."
7119,Howard,"yes, sir, i understand classified. we’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
10424,Howard,like when?
10466,Howard,"yeah, but you’re a scientist."
10217,Howard,what’s wrong with the way i run?
6728,Howard,my mother is so gonna love her.
11872,Howard,"good point, how you gonna cool it?"
10166,Howard,your mother and i? you’re not my father.
9273,Howard,"wait, what are you doing?"
11478,Howard,"sorry, just passing through. i think this fell off your cart."
9106,Howard,"she did not burp me. she was patting me on the back, and i happened to burp. don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?"
6716,Howard,"step one, she notices the eye patch. may i say, penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? "
8906,Howard,thanks.
11722,Howard,i’ll say it again. india.
9884,Howard,i already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
6685,Howard,"wait a minute, you’re telling me that i’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?"
7046,Howard,"that’s my system. oh, and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she’s mine."
8108,Howard,"let me ask you something, bernie."
7396,Howard,i am.
8327,Howard,"bernie, it’s not you. she’s just set in her ways."
8251,Howard,"nah, i think we have to be more subtle."
6432,Howard,do you have $800?
6202,Howard,sounds like your neighbour’s home.
9571,Howard,it was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
8892,Howard,"take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything."
7607,Howard,you see what you’re doing? stop that.
8182,Howard,"oh, uh…"
10917,Howard,"i don’t know. i was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, i want some more."
7089,Howard,"no, i’m celebrating. as we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the international space station where it will deploy the wolowitz zero-gravity waste disposal system."
8129,Howard,sexually.
7437,Howard,"look, bernadette is really nice. i just always thought when i finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
7185,Howard,"no, you’re misunderstanding. a shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them."
6811,Howard,"here’s a crazy idea, ma, answer it!"
10177,Howard,"hey, what if i took your class?"
8722,Howard,"hey, guys, i got a surprise."
8299,Howard,i was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
11598,Howard,the display is synced to your phone. give it a try.
6668,Howard,i believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount of thai food and split into two sheldons.
11224,Howard,"no, i’m fine."
21718,Howard,you’re waiting for the elevator?
9556,Howard,"you’re right, you’re right. i’m really proud of you, and i’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. and space beats water."
8254,Howard,"thanks. our culprit is one mr. todd zarnecki, 2711 ocean view road, carlsbad, california."
7860,Howard,"okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
10226,Howard,that was a close one.
9868,Howard,you want us to talk to him?
8823,Howard,"how about you? did you have a fun night? yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
8874,Howard,uh-huh.
7731,Howard,there it is. there’s the spike!
7008,Howard,"oh, pish-posh.  shucks means shucks. let one go once in a while."
11128,Howard,i guess that is a way around this. you guys would be cool doing it like that?
10313,Howard,do the dishes. there’s a star right there.
9851,Howard,i’m in the middle of something.
7135,Howard,for this i went to mit.
8763,Howard,have you met my mother? i live in jewish hell.
6857,Howard,wow. i don’t see how we missed that.
10314,Howard,that pan had to soak and you know it.
8620,Howard,"oh, yeah."
10570,Howard,no. all ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
9849,Howard,"please, i’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  yeah? well, i fake my orgasms."
11805,Howard,"now, this is rare. i don’t know which one of you i want to stop talking first."
6330,Howard,how can i ask them when i’m talking to you!  hello.
8529,Howard,"trick or treat, bubbeleh."
10455,Howard,"you work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?"
11072,Howard,are you sure?
7297,Howard,"you and i made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
10480,Howard,"it’s called emily or cinnamon. i give you actual quotes i’ve heard raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog."
8447,Howard,"look, i don’t know the sign for opalescent."
8488,Howard,honestly? sex.
9782,Howard,they’re drinking beer and watching football. 
7634,Howard,don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
6277,Howard,what are you guys doing here? 
9289,Howard,we’ve got our costumes in the trunk. we could go there and have a little photo shoot.
11082,Howard,"oh, my god, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?"
10976,Howard,bernie and i are getting the house ready for the remodel. we could always use an extra pair of hands.
9848,Howard,"well, i’d be able to tell anyway."
8723,Howard,"no. bernadette’s going to be playing with us. so, that’s pretty cool, huh? right? sure it is, yeah."
6831,Howard,you really think so?
10666,Howard,you want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? that’s ridiculous.
10529,Howard,"no, it’s okay. what?"
6890,Howard,we’ll talk about this later.
11608,Howard,"sorry, is that gary with one r or two?"
10937,Howard,"that’s not the point. when we created footprints on the moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. you know, maybe i should go solo."
7719,Howard,we broke up weeks ago.
6269,Howard,"i do not, my mother lives with me. "
11817,Howard,again.
11385,Howard,bloberta. or blobbi with an i.
10161,Howard,this is stupid. i’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
6293,Howard,i’d like to try a slippery nipple. 
10251,Howard,"toy stores, puppet shows."
9017,Howard,"yeah. the lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so i’m like an inch and a half taller. i’m going to the dmv tomorrow to get my license changed before i shrink back."
11795,Howard,"i’ll get her, you grab her bag. "
9200,Howard,it’s not just a parking spot. he can’t handle the fact that i’m a bigger deal than he is now.
10732,Howard,we should have done it months ago.
11863,Howard,guys. focus. should we do something about nowitzki?
8322,Howard,you’d think that. but no.
7952,Howard,all right. apology accepted.
9521,Howard,"it’s not her. i just googled foo-foo little dogs.  it’s raj. stay quiet. hey, bad timing. bernadette just took cinnamon out for a walk."
9111,Howard,"i remember when i was five, hiding under this desk with all my halloween candy. had some peanut m&m’s, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. came home, celebrated with a snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock."
7045,Howard,"it’s way too early in the night for that. see, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
7891,Howard,"yeah, but we weren’t, i-i mean, you and i never…"
9170,Howard,what the hell is that thing?
10415,Howard,and tell them that we compromised all the equipment? let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
8145,Howard,wait-wait-wait. are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
9504,Howard,"you know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?"
10913,Howard,i happen to be a giving and generous lover.
6932,Howard,thank you. it helps when i get to practice with a real woman.
6500,Howard,don’t ask.
7145,Howard,"good idea, what do you think? ice station zebra or john carpenter’s the thing?"
11529,Howard,"we made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it."
8885,Howard,check.
6198,Howard,"leonard, you’ve got one on your tail."
9040,Howard,"you know, people say the soyuz capsule was a lemon. but, hey, that baby got me to space and back."
8460,Howard,"i speak sign language, i don’t read minds."
10793,Howard,it’s burning salsa. i’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
9197,Howard,"i’m warning you, sheldon!"
10370,Howard,"they always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on."
11596,Howard,"yeah, i was joking."
9714,Howard,you know they’re making jewellery right?
9664,Howard,"for the love of god, why?"
11859,Howard,yeah. like bernadette used to look at me.
11781,Howard,finally get halley down?
7661,Howard,"okay, how about this for a topic, why is leonard being a giant douche? assuming giant douches are possible."
9901,Howard,"oh, god, i could really use exactly two tablespoons of pepto right now."
11712,Howard,"well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
7740,Howard,excuse me?
10671,Howard,i’ll figure it out.
10280,Howard,"well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
11375,Howard,no worries.
6753,Howard,two booty calls with leslie winkle.
9953,Howard,"oh, me, too. i mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest."
6930,Howard,"okay, there are two ways of looking at this…"
6643,Howard,"oh damn, i picked the wrong side."
10875,Howard,"oh, my god, we’re gonna die."
10534,Howard,"so, some stranger has my mom? is that what you’re telling me? my poor mother can be anywhere in los angeles right now?"
9076,Howard,"that somewhere right now stephen hawking is saying, damn it, i meant to click no.”"
7224,Howard,"oh, you know, goth stuff. goth magazines, goth music."
6711,Howard,she’s taller than all the women in my family combined.
8323,Howard,you can’t take that personally.
10315,Howard,"it’s not an allowance. it’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends."
9209,Howard,"you’re the bigger man, sheldon."
11952,Howard,i said i’m getting it!
6879,Howard,"i understand that unlike leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields."
9224,Howard,"okay, dig in."
6903,Howard,it kind of does.
8061,Howard,"ma, ma, calm down. listen to me. i know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. now, put your finger on it. doesn’t matter which finger. good choice. now move it down to your e-mail icon. yeah, the little envelope. what do you mean, what does it look like? it looks like an envelope! fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. good-bye!"
8063,Howard,i always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
7038,Howard,okay! let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
9894,Howard,no need. i’m breaking rules all the time. 
9839,Howard,what’s your part?
10590,Howard,it’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. took that long to walk it off.
7778,Howard,"i’ll eat later. i’m busy! oh, yeah. just like a real hand. hmm."
9135,Howard,don’t you know his schedule?
7543,Howard,"a little jealous, are we?"
9505,Howard,"okay, so what do i need to know to take care of her?"
7873,Howard,"bernadette. she was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story."
6703,Howard,"it was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in siberia, i took it an hour out of its way, tops."
7595,Howard,"awesome. mine says, to my friend, howard, from stan lee, excelsior!"
7783,Howard,"no, no! don’t touch, the program is paused."
7320,Howard,you like magic?
10319,Howard,how’d you get that?
9638,Howard,cherry
7742,Howard,"trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
10031,Howard,what’s this?
10927,Howard,"oh, man. i, what an honour to meet you. i’m, i’m such a fan of tesla and spacex. all your companies. howard wolowitz, caltech."
11954,Howard,"i think i wrote a letter to santa claus every day. and then on christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
9647,Howard,seriously?
8935,Howard,"hey, there’s my beautiful bride. can you see me?"
21714,Howard,"oh, probably, if i could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on."
9496,Howard,so take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
10993,Howard,he’s gone. let’s start in the garage.
7329,Howard,"ooh, rough. okay, check this out. my mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so i wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children."
11189,Howard,so you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
7644,Howard,"yeah, so?"
9129,Howard,"two forty-four, right on schedule. hey, sheldon."
10928,Howard,"oh, yeah. nothing better than helping people. which is something i realized when i was viewing earth from the deck of the international space station, where i spent two months as a payload specialist, a job i was qualified for because i’m an mit-trained engineer."
7502,Howard,"come on, do i have to think of everything?"
9360,Howard,"hey, raj. what’s up?"
9432,Howard,"you know, if he really wants to stay and finish, i can give him a ride home."
10394,Howard,sing hakuna matata like an eight-year-old girl?
6951,Howard,"sheldon, i owe you an apology. taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! i’ve actually got a shot at a terminator."
10200,Howard,"okay. you enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?"
9510,Howard,really?
7621,Howard,fine. he can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
11509,Howard,how did you know it wasn’t me?
8098,Howard,probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
7216,Howard,it’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
7652,Howard,"raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? i don’t know, some indian meditation crap."
11376,Howard,that was painful to watch.
7673,Howard,"you know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing wesley, it’d be the “wesley” crushers."
9520,Howard,"well, maybe with the first one. but kids are like pancakes. the first one’s always a throwaway. how’s this look?"
11119,Howard,excellent.
8727,Howard,i’ll miss you.
11903,Howard,"we’re not going to the olive garden, mom!"
8881,Howard,hey mike?
8648,Howard,mass. that’s a cool nickname. ‘cause force equals mass times acceleration.
10856,Howard,never mind.
7507,Howard,which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys.
6953,Howard,"sheldon, let me explain to you how this works."
11719,Howard,"hey, look at that. you’ve got a raj, we’ve got a stuart. maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
11068,Howard,morning.
11168,Howard,raj. he really wants to see this movie.
6364,Howard,we liked leonard.
8526,Howard,what’s up?
11159,Howard,remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
9570,Howard,"mrs. davis, nice to see you. "
7890,Howard,"okay, fine. i’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the internet where the name wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. but the only reason i go there, the only reason i’ve ever gone there is because i don’t have a real woman in my life. you happy?"
10292,Howard,"or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling."
8540,Howard,"raj did it. and he says he would do it again. okay, i’m sorry. you sent me the picture, i wasn’t thinking."
7767,Howard,coming up. 
6524,Howard,yes.
7444,Howard,"come on, katee, don’t make it sound so cheap."
11860,Howard,"okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
8048,Howard,switching it up from last year when we came as the justice league of america.
10683,Howard,it’s green.
8157,Howard,your call.
8862,Howard,we can only hope… that he doesn’t.
8274,Howard,i’m gonna ask her to marry me.
7230,Howard,we are fun people.
11414,Howard,you know i rely on humour in times of stress.
8598,Howard,maybe me and bernadette aren’t right for each other.
11382,Howard,"yes, thank you so much."
7461,Howard,don’t you just hate when this happens?
11384,Howard,"yeah, we could name him blobert."
9542,Howard,"fine.  you’d think, after all these years, i’d know not to fly over volcanoes. i’m a freaking idiot."
6795,Howard,see? sounds just like you and penny. we’ll take it.
11981,Howard,"okay, ma. say hi to aunt gladys. yeah, i love you, too. bye."
8550,Howard,"what? please! this is billy the kid we’re talking about. i mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is billy the kid doing in the mystic realm of ka’a?"
6597,Howard,"hmm, let’s do it. "
11724,Howard,"if you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here."
11057,Howard,you’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
8775,Howard,no!
8189,Howard,that’s fine. why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? and then you can go shopping.
11066,Howard,he’s not showing any symptoms. i guess i’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
10065,Howard,i wouldn’t worry about it. he’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
7263,Howard,"oh, he usually comes to my house. right, pal?  all right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. i don’t even chew it. i swallow it like pills."
6868,Howard,"ooh, double sixes."
6447,Howard,"you can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana. "
10064,Howard,"ugh. me, too. what happened?"
9937,Howard,"hey, bernie. i’m home. hello."
8836,Howard,penny has a message for you.
7994,Howard,"okay, i think that’s enough about me."
6419,Howard,sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.
11580,Howard,no.
8176,Howard,thanks.
7833,Howard,"oh, i thought you were just making a generalization, you know, i’m worried about sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime jell-o."
9552,Howard,what the hell? i thought i was your best friend.
9394,Howard,"you’re the one? okay, let me tell you something. that guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. okay? he was devastated."
9641,Howard,"hey, wait a minute. no, the nazis were digging in the wrong place. the only reason they got the ark was because indy found it first."
9000,Howard,did you get a sea lion while i was gone?
10659,Howard,hello.
7467,Howard,gals? chicks? utero-americans?
9088,Howard,what are you waiting for? hit send.
11198,Howard,you need some help?
9263,Howard,"excuse me, i’m a married man now. i wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile."
10159,Howard,"come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?"
7165,Howard,"oh, right, and i do? my people already crossed a desert once, we’re done."
6212,Howard,"maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. "
11680,Howard,"mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?"
10343,Howard,what was i gonna do? they were playing our song. i can’t take this anymore.
9274,Howard,"oh, come on, that can’t be true."
7247,Howard,what are you thinking? maybe a big musical number?
7065,Howard,she dumped me!
6268,Howard,"let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t christie stay with me."
7369,Howard,really?
10674,Howard,"okay, the wifi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. we should be getting an image."
8284,Howard,then the studio must have real faith in it.
9988,Howard,i’m gonna need that bag back.
7851,Howard,"no, of course not."
9983,Howard,"when? how about in the car? i’m an astronaut, and you know it. you just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous."
11631,Howard,i know. that’s why i keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.
9055,Howard,nothing.
8038,Howard,i prefer to think that i can’t lose.
8571,Howard,"as i was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. "
8442,Howard,"raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. she says she has to go back to her family, but penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
8634,Howard,"open the pod bay doors, hal."
10267,Howard,"well, i don’t need a reason, it’s my house."
10084,Howard,no. don’t be ridiculous. that’s wookiee life day.
6651,Howard,this is a state-of-the-art simulator. i adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
8059,Howard,superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
10358,Howard,"damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?"
8584,Howard,"and now, all the rings are magically linked together. my fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. it made all my money disappear."
6440,Howard,"you can’t just keep it here, what if i meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that? "
8281,Howard,you will?
10079,Howard,what difference does it make?
6518,Howard,"no, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. "
10310,Howard,"for the tenth time, that was a groupon."
8191,Howard,yeah. you know what would make this moment perfect?
7175,Howard,"okay, first of all…"
6417,Howard,"okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
11442,Howard,you don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
7941,Howard,"i see. well, it’s good to know, when i need you guys, i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything."
8278,Howard,thank you. bernadette maryann rostenkowski…
6602,Howard,like if hulk were dating peppermint patty.
6970,Howard,"so anyway, in the dream, you and i were ice skating, just the two of us. and then, i picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. i tried to stick them back on, but before i could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. what do you think that means?"
10614,Howard,"no, i’m not."
11592,Howard,because that’s not what people do.
7366,Howard,"ah, who am i kidding? i wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that."
11097,Howard,damn. what is it?
10602,Howard,so it’s settled. the fate of doctor who’s tardis will be decided by a game of thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of thundercats versus transformers.
10374,Howard,"okay. the truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful."
7700,Howard,"yeah, um, i have a two-part question."
11088,Howard,that’s easy for you to say. you and sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
8596,Howard,"yeah, she doesn’t like them. and from what i saw, the feeling was mutual."
8242,Howard,all right. . two of hearts.
9465,Howard,"actually, i don’t want to know. i want all of them to be true."
7291,Howard,"all right, raj has played his phantom warlord card, and i am going to back him up with my strangling vines. choke on that, sucka."
9462,Howard,really?
8084,Howard,still right behind you.
8227,Howard,"you know, i have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. like, ooh, look! the pencil’s rubber!"
10537,Howard,i could’ve driven her.
8298,Howard,nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
7597,Howard,"plus, you didn’t get to meet stan lee."
9654,Howard,i’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
6943,Howard,"hey, ma, you got to rent me a tux!"
9927,Howard,i told them i’d be honoured.
8690,Howard,why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
8482,Howard,"well, i mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you chernobyl."
7578,Howard,absolutely. and i’d leave him there. 
6451,Howard,"okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here. "
7799,Howard,what do we owe you?
8979,Howard,i know.
7931,Howard,"yeah, well, raj, i just want to say that i’d never betray your trust. unlike leonard, i respect you."
11562,Howard,bernie?
8897,Howard,i don’t need to take cereal.
10572,Howard,all you said was i had to get rid of things. you didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
7293,Howard,are we going to talk or are we going to play mystic warlords of ka-ah?
9865,Howard,poor bert. that guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
6242,Howard,"no, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo. "
8819,Howard,don’t remember. please sit down.
9446,Howard,ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
9516,Howard,"good thinking.  cinnamon, come to daddy."
6266,Howard,in here my lady.
8882,Howard,i changed my mind. i don’t want to do this.
6267,Howard,chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
10638,Howard,you are my brother.
7878,Howard,"i wasn’t athletic, yeah, i was kind of sickly."
7061,Howard,is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
9142,Howard,why would he chain up stephen hawking?
10877,Howard,but you were okay throwing me under the bus?
10446,Howard,"you were right. go ahead, call building services. tell them it was my fault."
8225,Howard,"i’m saying believe in magic, you muggle."
8731,Howard,"well, can you make it soon. there’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. in one corner, bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine."
9280,Howard,i don’t know. seek professional help?
7368,Howard,"yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me."
6217,Howard,"well, as usual, wolowitz has the solution. i happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and leonard could have his pick."
7775,Howard,"or, as we call them, shamy."
6807,Howard,"um, so what are you saying?"
8346,Howard,"you gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty."
11040,Howard,when are you gonna tell emily?
6400,Howard,"they formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing knotsbury farm. "
7869,Howard,"okay. well, you know world of warcraft?"
9212,Howard,it’s heebie-jeebies.
10885,Howard,you sure you’re up for that? she did hurt you.
8410,Howard,movie theatre.
6345,Howard,"sorry, don’t you have a spare."
10918,Howard,it’s not like i’m expecting them to sing.
7792,Howard,i slipped and fell.
11484,Howard,that’s amazing.
8236,Howard,maybe. when it stops being fun.
11907,Howard,"ooh, looks like i’m gonna have sex tonight. hey, baby…"
8718,Howard,48 hours of star wars gaming.
9905,Howard,okay. just make it look like an accident.
6657,Howard,oh.
10357,Howard,not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
9428,Howard,"are you kidding? he’s like a savant at organizing. everything in his apartment has a label on it. including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. and if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label."
7974,Howard,how about the guy who gets a prostate exam from wolverine?
11550,Howard,"no. i got it. doubtfire, poppins, follow me."
7425,Howard,we do?
7433,Howard,"okay, well, before you and penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
11101,Howard,thank you.
9130,Howard,raj and i are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. want to come with us?
6889,Howard,i can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
11779,Howard,"me i get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
10107,Howard,"yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. i’m what my people would call a putz."
8691,Howard,the bird?
9652,Howard,bernie…
10513,Howard,that would be great. i’d love for things between me and mom to get back to normal.
6834,Howard,yeah. they sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
11042,Howard,"sorry, bernie and i are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what i mean."
9246,Howard,"hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go."
7333,Howard,"listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime."
10380,Howard,all right.
6687,Howard,"sadly, mrs. giselle wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed."
10262,Howard,"well, hear me out."
6766,Howard,she was?
10617,Howard,something happened different from the way you wanted it.
8890,Howard,"no, here."
7614,Howard,"i know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
6550,Howard,"it’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?"
6253,Howard,"hey, have you seen koothrapali?"
11820,Howard,"i just told you, your mom’s."
11526,Howard,and talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
9351,Howard,what? you spent the night?
9356,Howard,"oh, really? where are your clothes and your shoes?"
8008,Howard,did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
7082,Howard,"really, me too."
9041,Howard,creature from the black forest ham lagoon.
7107,Howard,"maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself."
11064,Howard,"it’s not terrific. lots of highly unlikely things happen. you saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me."
6162,Howard,it’s a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974.
7267,Howard,"okay, she’s gone."
9329,Howard,didn’t cost a thing. i made them myself.
7831,Howard,"women, huh? can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses."
9204,Howard,stop that. you stop that.
7619,Howard,why do you want a jet ski?
10632,Howard,"hey, hey, the young man asked a good question."
9773,Howard,no. but i did get tackled in the hallway once. the whole school cheered.
11838,Howard,give us some good news.
8883,Howard,"yeah, i’m a funny guy. i also have a hysterical bit planned for later where i pretend to cry through the whole launch."
7255,Howard,"right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
11388,Howard,"so you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?"
8585,Howard,"okay. okay. now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
11201,Howard,what? are you gonna cry?
9110,Howard,yeah. i can’t believe i’m not going to live here anymore. this has always been my bedroom. right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
10944,Howard,i’ll keep rockin’. you don’t do that.
11535,Howard,melvina.
6760,Howard,new pants?
7109,Howard,"okay, here’s an idea. what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel?"
8506,Howard,"i was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
8465,Howard,why are you still doing this?
6460,Howard,"well, i think you’re delightfully droll. or as the french say, tres drole. "
10269,Howard,what?
6356,Howard,"angle your head to the right. a little more. a little more.  that’s it, now just keep true. alright, you’re close enough to sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. now turn it on."
10773,Howard,yeah. a buddy of mine let me borrow it.
11835,Howard,how can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
11960,Howard,how about now?
9741,Howard,wow.
8151,Howard,this is perfect. i hope this moment never ends.
9612,Howard,"oh, that’s cute. like it’s a real college."
7887,Howard,"well, you know how it is with guys. i mean, we have needs and…"
8621,Howard,"oh, let me try the voice recognition."
11694,Howard,i tried.
6344,Howard,sorry.  found ‘em. 
10738,Howard,never should have told you my middle name.
10160,Howard,who cares? you wouldn’t care if i slept with your mom?
7454,Howard,why not?
9391,Howard,now what?
9896,Howard,yeah. what about it?
9735,Howard,since when can’t you open up with me?
8124,Howard,sexual needs.
7842,Howard,anything.
6904,Howard,i agree. how exactly do we do that? 
8302,Howard,troll master.
8615,Howard,why not?
11556,Howard,what’s the matter?
6639,Howard,"sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane."
7850,Howard,not that kind of confused.
8815,Howard,"well, it’s probably not for me."
9942,Howard,you don’t think i did a good job up there?
10242,Howard,hey.
7557,Howard,you can come with us.
11183,Howard,"okay, that is the least jewish thing i’ve ever seen in my life. you feel like raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?"
8672,Howard,"we’re grown men, we drink at bars."
11190,Howard,"and you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?"
8694,Howard,"yeah, but it’s from nasa, so it’s oh eight hundred."
8350,Howard,better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
6717,Howard,ow.
7807,Howard,"oh, look, it’s leonard and r2-d-bag."
10495,Howard,"i don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody."
10581,Howard,okay.
7800,Howard,here you go.
8742,Howard,then why did she even go out with you?
6797,Howard,"all right, that’s the last servo. behold the mobile omnidirectional neutralization and termination eradicator. or…"
8987,Howard,"okay, okay. what am i doing? i’m using up all the oxygen. if i die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man."
10045,Howard,that must be it.
9639,Howard,halle berry. why?
8909,Howard,"oh, wait to go, raj."
6873,Howard,okay.  
11122,Howard,"that old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose."
11913,Howard,"enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. i’ll come over every night and have dinner with you."
7643,Howard,you quit the game! you had no right to take it.
9407,Howard,"so, you think i’m one of the smarter kids?"
7234,Howard,"uh, yeah!"
8960,Howard,excuse me. i’m talking to my friends.
11524,Howard,no idea. ask him.
11760,Howard,good. love you.
8013,Howard,mouse boy?
6704,Howard,"no need to neuter the nerd, i can get you back online."
10721,Howard,"that was a big sticky mess, but i think i got it."
6292,Howard,worked for my parents. 
10809,Howard,right? mamma-jamma just came to me.
11161,Howard,wait. i bet it’s suicide squad. let’s check it out.
8202,Howard,didn’t you read my email?
8902,Howard,did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
8799,Howard,"fine, i’ll just make him do a couple more things, then i’ll stop."
7132,Howard,so you guys are seriously considering this?
9400,Howard,"all right. well, i’ll see you around."
10168,Howard,"well, it’s my house, it’s my rules."
10414,Howard,"you mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
7342,Howard,what was i supposed to do? she gave me that come-hither look.
10406,Howard,i love that.
7856,Howard,it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
8153,Howard,"well, i’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning."
6291,Howard,"fine, next time make your own date."
9544,Howard,mother? is that you? your little boy is coming home.
8512,Howard,"so, this spring, i get to go to the international space station."
10312,Howard,"oh, you’re saying i don’t do anything around here. look at my chore chart."
11314,Howard,i have performance anxiety. you of all people should know that.
10690,Howard,that right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
10272,Howard,"probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
11905,Howard,i know. it’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
10138,Howard,hang on. i know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
7449,Howard,really? tall?
7961,Howard,knock-knock.
11439,Howard,the guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore. 
7852,Howard,"wait. katee, why are you leaving?"
8294,Howard,"okay, well, it’s getting late. this was terrific. you win. bernie?"
7429,Howard,three dates means sex? who knew?
9303,Howard,let me see.
8783,Howard,"but in exchange, i’d like you to do a few things for me."
8001,Howard,hey.
10902,Howard,what?
10123,Howard,how you feeling?
11468,Howard,"okay, last question. the chaps he was wearing, assless?"
6598,Howard,yeah.
10873,Howard,"that’s not true at all. i wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. i’m climbing on top of her every chance i get. in a loving and respectful manner. the point is, i really do want kids."
7536,Howard,"hey, i once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
9846,Howard,where’s sheldon?
8762,Howard,jews don’t have heaven.
10218,Howard,"well, i was going to, but the day of tryouts i found my dad’s playboy collection. threw my arm out."
8914,Howard,there’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
8400,Howard,"fine. but next time, we get a sitter."
11620,Howard,i’m not gonna get fat.
9166,Howard,i have to know!
10490,Howard,nah.
7570,Howard,"yeah, i am pulling out all the stops. there’s a $39.95 lover’s special at p.f. chang’s. egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
8776,Howard,"let me try gansta, hells no."
7153,Howard,and we agreed to never speak of it again.
10998,Howard,oh. he was so excited.
8940,Howard,pretty clear.
7476,Howard,"thanks, honey.  all right, what is your deal?"
10037,Howard,you got it.
6565,Howard,that’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. 
11162,Howard,"penny just said they’re having fun. honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?"
10203,Howard,"okay, this one is for a cadbury creme egg."
11404,Howard,i’m sorry. we don’t have to go.
7983,Howard,what kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
6505,Howard,he came with a manual. 
7015,Howard,"you’re right, this filly’s been broken."
7561,Howard,good. p.f. chang’s? my mom has coupons.
10472,Howard,huh. i always thought it was mini golf.
6206,Howard,because he looked better than you?
9474,Howard,asthma attack?
11061,Howard,"poor judgement, obviously."
10235,Howard,wish me luck.
9463,Howard,hmm.
7409,Howard,"wait. wait, wait. so you’re saying we’re out of food?"
10245,Howard,"my mom got him cable. in my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. do you know how many hbos that leech had my mother get him? seven. seven hbos. seven."
9636,Howard,"hey, she got the way to move me, cherry,"
7879,Howard,thank you.
9392,Howard,he’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.
9877,Howard,nope.
11783,Howard,"i mean, why would you say that?"
8629,Howard,this is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
10316,Howard,it’s okay.
7758,Howard,"okay, i’m out."
10288,Howard,we got to watch back to the future ii.
8010,Howard,"no, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
6782,Howard,where were you?
7003,Howard,"so, there is a number."
8863,Howard,"mr. rostenkowski, are you busy?"
10411,Howard,"i know. if we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty."
7951,Howard,but you love that spot.
7980,Howard,"ah, this takes me back. leonard obsessing about penny. i mean, don’t get me wrong, i love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits."
10806,Howard,"is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my."
9689,Howard,just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing i do next.
10740,Howard,it’s hard not to. they taste so much better than real berries.
11498,Howard,do you think this is in poor taste?
9872,Howard,t-minus 60 seconds.
7542,Howard,"boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? just the guys."
10040,Howard,"because he’s raj, that’s his thing. beckham can bend it, ralph can wreck it, raj can blow it. look, i don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… oh, crap, i know that girl."
7943,Howard,and they were okay with that?
7256,Howard,"true. okay, forget the hot tub. the point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls."
8772,Howard,"something got you down there, bunky?"
6645,Howard,this madness has to stop.
9139,Howard,not yet. what are you doing?
8610,Howard,"well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
6626,Howard,"oh, gee, thanks."
7098,Howard,no. are you crazy?what am i gonna say? i screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
6531,Howard,"okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now. "
6246,Howard,i’m peter pan! and i’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
8588,Howard,"she’s just kidding, boys and girls. everyone gets cake."
9645,Howard,sorry. 
10776,Howard,"okay, calm down. there’s a theme to this weekend. we are going to mexico in feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house feynman bought with the money from his nobel prize."
11396,Howard,"okay, you’re positive you want to know?"
8968,Howard,nothing. everything’s fine.
9779,Howard,here you go.
7370,Howard,bye.
10625,Howard,"well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?"
9551,Howard,are you kidding me? how often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
10332,Howard,they’re not dating. they’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
10322,Howard,a gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
7228,Howard,really? how about that? i’ve been to the gap.
10688,Howard,"yes, of course."
7841,Howard,"i’ve missed you, katee sackhoff."
9788,Howard,"raj grew up in india. trust me, he’s seen worse."
7761,Howard,"and finally, my moo shu pork."
6709,Howard,"yes, we here to fix the cable."
7085,Howard,"she’s a hooker, isn’t she."
9373,Howard,"yes, please."
11885,Howard,told you the sensor would work. 
11613,Howard,don’t beat yourself up. that’s what i’m here for.
6496,Howard,what difference does it make?
10291,Howard,"oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
8560,Howard,i thought you didn’t like facebook anymore.
6648,Howard,"the application in your hand, give it to her."
10892,Howard,"he’s right, he knows a lot of jokes."
7519,Howard,"yes, actual women are the best."
9524,Howard,i’m really sorry.
11918,Howard,"red alert, leonard. sheldon ran away."
10982,Howard,spineless.
8519,Howard,"no, you only get one wish."
10685,Howard,"oh. all right, playtime’s over. let’s open this baby up."
9270,Howard,good story.
8649,Howard,sorry. my phone.
8106,Howard,"yeah, let’s go with that."
8568,Howard,"how about that? after all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
9460,Howard,"oh, yeah, what’s that?"
7567,Howard,happy now?
6208,Howard,"i don’t know, you guys work in the same lab."
11070,Howard,"continued on milk. if you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. are. we are. see spoons for more."
11350,Howard,"well, maybe. i don’t know. we’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
9022,Howard,"wow, so you guys are like buds now?"
6201,Howard,i am the swordmaster!
10044,Howard,"well, you sure don’t. you i know, you i know, you? total stranger. even if you had yummy candy, i would not get in your van."
7626,Howard,"okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
9863,Howard,tammy cho.
9831,Howard,"well, things would be a little different."
11193,Howard,"look, raj, you’re my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
8954,Howard,"i love you, too. sweet dreams. i’ll talk to you tomorrow?"
10920,Howard,we’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
11036,Howard,"no, i didn’t."
11272,Howard,"okay, let me stop you right there. we absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world."
8306,Howard,"ma, i’m home! where are you?"
9046,Howard,what?
7193,Howard,"i will put up my fantastic four number 48, first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123, the classic flash of two worlds issue."
6767,Howard,hey. nice sweater.
6601,Howard,what the frak?
8683,Howard,"i guess. still, it’s a shame professor rothman was forced to step down."
11302,Howard,it’s not nonsense. this is how the u.s. military works.
11476,Howard,"oh, yeah, the astronomer. raj told us about you. hey, free toilet paper."
9461,Howard,nice try. that’s the plot for goonies.
7541,Howard,your new girlfriend. have fun tonight.
6613,Howard,"poverty? your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a bentley."
7401,Howard,"up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
11944,Howard,"well, i don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, i got you."
6775,Howard,"hey, isn’t that the guy who won the macarthur genius grant last year? no, not all at once."
11565,Howard,"well, i’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on."
7080,Howard,i’m going back to the room.
6978,Howard,"okay. great. now, can i take one where it looks like we’re making out?"
8307,Howard,"so, how’d it go?"
8681,Howard,"you know, this isn’t that pressing. why don’t i talk to him about it in may."
6512,Howard,can’t you play him some other time?
11730,Howard,this one says that every time i go out. see? i listen to you.
6391,Howard,did anyone see how he did it?
10125,Howard,welcome to team putz.
9020,Howard,"it’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. we leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your howie mandels."
6560,Howard,"oh really, did you make a second date."
7986,Howard,"i did it with you when we rented the notebook.  yes, gena rowlands is a treasure. you’d better open up that bottle of wine or i’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear."
7019,Howard,"if i may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, thursday night is ladies’ night. which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one jell-o shots."
9449,Howard,"sheldon, i swear to god, i’m gonna kill you."
7497,Howard,"okay, i got a bone to pick with you."
8637,Howard,"no, that’s not what i’m talking about."
9295,Howard,"oh, so is mine."
9431,Howard,colour’s fine.
8492,Howard,"hey, we’re a team. so, what do you think?"
7218,Howard,what?
7323,Howard,okay… puppies? where do you stand on puppies?
9245,Howard,here we go. oh!
7075,Howard,"you guys go ahead, i just have to finish up an email."
9930,Howard,good news. someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
9473,Howard,money from family does come with strings attached.
10221,Howard,are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
11669,Howard,oh. how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
6679,Howard,"what do you mean, aw? like she didn’t know we were nerds?"
8158,Howard,"boy, i don’t know. you, me, ma living under the same roof?"
7580,Howard,"ooh, that’s gotta sting."
7063,Howard,"no, it was something else. why does everything have to be about sex with you? come on. who’s turn is it?"
8502,Howard,"i don’t know. if we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that i’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
9593,Howard,"yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. that’s turkey and loganberry. and don’t tell my hips, but i’m warming up a brie in the oven."
10396,Howard,"well, there’s no discernible pattern that i can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check."
9814,Howard,i don’t know. i guess i was just feeling like i’m a lousy husband.
11664,Howard,you don’t need your dad’s money. you can get by on your salary.
9096,Howard,that’s not true.
7239,Howard,"ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
7176,Howard,what are you doing here?
7311,Howard,six if you count klingon.
9213,Howard,not me. i’m having dinner with bernadette and her parents.
8673,Howard,"oh, yeah, sure."
10338,Howard,she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
6689,Howard,giselle’s hanging by a thread.
7010,Howard,i’ll run lines with you in the car.
11923,Howard,"hey, raj, guess what. professor laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
8105,Howard,"no! no, i’m saying exactly the opposite."
10886,Howard,hubba bubba over dubble bubble? you’re crazy.
7921,Howard,"hey, i’ve got a girlfriend now."
8253,Howard,"yeah. no one can hide from me, not waldo, not carmen san diego, not even topless natalie portman."
9719,Howard,"hello, everyone."
6237,Howard,"i shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. "
10258,Howard,"mm. so, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity."
10136,Howard,i don’t know what else we can do.
8087,Howard,"we can watch it later on c-span. besides, i was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel."
10908,Howard,"so now anyone can control your phone? hey, siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
6416,Howard,so?
9712,Howard,doing what?
7714,Howard,"yeah, right. dr. plimpton?"
6165,Howard,"hang on, there really is a lady here?"
11738,Howard,you can just feel the time being saved.
11667,Howard,"we are, that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless."
8405,Howard,"well, don’t think of it that way. once we move in, it’ll be our house."
11536,Howard,ah. it sucks that she’s not here.
10745,Howard,i’m on it.
8034,Howard,we’re starting now!
7936,Howard,good news. i made it onto the team for the new defence department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
9599,Howard,"hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
10376,Howard,"i just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. although, there are ways to improve our communication. one thing i learned when i was in couples therapy was…"
8531,Howard,that’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
8950,Howard,"okay, okay."
10073,Howard,"that’s actually not a bad plan. i can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time i was like, oh my god, a prune pit."
8351,Howard,"hey, what’s up?"
9149,Howard,"when i was starting to do magic in junior high, i thought i could be an escape artist like harry houdini."
10014,Howard,i’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
7660,Howard,would that be a giant rat’s ass?
7448,Howard,"i know, but she’s not you."
10652,Howard,no. he is. so i have a dominant personality. we all know that.
9733,Howard,"whoa, where is that coming from?"
7378,Howard,i didn’t know you were upset about that.
9565,Howard,"look, bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with amy, i’ll go with you."
11295,Howard,i’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
6467,Howard,hallelujah. 
11059,Howard,"nice. a classic rabbit name. peter rabbit, roger rabbit. valentino wolowitz rabbit. oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. of course you’re a wolowitz. son of a bitch, he bit me."
7372,Howard,"yeah, i don’t think i need my preshow urination anymore."
7695,Howard,"well, that’s it. we’re officially out of things to talk about."
7811,Howard,toilet.
11195,Howard,the three of us aren’t having this baby. just the two of us.
10383,Howard,"see, i am. isn’t this great?"
8333,Howard,can i see her?
9709,Howard,"if i didn’t have you life would be dreary, i’d be string theory without any string. i’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. i’d be firefly, buffy and avengers without joss whedon. i’d speak a lot more klingon, heghlu’meh qaq jajvam. "
9221,Howard,death by chicken. that’s a pretty fowl way to go.
10748,Howard,we’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
8003,Howard,whoa. where did that come from?
9564,Howard,"oh, will you stop it. now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie."
9528,Howard,isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?
6937,Howard,when did that happen?
11967,Howard,dr. schneider?
6338,Howard,then call your own mother.  it was sheldon.
8527,Howard,"well, i, i’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?"
10615,Howard,"no, i’m not. settle this. those little animated pictures on the internet, are they called gifs or jifs?"
6511,Howard,"come on, afterwards there’s a q & a with harrison ford’s body double. "
7539,Howard,let me show you another way to look at this. here we have the universe of all women. these are the ones you want to sleep with. these are the women who believe exactly what you believe. these are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. and right there in the
11651,Howard,told ya. can you fix it for us?
6892,Howard,"yeah, still funny, raj."
8869,Howard,"nice story. anyway, the reason i wanted to talk to you is nasa has moved up my launch to the international space station."
7300,Howard,"yeah, raj, that’s how it works."
10628,Howard,"no, i got it."
8205,Howard,"oh, please. that crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
9904,Howard,"fun fact, i’m gonna jump off this train."
9484,Howard,"you know what’s going on, don’t you?"
6832,Howard,i don’t know.
6489,Howard,it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. 
10986,Howard,hang on. should i send him away?
7273,Howard,"gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. how about i meet you halfway?"
7088,Howard,"they’re on me today, boys."
6871,Howard,"well, there you go. problem solved."
9349,Howard,hey. how’d it go last night with my mom?
8740,Howard,yeah. sure. how are things going?
10012,Howard,"that was an hour ago, sheldon. a jew sits in front of a house in texas that long, for sale signs start to go up. i take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom."
10390,Howard,"oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. i dated it all through sixth grade."
10286,Howard,there’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
11606,Howard,schmuck. got it.
7227,Howard,"does it? okay, if you like space stuff, i design components for the international space station. which is in space. where, as i’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
9116,Howard,"oh, i’m fine. it’s just her i’m worried about."
9610,Howard,why?
8433,Howard,"i say, hey ma, what’s for dinner?”"
8856,Howard,a week from friday.
9210,Howard,"i’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet."
7304,Howard,"come on, i’m smart, i have good job and i have only three percent body fat."
11687,Howard,what? why? 
9855,Howard,"yeah, he’s nice because he likes you."
9054,Howard,clever.
7066,Howard,"i don’t know. she just said howard, momma’s a rolling stone. and then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
8616,Howard,really?
6936,Howard,what about it?
8214,Howard,"remind me, what’s your birthday?"
9903,Howard,i don’t own a pocket watch.
10718,Howard,she doesn’t baby me.
7353,Howard,"yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. does a patang?"
7326,Howard,not as crazy as my mother makes me.
7991,Howard,well i’d like to propose a toast. to science and friendship.
10097,Howard,"well, you didn’t miss anything. we just started over."
9048,Howard,what was i supposed to talk about? we were eating at johnny rockets.
9991,Howard,it’s over.
8551,Howard,you interested in amy?
11993,Howard,"i thought you were great, but, oh, my god, you were so dominated by your parents."
9705,Howard,"oh, don’t worry about it. i brought the date here. guys, come on in."
7140,Howard,"ma, i’m putting you on speakerphone with raj’s parents. can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the arctic?"
11293,Howard,"thanks. hey, i just got an e-mail from the u.s. air force."
9805,Howard,"no, you’re being a better husband than i am. doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
9971,Howard,that’s sheldon. he says he’ll be down in a minute.
9536,Howard,what do you do?
10421,Howard,"okay, well, what’s your plan?"
10761,Howard,250 dollars an hour. why?
10439,Howard,"oh, no. i killed it. oh, not again."
9126,Howard,"i’m looking at his public calendar. two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. he never has anything booked during that time."
8848,Howard,let me explain the difference between you and me. you watch star trek. i live it.
6608,Howard,creepy good or creepy bad?
11696,Howard,"i know, i wish there was some way we could help him."
8064,Howard,what’s that? some weird sex thing?
6387,Howard,"uh-uh. i know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. and if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
10619,Howard,"great, it’s all done. the lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. i didn’t have to meet him, i didn’t have to talk to him, i don’t even know where he is."
9995,Howard,we can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. we should bring something.
7529,Howard,what do you think? want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
7363,Howard,"my pleasure. maybe after lunch, we can go to marie callender’s and have some pie."
6680,Howard,look at those women.
11248,Howard,you sure?
10907,Howard,no. how does it work?
6691,Howard,just put it back before he comes!
9806,Howard,i don’t want coffee.
6392,Howard,he’s back.
9410,Howard,what exactly are you looking up?
8379,Howard,"pretty sweet, huh? this little baby set the university back 175 grand."
11104,Howard,"thank god, ’cause i was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. but i’m also really excited. i mean it."
9342,Howard,"anyway, it was bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
7715,Howard,"uh, yeah."
6360,Howard,"hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your head back.  "
6812,Howard,"i don’t go to school, ma. i work at a university."
7421,Howard,sure.
10571,Howard,i’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. we’re gonna eat it.
11425,Howard,you jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
9780,Howard,"i never had a beer with my dad, either."
11717,Howard,"i just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. unless leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
9320,Howard,"eh, what can you do?"
8532,Howard,"please, we’re eating. can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
10131,Howard,"you know, if you’re really serious about that, i hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
10120,Howard,"a mocha? well, it must be nice to be queen."
6759,Howard,stephanie barnett is in a relationship with leonard hofstadter.”
7206,Howard,"no, you don’t understand. we just want to ask you a question."
9278,Howard,i don’t know.
9237,Howard,really?
11972,Howard,"hello, amy. nice to see you. what can i say? it’s funnier with the accent."
11916,Howard,"leslie winkle. you’ve reached friends with benefits. for a booty call, press one now."
9583,Howard,"really? tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying."
11961,Howard,hi.
9264,Howard,"i walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”"
9377,Howard,"she hid my xbox like i’m a child. yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, i’m telling."
9203,Howard,what are you doing in there?
6863,Howard,he has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. kind of like a puppy.
6882,Howard,"you know the rules. you brought your mom to work, you must suffer."
9885,Howard,"sheldon, just come with us. you’re not gonna make your own convention."
10781,Howard,i think it’s a tyre.
7802,Howard,really? you’re changing the sheldonian calendar?
10849,Howard,"i love you, amy. "
8240,Howard,want me to tell you how to do it?
11540,Howard,"come on, bernie, breathe. remember what you learned in birthing class."
8948,Howard,it’s not definite. i’ll talk to bernadette.
7025,Howard,"tell me about it. look, a new batman belt buckle."
6340,Howard,"stand by. ma, can my friends come over?"
7935,Howard,"thankyou, and i’m sorry about your phone. and thanksgiving. and while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of july."
7755,Howard,"okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later."
7298,Howard,"so you’ve been with penny for like a month and a half now. where’s my shorty, morty?"
11715,Howard,i don’t know. why are you asking all these questions?
11255,Howard,"oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. and, and, and, and, and here we are."
7824,Howard,trust me.
6329,Howard,i don’t know.
10593,Howard,"come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what i paid for it."
6273,Howard,when they perfect human cloning i’m going to order twelve of those.
7212,Howard,really?
10838,Howard,"oh, boy."
6606,Howard,i’ll take the bullet.
7861,Howard,why?
7937,Howard,"thanks. listen, i have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the fbi."
8789,Howard,"here is a black light to check them. and for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
10377,Howard,not important.
6590,Howard,you’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
10764,Howard,why are marine biologists always so cute?
7307,Howard,and tall. i want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
7795,Howard,can you please just help me?
9791,Howard,then you left me no choice.
9406,Howard,"van nuys pole-dancer d.d. melons. all right, i think we’ve really helped women today. let’s fire up the old xbox."
8224,Howard,fine. get another deck and i’ll do the trick with that.
11253,Howard,oh. cool.
11252,Howard,hey. where is everybody?
9150,Howard,"pretty good. i managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. there. ready?"
11102,Howard,i’m really glad you’re here. can we talk?
11642,Howard,open a window. it’s about to get smug in here.
9653,Howard,i’m sharing my pain.
6226,Howard,what do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
7094,Howard,"guys, we have a code red."
7081,Howard,"hi there, howard wolowitz."
6634,Howard,"oh goody, more tales from the panhandle."
10089,Howard,i think he’s taking this professor proton thing pretty hard.
9513,Howard,"no, i wasn’t. you were."
7620,Howard,it’s sad how great that sounds.
8716,Howard,turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
6938,Howard,"well, hold on. are you saying if i don’t go to the wedding, i can’t go to geneva?"
11794,Howard,probably. we should go.
11012,Howard,no.
7613,Howard,"no, i can’t tell you who it is. stop asking."
7808,Howard,i say we just take him to tatooine and sell him to some jawas.
8337,Howard,"hey, how’d it go?"
10169,Howard,don’t talk to her like that. that is my mother. wife. my wife. i said my wife.
10731,Howard,i didn’t touch it. must have been stuart.
9252,Howard,"really? your wife makes you do stuff? you’re a big, scary cop."
8171,Howard,tea does sound nice.
6572,Howard,do you want to switch?
6783,Howard,"ooh, “dave.” sounds like leonard’s got a new bff."
9980,Howard,"well, it still doesn’t."
8805,Howard,"all right, sheldon, there’s only one thing left i want you to do. don’t worry, it’s an easy one."
6235,Howard,that was absolutely humiliating.
8293,Howard,nice to see that the gals are getting along.
7499,Howard,"we were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that i have a problem with her hanging out with you."
10144,Howard,what’s wrong with your car?
11980,Howard,"i’m not a baby. i’m a grown man, and i made the bed. now where’s my star?"
10043,Howard,"uh, no. i, i don’t, i don’t think so."
7728,Howard,"if it’s not too much trouble, i’d like to point this at the moon now."
9299,Howard,we’re not with him.
8533,Howard,oy. bernadette keeps texting me pictures of penny in bridesmaid dresses.
9825,Howard,she nailed it.
11016,Howard,sheldon cooper apologized to me
11591,Howard,sometimes people say things they don’t mean.
9929,Howard,thank you.
9787,Howard,i am cleaning up. look at the mess the joker made of gotham city.
7821,Howard,"oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. you just don’t hear it."
10801,Howard,"well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing."
11026,Howard,you’re a screenwriter?
11135,Howard,"honey, this is fine."
11445,Howard,"see? easy. and look at all this cargo space. now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. i’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
7839,Howard,"oh, not since we broke up. wow. how am i going to play this? sophisticated and relaxed? friendly, noncommittal? cold and distant? ."
11313,Howard,"hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay."
6905,Howard,war is hell.
21710,Howard,i don’t have playdates! i have colleagues!
9862,Howard,"marci grossman, lisa mazzarino."
11408,Howard,you know what’s weird? how turned on you are right now.
11005,Howard,i don’t know.
9053,Howard,"yeah, sure, whatever."
9635,Howard,let’s go.
6168,Howard,"enchante madamoiselle. howard wolowitz, cal-tech department of applied physics. you may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
9935,Howard,i think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
7310,Howard,"good, good."
7087,Howard,thank you!
6987,Howard,why not eliminate the middle man? we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom.
9296,Howard,car.
9609,Howard,hallelujah.
9594,Howard,"okay, well, i’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, i need you to be honest with me. do my boobs look bigger to you?"
10412,Howard,how the hell did a pigeon get in here?
11594,Howard,"sheldon, i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader. they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test."
7685,Howard,let’s go.
6365,Howard,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
6381,Howard,"no, i just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. "
6785,Howard,yep. it’s officially a bro-mance.
7365,Howard,no. this is our day.
7956,Howard,"uh-huh. i’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
7632,Howard,will you be quiet?
6821,Howard,people move away from her on the bus. what do you want?
9374,Howard,sorry we’re late.
7148,Howard,"dammit, i should have gone over and told her we were back."
8461,Howard,"yeah, but i’m a make out king. "
9981,Howard,fine.
7002,Howard,"all right, penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today."
8964,Howard,"all right, all right. i gotta go. there’s a meteor shower."
7073,Howard,"black case, top compartment."
8912,Howard,"so, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony."
8511,Howard,"right, right."
7301,Howard,"so, have you talked to penny yet?"
10070,Howard,"good idea. we can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to cinnamon, and then my mom can eat cinnamon. so what do you feel like doing?"
9427,Howard,you know what we should do? we should show the closet to sheldon.
10371,Howard,how can i convince you it won’t?
10818,Howard,really? remember when you were gonna get circumcised for rachel bernstein?
9774,Howard,sounds like zack’s the victim. you’re sleeping with his wife.
11727,Howard,"huh, so you can tell what that feels like. interesting."
9350,Howard,what time did you leave?
9365,Howard,"bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. and i’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because i’ve been busting my tail playing assassin’s creed."
6739,Howard,"no one cares, ma! so, what’s up?"
8602,Howard,"i don’t know, hunting?"
6423,Howard,yes.
7009,Howard,"yeah, what’s the occasion?"
8271,Howard,"this one’s funny, leonard. how come you couldn’t make it work with her?"
11049,Howard,how?
8081,Howard,"well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, i’d say about a million dollars a pop."
9975,Howard,"hey, buddy."
11259,Howard,where’s claire?
8905,Howard,"uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?"
7060,Howard,were you in the original trilogy?
6944,Howard,what’s the plan?
7092,Howard,"hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?"
10058,Howard,"can i say just one more thing? i had some kind of food poisoning that day. sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. nor was climbing out your window and running away. but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and i’d really appreciate it if we could move on."
9158,Howard,forty-three. what is forty-three? besides my mom’s neck size.
10194,Howard,making a straw.
6838,Howard,"i’m not sure yet. you know, george clooney has one now!"
10009,Howard,good luck.
6817,Howard,who?
7753,Howard,"and that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”"
10790,Howard,"no, it’s too broad of a beam. you’d need something more precise, like superman’s heat vision."
8747,Howard,"yes, to other gay people."
8252,Howard,"good news, gentlemen, i found our hacker."
11144,Howard,"yeah. but, um, we were talking, and i’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership."
10884,Howard,no problem.
10410,Howard,we should get going to amy’s.
7260,Howard,celebrating columbus day.
6534,Howard,"don’t toy with me, woman. "
8770,Howard,i showed him some card tricks.
8530,Howard,"what would you like to talk about, sheldon? why do you hate us?"
