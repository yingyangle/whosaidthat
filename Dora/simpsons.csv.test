49297,Lisa,all the bees are dead!
49301,Lisa,no bees means no honey...
49307,Lisa,please let me keep them for just a little longer.
49318,Lisa,you don't?
49321,Lisa,"mr. burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren't strong enough to survive on their own."
49323,Lisa,give me the keys!
49324,Lisa,"wow, this must be important, dad! i've never seen you walk up an incline before."
49325,Lisa,my bees?
49354,Lisa,"mom, i'm meeting juliet after school!"

49361,Lisa,"juliet, you're scaring me just a little--"
49363,Lisa,"mom, please don't do that."
49375,Lisa,yeah.
49376,Lisa,"so the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised."
49413,Lisa,i waaarned you.
49415,Lisa,what did i get wrong?
49424,Lisa,huh?
49428,Lisa,this is so hard because i always thought mom was the strong one.
49431,Lisa,"hey, dad."
49434,Lisa,"dad, we've been trapped in the house for days. can't we play outside?"
49438,Lisa,"okay, people, we've hit penumbra. brace yourself for umbra."
49444,Lisa,"dad, leave -- so i can get into character."
49458,Lisa,heart and soul...
49462,Lisa,big ring... big ring...
49467,Lisa,"oh. well, i seek it so i can find my sister. how do you know about the gem?"
49469,Lisa,does your mother know you're using her minivan?
49478,Lisa,"no, that's not it! a secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
49479,Lisa,"so, the anagram spells: ""regally, the rock gem is..."""
49483,Lisa,look who's here!
49486,Lisa,"no, no, no -- the solution was ""regally the rock gem is lisa""."
49487,Lisa,um... this one?
49490,Lisa,mom! how did you know maggie was here?
49493,Lisa,well that sucked! / there's a day we'll never get back! / i was so bored.
49513,Lisa,sideshow bob! drop that knife and give back our dad!
49516,Lisa,we know it was you selma bouvier.
49521,Lisa,"math, done. pine cone, collected. permission slip, signed. now time for a break -- a little social studies."
49527,Lisa,"and in the new nineveh , darkness falls."
49528,Lisa,what's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
49535,Lisa,"wow, the truth in boardwalking law has really done a number on this place."
49537,Lisa,"yeah, sure. it's complimentary."
49542,Lisa,pecan blandies... cream of steam... you guess 'ems...
49547,Lisa,"dad, if i join a clique, i'll be the kind of person i hate."
49548,Lisa,"hmm, well, they are good ones."
49555,Lisa,"no, there's a middle ground."
49559,Lisa,"i just wish i could go to a school like that -- even for one week. ""tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all."""
49561,Lisa,look at this place. it's everything i've ever dreamed of: on-campus stables!
49569,Lisa,"but i always get a's. at my old school, i got so many a's, the teachers didn't even check my work."
49575,Lisa,did you just wink at me?
49583,Lisa,you have a show?
49585,Lisa,that's amazing.
49589,Lisa,mom! dad! i have to leave waverly hills and never come back!
49591,Lisa,"mom, i'm glad you brought me here, but isn't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful?"
49594,Lisa,"excuse me, but snow white is a fairytale from hundreds of years ago. no one owns that."
49597,Lisa,...greedy!
49610,Lisa,i dunno -- chasing ducks? buried alive? he'll be missed. let's move. i've gotta collect pine cones.
49611,Lisa,"just follow the ""dies,"" mom."
49618,Lisa,yeah?
49619,Lisa,you're on.
49620,Lisa,"congratulations, hubert. or should i congratulate your tutor: amelia, at the homework factory! your victory is tainted! asterisk! asterisk!"
49625,Lisa,"interesting. with no obvious motive, no one would suspect us."
49629,Lisa,"bart, have you established your alibi?"
49630,Lisa,and people will remember you were there?
49632,Lisa,you should've seen the look on krabappel's face!
49633,Lisa,you killed her?
49636,Lisa,"yeah, ding-dong-ditch!"
49639,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be sick.
49641,Lisa,"sorry bart, i couldn't do it! there's got to be another way."
49644,Lisa,"all right, bart... i guess i have no choice. i have to kill... you!"
49650,Lisa,"oh my god. if bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
49655,Lisa,and all we had to do was let bart take a bath in our food.
49659,Lisa,"so, i'll hide and you guys count to a hundred."
49664,Lisa,my name's lisa and i was playing hide and seek when i met you ladies. please don't hurt me.
49665,Lisa,"uh-huh, what's an esbat?"
49668,Lisa,"sure they do. if magic was real, i'd use it to get out of my pipe cleaner art project that's due tomorrow."
49669,Lisa,dad! over here!
49671,Lisa,what happened to miss hoover?
49675,Lisa,what else ya got?
49685,Lisa,don't dip those wiccans!
49693,Lisa,global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
49694,Lisa,"really? really? uh-huh, all right."
49695,Lisa,"when maggie's nightlight goes out, her onesie becomes a funsie. this announcer has never seen diapers so dapper!"
49696,Lisa,what do you want?
49709,Lisa,"hello, bart."
49720,Lisa,...clark gable owes me a book. and he never paid me for the shoeshine. but his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. lunch butter we called it.
49739,Lisa,what about bart?
49744,Lisa,don't forget the unicorn!
49748,Lisa,"whether she's competing in equestrian events at the 1976 olympics or spending her summers at holyrood palace, princess anne is truly a world leader."
49751,Lisa,maybe i should go out and get you guys a converter.
49758,Lisa,you use the wand like a tennis racket to hit an invisible ball.
49760,Lisa,why would you put it in the dishwasher?
49761,Lisa,you ruined it on purpose. you want the old folks to be zombies -- because it makes your jobs easier!
49771,Lisa,oh my god! dad threw too hard!
49773,Lisa,"sorry, but i was planning to stop by the olympic pin center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. y'know, just to get me through the day."
49777,Lisa,"my pearls? these were a gift from my mom, when i could first read at a twelfth grade level."
49779,Lisa,i saw you grooving to the beat! you gotta pay for that!
49780,Lisa,nothing's going on. just sharing my music with the good people of vancouver.
41590,Lisa,"yeah, even though mcdonald's owns yale now, it's still a great school. and i could never afford to go there if i hadn't won the montgomery burns scholarship."
41594,Lisa,uh...
49786,Lisa,"ooh, family trees -- the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure!"
41597,Lisa,"look, my point is, show jenda you want to be successful and she might take you back. it's never too late for love."
49789,Lisa,they're all horrible!
49791,Lisa,"i won't give up. i have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the pittsburgh poisoners, this family had a noble spark. and i will find it, even if i have to go back to adam and eve."
41603,Lisa,well... okay. i guess this is my destiny.
41608,Lisa,losers? you mean losers like...
49803,Lisa,i can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
41615,Lisa,i'll get those no good indians. just as sure as my favorite book is...
41621,Lisa,we were just playing.
41625,Lisa,might as well. you're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.
41630,Lisa,"only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead!"
49823,Lisa,so they did the right thing -- my quest is fulfilled! our family has heroes!
49824,Lisa,our family has heroes!
49826,Lisa,"no, no, no, not now! quit! quit! no, don't quit the program, just the update, ya stupid--"
41640,Lisa,"i'm dizzy! i'm nauseous! oh, but i'm popular!"
49836,Lisa,what are you talking about? is there something you know about virgil that you haven't told us?
41651,Lisa,...and a mouth-watering veal chop.
41652,Lisa,"oh, no. now i'm dad."
41654,Lisa,whuh?
49847,Lisa,"fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. for example: one half plus one third equals..."
49848,Lisa,you'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
49850,Lisa,"thanks, dad. but you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
41662,Lisa,"okay, i can talk my way out of this."
41667,Lisa,question two: using what you learned in question one...
41674,Lisa,those girls are snotty and shallow. tell them off!
49868,Lisa,"flotus1 is ""first lady of the united states... one!"""
41678,Lisa,"wow, i made mom cry. what unimaginable power! i can use this to get anything i want. but right now, all i want is for mom to stop crying."
49871,Lisa,mr. flanders invited us to israel. i think he wants to get dad into heaven.
41689,Lisa,mr. bergstrom! mr. bergstrom!
41690,Lisa,do you know where i could find him?
49881,Lisa,"nothing! look, do you want to do it or not?"
41694,Lisa,"hey, lisa, indeed."
41696,Lisa,you can't go! you're the best teacher i'll ever have.
41697,Lisa,"oh, please."
49890,Lisa,there's only one ant left!
49895,Lisa,"bart, she's only carrying thirty times her weight. our girl is slowing down."
49896,Lisa,"it's the natural order of things. i'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
41707,Lisa,"yes, you! baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
41710,Lisa,"look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
41711,Lisa,yeah.
49903,Lisa,"dad, you are leading the way in clean energy."
49904,Lisa,"dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
41723,Lisa,sprinkles and syrup.
41724,Lisa,it's no use kidding myself. i'm having an ethical crisis.
49917,Lisa,"hurry, dad, hurry!"
49918,Lisa,but i don't know how to drive.
41728,Lisa,you grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
41729,Lisa,how's your marriage?
49928,Lisa,bluella?
41737,Lisa,too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
49929,Lisa,oh no.
49931,Lisa,maybe i should just be alone a little bit.
41742,Lisa,"ah ha, now you look pathetic."
49937,Lisa,"run! i mean, swim! i mean ."
41746,Lisa,i'm trying to teach maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. i want her to have all the advantages that i didn't have.
49941,Lisa,"they're right. if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, i can't let you do it."
49942,Lisa,dad! the sharks must think you're a baby whale!
41752,Lisa,"ooh, look, maggie, what is that? do-dec-ah-edron. dodecahedron."
49946,Lisa,hey!
41756,Lisa,"no, maggie. not az-tec. ol-mec. ol-mec."
41757,Lisa,perhaps there is no moral to this story.
41762,Lisa,"bart, i do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. i've made things for you. but you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
49954,Lisa,"first of all, my father no longer has any functioning credit cards. secondly, how dare you refer--"
49963,Lisa,that's a rather unambitious book.
41772,Lisa,"huh... wha-- bart, it's six a.m."
49968,Lisa,"oh, i can't go on! this rebuttal is a sham!"
49969,Lisa,you aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you're being convinced by the color of my hair!
49970,Lisa,"well guess what, i am not a brunette! i'm a blonde!"
41780,Lisa,"what would ben franklin say if he were alive today? he'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
49972,Lisa,and not all old people are bad drivers!
41783,Lisa,"yes, mom."
41787,Lisa,"thanks for driving me to the contest, dad."
41788,Lisa,"when america was born on that hot july day in 1776, the trees in springfield forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. and as they were nourished by mother earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. thank you."
49981,Lisa,he's got koi!
41790,Lisa,bart! there's no such thing as first bedsies. you just made that up.
41791,Lisa,iiiiiii waaaaaannt... that one.
41792,Lisa,why? what's wrong with it?
41793,Lisa,"no, really, what?"
49986,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, would you like to buy some band candy?"
49987,Lisa,that doesn't work on me.
41796,Lisa,have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability?
41800,Lisa,only two. i checked.
49992,Lisa,"mr. cowell, would you like some band candy?"
41806,Lisa,how could i read my essay now? i don't believe my own words.
50000,Lisa,"oh i get it. they go to oslo, we get some ice cream."
50004,Lisa,huh?
41815,Lisa,"""the city of washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. it stank then, and it stinks now. only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air."""
50008,Lisa,"sing what you just said, then play a little guitar riff."
41820,Lisa,the flanders are having a beef-a-thon! incredible ned-ibles! maude-acious vittles!.
41821,Lisa,"dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?"
41829,Lisa,hey!!
41831,Lisa,"hey, stop that."
41832,Lisa,not any more. you punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. this is my brother... and he knows karate.
41834,Lisa,it's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
41839,Lisa,"bart, is your boss a crook?"
41847,Lisa,how zen.
50040,Lisa,"thanks, guys!"
50046,Lisa,got it!
41855,Lisa,"no, dad, that's hebrew. krusty must be jewish."
41857,Lisa,"poor krusty, he's like a black velvet painting come to life."
41858,Lisa,come on...
41860,Lisa,that is so sad.
41868,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
41869,Lisa,"bart, we've been going about this all wrong. what's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
50060,Lisa,he is. he's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
41872,Lisa,this looks good bart. take it to him.
41886,Lisa,"oh, no! maggie made a wish!"
50079,Lisa,"well, that depends."
50086,Lisa,it's me!
50087,Lisa,"what, you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team?"
41901,Lisa,"no. dad, i broke my last saxophone reed, and i need you to get me a new one."
41905,Lisa,i'm done.
41906,Lisa,"i'm sorry dad, i don't feel much like eating."
50101,Lisa,huh?
50103,Lisa,everyone shift towards right!
50105,Lisa,"bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. don't swing at anything!"
50106,Lisa,hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
41915,Lisa,you're so beautiful.
50109,Lisa,you disobeyed your manager!
41924,Lisa,i'll never forget you.
50116,Lisa,"well, you're not!"
50118,Lisa,i need you! ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced.
50120,Lisa,bart!
41931,Lisa,everything.
50123,Lisa,"okay, okay, he's stolen third. but surely that's the limit of his cockiness..."
50125,Lisa,"stealing home. it's so impossible. it's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
50126,Lisa,"it's the most exciting play in baseball! go, bart!"
50128,Lisa,"maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
50130,Lisa,awww...
41943,Lisa,"well, it's a country in europe --"
50145,Lisa,"dad, i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""baby must-have."""
41954,Lisa,"dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her ariel?"
50147,Lisa,"someday when i'm a grownup, maybe i'll go back and look fondly at our house."
50149,Lisa,"mom, these grades are amazing! just as good as mine!"
41958,Lisa,that is so sad.
50150,Lisa,principal skinner? quick question. is it true my mom was a great student?
41960,Lisa,"dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
41962,Lisa,"i dreamed i was married to corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and corey was always walking around with his shirt off."
50159,Lisa,"okay, i've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... oh my god!"
50162,Lisa,"mom, is something wrong?"
41973,Lisa,"i don't know, the dolphins."
41976,Lisa,why isn't dad ever interested in anything i do?
50170,Lisa,willie!
50171,Lisa,do you have to wax this floor now?
41985,Lisa,what could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
50177,Lisa,"mom, please don't."
41987,Lisa,so gambling makes a good thing even better.
41989,Lisa,"boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
50181,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i don't really play."
50183,Lisa,"well, i am so happy to be in your class."
41993,Lisa,can i watch football with you again next sunday?
41995,Lisa,he'll lose.
50193,Lisa,mr. burns? where's he going?
50199,Lisa,"people of springfield, as a nerd, i understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
42008,Lisa,"moe, this is l.s. calling for h.s."
50200,Lisa,what did you do with him?
50203,Lisa,"all right. mr. burns, i'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel."
50204,Lisa,not today.
42013,Lisa,so that's it. you just wanted me to help you gamble. you never wanted to be with me at all.
42014,Lisa,my third husband bought me this.
50205,Lisa,"i thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
42016,Lisa,"don't tell me what to do, sonny. i've been gambling since i was eight. and i've been hockin' jewelry since i was twelve. now give me some chips!"
42017,Lisa,"look around you, malibu stacey. all this was bought with dirty money. your penthouse, your alfa romeo, your collagen injection clinic."
50206,Lisa,"actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. but you're a better person than he ever was."
50208,Lisa,"hey, there's a number on him. what is it?"
50211,Lisa,like those chairs in the music room?
42021,Lisa,"yeah, i did."
42024,Lisa,"look dad, i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to. but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
50220,Lisa,no! no! no! get off! get off! get off!
50221,Lisa,"mom, it's just maggie."
42035,Lisa,thanks mom.
42037,Lisa,"mom, bart's making faces at me."
42038,Lisa,"mom, he's doing it again. bart, quit it! quit it! hey quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! mommmmm!!"
50231,Lisa,"marking a crime scene. to celebrate a ancient pagan ritual, this tree was cut down and tarted up like a dime-a-dance floozy."
42045,Lisa,"ah, bart! that's a black-head gun!"
42046,Lisa,dad!
42053,Lisa,is it terri?
42056,Lisa,how's the dog supposed to get in?
42062,Lisa,"""and any time i hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... edna!"""
42068,Lisa,"mom, they're professional athletes. they're used to this sort of thing. it rolls right off their backs."
50263,Lisa,happy new year!
50264,Lisa,why are you hung over? i didn't see you drink last night.
42073,Lisa,a homemaker! i might as well be dead!
50272,Lisa,i'm busy.
42084,Lisa,"janey, i'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet."
50282,Lisa,huh. let's see what cousin jessica's up to.
50285,Lisa,"well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering."
50286,Lisa,no. it's oddly dehumanizing.
50287,Lisa,the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
50292,Lisa,"many great directors, like wes anderson, frank tashlin, and tim burton started with short films."
50293,Lisa,taylor hackford.
50294,Lisa,"the creative team from mixar! pardon me. i've seen all of your movies except ""cars,"" and i can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital rembrandts of my generation!"
50296,Lisa,"good luck, mr. park. there'd be no shame in losing to you."
42109,Lisa,have you found a picture yet?
50312,Lisa,"all right, bart. what are you up to now?"
42123,Lisa,"come on, bart. if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
50315,Lisa,i'm sorry i was so stubborn. i hope you're not mad.
50316,Lisa,"oh, i ain't mad, and i never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful, wonderful..."
50319,Lisa,look!
42133,Lisa,"dad, what if i told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
50325,Lisa,"easter grass, cable ace awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten jiffy pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys..."
50326,Lisa,this is so sad. can we help her?
50328,Lisa,"so, how was your first day of school?"
42137,Lisa,no. it's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. let's get you on the scale.
50329,Lisa,"grampa, you're not dead."
50332,Lisa,you're out of tonic.
50333,Lisa,really? can i see it?
42144,Lisa,i stand corrected.
50337,Lisa,"ooh, authentic american folk music, just like they play on n.p.r.!"
42146,Lisa,dad? dad?
42147,Lisa,unky herb!
50344,Lisa,"i've been-- hey, how ya doin'?"
50347,Lisa,sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.
42159,Lisa,how could this have happened? i feel so dirty. uh.. uh...uh. the dirt's not coming off. okay. calm down. this must just be a little typo.
50353,Lisa,i'm not exactly flattered by that.
50356,Lisa,from the great raymondo.
42167,Lisa,"if the pets die, don't replace them. i'll know!"
50360,Lisa,"oh, what's wrong?"
42170,Lisa,you're serving us gruel?
42174,Lisa,our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
42176,Lisa,bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that krusty the clown will come through.
42179,Lisa,"and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. so i close by saying, save us! save us now! bart and lisa."
42180,Lisa,he's really having trouble keeping his balance.
50371,Lisa,"oh, it's a lot less dangerous than you think. you can see me do it again in a talent show next week."
42183,Lisa,crandall!
50375,Lisa,"from inside, you just push up. easy peasy. and there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done."
42187,Lisa,yuh huh.
50380,Lisa,i'll get him out!
50384,Lisa,ricky jay? david copperfield? penn? teller?!?!
50385,Lisa,but why?
42194,Lisa,i think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness.
50388,Lisa,"we used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now it's time for our reward."
42198,Lisa,give it a little more gas.
50391,Lisa,my lick.
42201,Lisa,nothing.
42202,Lisa,"dad, can i ask you a question?"
50395,Lisa,a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. it's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
42204,Lisa,truly this was an act of god.
50396,Lisa,"bart, you can find them by smell! that's amazing! restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
42208,Lisa,i'm an ugmo.
50405,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart! take the last truffle... do whatever you want. sell it, eat it..."
42217,Lisa,but that ride meant everything to him!
50419,Lisa,hmm...
42232,Lisa,one! two! three! four!
42234,Lisa,"as little miss springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to america, the land of opportunity."
42236,Lisa,hi fellas.
50428,Lisa,"milhouse, i... i..."
42238,Lisa,i don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company!
42240,Lisa,i'm tired of being a corporate shill.
42245,Lisa,uh-huh.
42246,Lisa,it's a deal.
42249,Lisa,"bart, please. don't you remember that snowball i died four years ago tonight? run over by the mayor's beer swilling brother, clovis."
50444,Lisa,"ooh, a pull-down map of..."
50445,Lisa,nothing? and this ruler is unmarked and... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect...and this tooth has no dentin! everything is fake! what is going on?!
42254,Lisa,uh huh.
42258,Lisa,what are we going to have?
42260,Lisa,ew!
42261,Lisa,bart!
42262,Lisa,"bart, come quick! there's an itchy and scratchy movie!!!"
42263,Lisa,we got beets!
42264,Lisa,"dad, i agree that bart should be punished, but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
42265,Lisa,it wasn't that great.
50458,Lisa,"jeez, they're dropping like flies."
50459,Lisa,the children are on bus 23.
42268,Lisa,"dad, you've got to let bart see that movie. i've never seen him like this. he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine."
50461,Lisa,you know anything about... bus twenty-three?
42272,Lisa,"well, you voted for him... twice!"
42274,Lisa,they discovered radium. then they both died of radiation poisoning.
50467,Lisa,"no, i mean they're mannequins!"
42277,Lisa,"bart, that's not funny."
50472,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. luckily, as equipment manager, i... was not... invited! woo-hoo!"
50475,Lisa,i like routine. i like routine.
50476,Lisa,please! i went through my t.r. phase in first grade. now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin.
50479,Lisa,"that's a lot of anger, grampa."
42288,Lisa,"dad, that's not the real batman."
50482,Lisa,"hello, mom? you won't believe what bart's doing."
42294,Lisa,i think you should do a new ad. one that's fresh and original.
50486,Lisa,oh my god! do you realize what this means?
50488,Lisa,exactly!
50491,Lisa,"""d, e""... amazing! oh, but before we continue..."
42303,Lisa,when are we going to get to my first word?
42304,Lisa,my first word.
50495,Lisa,i miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
42310,Lisa,bart. bart bart bart bart bart.
42322,Lisa,my dad is very sick. what's gonna happen if he dies?
50520,Lisa,"mom, we're hungry!"
50524,Lisa,uhh... before the koreans?
50528,Lisa,what kind of american man doesn't want to explore global food culture?
42338,Lisa,... nine... ten...
50532,Lisa,"it's called ""el chemistri"" and they use science to make the food!"
42344,Lisa,the beeramid contains so much aluminum it would take five men to lift it. twenty-two immigrant laborers died during its construction...
50537,Lisa,gift shop!
42346,Lisa,"there's ""surly""... and ""remorseful""."
50539,Lisa,what?
42348,Lisa,i'm not sure that is water.
50543,Lisa,wait! wait! come back! dad! follow that dinosaur!
50546,Lisa,of course you're real! everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. how could that be made up?!
50551,Lisa,"every book on the ""young adult"" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!"
42360,Lisa,midnight?
42363,Lisa,must you be forever dialing that phone?!!!
42366,Lisa,i made it!
42369,Lisa,poor ralph.
50568,Lisa,what happened to me? in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most -- a literary fraud.
50570,Lisa,"no, guys... it was me."
42388,Lisa,what if he wants to hold hands?
42391,Lisa,"dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?"
50585,Lisa,proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as i cuddle up with madame bunny.
42395,Lisa,eiw.
50589,Lisa,"well, you're getting my help."
42398,Lisa,oh no. please don't show me with ralph.
42403,Lisa,"dear, dear george washington. can this liberty you dream of be worth all this bloodshed?"
42404,Lisa,"well, can it?"
50596,Lisa,why can't we visit a real museum? one that doesn't have the skeletons of the three stooges in the lobby?
42411,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
50610,Lisa,"dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
42419,Lisa,"oh... i was just thinking of a joke i saw on ""herman's head."""
50611,Lisa,"dad, i'm glad your show is successful, but i have to ask you: what's with the crying?"
50612,Lisa,"so, what's this with the gravy boat?"
42424,Lisa,remarkable.
50617,Lisa,"dad, you cannot endorse ted nugent. i mean, sure, we all love his music..."
42426,Lisa,experiment two: the food is connected to a mild electrical current.
42434,Lisa,this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
50627,Lisa,"well, i'll just buy one of these and build something different."
42438,Lisa,the mirror. the mirror!
50630,Lisa,can i join you?
42445,Lisa,the christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
42450,Lisa,arrrgh!
42460,Lisa,we're a family again!
42461,Lisa,you were in that coma for seven weeks.
42466,Lisa,"yeah, sort of."
50666,Lisa,"yep, you're the crack head. what dessert are you gonna get?"
42479,Lisa,bart! our cartoon's on tv!
50671,Lisa,it's... nice.
42482,Lisa,yay!
42484,Lisa,they said their insurance won't cover you.
50676,Lisa,"wow, nick here in our house. i hope it doesn't make him think less of me."
42488,Lisa,it's all so barbaric.
50684,Lisa,but grampa...
50686,Lisa,i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide.
50687,Lisa,"you know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table."
50689,Lisa,"wait, how long is this love for again?"
50690,Lisa,"hm, that's a pretty long time."
42512,Lisa,you're a latter-day clarence darrow.
42513,Lisa,"you're still my hero, mom."
42514,Lisa,"excuse me, but i think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean."
42515,Lisa,it seems like i've been wearing the same red dress forever.
50706,Lisa,wha--? mom is gonna love that!
42517,Lisa,we've gotta clean this up before mom gets back.
50708,Lisa,they have jellies made of fruits i've never heard of!
42525,Lisa,dad...
42528,Lisa,"miss midler, i can't believe you do this all by yourself."
50721,Lisa,"forsooth, a myst'ry-"
50723,Lisa,gramma!
50725,Lisa,power's out.
42535,Lisa,"bart, look! it's dad!"
50727,Lisa,thank you!
50728,Lisa,"dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function."
50731,Lisa,"wow, the tv's hooked up to the internet! you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows."
42540,Lisa,but there are still a few things i don't get. like how come we never heard about this until today?
42545,Lisa,"that's good, dad."
42546,Lisa,yeah!
42547,Lisa,"bart, i figured it out. who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years?"
50738,Lisa,"face it, we're just kids. we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. all we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
42551,Lisa,sideshow bob!
42553,Lisa,three little maids from school are we / pert as a schoolgirl well can be / filled to the brim with girlish glee / three little maids from school...
50746,Lisa,sweet? sweet?! the passengers on this ship could be the last people on earth!
42555,Lisa,"dad, don't let these application essays throw you. let's see... ""list your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
42559,Lisa,"dad, nerds are nothing to fear. in fact they've done some pretty memorable things. some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, orville redenbacher, rock star, david byrne and supreme court justice david souter."
42562,Lisa,i heard about this. this is the one where scratchy finally gets itchy.
42563,Lisa,plug it in! plug it in!
42564,Lisa,the tv! the tv!
42565,Lisa,it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- can't we do something?
50755,Lisa,hold that thought. i'm tuning my saxophone. sharp. flat. sharp.
42568,Lisa,does either of you know what incontinent means?
50761,Lisa,krusty! this once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! because he's been eating nothing but your food!
50763,Lisa,"well, he's tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes."
50764,Lisa,nothing.
42576,Lisa,"nope. it says right there, school bus."
50768,Lisa,"dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the christian faith. and although i personally follow the enlightened teachings of lord buddha, messing with jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a florida state jersey to a florida game."
50770,Lisa,he's in every scene.
42582,Lisa,"ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
50777,Lisa,"what?! ""least popular?"" i gotta go."
50789,Lisa,give that back!
42598,Lisa,it's so nice having everything back to normal.
42602,Lisa,mom?!
42606,Lisa,sure dad.
42607,Lisa,"hey, dad, i think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
42611,Lisa,"quit it, bart. quit it. quit it. quit it. mom, bart's making faces."
42614,Lisa,i'm going to have my wedding here.
42616,Lisa,are you mad?
50809,Lisa,are you crying... glitter?
50810,Lisa,"dad, thank you. like always, the fact that i could tune you out without fearing i'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful i have been. which means i've got a train to catch."
42620,Lisa,is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
50816,Lisa,"i used to think that i was stupid, worthless, weak, and wrong"
42625,Lisa,"dad, sit down."
42627,Lisa,really? not even this?
50823,Lisa,lisa simpson / lisa simpson
50824,Lisa,lisa simpson superstar!
50830,Lisa,we're not having a baby!
42639,Lisa,"this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my allowance. it isn't much, but i would like to help."
50831,Lisa,oh brother. let's dance.
42642,Lisa,"dad, what do you think?"
50845,Lisa,"oh, for the love of god."
42654,Lisa,"i'm not a state, i'm a monster!"
50847,Lisa,"hey! i specifically said no critics! this is outrageous! ooh, but they like me!"
50849,Lisa,huh?
50852,Lisa,"um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog."
42662,Lisa,"dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? i mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?"
50854,Lisa,"are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"""
42672,Lisa,"and that's how i cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of tv's ""facts of life"", including long time hold-out, tootie."
50870,Lisa,achem!
42680,Lisa,"forget it, dad. if i ever become famous, i want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
50874,Lisa,what do you do tuesdays and thursdays after school?
42686,Lisa,mmm corn. haven't had that in awhile.
50878,Lisa,because they can't let me have a secret. it drives them crazy.
42688,Lisa,and he taught me how to play the shenai.
50879,Lisa,cursive writing. i'm learning cursive. all these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them.
42695,Lisa,what'd ya bring? what'd ya bring?
42696,Lisa,"i'm sorry, apu. but remember, who needs a kwik-e-mart--"
42697,Lisa,awww.
50887,Lisa,get your hands off my future!
50891,Lisa,"well, maybe i can just win the sixty-two dollars back."
50895,Lisa,yeah! fifty dollars up! time to play with house money!
42712,Lisa,i have one.
42720,Lisa,"no, it couldn't be..."
50916,Lisa,but i'm a vegetarian!
50918,Lisa,this is such a big step!
42732,Lisa,"""...when i get married, i'm keeping my own name."" you know, that should probably be if i choose to get married."
50928,Lisa,nooo!
50929,Lisa,nooo!
42742,Lisa,"how doth the hero, strong and brave, a celestial path in the heavens pave!"
50947,Lisa,i didn't know that was an option.
50950,Lisa,"check it out, the new york times travel section just named springfield ""america's coolest city."""
42761,Lisa,"you can't do that, dad. it's cruel."
50953,Lisa,the back yard?! but what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to flanders's fridge?
42764,Lisa,"taught stampy any tricks yet, bart?"
42765,Lisa,i think they're trying to get some attention.
50959,Lisa,you never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. and i suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
42768,Lisa,"dad, i think he's an ivory dealer. his boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and i'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
42770,Lisa,are you an ivory dealer?
42772,Lisa,"i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, dad."
50966,Lisa,"when grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about."
42776,Lisa,dad!
42782,Lisa,it couldn't possibly be bottomless.
42787,Lisa,just take one of my geodes. the rocks on my desk.
42788,Lisa,"no, that's a trilobite... that's petrified wood... bart, that's a bran"
42789,Lisa,muffin.
42790,Lisa,that's guilt. you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
50980,Lisa,"you're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!"
50987,Lisa,no! outside the house!
50988,Lisa,it was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.
42797,Lisa,how do you know? there weren't any witnesses.
50990,Lisa,with nametags on them?
50991,Lisa,this is a pretty important decision.
50992,Lisa,someone's smitten.
42804,Lisa,"well bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
42805,Lisa,chicks on the bench...
42810,Lisa,what kinds of kids eat armour hot dogs?
42813,Lisa,doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
51006,Lisa,compliment her!
51009,Lisa,wait a minute. didn't bart and i both watch this thing when we were little?
42820,Lisa,"i think it's great you're a teacher, dad. so, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?"
51014,Lisa,"dad, why are you kowtowing to mr. van houten?"
42824,Lisa,"here, dad. i brought you some nice..."
51016,Lisa,"mom, i think maggie misses tv."
51017,Lisa,"you know mom, i was thinking we could take maggie downtown. ""the jazz hole"" is featuring a dizzy gillespie tribute band. their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks..."
42831,Lisa,"ah, face it, bart. our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck."
42832,Lisa,pool mobile?!!
42834,Lisa,dad...
51026,Lisa,your intellect-deadening dvds turned my brother's brain to jelly.
42841,Lisa,coming!
42842,Lisa,"dad... you have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean."
51033,Lisa,it looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
51041,Lisa,do not. that's ridiculous-- it's just-- it's that-- he's-- he's a rebel and only i can change him!
51042,Lisa,i got one for just watching the game.
51045,Lisa,confident... vassar sticker on the windshield... could it be... do i detect... enthusiasm?!
51050,Lisa,"well, while you're grading so generously... here's mine."
51054,Lisa,"please keep them together! if not for me, for the mother!"
42863,Lisa,i never made miss hoover yow-wee.
42864,Lisa,"hi, allison? i'm lisa simpson. oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level."
51056,Lisa,chauncey!
42868,Lisa,"uh! hey, sara! well, i gotta go. i have to practice for band auditions."
51062,Lisa,principal skinner...
42872,Lisa,"me, too."
51064,Lisa,better switch to social studies.
51066,Lisa,i have a bully at school.
42877,Lisa,and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
51072,Lisa,that just made it worse.
51073,Lisa,"ms. cantwell, i can make this stop. all you have to do is... like me."
51074,Lisa,ms. cantwell! wait!
42883,Lisa,"you're thinking of bears, mom."
42884,Lisa,"i can't tell you either, ralph."
42888,Lisa,"hey, i am above average! so what if allison's ahead of me? there's no shame in being second."
51080,Lisa,"nice going, bart. you've ruined halloween, thanksgiving, christmas and easter. the legendary grand slam."
51082,Lisa,"to prove my brother's innocence, i demand a youth court!"
42894,Lisa,oh really? i...
42895,Lisa,jeremy's iron.
51086,Lisa,i find that a little hard to believe.
51093,Lisa,why are you here?
51096,Lisa,the trial's not over and gravy is dead animal juice.
51101,Lisa,this skirt has a small splatter...
42910,Lisa,what?
51104,Lisa,what's that?
51107,Lisa,aw... but i do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
51111,Lisa,ah! tenting! tenting! back to the tenting!
42922,Lisa,"it was an unusually warm february 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
51114,Lisa,"ooh, a cupcake!"
51117,Lisa,i just have one thing to say...
51119,Lisa,why am i doing this?
42928,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
51123,Lisa,it came with fries or salad.
51124,Lisa,"well i wasn't sure, so i got both. who knows her little milhouse?"
42935,Lisa,"mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?"
51127,Lisa,bart! milhouse!
42947,Lisa,"you know, itchy and scratchy land isn't just for kids. they have a place called parents island."
51142,Lisa,"i staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it. then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of ""mamma mia."" in a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple. that couple right there!"
42960,Lisa,"don't do it, bart."
42966,Lisa,"no, mom. he's right. observe."
51159,Lisa,"i guess bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out. always."
51163,Lisa,it's for babies!
51164,Lisa,blob-jitsu kick!
42973,Lisa,bart! your mortal enemy is on the radio!
51165,Lisa,it's ki-ya karate monsters.
51169,Lisa,ki-ya--
42978,Lisa,there's no councilman les wynan.
42979,Lisa,i don't think bob won that election legally. i can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
51170,Lisa,ki-ya!
51175,Lisa,we're pretty broken.
51181,Lisa,dad! do we have to ride like this?
51188,Lisa,"oooh, there's new marshmallows in the belfast charms!"
51191,Lisa,"i'm glad you're back, dad. it's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek."
43002,Lisa,"mom, is dad gonna kill us?"
51198,Lisa,intelligence?
51199,Lisa,dad's kneeling on a prayer mat! he doesn't believe in kneeling!
51200,Lisa,huh. it looks like he's praying...
51209,Lisa,nothing really.
51217,Lisa,but i saw you praying to mecca!
43027,Lisa,"oh, what the heck, it was jessica lovejoy."
51219,Lisa,i've told you that a million times!
43029,Lisa,that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. what if the weatherman is wrong?
51222,Lisa,"we did it, dad. we did it."
43031,Lisa,i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer.
43033,Lisa,gym?!! that's the stupidest thing i ever heard.
43034,Lisa,that's not fair... why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out?
43036,Lisa,"mom, this is really scary. i'm gonna get my first 'f' ever."
43044,Lisa,"that's very nice, dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. however, i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
43045,Lisa,"lay off, guys. he's with me."
51238,Lisa,"well, now i always have someone to eat lunch with."
43050,Lisa,"bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
43051,Lisa,"bart, just get out of here."
43052,Lisa,that doesn't make sense.
51242,Lisa,"well then, i guess i have no choice."
51251,Lisa,the students would do it.
43060,Lisa,for the greater good.
51256,Lisa,now the class nerd. milhouse?
43065,Lisa,ashley grant! you gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
43071,Lisa,"the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. all they care about is entertainment. well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- public access television."
43072,Lisa,now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
51263,Lisa,"oh my god, you found a loophole! why don't you just put this much inventiveness into your work?"
43074,Lisa,yay!
51268,Lisa,"well bart, is that enough of a sign for ya?"
51270,Lisa,"bart, you're not annoyed that milhouse asked me to go to the american football game instead of you?"
43080,Lisa,"yeah, i hope it's as exciting as his other book ""rational thinking: reasonable future!"""
43086,Lisa,"no, dad. i want to get down. this tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."
43091,Lisa,hawaii!
51284,Lisa,"dad! we're missing ""the giant capybaras of uruguay!"""
51289,Lisa,one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do...
43103,Lisa,fine.
51295,Lisa,begone!
43105,Lisa,warning. warning. doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores.
43107,Lisa,"ow! cut it out, bart."
43111,Lisa,i still don't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters.
43116,Lisa,"dad, you're not with the stonecutters now. there are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."
51308,Lisa,a lincoln republican?
51311,Lisa,"oh, dear god."
43120,Lisa,yeah!
51313,Lisa,"i just can't believe someone like you would be a republican. i mean, isn't your last name guti√©rrez?"
51315,Lisa,"yes, why?"
43126,Lisa,i think it's romantic. throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
51318,Lisa,you voted for reagan?!
51322,Lisa,what?! my mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
43141,Lisa,"no, dad, i don't think..."
43144,Lisa,it's a pony.
51341,Lisa,that's impossible. we've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
51343,Lisa,excellent.
43153,Lisa,"yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as tom bosley. but krusty!"
51345,Lisa,"okay, i'm a liberal. and sometimes that's a dirty word."
43155,Lisa,"come on, shampoo! you can do it!"
43159,Lisa,"bart, water will only go the other way in the southern hemisphere."
43168,Lisa,"it's 6:45 a.m. next wednesday. you may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
51361,Lisa,i didn't say anything.
51362,Lisa,yes.
43171,Lisa,"mom, you said i could have one souvenir, right? well i want a didgeridoo."
51366,Lisa,"you could do what ""everybody loves raymond"" did."
43175,Lisa,"well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into an ecosystem that can't handle them."
51372,Lisa,but i'm going to give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.
43181,Lisa,i didn't turn it on. i thought you turned it on.
51374,Lisa,"mr. flanders, where's your store?"
43183,Lisa,that spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. i wonder who he is.
51381,Lisa,"i know this christmas has been a little rocky even for the simpsons. but i think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara, i mean holly and jolly."
43191,Lisa,"mr. sherman, i understand you have two pulitzer prizes."
51385,Lisa,"well, at least you're eating vegetables."
43195,Lisa,how did you know my name?
43197,Lisa,i'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.
43203,Lisa,that's bad?
51402,Lisa,i don't know. it wasn't like dad was stealing for himself. he created this wonderful experience for the whole town. i just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
51405,Lisa,thanks for taking us in. our family always appreciates asylum.
43214,Lisa,pertaining to a process involving a randomly determined sequence of observations.
43220,Lisa,i love these new planes.
43223,Lisa,"this place is so enchanting, hugh. i love it here."
51417,Lisa,so the rumors are true: moms can want things.
43226,Lisa,guess what -- hugh and i are getting married.
43229,Lisa,oh.
51421,Lisa,that's someone who eats plants.
51426,Lisa,i have about eight of them.
51427,Lisa,"oh, bart... diggs' problems don't have easy fixes."
51428,Lisa,well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. want a hug?
51437,Lisa,mom... can i visit bob?
43247,Lisa,"hi, dad."
43249,Lisa,oh dad...
43250,Lisa,"dad, you're babbling."
51441,Lisa,i say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
43255,Lisa,but you promised my dad you would.
43260,Lisa,maybe. but i still love them. and i don't think you understand that.
43264,Lisa,wow!
43269,Lisa,my bongo drums!
43270,Lisa,what's santa's little helper doing to that dog?
51463,Lisa,"uh... bob, you can't kill us without a little singing, right?"
51474,Lisa,"""this includes feeding; bathing; cleaning of droppings and barfings; and, when the time comes, burying or flushing."""
43286,Lisa,ssh.
43287,Lisa,we've gotta get you outta here!
51482,Lisa,"maybe i should get that sick one. if i don't, no one else will. bart, list your top five, best to worst. no, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
51483,Lisa,i just wish the grey one had the brown one's personality!
43292,Lisa,"quick, let's get..."
51486,Lisa,i could get two...?
43299,Lisa,oh no. strike?
43300,Lisa,"horrible news, mom!"
43301,Lisa,"luckily i've prepared for this, so i'm not too worried."
43303,Lisa,"but dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
51496,Lisa,"hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: ""johan oldenveldt."""
43305,Lisa,"relax? i can't relax. nor can i yield, relent, or... only two synonyms? oh my god! i'm losing my perspicacity!"
43306,Lisa,"so if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
43307,Lisa,"grade me! look at me! evaluate and rank me! oh -- i'm good, good, good, and oh so smart! grade me!"
51499,Lisa,this is so exciting! my first time establishing provenance!
51503,Lisa,what?
43312,Lisa,"how're you feelin', big brother?"
51504,Lisa,you're a... forger?
43315,Lisa,it's been a long time.
51511,Lisa,no-no-no.
51516,Lisa,no!
51517,Lisa,my hero isn't famous...
43327,Lisa,"lift me, won't you lift me / above the old routine / make it nice, play it clean, jazzman..."
43328,Lisa,"when the jazzman's testi-fyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman, oh jazzman..."
51519,Lisa,...and isn't in any history books...
51525,Lisa,that's what heroes do.
51533,Lisa,you put it on the fridge!
51534,Lisa,"all right, you're hurt. i understand. but when i made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. you became the hero i thought you could be, dad."
43343,Lisa,how come it won't stop hurting?
51536,Lisa,"i don't know, but she's my new hero."
43345,Lisa,no! it was bleeding gums murphy.
43346,Lisa,saxophone! he was a jazz musician.
51543,Lisa,"actually, i think it--"
43354,Lisa,bart! i can't believe it... but why?
51546,Lisa,is kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
51547,Lisa,i won't be using the correct term then.
51550,Lisa,can i join you for lunch?
51552,Lisa,"beans, beans. we'll do beans."
43361,Lisa,yay!
51553,Lisa,maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
51555,Lisa,hello?
43368,Lisa,as long as it's constitutional.
51561,Lisa,is that mom?
51562,Lisa,"dad, i believe we were on a date."
51566,Lisa,"oh dad, you're back! just in time for my recital!"
51570,Lisa,typical ralph nonsense.
51571,Lisa,now that's what i call a modern family.
51574,Lisa,after this we'll do makeovers!
51577,Lisa,what's for dinner?
43389,Lisa,could not!
51581,Lisa,"at the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes, yes, yes!"
51587,Lisa,mom paid her to be my friend?
43396,Lisa,"well, i don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
51594,Lisa,"mom, stop! stop! stop! i'm sorry!"
43410,Lisa,"okay, mom. anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. like those fingerprints. they could've gotten on the gun some other way."
43411,Lisa,are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
43413,Lisa,the scene of the crime! there must be something here that can clear dad.
51605,Lisa,"bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, bart chose ""b."""
43417,Lisa,then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to w and s.
51612,Lisa,it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue. he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
51616,Lisa,"while bart was in hell, homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
43427,Lisa,i don't know. they should be here.
43428,Lisa,you don't understand. mom and dad take good care of us.
43435,Lisa,"you know, maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us. i think she's beginning to forget mom and dad."
43442,Lisa,"let's see. dirt... dirt... well, there wasn't really much dirt."
51637,Lisa,"dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating."
43446,Lisa,what? how could you do that? your soul is the most valuable part of you!
51640,Lisa,kids love 'em. we trade them at school.
43451,Lisa,well?
43452,Lisa,"that's creepy, bart. i think you really did lose your soul."
51644,Lisa,"no, no. you want to make american kids work?"
51645,Lisa,"um, i'm not sure this is the best use of my skills."
51649,Lisa,"hm, looks like ancient aramaic. fortunately, i have an app for that."
51650,Lisa,hey!
43461,Lisa,awwww.
43462,Lisa,"oh, you are so cute! yes you are! you are! i just love you."
51656,Lisa,"dad, the tv's screwed up. it only plays ""married... with children."""
43465,Lisa,"no, i can't! i can't eat any of them!"
51664,Lisa,"sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, cute! this one..."
51665,Lisa,maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.
43474,Lisa,well i believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
43475,Lisa,do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?
51668,Lisa,this whole building is just a fa√ßade for a drilling operation.
43479,Lisa,mom.
51672,Lisa,maxine lombard.
43483,Lisa,"wait dad! good news, everyone! you don't have to eat meat. i made enough gazpacho for all!"
43484,Lisa,it's bad enough they're all eating meat. they don't have to rub it in my face.
43485,Lisa,"oh, then you must think i'm a monster."
51681,Lisa,a little lazy if you ask me.
51682,Lisa,"regardless, i see no reason to believe that ""bender"" is from the future. robotic technology today is very advanced."
51683,Lisa,it's not my birthday. although maggie's is pretty soon.
43492,Lisa,there! is everybody happy now?!
43494,Lisa,"but why, apu?"
51688,Lisa,that's it! all we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
43500,Lisa,"apu, i'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."
51693,Lisa,"dad, we have beer in our time!"
43502,Lisa,"when will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?"
43504,Lisa,"i guess i have been pretty hard on a lot of people. especially my dad. thanks, you guys."
51696,Lisa,"wait, wait, wait! you're the portal. how are you going to get to the future?"
51699,Lisa,"excuse me, but buzzard's roost is a converted parking lot."
51703,Lisa,"excuse me, you ruined my report."
43512,Lisa,hmmmmm.
51704,Lisa,oh! yippee! fourth-grade a!
51707,Lisa,i'm home!
51708,Lisa,so many musical choices!
51714,Lisa,"uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--"
51722,Lisa,i'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.
51724,Lisa,oops. so did mine.
43533,Lisa,no.
51725,Lisa,i got a chemistry set!
51727,Lisa,are we there yet?
43541,Lisa,neat!
51733,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
43544,Lisa,i would if i could.
51737,Lisa,"dad, i don't know about this. it's not on the park map."
43546,Lisa,this whole thing is really creepy. are you sure you won't talk to dad?
43547,Lisa,"well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. the longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
51738,Lisa,we've left earth's atmosphere!
43550,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing down there?"
51744,Lisa,now what?
43554,Lisa,"i think it's ironic that dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death."
51749,Lisa,"i win, i think."
51750,Lisa,thanks.
43559,Lisa,"me, too!"
43560,Lisa,more like pre-school.
43561,Lisa,"me, too."
51752,Lisa,here you go.
51756,Lisa,that's correct.
43572,Lisa,"you know, gramma, i used to think maybe i was adopted. i couldn't understand how i fit into this family. now that i met you, i suddenly make a lot of sense."
43574,Lisa,"don't you remember, dad?"
51766,Lisa,"mom, dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!"
51768,Lisa,i'm done.
43577,Lisa,"i wanna meet the first female stealth bomber pilot. during the gulf war she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is lisa, too!"
43581,Lisa,"mom! mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!"
43583,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
51778,Lisa,his company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! he changed the way hollywood drives!
43589,Lisa,helium. sideshow bob is in the duff blimp!
51782,Lisa,"no ideas? oh, that's sad."
51795,Lisa,"how about ""patty and selma""?"
43604,Lisa,"then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to w and s. waylon smithers."
43609,Lisa,i wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in!
43611,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
51805,Lisa,"but to be frank, there's not a lot to recommend it..."
51810,Lisa,do you really think that we can write a song that does that?
43621,Lisa,who are they?
51814,Lisa,"we couldn't write a song. we're one-hit wonders! but, is that such a crime? look at j.d. salinger."
43623,Lisa,"but it's marked down from $2,800!"
43624,Lisa,"oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like mary hart!"
51816,Lisa,charles m. schulz.
51817,Lisa,"well you're the only ""gangsta"" i know with a nine o'clock bedtime!"
51819,Lisa,"well, despite all that, today's gonna be fun, dad! will there be lots of other girls there?"
43630,Lisa,"all these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. it just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses i'm sorry. i gotta go!"
51828,Lisa,i'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!
43637,Lisa,you mean it's a new dress? where did you get it?
51829,Lisa,cook all the tater tots! / there were too many tots! / and the teachers took them home in manila envelopes! / i hate you!
51831,Lisa,i know how much to tip a waiter.
51832,Lisa,mom's counting cards at the casino!
43641,Lisa,"so with tax, how much was it?"
51834,Lisa,"nice try, dad."
43644,Lisa,i won't say anything controversial.
43645,Lisa,it's okay. those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
51838,Lisa,daddy! we're so glad to see you!
43648,Lisa,mom?
51842,Lisa,yay!
43651,Lisa,"it is a tragedy for all us kids. but, bart, you can't beat yourself up."
43654,Lisa,"bart, you're seeing krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. would it help if i told you you're not responsible for krusty's death?"
43655,Lisa,well i can't. you'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
51849,Lisa,all of the other reindeer / used to laugh and call him names...
43659,Lisa,hey! you've got a pacemaker scar just like krusty!
51852,Lisa,then one foggy christmas eve / santa came to say...
51856,Lisa,id. triple word score.
43665,Lisa,how about town crier? you'd be great at that.
43667,Lisa,"i was right about jebediah, and now i can prove it."
51861,Lisa,he's the bullfighter.
43670,Lisa,"--ha ha ha ha ha. oh my god! our town hero is a fraud! ""i write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
51864,Lisa,here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
51867,Lisa,"dad, eat something. it's got mustard on it."
51873,Lisa,"what, dad?"
43685,Lisa,no baseball bat.
51879,Lisa,aha!
51880,Lisa,we were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
51887,Lisa,me!
43698,Lisa,yes.
51890,Lisa,"happy, dad?"
51896,Lisa,where's he going?
51899,Lisa,hey!
43708,Lisa,that's because you stole it!
51900,Lisa,i guess i'd have needed a partial scholarship.
51905,Lisa,arrrgh!
43717,Lisa,"because the myth of jebediah has value, too. it's brought out the best in everyone in this town. regardless of who said it, ""a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."""
51910,Lisa,it's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
43719,Lisa,mo-omm! i just said that!
43721,Lisa,simpson! i need a ride to the library.
51914,Lisa,"i'm not greasing the wheels, dad. i like my teacher."
43727,Lisa,"bye, mom. bye, dad."
51919,Lisa,forget it.
43735,Lisa,you'll get more royalties.
43739,Lisa,"yes, well, technically everything worked out all right. but..."
51931,Lisa,don't bart! he's a friend of nelson muntz.
43742,Lisa,i don't know. but it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.
43745,Lisa,"hi. i remember you from such film strips as ""locker room towel fight: the blinding of larry driscoll."""
51938,Lisa,"yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?"
51939,Lisa,eww! knock it off!
51943,Lisa,just take mine. a simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.
43752,Lisa,"no, thanks. do you have any fruit?"
51944,Lisa,"i'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. the iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. the west virginia coal miner, coughing up his..."
43755,Lisa,"well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
51950,Lisa,"i'm just wondering, what's the point? would it make any difference at all if i never existed? how can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?"
43759,Lisa,"that's not latin. mom, bart's faking it."
43761,Lisa,sure i would! i can always learn about owls this summer at bird camp.
43764,Lisa,why do you need me?
51956,Lisa,is not.
51958,Lisa,"no, maggie, don't go for the glitter. look for substance."
43768,Lisa,we could have a slumber party.
43769,Lisa,thanksmombye!
51964,Lisa,"thanks, mr. murphy."
43777,Lisa,langdon alger.
51970,Lisa,"yeah, but i don't feel any better."
43779,Lisa,"thanks, dad. oh, this has been the best spring break ever!"
43780,Lisa,"so how's the national grammar rodeo, bart?"
51973,Lisa,how?
43784,Lisa,whee.
51978,Lisa,uh-huh.
43789,Lisa,"it's in tennessee, right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
51981,Lisa,"wow, mom."
43791,Lisa,"no! don't use your real name, or bart will know!"
51982,Lisa,"okay, mom."
51983,Lisa,i feel like smiling.
51984,Lisa,this is better than our house!
51988,Lisa,"we're playing ""what's that odor?""."
51990,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
43803,Lisa,"cut it off, but be careful."
43805,Lisa,he's down there.
43811,Lisa,"that's specious reasoning, dad."
52010,Lisa,maybe one more.
43821,Lisa,there was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! that means you can take the citizenship test!
52014,Lisa,here's your birthday breakfast!
43827,Lisa,"you know, apu, in a way, all americans are immigrants -- except native americans."
52020,Lisa,"oh, brother."
52023,Lisa,"""lullaby and good night / go to bed and sleep tight / close your eyes, start to yawn / pleasant dreams until the dawn."""
43832,Lisa,"dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse!"
43835,Lisa,"wow, it's like woodstock. only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards."
43838,Lisa,wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
43839,Lisa,"it may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
43840,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
52034,Lisa,"mom, bart was taking a picture of his butt."
52035,Lisa,yay! fried shrimp!
43844,Lisa,no.
52036,Lisa,ewwwww!
43847,Lisa,the reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: retrospecticus.
43848,Lisa,oops.
52039,Lisa,"hi, daddy."
52042,Lisa,what do you know about france?
52043,Lisa,"'bye, bart."
43859,Lisa,"we are best friends, mom. but i'm a kid. i need friends my own age, too."
52053,Lisa,goodbye adil. have a nice trip.
43862,Lisa,maybe you're getting stronger.
43867,Lisa,"uh, mom, i'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."
52059,Lisa,the cannon. the cannon. the cannon. the cannon.
52063,Lisa,his face is so flesh-colored and sad.
52069,Lisa,yeah man.
43879,Lisa,thanks. umm... you guys skate?
52073,Lisa,wait a minute. krusty can't read.
52075,Lisa,"bart, i'm starting to think you're right. krusty was framed. did he have any enemies?"
43884,Lisa,"well, it beats doing stuff."
43885,Lisa,"okay... thanks. that's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
43894,Lisa,"for me? wow, my first real friend... ...ship bracelet. i don't have anything for you... ...except this necklace i made."
52087,Lisa,dad dances?
43896,Lisa,what's he doing here?
43897,Lisa,my yearbook! no!
52092,Lisa,"oh, no, bart, we'll have nightmares."
43902,Lisa,does this mean you still want to be friends? even though i tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
43903,Lisa,"ohmigod, bart, look!"
43905,Lisa,bart!
43909,Lisa,no. she's sleeping with
52103,Lisa,we caught her! we caught the babysitter bandit! she's tied up at our house right now!
52107,Lisa,"everyone knows you're faking it, bart."
52109,Lisa,"prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel."
43924,Lisa,oh boy! mold! that's science-fair paydirt!
43932,Lisa,"so, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? oh my gosh!"
43934,Lisa,"wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
43937,Lisa,"well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
43939,Lisa,you think i'm god?
43940,Lisa,the devil? what devil?
52131,Lisa,it chose to destroy itself rather than live with us. you can't help but feel a little rejected.
52135,Lisa,fried shrimp.
43947,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i just find that very cute."
43954,Lisa,"hello, mr. chipmunk! you're a northern reticulated chipmunk! yes, you are! you are so reticulated!"
52150,Lisa,what?
52151,Lisa,"bart! stop it. he says ""nevermore"". that's all he'll ever say."
52155,Lisa,"try not to spill anything, dad."
52156,Lisa,"oooo, a political discussion at our table. i feel like a kennedy."
43966,Lisa,what a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day!
43967,Lisa,"it's not foilage, mom. it's foliage. fo-li-age."
43968,Lisa,he tried to kill our puppies.
52159,Lisa,"yes, sir. a very inane one. mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"
52160,Lisa,"oh mom, that felt awful."
52167,Lisa,i can't leave springfield. i was born here and i thought i would die here.
52175,Lisa,but i can't go back! not after i've seen the bright lights of capital city. i'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
52178,Lisa,"hi, bart. what're you doing?"
52179,Lisa,"well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but i think you're referring to a pawn."
43991,Lisa,she knows.
52185,Lisa,"let's see, ""golf""... anecdotes, eisenhower and, fashion, humor, japanese obsession with... ah, here it is. putting."
43996,Lisa,hey!
52191,Lisa,bart! you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about.
44002,Lisa,"milhouse, i've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but i've never felt this way before. i think i have a crush..."
52195,Lisa,"let's try another one: if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?"
44010,Lisa,i don't know why i like you. i just do. so... what do you think?
52203,Lisa,nirvana.
52207,Lisa,"bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, i'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. but here goes. i believe in you."
52210,Lisa,"it's not yours, bart! this is family glue!"
44021,Lisa,would you... play a song for me?
52213,Lisa,"maggie, i'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!"
44024,Lisa,how am i supposed to get home?
44027,Lisa,mom...
44029,Lisa,i wonder if i could change nelson...
52222,Lisa,baaarrtt!
52223,Lisa,you don't even care! you don't even care!
52224,Lisa,that's all right.
44034,Lisa,what do you feel? what's inside you right now?
44035,Lisa,"come on, nelson! you must think and feel things. i mean, look where we are: a rolling green hillside, the stars coming out like god is lighting a million tiny candles, the moon looking down on us as if to say..."
52228,Lisa,welcome back. bart! i'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.
44037,Lisa,"listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!"
52229,Lisa,"yeah, beg me, bart. beg me!"
52231,Lisa,bart...?! where are you?
44042,Lisa,meet me at the back door!
44045,Lisa,you lied to me.
52237,Lisa,"bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings."
52238,Lisa,just look!
52239,Lisa,apology accepted.
52240,Lisa,"yes, but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling, perhaps forever."
52245,Lisa,dad?
52248,Lisa,"springfield gorge? bart, you'll be killed!"
44058,Lisa,i think a hurricane is coming!
44060,Lisa,we better pick up some supplies.
44065,Lisa,"dad, no! this may just be the eye of the hurricane."
52257,Lisa,we will.
44070,Lisa,i'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
44072,Lisa,what hat?
52264,Lisa,okay. may we please be excused?
44074,Lisa,either that or batman has really let himself go.
44075,Lisa,all right! it's time for abc's tgif lineup!
52267,Lisa,"dad, may i please make an observation?"
52271,Lisa,"friday night, pork chops. from cradle to grave... etched in stone in god's library somewhere..."
44081,Lisa,wait!
52274,Lisa,"please, dad. this argument humiliates us both."
52278,Lisa,"please, dad."
44088,Lisa,yankees.
52280,Lisa,"please, dad."
44092,Lisa,"hi, mom!"
52291,Lisa,why are we waiting for dad?
52295,Lisa,it's so hard to picture you two then. hand in hand at the crossroads of life. there are so many questions.
44105,Lisa,but he didn't do anything!
44107,Lisa,"maestro, if you please."
52300,Lisa,cable? / us? / wow! / we have cable!
52309,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
44119,Lisa,"oh shary bobbins, this is ever so much fun!"
52312,Lisa,i see.
44124,Lisa,been there. done it.
44133,Lisa,wow! / alright! / cool!
52325,Lisa,"dad, bart ate a green bean during the blessing."
44136,Lisa,me! / i would! /
52330,Lisa,da-ad!...
44139,Lisa,"you should try out, dad. you have a funny voice."
44144,Lisa,"aw, mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? i mean, what would your grandma say?"
52336,Lisa,"no, sir. i can assure you i am not."
44146,Lisa,ech! think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
44147,Lisa,please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery.
52340,Lisa,you weren't watching! you weren't watching! you weren't watching!
52342,Lisa,pony ride!
52343,Lisa,pony ride!
44153,Lisa,"but if there're no deer out there, then what are they hunting?"
52345,Lisa,what is it unky herb?
44155,Lisa,"this is about as tolerant as dad gets, so you should be flattered."
44156,Lisa,he thinks you're gay.
52347,Lisa,the cat is named scratchy.
44158,Lisa,"hey, you said we were going to dairy queen."
52349,Lisa,hello there. do you miss the antarctic?
52351,Lisa,his life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a simpson.
44161,Lisa,what were you thinking?
44162,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd swear bob was building a dam."
44164,Lisa,run!
44171,Lisa,"bob, look!"
44174,Lisa,"i love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
52366,Lisa,"gee, is it always this good?"
44176,Lisa,why hasn't anyone called?
52369,Lisa,"look, mom, i finished my patch. it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life."
44180,Lisa,"please, please, please!"
44182,Lisa,"oh, they're going to get eaten alive in middle school."
52376,Lisa,this patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt.
44186,Lisa,now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
52378,Lisa,"huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab."
52381,Lisa,that's gross.
44191,Lisa,it'll be dark.
52386,Lisa,it seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
52393,Lisa,me too.
44204,Lisa,"okay, bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
44207,Lisa,i'll answer it. you go to bed!
44210,Lisa,"well, there's been a mistake."
52404,Lisa,maybe you could take a class at springfield community college.
44217,Lisa,go to your bed!
52414,Lisa,"um, one: your belt buckle says ""state of texas"", but texas wasn't a state until 1845."
44226,Lisa,"bart, if you come out, i'll let you eat raw cookie dough. i'll let you... ride the lawn mower through the house. come on, open the door!"
44227,Lisa,what are you doing now?!
52418,Lisa,and there weren't any jewish cowboys.
52429,Lisa,"no, mom. this is different. i mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better."
52433,Lisa,"yes! yes, mr. bergstrom?"
52436,Lisa,"unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to."
52439,Lisa,"places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
52440,Lisa,"i believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your semitic good looks."
44251,Lisa,didn't you hear i almost killed my brother?
44259,Lisa,i didn't. i just wanted to leave.
44260,Lisa,"i was in the library at the time, but janey told me that principal skinner and bart's teacher, mrs.... what's her name?"
44264,Lisa,ich esse; er isst; wir essen.
44266,Lisa,halogen lamps? kilim rugs? you can't afford this how can you afford this?
52458,Lisa,here he is!
52460,Lisa,i want candy!
52462,Lisa,ba-art!
44272,Lisa,"hey! stop! you can take back the bassinet, but the baby is ours!"
44276,Lisa,"bart, that is a new low."
44279,Lisa,"mom, mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
44280,Lisa,and you have to cut these up first. otherwise animals get caught in them.
52473,Lisa,'s okay. but you know who took her side? marge boooouuuuvier simpson!
52474,Lisa,"i am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter, but you are too clueless to understand what that's like."
44283,Lisa,"yes. um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
52475,Lisa,"my daughter thinks i'm a ruthless tyrant, like hitler or prince harry."
52476,Lisa,"godspeed, bart. i'm gonna go apologize to mom!"
44286,Lisa,no! i don't agree!
44291,Lisa,there's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
52483,Lisa,"google, even though you've enslaved half the world, you're still a damn fine search engine."
44293,Lisa,"what do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? you must have some magazines, or newspapers."
44300,Lisa,"oh... if i did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. nothing evil."
52492,Lisa,garden brains.
52495,Lisa,i love how you're dropping all your definite articles.
44304,Lisa,"oh, i'm not doing this for the money. i'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
44310,Lisa,what's going on?
52503,Lisa,"wait, mom. does that mean you're gonna take dad back?"
44312,Lisa,i think i'm going to be sick...
52504,Lisa,"thanks, but milhouse and i are in a pretty good place."
44314,Lisa,stop! don't recycle! it's murder! you're helping mr. burns!
44315,Lisa,no! it's evil! please stop recycling!
52505,Lisa,"no, that's what happened in your false memories."
52507,Lisa,"no, you were real."
52512,Lisa,you could go back to michigan -- it's still under sharia law.
44326,Lisa,what the heck is that?
44328,Lisa,what's he saying?
44333,Lisa,"hey, it was all a coincidence!"
44334,Lisa,did you see that?
44337,Lisa,play dead!
44343,Lisa,"chief wiggum, i can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
44344,Lisa,"oh, miss hoover, movies are a nice break, but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging?"
44350,Lisa,and so am i!
44351,Lisa,this school has everything i ever wanted.
44356,Lisa,"hey, look, it's the school motto."
44359,Lisa,"hey, what about me? i'm a lowly maggot!"
44363,Lisa,"uh-huh. so, anything else you want to talk about?"
44367,Lisa,"ech, i'm tired of being an issue, bart. maybe everyone would be better off if i just quit."
44369,Lisa,don't do that. why should we both be outcasts?
44371,Lisa,this wasn't in the brochure.
44377,Lisa,yes!
44382,Lisa,"a medal? thank you, sir!"
44401,Lisa,shhh! they're strapping down liza minelli.
44403,Lisa,"what a magical city! can we come back next year, dad?"
44411,Lisa,you'll practice me? what does that mean? is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
44415,Lisa,oh yeah?
44419,Lisa,yeah. except you were supposed to be telling the story of how i got my saxophone!
44420,Lisa,"mom, can you tell me the story of how i got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about bart!"
44434,Lisa,i know it's good.
44436,Lisa,all the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
44438,Lisa,"wow, look at all these gadgets! if i were a nerd, i'd be in heaven."
44439,Lisa,ow! someone just punched me in the face!
44440,Lisa,"mom, stop! according to this, it says bart mixed up his dna with a fly's. i think that's bart!"
44442,Lisa,"there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
44454,Lisa,"can we go, dad? / please dad? / please, please, please? / can we go, huh, huh please? /"
44456,Lisa,somebody's gotta stop them!
44459,Lisa,that would have made a lot more sense.
44470,Lisa,did anyone stop that robber?
44473,Lisa,what position have you got for me?
44474,Lisa,that's right. a girl wants to play football. how about that?
44491,Lisa,"which bombay to springfield flight is she on? the 10 o'clock, the 10:15, or the 10:30?"
44497,Lisa,"but they might be paving over rare specimens. pull over so we can complain, dad. come on, who wants to complain with me?"
44498,Lisa,fine. i'll come back later. who wants to come back with me? fine.
44504,Lisa,"okay, everyone! back to work! you never know when we might uncover a tyrannosaurus."
44514,Lisa,it could be anything. it could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
44518,Lisa,what about that sign right there?
44520,Lisa,wow... so lifelike.
44532,Lisa,"don't feel sorry for me, mom. i feel sorry for you."
44533,Lisa,kent.
44538,Lisa,nothing. someone must have stolen it.
44543,Lisa,wait a second! you planted a phony skeleton for me to find! this was all a big hoax.
44544,Lisa,"you exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares?! well, we are outraged! aren't we?!"
44545,Lisa,"i don't understand, professor. why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
44556,Lisa,um-hmmm.
44558,Lisa,this year's tree is just perfect. that old aluminum one was so fake.
44581,Lisa,hey!
44587,Lisa,"many people in this town / sing like we do / there's mister burns, there's krusty, and even apu."
44591,Lisa,you turn it on. i turned it on yesterday.
44597,Lisa,hard work made us quit.
44598,Lisa,okay. we get our room and board free anyway.
44604,Lisa,we just saw the most amazing camel!
44625,Lisa,the hell with him! / what leader? / he can take a flying leap as far as i'm concerned! / lea-who?
44627,Lisa,yayyy!
44632,Lisa,"aw, those poor badgers are soaked."
44636,Lisa,all we found were these oozing berries. and they look pretty poisonous.
44646,Lisa,"milhouse, did you steal the food?"
44647,Lisa,could anyone else have taken it?
44650,Lisa,did any one of you actually see milhouse eat the food?
44655,Lisa,run-a-way!
44656,Lisa,"aw, crud. / aw, come on, man."
44663,Lisa,"look, he's licking the slime off that rock! that's what he's been eating -- slime! and there's enough slime for all of us! we're saved!"
44667,Lisa,"mom, these are at least two sizes too big."
44669,Lisa,"dad, the zebra didn't do it. it's just a word at the end of the dictionary."
44674,Lisa,me too...
44680,Lisa,i bought my lunch at the gas station.
44681,Lisa,it's the kind john glenn eats when he's not in space.
44682,Lisa,professor provolone's picto-puzzle.
44690,Lisa,ugh! now i can't remember my combination!
44695,Lisa,"me, too."
44696,Lisa,darn it!!
44706,Lisa,oh... i've got to find out more...
44708,Lisa,no.
44718,Lisa,"hey, angel pie. can you drive me down the libarry? i wanna rent us up some movies."
44722,Lisa,i don't want to turn out that way!
44724,Lisa,"dear log: it won't be long now before my mind melts into a soft simpsony sludge. soon, the arts and literature i love will be replaced by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps. it's time to give my brain its last meal."
44725,Lisa,"oh, kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. it's so luminous and vibrant."
44729,Lisa,"yeah, while you still can... thanks!"
44732,Lisa,hello. my name is lisa simpson.
44737,Lisa,"so, please, i beg you, don't take your brain for granted. it's the best friend you'll ever have..."
44749,Lisa,i wanna read the giant book!
44754,Lisa,are you thinking of joining the naval reserve?
44763,Lisa,that was last year's taxes! you have to pay again this year!
44765,Lisa,"no, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
44770,Lisa,...and i'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. plus i get to be on tv!
44776,Lisa,"come on, this isn't a joke. all over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news."
44780,Lisa,what?!
44782,Lisa,"what is ""zazz""?"
44784,Lisa,"but that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. i mean, let's be honest. bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
44793,Lisa,they want cheap sentiment? i'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
44794,Lisa,"they call her the cat lady. people say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. but can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
44798,Lisa,they also have memorial day.
44808,Lisa,"eww. thank you, milhouse. now it's time for today's special live edition of bart's people."
44809,Lisa,"oh, no! what have i done?!"
44812,Lisa,"no, you can't hurt bart. he's... well, he's... your son!"
44827,Lisa,drugs.
44828,Lisa,that's awful! i almost wish it were drugs.
44836,Lisa,this exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. it's the first time these egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of england.
44841,Lisa,but it's the last day of the isis exhibit!
44846,Lisa,"hmm. i guess i could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea."
44856,Lisa,may i have that seat?
44862,Lisa,but i'm lost and i need to know where --
44867,Lisa,how could i confuse bus 22 with bus 22a?
44874,Lisa,excuse me. can you tell me how to get to the museum?
44880,Lisa,look out!
44883,Lisa,no!
44884,Lisa,"are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did close on your head."
44891,Lisa,"dad, i'm kind of scared."
44892,Lisa,okay... here goes.
44894,Lisa,now i know how sir dudley winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the temple of isis.
44895,Lisa,have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
44904,Lisa,"it's kind of humbling, isn't it? the music we just heard might never be heard again."
44912,Lisa,what a weird looking vacuum cleaner.
44916,Lisa,but it's all trash.
44927,Lisa,you have a pen glued to your cowlick.
44929,Lisa,"come on, bart. the bus is here."
44930,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll help her out. i remember how hard it was to be an outsider. always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like..."
44931,Lisa,did she just tell me to shut up?
44932,Lisa,you'll want a locker in this hallway -- it's library-adjacent.
44933,Lisa,is that perfume?
44941,Lisa,"okay, i'll go get our lunches."
44944,Lisa,or a big joke.
44975,Lisa,"oh. so, i guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?"
44978,Lisa,ahhhh!
44982,Lisa,lucky parameciums.
44990,Lisa,it slipped.
44994,Lisa,huh?
44999,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was work?"
45002,Lisa,"homer simpson, welcome to your life!"
45005,Lisa,"that, too. he also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car."
45006,Lisa,it's true. i read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
45009,Lisa,fluorescent...
45021,Lisa,"hang in there, dad! just half a basket left!"
45024,Lisa,fake mustache.
45025,Lisa,wanna comb it?
45037,Lisa,but isn't that a bit short-sighted? what happens when we're overrun by lizards?
45042,Lisa,"whoaaa, daaad!"
45045,Lisa,who'd do such a thing?
45056,Lisa,"we're done for, bart!"
45062,Lisa,poor maggie. if only you could tell us what's happening to you.
45063,Lisa,and now he's dead.
45064,Lisa,dad! wake up! wake up! wake up!
45066,Lisa,"actually, keeping promises would make you a good father."
45074,Lisa,"i didn't quite get the point of it, dad. why would lenny want someone to saw his legs off?"
45078,Lisa,uh-oh. i don't like the sound of that.
45079,Lisa,and the soles of your feet are jet black.
45080,Lisa,"ah, this is my kind of aisle -- soy substitute... whizless cheese... oven-roasted cud!"
45086,Lisa,"no, but i enjoy the smell."
45089,Lisa,"all right, i guess you're supposed to go through this stupid door..."
45092,Lisa,"oh, great. so i'm dead now? fine, i'm sick of this stupid game anyway."
45094,Lisa,i am just four power wands away from an anti-gravity lozenge. hope i don't run into that weird little troll!
45096,Lisa,the wind in the willows.
45097,Lisa,"no, you live in a different house."
45101,Lisa,"oh, i really need one more day, mom. i think the germs are regrouping. now for breakfast i'll have hash browns, coffee and a short stack. and would it kill you to heat up the syrup?"
45102,Lisa,but i-i might infect the other kids!
45107,Lisa,"no, not brown!"
45113,Lisa,"hey, i can't go in there!"
45114,Lisa,oh my god! these are the answers to the test! i don't wanna cheat!
45115,Lisa,forget it. i'd rather get a zero.
45117,Lisa,"well, i guess i was just on a roll."
45124,Lisa,"no! i never cheated before, and i never will again! oh, i almost wish i hadn't gotten away with it."
45134,Lisa,you can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! because i cheated!
45140,Lisa,"but, mom--"
45153,Lisa,he's waking up!
45154,Lisa,"i know you're a little peeved at grampa, dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
45158,Lisa,"that ""change"" was a bribe."
45164,Lisa,"heh, you're not really giving my father power of attorney, are you?"
45178,Lisa,meh.
45192,Lisa,but it's nine digits now. what's the point of these other four numbers?
45197,Lisa,"yeah, i'm bored too."
45200,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
45205,Lisa,"mom, this was made in 1967. they're probably out of business."
45206,Lisa,"so, is he alive or not?"
45207,Lisa,these super bowl commercials are weird.
45208,Lisa,unplugged.
45221,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks."
45223,Lisa,"but mom, i read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents."
45228,Lisa,bart! that's tomorrow night's dinner.
45231,Lisa,"bart, they're not here to entertain us."
45236,Lisa,"well, this could be quite enlighten--"
45237,Lisa,"nbc has lots of great shows, and their news and sports coverage can't be beat!"
45238,Lisa,fine. how about--
45245,Lisa,it encapsulates america and makes history come alive!
45246,Lisa,"sorry, dad. my mind is made up."
45248,Lisa,"hey, how come the smithsonian needs to be sponsored by a cel phone company?"
45252,Lisa,how can they put a prop from a tv show next to the bill of rights?
45264,Lisa,shut up.
45277,Lisa,"mom, i don't feel so good."
45293,Lisa,your snoring is disturbing the dancers.
45295,Lisa,"boy, i can really be a pain in the butt."
45296,Lisa,"gee, i should cut dad some slack. after all, he did take me to the ballet, and the smithsonian exhibit... in fact, he takes me lots of places he hates."
45300,Lisa,lousy meat-eating scum.
45305,Lisa,we're buying a new doorbell?
45306,Lisa,"mom, is this the one you want?"
45307,Lisa,"come on, mom, let's take it for a test drive."
45309,Lisa,"wait, people are coming. i think they're jehovah's witnesses."
45310,Lisa,"dad's got it on the speed dial under ""fire."""
45312,Lisa,why is it playing over again?
45317,Lisa,"keep that plague coming, moses."
45320,Lisa,i know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.
45332,Lisa,"dad, chew with your mouth closed. you're losing your mystique."
45340,Lisa,"to make the world a more magical place, i guess. although they did blow over and kill some people."
45342,Lisa,"well, actually, i just wrote it for a school assignment. everyone else wrote to the back street boys."
45345,Lisa,the future is a...
45348,Lisa,g-52.
45363,Lisa,they don't even seem to care that it's medication time.
45368,Lisa,"hey, mom, look!"
45369,Lisa,why can't we see it now?
45371,Lisa,"ooh, i hear this really sucks. hm, ""director's commentary""."
45376,Lisa,"oh, i think this really sucks."
45377,Lisa,"thank you. mm. for low-fat, this pudding's pretty good."
45379,Lisa,a pie.
45382,Lisa,"okay, i'm leaving."
45396,Lisa,i think so.
45397,Lisa,i know that. it's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere.
45414,Lisa,"with our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. we could turn springfield into a utopia!"
45419,Lisa,"welcome, everyone. today we embark on a new era of intelligent governance."
45423,Lisa,"da-ad! oh, dr. hawking. we had such a beautiful dream. what went wrong?"
45428,Lisa,"hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in springfield! will you take me, dad? please? i'll show you how to order pizza over the internet..."
45432,Lisa,"dad, do we have any money left?"
45444,Lisa,what the--?
45449,Lisa,now can we do something japanese?
45457,Lisa,"ah! dad, you're headed for the harbor!"
45460,Lisa,"stop doing that, mom."
45463,Lisa,you've really done it this time.
45466,Lisa,"no way... ""the seven habits of highly effective pre-teens?"" is this all because of the...?"
45467,Lisa,are you standing up to get me to leave?
45470,Lisa,i'm so glad you're here. bart's really acting funny.
45473,Lisa,"oh, bart, what's happened to you?"
45477,Lisa,why is the zero made out of glass?
45478,Lisa,"dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?"
45481,Lisa,and what per cent is that?
45484,Lisa,"well, we went to pat√© labelle last week. how 'bout that?"
45485,Lisa,the food is delicious.
45486,Lisa,hm. what's the english equivalent for ? i'd say... transcendent.
45490,Lisa,"wow, my first published article. although someone else's name is on it."
45511,Lisa,"bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes!"
45515,Lisa,"bart, just let me drop and save yourself!"
45519,Lisa,it's got a computer chip in it. everything does.
45527,Lisa,do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
45533,Lisa,"where are we going, dad?"
45535,Lisa,i'll weed the floor.
45536,Lisa,"oh, you poor little sheep! no one's sheared you for years!"
45545,Lisa,"no, i..."
45547,Lisa,just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
45557,Lisa,you already saw them.
45565,Lisa,you keep it.
45569,Lisa,korean love brides?!
45573,Lisa,i'll be in my room.
45577,Lisa,"uh, just a few venn diagrams."
45578,Lisa,"the word is ""irony."""
45580,Lisa,that's not funny... huh?
45581,Lisa,they're spying on us. why would they do that?
45587,Lisa,"bart, they lied to us. instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. aren't you outraged?"
45588,Lisa,good. saddle up the bikes.
45592,Lisa,really?
45593,Lisa,"oh, brother."
45598,Lisa,boycott funzo. he's a toy-killing machine!
45602,Lisa,joy to the world / the lord is come. / let earth receive her king...
45605,Lisa,si-lent night...
45608,Lisa,yes. the madness ends here.
45610,Lisa,are you saying the end justifies the means?
45623,Lisa,but they...
45632,Lisa,will you at least do the dishes?
45633,Lisa,oh! you're gonna be late.
45635,Lisa,"you stay away from lenny. and where's your sweater, bart?"
45639,Lisa,here you go.
45643,Lisa,you said that four days ago.
45647,Lisa,"dad, i gave you a list!"
45650,Lisa,so mom... you think you'll be getting out of there soon?
45651,Lisa,"i really thought i could handle this, but..."
45653,Lisa,"stupid, inconsiderate bunch of jerks... i can't believe, after i..."
45655,Lisa,what are you doing here?
45656,Lisa,will this do?
45660,Lisa,let's see... crusty sores...
45662,Lisa,any exposure to unsanitary conditions?
45665,Lisa,"now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. i'll get you a couple of mops."
45672,Lisa,you mean hawaii?
45674,Lisa,"dad, you only took one course."
45675,Lisa,you went to springfield u. you hate a & m.
45676,Lisa,no.
45681,Lisa,i think godzilla's bigger than superman.
45683,Lisa,they'll have tabouleh.
45686,Lisa,you won a grammy.
45688,Lisa,i'm princess margaret!
45693,Lisa,why are we cleaning this room? i don't think we were even in here.
45695,Lisa,"ah, it's good to be home."
45696,Lisa,"i hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win playing ""stars and stripes forever""? it's so beginner band, and we're advanced beginner band."
45700,Lisa,anybody got a building permit? 'cause we nailed it!
45703,Lisa,"i hope you enjoy your plaque, cheater."
45710,Lisa,is that duncan?
45724,Lisa,"dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes."
45728,Lisa,agreed.
45729,Lisa,microatia? that's twelve thousand miles away.
45739,Lisa,"hey, gimme that! / that's mine!"
45762,Lisa,"dad, that's just a myth. lincoln didn't hide any gold in the white house."
45764,Lisa,"bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy."
45765,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
45771,Lisa,"see, that has the same problem. we need to soften the blow."
45790,Lisa,"you know something, bart? you're right. my lack of coolness is really holding america back."
45820,Lisa,"well, at least we won the bike."
45826,Lisa,"oh, no! we came during spring break!"
45837,Lisa,what should i do?
45841,Lisa,it got rave reviews from both the entertainment radio network and the radio entertainment network. let's go!
45843,Lisa,"that's my name with bella on the end of it. ask her, oh god, please ask her to dance."
45854,Lisa,but i just... need more practice. see ya!
45856,Lisa,the cat dances better than i do.
45858,Lisa,excuse me...
45862,Lisa,"all right, i'll be the stupid curtain puller."
45868,Lisa,"but, but you don't understand..."
45877,Lisa,you think so?
45879,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
45886,Lisa,"well, mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans."
45895,Lisa,"and i'm directing the ""making of"" video."
45907,Lisa,"right from the start, i had a bad feeling about that gig."
45908,Lisa,what kind of song should we play?
45917,Lisa,"it really says ""die""? that sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
45919,Lisa,but these fairy tales take me away from the harsh reality of peasant life.
45923,Lisa,everything in this forest is from a fairy tale! and this book can keep us one step ahead!
45924,Lisa,"hmm... bowls of porridge... oh, this seems somehow familiar... let's see..."
45928,Lisa,you're probably right.
45929,Lisa,"oh, this is horrible!"
45931,Lisa,"well, at least stop basting yourself!"
45941,Lisa,killer dolphins?
45942,Lisa,plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
45960,Lisa,you've ruined all my stuff.
45961,Lisa,it is my birthday.
45965,Lisa,"catch, dad, catch!"
45966,Lisa,dad! dad!
45968,Lisa,"i'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering."
45970,Lisa,"there you go, little fish."
45971,Lisa,"bart, do you know how many trees died to make those menus?"
45972,Lisa,you're ruining the earth.
45979,Lisa,no i don't!
45983,Lisa,jesse?
45995,Lisa,"well, this looks like a good place to set up camp."
46002,Lisa,all right! a care bucket.
46003,Lisa,"hot thai soup! ohhh, bart... ""dear lisa. you rock! mom is calling rescue agencies. dad is building a giant ladder, but it is of poor quality. we miss you, bart."" awww."
46018,Lisa,"lightning?! well, at least it wasn't my fault."
46023,Lisa,... pour cocktail onions down your pants.
46025,Lisa,i'm not dead! and neither is my sense of moral outrage.
46028,Lisa,"well, i'll write you letters. on rice paper, with a soy pencil!"
46032,Lisa,"dad, what happened to the back seat?"
46040,Lisa,not my dad.
46045,Lisa,"no, dad. you could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate."
46046,Lisa,i'm so proud! my dad will be the grand finale of the thanksgiving day parade.
46047,Lisa,something tells me he is.
46053,Lisa,"okay, you're ready to go. i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them."
46054,Lisa,well... a web page is supposed to be a personal thing. you've just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else. they could sue you for that.
46056,Lisa,"you have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
46059,Lisa,"well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
46067,Lisa,what happened to mom?
46073,Lisa,"i dunno, mom. i think they're up to something..."
46076,Lisa,anything else?
46080,Lisa,the cirque de pur√©e. we've had tickets since septembre.
46081,Lisa,"as french canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment."
46085,Lisa,this couldn't have less to do with christmas! and i think that's a stagehand.
46087,Lisa,"""lisa is an outstanding student, with a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism."" that's not even a word!"
46092,Lisa,"well maybe if mom didn't make such dry waffles. there, i said it!"
46098,Lisa,"no, really. i think books have an amazing power to bring people together. look, even cletus is checking one out."
46106,Lisa,"""lisa: i'm taking the coward's way out. but before i do, i just want you to know: being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are."""
46115,Lisa,"you know what'd be good with these, is some ms. butterworth."
46124,Lisa,practicing tennis.
46130,Lisa,"dad, i think you're overreacting."
46131,Lisa,this session's over.
46137,Lisa,how would you know? your backhand looks like a rusty gate.
46140,Lisa,me neither. i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
46142,Lisa,i can't believe krusty's retiring. this is tragic!
46146,Lisa,"wait, what was that?"
46161,Lisa,but you have recruiting ads on tv. why do you need subliminal messages?
46163,Lisa,cut it out! you're a grown man!
46166,Lisa,m-e-h. meh.
46172,Lisa,"thank you, dad."
46173,Lisa,great!
46174,Lisa,"thanks again, dad."
46179,Lisa,why don't you just cook less?
46180,Lisa,that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
46183,Lisa,give her a break. remember your first day at school?
46199,Lisa,um-um.
46203,Lisa,"willie, i need to see the school security tapes."
46206,Lisa,"ooh, here's the tape i need."
46207,Lisa,how did she know i was there?
46211,Lisa,"hey willie, i think i'm onto something! check this out!"
46215,Lisa,"excellent, now don't mind the squeegee."
46232,Lisa,"the pungent vinegar and tangy roquefort block the smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless."
46242,Lisa,"hey, how ya doin' there? / hi! / hello. / yo, kitenge! what's going on?"
46244,Lisa,"no, mom."
46259,Lisa,"hello, little fella."
46264,Lisa,"hey! ah! stop it, you creep!"
46270,Lisa,these are just pictures of monkeys from famous movies.
46272,Lisa,"/ oh, he got overthrown!"
46281,Lisa,"quiet, please! some of us are trying to weld! almost done. just lay still."
46287,Lisa,"oh no! somebody took my bike?! mom, i need a ride to school."
46293,Lisa,i'm at the wrong school!
46301,Lisa,will i ever see you again?
46308,Lisa,i've gotta get to school.
46309,Lisa,"mom, i have to get to school. it's ten to three!"
46321,Lisa,don't listen to him. you just have a good time at the eye doctor.
46324,Lisa,you said we were doing this out of friendship.
46328,Lisa,"no, dad! i think there's a leak in the line."
46329,Lisa,eight.
46336,Lisa,i guess dad just takes us for granted.
46338,Lisa,night will come soon.
46341,Lisa,we just spliced in some home movies. whaddaya think?
46342,Lisa,yeah. / pretty much.
46347,Lisa,got any more tall tales?
46354,Lisa,"ohh, let's try matthew perry!"
46365,Lisa,hocus-croakus!
46367,Lisa,release the dragon!
46369,Lisa,this isn't my wand. it's a twizzler!
46371,Lisa,"help me, bart!"
46373,Lisa,"bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry. even if you never become a great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother."
46376,Lisa,ack!
46377,Lisa,"granted. but you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for bart. he might even make the honor roll, if dad can control his night terrors."
46379,Lisa,"oh, poor mom and dad."
46380,Lisa,"do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet mom and dad are being punished?"
46385,Lisa,"judge snyder? motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be boys."""
46391,Lisa,why?
46392,Lisa,a hole for what?
46393,Lisa,o-kay then.
46395,Lisa,this is pretty far to go just to spite moe.
46396,Lisa,can we go to bed now?
46397,Lisa,but you're not even using them.
46401,Lisa,moe?
46403,Lisa,dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
46411,Lisa,then i'll have the sweet 'n' sour rice.
46412,Lisa,"neither, thank you."
46414,Lisa,i don't know.
46420,Lisa,i came home as quick as i could. what's going on?
46432,Lisa,"stop saying that, dad."
46440,Lisa,that's just a dog in a space suit.
46452,Lisa,don't you see what mr. burns has done to this church?
46453,Lisa,"those are all wonderful things. but they've cost the church its soul. and i, for one, will not be a part of it!"
46474,Lisa,a buddhist wouldn't want any.
46476,Lisa,no.
46478,Lisa,"well, they do smell good..."
46479,Lisa,i just came down for a glass of water.
46485,Lisa,whaa?
46496,Lisa,pennsylvania avenue. i wanna buy a house.
46526,Lisa,"we have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople."
46533,Lisa,who?
46534,Lisa,maybe we should try to calm dad down.
46536,Lisa,really?
46544,Lisa,she's not on drugs. she couldn't sleep because of dad's chronic snoring.
46547,Lisa,mmmmm.
46553,Lisa,this school has everything.
46558,Lisa,i will not be a gamecock!
46559,Lisa,no!
46562,Lisa,greta called. it seems you told her you were sick.
46568,Lisa,"all right. look, maggie's not playing with this ball right now. but look what happens when i take it."
46573,Lisa,let's go where it's quiet.
46582,Lisa,plus he'll work for scale.
46583,Lisa,no one expects you to do anything difficult. they understand you're too old.
46584,Lisa,you know what? i bet he can't even fit into his old costume.
46587,Lisa,i'm really gonna miss him.
46591,Lisa,give grampa a chance. statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes.
46596,Lisa,"oh, that was lucky."
46601,Lisa,this has been a gracie films pray-sentation!
46602,Lisa,"here's the book... ""classics for children?"""
46612,Lisa,"yes, sir."
46623,Lisa,"is that true, lord?"
46635,Lisa,"ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. that's why i called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared."
46641,Lisa,except antarctica.
46655,Lisa,"excuse me, we're looking for this little boy."
46658,Lisa,"okay, on this map i marked all the places that ronaldo liked to go. if we split up, we should be able to search them all."
46660,Lisa,american corporations should stop playing god with nature.
46662,Lisa,"whatcha doing, mom?"
46665,Lisa,"i want my old dad back. the one who was yelling all the time and... you know, i'm not really sure what i want."
46667,Lisa,"it's time for your surprise, dad."
46669,Lisa,who's mark spitz?
46677,Lisa,"groundskeeper willie, groundskeeper willie's enemy seamus..."
46678,Lisa,"well, i think we should try the springfield speaker's bureau."
46680,Lisa,"he created a cartoon called ""danger dog."" it's popular with kids and adults."
46683,Lisa,can she have a pony? and the last line in the scene?
46690,Lisa,no. the last step is quitting.
46691,Lisa,whaaa?!
46698,Lisa,my bad.
46699,Lisa,who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
46705,Lisa,ich bin ein... gymnast!
46710,Lisa,"oh, i'd love to!"
46717,Lisa,"actually, i'm off campus. i, um, share a house with a couple of girls, a couple of guys."
46727,Lisa,"lisa simpson, master of the double life."
46733,Lisa,but the atmosphere there was so stimulating. it was a bustling marketplace of ideas.
46737,Lisa,two million.
46745,Lisa,well i can't do it tomorrow. there's an assembly in his honor.
46746,Lisa,ew! bart!
46757,Lisa,are you gonna call the police?
46759,Lisa,maybe we should look for clues.
46764,Lisa,we could come with you.
46769,Lisa,"dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?"
46770,Lisa,that's it! i know exactly what we should do.
46776,Lisa,"...twenty eight, twenty nine... there's one missing."
46777,Lisa,three cheers for a gun-free springfield. hip hip...
46778,Lisa,hip hip...
46785,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing?"
46795,Lisa,"have you always resented us, dad?"
46796,Lisa,please don't say any more!
46799,Lisa,come... on... dad...
46803,Lisa,"are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, dad?"
46807,Lisa,"bart, the test is in two hours. and you haven't slept in a fortnight."
46808,Lisa,"you should know, it's on the test!"
46817,Lisa,that's cheating! bart cheated!
46818,Lisa,i'll take ashley!
46824,Lisa,"he thinks he's really cool, but frankly the other kids are starting to wake up and smell the cooties."
46826,Lisa,to fraternal love.
46832,Lisa,because you've already done it once.
46847,Lisa,i'm sorry. they don't publish that any more.
46850,Lisa,we're building homes for the homeless.
46854,Lisa,"dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring."
46861,Lisa,"dad, look!"
46866,Lisa,"actually, it says here we're gonna see hockey."
46874,Lisa,why don't we stay at a youth hostel?
46879,Lisa,"why is the guy from ""laverne and shirley"" living in our house?"
46899,Lisa,edna! edna! edna! edna!
46902,Lisa,"mom, dad, my birthday's coming up, and girltech turbo diaries are in stores now."
46914,Lisa,"is that miles davis' ""birth of the cool?"""
46917,Lisa,because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. take a look for yourself.
46919,Lisa,and look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
46920,Lisa,"dad, today was so great. the animal rights protest, a visit to the museum of sadness and oppression..."
46921,Lisa,how'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? did mom help you?
46925,Lisa,"blackening our hair was a great idea, dad. i look just like a powerpuff girl."
46935,Lisa,those are the test animals! the detective must have sold them to the circus.
46936,Lisa,"dad, are you in here?"
46942,Lisa,i'm a magazine rack.
46944,Lisa,the air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
46954,Lisa,"dad, are you hurt?"
46965,Lisa,bart sad.
46966,Lisa,"if i ever needed proof of the existence of god, here it is."
46976,Lisa,"oh, tomorrow's the day the judge said we can visit bart."
46989,Lisa,"well, i'm not done yet. principal skinner said if i win the state finals, i can go to the spell-lympics!"
46990,Lisa,could you use it in a sentence?
46992,Lisa,"really? it won't be the same without you, dad."
47006,Lisa,"some of us still enjoy scripted comedy, sir."
47012,Lisa,throw the bee and go to college. throw the bee and go to college...
47020,Lisa,"with you here i can't fail. attention, everyone. i was asked to take a dive. but i won't do it. i-n-t-r-a-n-s-i-g-a-n-c-e."
47022,Lisa,"my one chance for everyone to like me, and i blew it."
47028,Lisa,"well, i'm all set. i'm gonna be following the latest designs from modern sandcastle magazine."
47034,Lisa,"dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?"
47035,Lisa,this is not a delta hub!
47037,Lisa,why don't we go to our congressman?
47039,Lisa,"yeah, and entertainers are always winning elections. jesse the body ventura, sonny bono, gopher from love boat, mary bono..."
47055,Lisa,"dad, have you looked at this earnings report?"
47059,Lisa,"hey, you can't blame principal skinner for wanting to feature his best student."
47060,Lisa,"well, i am young, gifted and yellow. my interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings..."
47065,Lisa,"hmm, maybe i could be an expert on dinosaurs."
47072,Lisa,what happened?
47080,Lisa,"hi, i'm trying to reduce light pollution."
47093,Lisa,look!
47104,Lisa,it's so weird not having dad here. i can't fall asleep if i haven't read him his bedtime story.
47107,Lisa,dad took us antiquing!
47110,Lisa,"thanks, julio. i love you as a blonde."
47114,Lisa,"hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas...non-christian friend..."
47121,Lisa,i'm lisa simpson and you're the first person i've met here who cares about our animal equals.
47128,Lisa,"but when he's twenty-three, i'll be eighteen."
47133,Lisa,"yeah, it sure is..."
47137,Lisa,sister?! you mean she's not your girlfriend?
47142,Lisa,i'm sorry. i only sent you the wrong way because i thought you were luke's girlfriend.
47152,Lisa,"actually, frank lloyd wright endured a lot of harsh criticism."
47157,Lisa,"it also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the duff corporate jet."
47170,Lisa,"dad, you ate the last can of tuna."
47171,Lisa,where do you keep the fish 'til it's done?
47172,Lisa,"dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. why don't you take public transportation?"
47174,Lisa,yay! i wanna amble!
47175,Lisa,amble!
47176,Lisa,amble!
47179,Lisa,"ideally no, but..."
47180,Lisa,i don't think dad is accurately portraying native american life.
47186,Lisa,"because i know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
47191,Lisa,this party's boring. everything here is for babies.
47199,Lisa,"""my dad's job."" my dad's job takes him to all parts of the community. he performs a valuable service, but is often misunderstood, like a vulture or the flesh-eating maggot."
47206,Lisa,it almost sounded like he plans to tear organs out of living people!
47211,Lisa,he's right! it all checks out!
47221,Lisa,i object!
47237,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options..."
47241,Lisa,"don't vote for me, kids of springfield / unless you want an effective leader / i'll talk to teachers / i'll handle skinner / a vote for lisa / makes you the winner..."
47248,Lisa,"well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason i can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
47251,Lisa,"well, i have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
47255,Lisa,"""photo op helping kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""move the brushfire hazard needle..."" um, shouldn't i stay here and work on school policy?"
47259,Lisa,okay.
47262,Lisa,"and then, as school president, i don't have to take the hearing test."
47267,Lisa,what have i done?
47269,Lisa,they made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
47270,Lisa,you tricked me into betraying my fellow students!
47272,Lisa,"i hereby resign as your president. and for my last act, i call a general student strike, effective immediately!"
47283,Lisa,"okay, let me take figure skating."
47322,Lisa,zoot suit... astronaut outfit... southern belle... renaissance dandy... country-western octopus...
47325,Lisa,he made it! he's finally protected from man.
47332,Lisa,he's at the peak of cuteness.
47337,Lisa,there's nothing in the talmud that forbids it.
47346,Lisa,"dad, i don't like the looks of this neighborhood."
47354,Lisa,not any more.
47361,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna lose. we have to do something."
47362,Lisa,"okay, but how?"
47363,Lisa,oh my god! i just had my most brilliant idea ever!
47365,Lisa,"bart, why are we fighting?"
47376,Lisa,coltrane?
47377,Lisa,"coltrane, you were with us only briefly, but we'll always have the ride home from the shelter. and uh... i guess that's it. amen."
47388,Lisa,don't you need training for that?
47389,Lisa,not if i pump your heart full of morphine first!
47393,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, mom. but just one thing: isn't your book a little hard on dad?"
47396,Lisa,"if dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
47397,Lisa,what if they make it into a movie?
47400,Lisa,didn't you read mom's book?
47410,Lisa,"mom, that sounds a lot like the movie ""amadeus,"" which was historically inaccurate. mozart worked hard on his music... salieri was a respected composer..."
47413,Lisa,who is it? is it ralph?
47415,Lisa,"ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants."
47418,Lisa,"that's not true, bart. mom and dad value us equally, and... oh, you're right. 'kay, go ahead."
47424,Lisa,"hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here. this place should be our special secret!"
47434,Lisa,oh. i see how it is.
47436,Lisa,mmm-hmm... i think i'll go to bed now.
47443,Lisa,bart will give back the malibu stacy head you thought was lost.
47445,Lisa,i think i'm gonna use this card right now.
47447,Lisa,yay!
47451,Lisa,"okay, for malibu stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need?"
47453,Lisa,did you do that?
47458,Lisa,"go on, maggie, you can do it."
47459,Lisa,"but, but my iq is only 159! maggie's more intelligent than me?"
47460,Lisa,"yes, thank you."
47461,Lisa,really?
47464,Lisa,"all right, if i'm second rate as the smart kid, i'll find a new raison d'√™tre."
47472,Lisa,"okay. but first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess ironica, uh... who lives in this rock."
47478,Lisa,"fine, i'll help you with your stupid flash cards."
47479,Lisa,aren't you smart. let's try another one... a little harder this time.
47481,Lisa,"that's right! this spells ""dog."""
47483,Lisa,"maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly!"
47493,Lisa,"maggie, i'm sorry i was jealous of your special gift. from now on i'm gonna nurture and cherish--"
47495,Lisa,you can do it. red!
47497,Lisa,"go on, maggie, you can do it."
47499,Lisa,so maggie's not a genius?

47517,Lisa,"thanks for reading me ""the corrections."" it makes me feel better about my own family."

47524,Lisa,that character is just a tired stereotype.
47525,Lisa,"i can't believe the ""gathering shadow"" was senate redistricting!"
47526,Lisa,i'll write the letter.
47529,Lisa,"no, he lives at the ""cosmic wars ranch"" in northern california."
47536,Lisa,wow... mom and dad sure are having fun.
47543,Lisa,why would bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
47546,Lisa,"grampa, how do you sleep at night?"
47551,Lisa,at least i was planned.
47557,Lisa,that's where mom and dad are!
47565,Lisa,let's go find mom and dad!
47574,Lisa,i know. my new thing is to ignore you.
47576,Lisa,"no! you don't understand. we came here to give you some privacy, and--"
47579,Lisa,these giant vegetables are amazing.

47594,Lisa,"and now please welcome the elvis of enlightenment... the lean, serene, chanting machine: the dalai lama!"
47602,Lisa,"that's horrible. how could you, dad?"
47614,Lisa,"we get it, mom."
47615,Lisa,"i'm as patriotic as the next person, but changing the traffic lights to red, white and blue just seems dangerous."
47619,Lisa,"it's not a jail, it's a ""reeducation center."""
47624,Lisa,yes.
47626,Lisa,"maman, please pass ze baguette."
47628,Lisa,"gee, i never noticed that before."

47646,Lisa,burns owns everything! i've gotta speak out before it's too late!
47648,Lisa,"i'm sorry mr. burns, but my paper's not for sale."
47653,Lisa,you can't leave now! we're the only thing stopping mr. burns!
47656,Lisa,"bart, you're staying!"
47657,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful."
47662,Lisa,what's that?
47665,Lisa,nooo!

47695,Lisa,cheating!
47698,Lisa,i guess dad has to be my hero now.
47705,Lisa,"dad, the kids at school said my butt's big."
47706,Lisa,maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
47715,Lisa,that doesn't make any sense!
47723,Lisa,i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
47729,Lisa,it's a media circus!
47731,Lisa,"abc, cbs... uh-oh, the christian science monitor has a flat tire!"

47780,Lisa,done and done. i'm going to the organic market!
47787,Lisa,"dad, what did you do?"
47794,Lisa,"""the plywood pelican was larger than a football field. it weighs more than the state of new hampshire. it was only flown once, by its creator, mr. c. montgomery burns."""

47809,Lisa,are you sure mom and dad want us to enter a european balloon race?
47810,Lisa,"i used to love springfield park, but it's gotten so run down."
47814,Lisa,"dig in, everybody!"
47815,Lisa,really? didn't you just sign a ninety million dollar contract?
47818,Lisa,just what we need. another lame suburban kid who loves rap.
47825,Lisa,"it doesn't matter. the point is, only with your help can i expose bart's lies."
47828,Lisa,wait just a minute.
47844,Lisa,"ah, pre-modern man. if these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
47846,Lisa,"how can you stand there eating snacks and being children, when the world's glaciers are vanishing?"
47847,Lisa,we have to do something about it!
47848,Lisa,glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
47854,Lisa,you don't even care how upset i am! but this time you have gone too far.
47855,Lisa,"you'll see. oh, you will see."
47861,Lisa,name three.
47865,Lisa,"stupid, selfish bart. like he's ever gonna do another nice thing for me..."
47873,Lisa,"aww, bart, i missed your lies... and i was kind of a pill. i guess."
47874,Lisa,gimme that torch.
47878,Lisa,i don't know about that -- i'm considered pretty smart.
47883,Lisa,"you look just like a buddha statue. now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity."
47886,Lisa,out of the way! i learned cpr while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
47896,Lisa,"hey, i know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. what if we..."
47899,Lisa,"let's see, the rv dealership is across the freeway on the corner of... hey, this is a flintstones fun map."
47907,Lisa,oh! the famous shelbyville theater district! can we see a play?
47919,Lisa,you toyed with my heart like it was a toy heart.
47922,Lisa,"bart, why were you in there so long?"
47925,Lisa,where are we?
47928,Lisa,milhouse?! uh! i've been turning him down for the prom since kindergarten.
47930,Lisa,you've wrecked my life! / you're gonna wreck my life!
47932,Lisa,my hamster!
47938,Lisa,"and here's the clincher... ray magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""

47945,Lisa,"attention, duped masses!"
47947,Lisa,i think he's having a heart attack!
47948,Lisa,"bart, how can you laugh at that? you just had a heart attack!"
47949,Lisa,i'd better tell dad.
47950,Lisa,um... maybe mom's the way to go.
47951,Lisa,i know how we can raise money!
47962,Lisa,i hope we didn't camp out here for nothing. it's like every kid in springfield showed up.
47966,Lisa,i can't believe i used to date him.
47970,Lisa,i'm talkin' springfield / you can buy chimichangas / talkin' springfield / the chicks have big gazongas
47974,Lisa,i'm talkin' springfield... where nobody sucks! except for flanders?
47980,Lisa,is it possible to get a green spotlight?
47981,Lisa,"no, it's fine."
47985,Lisa,but instead of singing carols / i was digging snowball's grave...
47991,Lisa,you're working with cameron now?
47995,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
47997,Lisa,so i took a stab at writing my own song. something that expresses what's really in my heart.
47998,Lisa,"bernie, if you please."
47999,Lisa,"i'm in the final two / i should be happy / but all i want to do / is spend more time with my pappy... now that you're gone, dad, i miss you so much / and your threats against teamsters and techies and such / your management style is like attila the hun / you were vicious, malicious, but you got the job done..."
48004,Lisa,now you're getting creepy.
48005,Lisa,good.
48014,Lisa,"no, ma'am."
48017,Lisa,"dad, if you'll recall, i never believed in you, not for one second."
48026,Lisa,"dad, i don't think you realize what you've done. you've totally humiliated the best friend the simpsons ever had."
48030,Lisa,cooper! more pink lemon-ale!
48032,Lisa,"guards, take him to the tower!"
48037,Lisa,"that's latin, dad. the language of plutarch."
48039,Lisa,"strange as it sounds, dad, i agree with you."
48042,Lisa,who's professor pigskin?
48048,Lisa,those reindeer look really uncomfortable.
48051,Lisa,no. i mean ketchup.
48054,Lisa,i see mom!
48059,Lisa,there's no such thing as zombies!
48061,Lisa,"bart, don't you have homework to do?"
48068,Lisa,groundskeeper willie?
48071,Lisa,but i thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs.
48073,Lisa,is it the chair?
48076,Lisa,yeah.
48077,Lisa,"okay, i'll watch tv."
48078,Lisa,"mom, i think there's a danger this time they might lose the ponderosa!"
48084,Lisa,"bye, dr. nick."
48085,Lisa,we don't go to you anymore. we have a better doctor.
48090,Lisa,"you know, you monsters seem scary, but when you get a little closer you're just funny."
48092,Lisa,my dad says they're too expensive.
48094,Lisa,"bye, guys. you really helped me a lot."
48098,Lisa,"if you two don't mind, i'd like to watch that cool fox show about teenagers in orange county."
48104,Lisa,i can read you like a book.
48106,Lisa,enough with the tricks!
48108,Lisa,"bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did."
48114,Lisa,you're just possessed by the devil.
48118,Lisa,"look! grampa's a gorilla, sideshow mel is spiderman, and nelson's a raccoon..."
48125,Lisa,"fine, there's a daddy claus."
48126,Lisa,"sure, why not."
48128,Lisa,"you know, this mass-produced junk doesn't express how i feel about dad. i am making him a present that comes from the heart."
48140,Lisa,don't make me affix it to your file.
48142,Lisa,janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. couldn't you be that kind of dad?
48144,Lisa,how did you do that?
48155,Lisa,summer opportunities.
48158,Lisa,of course i do. why would i say it if i didn't?
48162,Lisa,that's my italian tutor!
48174,Lisa,milhouse is teaching me / to speak so prettily / i'll quip so wittily / when i'm in italy...
48182,Lisa,that's a dvd of a fellini movie!
48183,Lisa,mozzarella! parmigiano! provolone! pecorino! gorgonzola! fontina! tallegio! bocconcini!
48184,Lisa,maybe there's a mechanic in this tuscan village.
48199,Lisa,sideshow bob has sworn a vendetta against us.
48202,Lisa,it's santa!
48203,Lisa,what are you doing in the chimney?
48204,Lisa,"oh, bart, why'd you ask him a follow-up question?"
48210,Lisa,'cause christmas eve is here!
48221,Lisa,our instruments are rusting!
48226,Lisa,"well maggie, i always knew it would some day boil down to just you and me. i'll look for work in the morning."
48229,Lisa,"willie? i hope i'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
48230,Lisa,don't you ever hope for anything better?
48238,Lisa,"alright, let's just try one more lesson. repeat after me: ""what flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
48240,Lisa,say it again!
48242,Lisa,where is that ghastly flow?
48246,Lisa,"that's where you're wrong, principal skinner. i did enter a project... and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!"
48247,Lisa,"mr. g. k. willington is not who he seems. in fact, he's someone you all know quite well!"
48249,Lisa,hm... maybe there's room on my sports wall.
48253,Lisa,"so, how you doin', willie?"
48261,Lisa,"sure. once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--"
48271,Lisa,i understand. i'll just read a magazine.
48273,Lisa,let's see... it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv.
48276,Lisa,"well, my best recollection of burns' paraphrasing of what he read in moe's letter is that krabappel told moe..."
48278,Lisa,how did you find this?
48279,Lisa,i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me!
48280,Lisa,"mr. burns got his plant back, and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul."
48286,Lisa,uh... sure.
48292,Lisa,"hey, i know how we can save bart."
48294,Lisa,"nelson, funny town doesn't exist."
48305,Lisa,"and i'm required to say ""come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor. yee ha."""
48314,Lisa,"grampa, i think you should give up the bullfighting."
48318,Lisa,"de nada, grampa."
48320,Lisa,hello?
48325,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, dad. you're the first man to ever outsource the american worker's sense of entitlement and privilege."
48328,Lisa,"not prostitutes, protestants."
48331,Lisa,and i will make thee a hat from construction paper!
48333,Lisa,seventy-four.
48340,Lisa,this hatchway is jammed!
48343,Lisa,i love the use of streamers as blood. it robs the violence of its power.
48349,Lisa,"but... isn't it? i mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
48358,Lisa,"mom, i don't think this will fool anybody."
48360,Lisa,i'm... jake.
48362,Lisa,"yeah, i guess i do."
48367,Lisa,did you know lisa simpson? i heard she was pretty cool.
48368,Lisa,what the hell are you talking about?!
48371,Lisa,"and because you're poor, so you don't feel like you're good enough."
48377,Lisa,i'm gonna be sick.
48383,Lisa,sure!
48401,Lisa,"bart, it's still history."
48405,Lisa,"evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact. it's even accepted by prominent conservatives, like george will and the late pope john paul!"
48411,Lisa,i have an issue i'd like to raise!
48419,Lisa,"mr. flanders, wait!"
48423,Lisa,"but, grampa, in nineteen forty-two, they only played women's baseball here."
48438,Lisa,"fat tony, it's not important what other people think of you. what matters is how you feel, inside!"
48443,Lisa,you guys need a break. why don't i take bart with me to the children's be-bop brunch at jazzy goodtime's?
48445,Lisa,"not bad for a newbie, bart! you just may be the second-best player up here. in case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
48447,Lisa,pleased to meet you.
48451,Lisa,"oh, i can't believe..."
48453,Lisa,mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
48464,Lisa,"okay, this little guy's coming home with me! who's gonna get neutered tomorrow? you are! oh, yes you are."
48468,Lisa,i'll take him too!
48473,Lisa,"no, buttercup! no!"
48484,Lisa,"bart, skinner's gonna be really mad at you."
48492,Lisa,speak.
48495,Lisa,"just write a scroll, asking him to stop."
48498,Lisa,"yeah. it was an orson welles radio play of ""war of the worlds."""
48507,Lisa,"what a deep, tormented soul..."
48512,Lisa,what you've got here is poetry!
48516,Lisa,"i don't care about my grade. i'm gonna send moe's poem to ""american poetry perspectives."""
48519,Lisa,"the wordloaf festival?! you'll meet all the great american writers, moe! you have to go!"
48538,Lisa,mom! bart's drinking coffee!
48542,Lisa,"ah c'mon bart, the party will be fun. nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness."
48546,Lisa,"dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?"
48560,Lisa,what i want can't be bought at any store.
48575,Lisa,ta-da!
48576,Lisa,ugh. this is the most disgusting place we've ever gone.
48584,Lisa,bart!
48596,Lisa,"milhouse, thanks to you, the nerds can breathe easy. except the ones with asthma. which is all of them. but still, it's great."
48599,Lisa,"there are no small parts, just small actors."
48601,Lisa,i see. while it would be an honor to be your queen...
48606,Lisa,i've got to give a presentation about our family's heritage. but ours is so boring!
48608,Lisa,"""my great-great, great-great great grandmother was a native american. she was a member of the..."""
48610,Lisa,"you're right. i'll just need to find ""traditional garb""..."
48624,Lisa,i'll be good.
48626,Lisa,"eating mock buffalo steaks made from peaceful turnip roots, uh, they... environment... umm, dignity... corn god... i'm sorry, i can't do this!"
48632,Lisa,what kind of lunch is this? a drawing of a sandwich?
48641,Lisa,my name's lisa. what are your names?
48642,Lisa,and that's how a presidential veto gets overridden. any questions?
48645,Lisa,mistos and lattes and grandes and ventis / browsing at bookstores with fat cognoscentis!
48648,Lisa,"mrs. skin-ner is ""mame""!"
48656,Lisa,'tweren't nothin'.
48666,Lisa,"dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!"
48672,Lisa,"dad, you're out of shape even for an american."
48680,Lisa,it's eleven at night and i can't get to sleep!
48689,Lisa,"i fell in love with the game when i saw ""bend it like beckham."""
48694,Lisa,"you don't even know the rules! this could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!"
48697,Lisa,"um, uh..."
48701,Lisa,"but, but..."
48705,Lisa,no.
48707,Lisa,"you were right to kick me out of that game. soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of europe and south america."
48709,Lisa,do you want to play a little?
48714,Lisa,"he died, bart. dad buried him in the back yard. but not in that order."
48719,Lisa,"bart, stop! no one's mad at you anymore! right?"
48720,Lisa,can't we?
48722,Lisa,i think maybe we cou-ould.
48726,Lisa,i can't -- i won't!
48727,Lisa,make her stop!
48729,Lisa,i've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken ambien -- i mean nappien.
48755,Lisa,look what the bullies could have stolen...
48756,Lisa,big chief rotten cheeks chewing tobacco...a take-a-penny tray with a quarter in it!
48758,Lisa,i've lost milhouse.
48772,Lisa,"dad, that's a bomb!"
48780,Lisa,"oh bart, you fall for that every six months."
48794,Lisa,i guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
48797,Lisa,"hi, dad."
48804,Lisa,"i just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
48807,Lisa,we crashed a funeral!
48808,Lisa,we should get out of here. come on.
48809,Lisa,it is! tenor andrea bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
48821,Lisa,there must be a website that can help you deal with a clingy baby.
48822,Lisa,"click that one, mom. / no, go up! / keep going, up, up, up! / the blue ones are ads! / that's the toolbar! / now you've opened ""word!"" close it. / close it, don't save it! / stop clicking! / don't go there! / why are you buying a freezer?!"
48832,Lisa,"mom, i think there's something you're trying to avoid. or someone."
48835,Lisa,ice cream! ice cream! / dad's the best!
48836,Lisa,"oh my god, an alien! i'm gonna blow rachel goodman away at show-and-tell!"
48847,Lisa,i warned ya. and yet my punishment is no less severe. that's odd.
48848,Lisa,"oh, that's great."
48850,Lisa,spider burps!
48852,Lisa,that's not the milhouse i know.
48856,Lisa,"bart, bart, bart. you're worried you're losing milhouse. and love is a selfish thing."
48861,Lisa,asterix! tintin! i heard these only existed in high school french classes.
48864,Lisa,"alan moore, art spiegelman... oh, dan clowes!"
48870,Lisa,"and dad, i hope you learned something from this."
48876,Lisa,"yummy, yumma!"
48878,Lisa,we're going to a rest'rant grand op'niiiiiiiing... / but don't fill up on bread!
48881,Lisa,that commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here!
48885,Lisa,which one?
48887,Lisa,"macbeth, act one, scene seven. look it up!"
48897,Lisa,...his father could take that opportunity to inject bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
48899,Lisa,stop that cremation!
48900,Lisa,i grew suspicious when i saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet.
48901,Lisa,why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
48904,Lisa,i think it's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe. i feel like a pundit in a think tank!
48910,Lisa,and ralph is only eight years old! it says in the constitution you have to be thirty-five.
48911,Lisa,"leave him alone, you vultures!"
48915,Lisa,maybe you wouldn't be such a bad president.
48916,Lisa,i like the sound of that.
48918,Lisa,"mom, i didn't know you went to college!"
48925,Lisa,"bart, no, it's valentine's day."
48932,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
48937,Lisa,see that hippo rolling in dung? you're the dung.
48946,Lisa,"grab onto this! c'mon, wake up!"
48947,Lisa,bart! you can't just run away from this!
48952,Lisa,"uh... let's think about this. martin's gone, but it was an accident. ruining our lives won't bring him back."
48959,Lisa,idiot!
48962,Lisa,act like you're shopping! we can't be seen together.
48975,Lisa,it's a tape. martin must've set it to go off when the chrysalises hatched.
48983,Lisa,"i'm just glad it was you who brought us in, nelson. remember when we used to date? if you let me go, we can get back together. i never let you cherry bomb my malibu stacey -- i'll let you do it now."
48985,Lisa,"the last book in the series goes on sale at midnight, and we're gonna go stand in line."
48987,Lisa,"angelica's first kiss, da, da, da... subplot about her cat, who cares?... professor skizzletwitch is a were-bear... and, uh, no, no he's not... maluicious krubb is actually kraluicious mubb!"
49000,Lisa,"uh, i don't know i--"
49009,Lisa,i thought they were cancer sticks.
49011,Lisa,my feminist heroes!
49025,Lisa,ballet is unnatural and unfair to women. i shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!
49028,Lisa,you can just drop me off here.
49033,Lisa,"sir, i didn't get this ""skepticism"" merit badge falling for promises like that."
49036,Lisa,"i've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes."
49038,Lisa,double ew!
49041,Lisa,what lap?
49049,Lisa,what you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
49052,Lisa,come on.
49063,Lisa,"bart, i'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. in the meantime, just say yes, so lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
49064,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's marrying one of cletus' daughters!
49072,Lisa,there's drama and inspiration everywhere i look.
49083,Lisa,"my family. ...language, rhythm and spectacle."
49085,Lisa,"um, okay."
49090,Lisa,and... let's roll.
49100,Lisa,i didn't mean it like that! a lot of things got changed in the editing room.
49106,Lisa,that doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
49114,Lisa,"mom, you tricked us!"
49125,Lisa,"wow, dad was so cute as a baby."
49126,Lisa,"grandma, i accept your gift."
49127,Lisa,"it's not really avenging her, dad. just the fulfillment of her last wish."
49132,Lisa,but she'll live on forever in what you did today.
49134,Lisa,that's not fair -- bart was great.
49139,Lisa,so do a global change?
49140,Lisa,i'll never last here.
5,Bart,maybe i'll just take a taxi.
8197,Bart,we're in the middle of the desert...
10,Bart,don't you mean tentacles?
8204,Bart,/
13,Bart,"man, back on earth we don't have so many moons."
8209,Bart,twinkle twinkle little star / how i wonder what you are /
8212,Bart,mine has a cup holder!
25,Bart,eat my shorts! / aye carumba!
26,Bart,victory party under the slide!
27,Bart,"hey, thanks for your vote, man."
29,Bart,"well, don't sweat it. just so long as a couple of people did... right, milhouse?"
8221,Bart,"years ago, stanley degroot was a cook here at the school..."
32,Bart,uh oh.
8225,Bart,they hanged him for murder and buried him in an unmarked grave. when they came back the next day... the whole cemetery was missing.
40,Bart,"hey! thanks, monkey-man."
41,Bart,"yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
8237,Bart,you can't make that stuff up!
8238,Bart,that this is one terrible county fair.
48,Bart,i understand why. you were wasted.
49,Bart,"dad, i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will."
50,Bart,now you wanna go?
8240,Bart,"and then i had this dream that my whole family was just cartoon characters, and that our success had led to some crazy propaganda network called ""fox news""."
52,Bart,what do you need a babysitter for? i'm almost ten and a half.
8242,Bart,huh? but we were doing such good work.
8243,Bart,i think i just got dumped.
55,Bart,"after the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a krusty burger and head for the arcade."
56,Bart,"lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? but right now my gut's telling me... bleed gramps dry."
57,Bart,check.
8245,Bart,"i saw you yesterday in the dining room, and i didn't know if i should say ""hi"" or not."
8247,Bart,"...and i wasn't planned, so when i came, my parents had to get married. and they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. maybe... i act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other!"
8258,Bart,"no way, this is our rec room!"
69,Bart,"you're great at a party, lisa. really great."
8263,Bart,uh... the name of the company is...
74,Bart,i'll never trust another old person.
75,Bart,wow! number nine! that's before fallout boy became his ward.
81,Bart,this looks like a discount for...
87,Bart,cool!
8297,Bart,where's all my stuff?!
107,Bart,no.
109,Bart,no.
8301,Bart,it's five in the afternoon!
8304,Bart,wanna go slam a few beers?
114,Bart,no.
8308,Bart,i hogged it! i hogged it!
8310,Bart,each cheek is a god to you!
8311,Bart,now for the defining moment of my life...
8312,Bart,"thanks, chief."
123,Bart,empty bottles... empty bottles...
8316,Bart,"laboot, laboot. sounds familiar."
129,Bart,all those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
8324,Bart,and someone used our videotapes as dominoes!
134,Bart,beat it.
8326,Bart,"why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy's dream: a fat, suggestible zombie dad."
8330,Bart,"c'mon, just one more."
139,Bart,"no, thanks. who's that?"
142,Bart,"ugh, i think i'd rather just get to work, ma'am."
8335,Bart,yes'm.
8336,Bart,really?
8339,Bart,that was never my plan.
150,Bart,"i'll sludge you, you old bat."
8346,Bart,"good boy! now, transform!"
156,Bart,two quarters!
8348,Bart,"okay, since the dog's not here, i'm gonna take you for a walk."
160,Bart,really?
8353,Bart,"mom, you can't send him away! he's a dog, not grampa!"
163,Bart,"wait a minute, martin. if you, milhouse and i went in together, we could buy a copy of ""radioactive man no. 1"" right now!"
8356,Bart,my god. i've lost him.
165,Bart,"wow! breathe it in, boys!"
8357,Bart,"i don't want a new dog. i want my old dog, the one who bit me."
8359,Bart,he is so awesome. i already love him more than i love lisa.
168,Bart,now you know better.
8364,Bart,"aw man, it's like some chemicals cut one."
8365,Bart,"strangles, you came to save me!"
174,Bart,yeah! what about zero?
181,Bart,"sweet dreams, boys."
183,Bart,"yeah, right, so do i, but you don't see me gettin' up."
185,Bart,"hmp, impressive."
190,Bart,the hell i can't!
198,Bart,and?
200,Bart,is it a bible story?
203,Bart,"whoa, otto-man! you work here?"
8395,Bart,dentist?! you said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!
8398,Bart,"let's see... according to your charts, you're due for your annual throat scraping."
8400,Bart,now rinse...
214,Bart,"yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
8408,Bart,"dad, you barely go to work at all."
219,Bart,wow! a crowbar!
8414,Bart,"yay, dad!"
225,Bart,"well, what do you know? i'm relieved."
227,Bart,lisa did it.
241,Bart,"hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. you got it, sis."
243,Bart,"i'm bart simpson, who the hell are you?"
8435,Bart,you just bought another freezer!
8437,Bart,awesome! how's he getting around?
246,Bart,"aw, come on. if you're really michael jackson, who were your last four dates for the grammys?"
8440,Bart,"shut the hell up, you damn ass whore."
8441,Bart,uh-oh.
251,Bart,poor house.
256,Bart,"hello, milhouse? can you keep a secret?"
257,Bart,"oh well, who cares. michael jackson is coming to my house!"
258,Bart,aye carumba!
8457,Bart,look!
8467,Bart,whoa! they turned the church into a haunted house!
8468,Bart,sin gets us something? awesome!
8469,Bart,he died as he lived -- like a dork.
278,Bart,yeah!
279,Bart,"hey, michael. what happened to your voice?"
8470,Bart,is it that you're brother and sister? because you really look a lot alike.
8474,Bart,but why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
8476,Bart,only one way to find out.
8478,Bart,hey who died?
8479,Bart,so you guys aren't ice cream men?
8480,Bart,"this'll cheer you up. i'll let you kill me in ""bar brawl four: final fracas""."
289,Bart,"no thank you, i'd rather push this button."
8485,Bart,anyone want to sit over here? you can have my pizza crust.
294,Bart,nothing.
296,Bart,good morning. this is your wake-up call.
8488,Bart,check it out! this image has not been sped up.
305,Bart,cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool...
8498,Bart,would you be my uncle?
8500,Bart,and that takes care of that.
8502,Bart,"oh, for cryin' out loud."
311,Bart,"yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
8503,Bart,"lis, i don't get it. why does milhouse's happiness make me sad?"
8505,Bart,"oh yeah? well when you're mean, i'm a trampoline, so everything you said goes back and hits your ugly head."
8507,Bart,"wait, milhouse! don't go! you're my best friend."
316,Bart,paying money to read books... the hell with this.
317,Bart,"come on, touch of death. touch of death. touch of death."
318,Bart,"uh, i learned the touch of death."
319,Bart,"permit me to demonstrate. lisa, shut your eyes. soon you will be at peace."
320,Bart,uh-oh. gotta get back to karate class.
8510,Bart,still sucks!
326,Bart,"sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old daddly-doodly."
8518,Bart,...but let's see what you know about super-heroes.
8522,Bart,"alan moore, you wrote my favorite issues of radioactive man!"
331,Bart,good mornin' world!
332,Bart,ow!
8523,Bart,i don't read the words. i just like when he punches people. how do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
8525,Bart,you had your hot dog plumped?
8528,Bart,lemme at it!
338,Bart,... lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...
341,Bart,wait! wait!

357,Bart,don't have a cow.
358,Bart,cool!
359,Bart,i don't know.
8558,Bart,"yeah, what happened while i was chillin' in dad's junk?"
368,Bart,"thanks... uh... say, are you guys crooks?"
8560,Bart,the nineties? never heard of it.
374,Bart,"those fingers through my hair / that sly come hither stare / that strips my conscience bare / it's witchcraft - gimme three fingers of milk, ma."
375,Bart,"more ""stink lines"" boys."
8584,Bart,this almost makes me want to find out how magnets work.
393,Bart,"aw milhouse, just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present."
400,Bart,"my best friend shafted me. i'll never get over this, otto-man."
8592,Bart,"gentlemen, this is an ostrich egg."
402,Bart,"now we're even for your party. c'mon, let's go play."
8595,Bart,"milhouse, bust out four of our finest juice boxes."
8603,Bart,where am i?
414,Bart,i don't wanna play with milhouse.
418,Bart,"hey mom, i'm friends with milhouse again."
8611,Bart,"normally, you can't even buy these. you have to buy the ostrich and wait."
8612,Bart,the whole insides.
421,Bart,i will.
8613,Bart,"my pleasure, sir."
8622,Bart,a funny thing happens when you mix mentos with diet coke...
8623,Bart,and it's all gonna go down in skinner's office.
8631,Bart,"oh man, not again."
440,Bart,"krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
441,Bart,"yeah, i've got a lot of fond memories."
442,Bart,"goodnight, krusty. sorry about your dad."
8635,Bart,"cool, the strong kicking the weak's butt."
444,Bart,"oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy."
446,Bart,we've got to do something.
450,Bart,we'll put them on later. now can you give us the rabbi's address?
455,Bart,"don't worry, lis. i've got a plan that can't fail."
8650,Bart,"i've been in trouble, but never like this. guess i'll go turn myself in."
8652,Bart,"usually when i do something bad, i feel good. but not this time. martin was like jesus -- only real!"
462,Bart,those stupid hats?
468,Bart,"is it not written in the talmud, ""who will bring redemption? the jesters."""
8660,Bart,"dad, look! raccoons!"
8662,Bart,calm down!
471,Bart,nope.
472,Bart,nope.
8666,Bart,cool!
8669,Bart,"wait in line for a book? you tell 'em bart says ""hey""."

8673,Bart,it's lisa kudrow.
483,Bart,"okay, no more fooling around. paw, this is bart. i wish for the simpsons to be rich and famous."
8676,Bart,dad... marinating with you is cool.

946,Bart,"we were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
9146,Bart,we should be safe from milhouse here. being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.

9170,Bart,i'unno.
9174,Bart,do you want me to watch and learn?
9175,Bart,no! stop the hovering!
986,Bart,"we're all gonna die, lis."
9181,Bart,"not to worry, at this school, we've got a clean slate. in fact, i'm establishing my cred right now."
990,Bart,"see, i told you krusty would come. just like i said, heh, heh. he's gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies."

1026,Bart,was it scary?
1030,Bart,"and later i'll teach you the tricks of the trade: taping your swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding ."
9223,Bart,"well, that's better than me. but still, you've gotta get out."
9226,Bart,bookstores don't have answers. they just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
1038,Bart,and now for your triumphant walk down the runway.
9232,Bart,cut it out. you're not a teacher anymore.
1041,Bart,"hey, i'm starting to think i can win."
1042,Bart,"lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing i've ever had to say. you're not ugly."
1044,Bart,that doesn't look like her body.
1045,Bart,"thanks, grampa."
9238,Bart,eh? eh? eh?
9239,Bart,"nothing, nothing."

1078,Bart,"yeah, right. like you're gonna let me go hungry. i'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
9276,Bart,"mom, that's a beautiful thought."
9278,Bart,i don't know when we'll be in a septagon again. wanna settle this bad blood that's been going on between us since you were born?
1087,Bart,wow.
9283,Bart,"if i say ""crisscross"" one more time, will that change your mind?"
9284,Bart,crisscross!
9285,Bart,yep. i'm at the tennis match.
9289,Bart,"yeah, 'cause you're smart. you don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" like mom and dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""
1099,Bart,"hey, where is she?"
1101,Bart,"dad, you gotta let me see that movie. can't you just give me a spanking?"
1102,Bart,"come on, go nuts."

9313,Bart,"okay, buddy. lower the eyebrows. nice and easy."
1122,Bart,cool!
1132,Bart,"well, i'm not sure i'm over it. shove it, witch."

1165,Bart,you're not my grampa.
1170,Bart,"dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
9363,Bart,you're right -- i can't risk another girl. use whatever birth control you want. it's your body.
9364,Bart,"one boy to go, please. easy on the freckles."
9366,Bart,"c'mon, i'd be an awesome big brother! i've got videogames! a treehouse! a garage stuffed to the rafters with illegal fireworks!"

1578,Bart,"otto, you gotta do something! there's a gremlin on the side of the bus!"
1580,Bart,"no! no, it's true! there's a monster on the bus."
1582,Bart,the gremlin's taking off the wheel! stop the bus or we're all gonna die!
9779,Bart,"here's my uniform, since i won't be needing it any more!"
1590,Bart,"lisa, burns isn't a vampire. and even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place."
9784,Bart,are you taking me to the dentist?
1593,Bart,"nyung, nyung, nyung nyung."
9785,Bart,"y'know mom, after only seven hours in this amusement park, i'm finally enjoying myself. i'm actually starting to forget about..."
9788,Bart,did someone order a happy ending?
9789,Bart,i'm stealing home!
9790,Bart,did i make it?
9791,Bart,i guess your computer was right.
9792,Bart,"and according to my gut, you're okay too."
1602,Bart,"don't worry. you'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, homina..."

1633,Bart,"lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?"
1635,Bart,what's the answer?
1637,Bart,skateboards? you copycat wannabes.
1638,Bart,ow!
1643,Bart,"oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?"
9836,Bart,what does your note say?
9841,Bart,milhouse couldn't beat me up.
1651,Bart,"new york is that-a-way, man."
9844,Bart,how do i do that?
1656,Bart,"okay look, i made a terrible mistake. i wandered into a junior camper recruitment center. but what's done is done. i've made my bed and now i've got to weasel out of it."
9850,Bart,"you really care, man. a lot of bullies just phone it in. kearney."

9866,Bart,"ask about the safe. no, better yet, act like you know about the safe."
9868,Bart,he's crawling on your arm.
1677,Bart,"oh, no. me bring homer on a rafting trip?"
1679,Bart,"look, homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. then it'll be his fault."
9874,Bart,that coop looks a little flimsy.
1683,Bart,stop it! / stop it! / dad!
9875,Bart,"now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here."
1688,Bart,"dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence."
9880,Bart,as long as it means we're not learning.
9881,Bart,what about the detroit lions?
1691,Bart,the beauty of it is each parking space is a mere one foot narrower. indistinguishable to the naked eye. but therein lies the game.
1692,Bart,god bless america.
9903,Bart,i wanted them till i got them! but this year i'm gettin' my dirt bike.
1712,Bart,the burglar even took my stamp collection.
9905,Bart,"bowl full of jelly, pump lead in his belly..."
1714,Bart,wow. it's a crime wave.
9910,Bart,"whatever you say. um, look, how do i get to santa?"
9911,Bart,isn't this the busy season? where is everybody?
1720,Bart,"we're having a field trip today. ah, lis, won't it be great to cast off the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is springfield elementary? oh, i'm sorry, i forgot. your class isn't going."
9914,Bart,just point me to santa.
1725,Bart,have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
9917,Bart,"no disrespect, fat man, but you'd better poop out a dirt bike."
9918,Bart,"listen here, kringle. i may have been naughty this year. but by today's standards, naughty's nothing. i didn't get anybody pregnant, i didn't facebook a kid to death... make with my dirt bike!"
9920,Bart,you win.
9921,Bart,you don't have to do that. i have socks. i'll give you socks!

9930,Bart,i don't even want to smell sparkling apple juice again.
1741,Bart,cool!
9937,Bart,"we're simpsons, dad. we don't do good behavior."
1746,Bart,"dad, i'm asking if i can get a job."
1748,Bart,"i'm telling ya, i do work on the krusty show. look at the credits."
1749,Bart,there's my name. right there. bart simpson.
9940,Bart,that's it! we challenge you to a rumble.
9946,Bart,where'd you get that scar?
1758,Bart,i didn't do it.

9954,Bart,awesome! i'll get the white wine.

9962,Bart,"you're not the chicken, i'm the chicken!"
9968,Bart,"all right, comic book guy, tell me my origin story."
1777,Bart,woozle wozzle.
1779,Bart,finished?
9971,Bart,are you willing to take that chance?
1781,Bart,"thanks, mom."
9973,Bart,"i go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy."
1785,Bart,i got out of school because i told them i was mangled in a car wreck.
9981,Bart,"i see how it is. you get a booty call and i get a cootie call. well, it's gonna cost ya."
1796,Bart,wow! did you actually get to see the rod?
1798,Bart,"wow! my father, an astronaut! i feel so full of... what's the opposite of shame?"
1806,Bart,hey.
1815,Bart,"gotcha. well, gotta go."
1819,Bart,kbbl is gonna give me something stupid!
10013,Bart,"...so i'm offering to trade your country nuclear secrets for a mini-bike. concludingly yours, bart simpson."
1824,Bart,"well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, marty. but i think i'm gonna have to go with the elephant."
1825,Bart,i want the elephant.
10017,Bart,"dad, i was thinking about it and... you're right. you shouldn't buy me something i didn't earn. and because you gave me the tough love i didn't know i needed, i'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you."
1830,Bart,where's my elephant!
1831,Bart,where's my elephant!
10023,Bart,no! why in the world would you get me this?
10029,Bart,"you know, dad, i really did have a good time hanging out with you."
1840,Bart,"thanks, bud. 'preciate it."
10037,Bart,i don't think i want to.
10039,Bart,"all right, i know there's a camera in you somewhere."
1848,Bart,"don't worry, stampy. i won't let homer sell you to that ivory dealer."
1853,Bart,stampy!
10046,Bart,"that's ""angry dad""! the semi-autobiographical web cartoon i created!"
1855,Bart,"dad, i can't let you sell him. stampy and i are friends."
10048,Bart,"thanks for letting me make this movie, mr. millwood! i've always loved cartoons, going way back to the real early spongebobs."
1859,Bart,"thanks, dad."
1862,Bart,"no, stampy. no!"
1863,Bart,"ah, thanks, boy."
10056,Bart,"i don't know who that is, but i'm convinced. let's start cutting."
1865,Bart,"atta boy, stampy. butt 'em once for me!"
10059,Bart,my category comes up pretty soon. i'm home free as long as this oscar show is tight and fast-paced.
1869,Bart,ow!
1870,Bart,huh?
1871,Bart,that explains his mysterious trip to holland.
1873,Bart,all right.
10065,Bart,"homer? well, i don't know. l.a.'s a world-class city with a lot to offer. he's probably enjoying the sights..."
10066,Bart,"conductor, get ready to play my song!"
10067,Bart,yes!
10069,Bart,"this whole thing is silly. i mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?"
1880,Bart,mr. burns throws peas at smithers.
1881,Bart,"oh yuck, meatloaf! my most hated of all loafs."
10085,Bart,"no, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!"
1894,Bart,it's a little tight.
1895,Bart,excellent.
10088,Bart,who the hell are cheech and chong?
10091,Bart,ay carumba!
10092,Bart,"i met the new principal, mr. baumgartner. he seemed really cool. when he walked through the gym, he shot a basket!"
1901,Bart,i love you guys.
1902,Bart,they're gonna eat this up at show and tell.
1912,Bart,"yeah, i guess it is guilt."
1913,Bart,"well, yeah, but --"
10105,Bart,fine.
1916,Bart,"um, it's, it's a lot of fun."
10109,Bart,fill the board then wash my car.
1918,Bart,"uh, no."
1919,Bart,"uh, i'm kinda busy on saturday."
10111,Bart,you think you're better than the great simpsini?!
10113,Bart,"what're you gonna do, write a book about me?"
1927,Bart,"if there was some way to get rid of flanders, would you want to come back?"
10119,Bart,you think you're so pretty? where's my lotto ticket?!
1932,Bart,"here's the plan. once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire ned on the spot."
1933,Bart,no problem-o. just make a pass at your commanding officer.
10125,Bart,three steps right...
1937,Bart,how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this?
1938,Bart,"a prison bus, otto?"
10134,Bart,"y'know, i was skeptical, but i guess therapy works."
10137,Bart,how many verses does this song have?
10138,Bart,"i forget what phase two is, but i'll assume we just dump the peaches like we discussed."
10141,Bart,what idiot put the dump so far away from where people live?
1950,Bart,let's see him track me now.
1952,Bart,i'm one of your nephews you don't see very often. bart-bart.
10145,Bart,aye ca-rum-ba.
1954,Bart,"wow! this is the biggest rice krispy square i've ever seen. boy, the rich sure know how to live."
10150,Bart,all that's left is banana runts! that's the worst runt!
10154,Bart,hey -- you licked the back! that was my side!
10157,Bart,only you can make tree poop boring.
10158,Bart,you're lookin' at him.
1971,Bart,what if i can get this guy off the hook. sh-should i do it?
1972,Bart,"well, i was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened..."
10169,Bart,truffle's in your room? i thought you'd been selling them!
10172,Bart,"vegetarian food is so boring! pasta, soy... you know what's a bad pizza topping? broccoli!"
10178,Bart,i'm really sorry it wasn't a year.
1987,Bart,go away!
1988,Bart,thanks.
10183,Bart,isn't this the greatest day ever?!
10185,Bart,"what's wrong, man?"
10186,Bart,"hey lis, those books aren't gonna pick themselves up."
1996,Bart,this gun is filled with ketchup. this one with mustard. now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you're gonna be a mess for your date.
2000,Bart,"oh well, he's happy. i'm gonna keep this mary worth phone right here. her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again."
10194,Bart,that's the key to my box with the real skull.
2004,Bart,"well, me and milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer."
10198,Bart,what the? i tried to do bad and i did good!
2007,Bart,"wow, i've never seen mom so mad at homer before."
2010,Bart,"oh, sorry. here's a fresh one."
10203,Bart,"crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... i know who'd have some answers. someone who's been here a long, long time."
2015,Bart,"friends and well-wishers, yes."
10207,Bart,original or three-sixty?
10212,Bart,no one cancels my free play!
10213,Bart,"sorry, man."
2023,Bart,"faithful milhouse. you'll spend the long, hot days by my side, won't you?"
2028,Bart,"you know, this isn't so bad. i'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called television."
2031,Bart,don't turn on that light!!
10225,Bart,now follow me!
10230,Bart,but... what if my dog eats it?
2039,Bart,i'm never ever gonna see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk.
10236,Bart,"no, i..."
2052,Bart,"of course. oh no. he's back. flanders is back! lisa, get outta there!"
10244,Bart,if i told you i'd have to kill you. can i tell ya?
2060,Bart,but i distinctly heard you say that maude was with god.
10253,Bart,"and one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!"
2068,Bart,oh!
2070,Bart,"homer, that was downright decent of you."
10269,Bart,chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
2079,Bart,"yep, she's clean as a bean. but, i did tip off the feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend, milhouse."
10271,Bart,my desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
10273,Bart,"well, what would teddy roosevelt do?"
10274,Bart,i call this meeting of the brotherhood of the spectacles to order. our mission: to get chalmers back his job.
10275,Bart,i'm thinking of something big. so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back!
2093,Bart,"you mean ""shining."""
2094,Bart,it's a new episode.
10289,Bart,ay carumba!
10291,Bart,one or two?
10303,Bart,"jeez, i put a lot of time in this. back to the drawing board."
2116,Bart,ow!
2119,Bart,"wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."
2120,Bart,"look at all this great stuff, lis. cool, personalized plates."
10314,Bart,"baby seal, huh?"
10316,Bart,check it out.
2125,Bart,"so, mr. itchy. you think you're god's gift to women, do ya?"
2130,Bart,i'll get more cameras!
2131,Bart,"smashie, smashie."
2132,Bart,sideshow bob! i'm only ten and i already got two mortal enemies.
10324,Bart,"games don't have lives or points anymore, dad."
10326,Bart,colon smash! / rectum kill!
10335,Bart,we're not a gang! gangs are cool!
10339,Bart,so grab a pancake and slurp some slop!
2149,Bart,"yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading archie comics."
10342,Bart,and then brag about it on the internet!
2154,Bart,oh my god! the dead have risen and they're voting republican!
10346,Bart,relax -- dad will be the life of the party. he'll be the fourth mouth-keteer.
2156,Bart,you were just barlow's lackey!
2157,Bart,sonny to his cher!
2158,Bart,we want the truth!
10347,Bart,where's dad?
10348,Bart,a hundred pork chops!
2161,Bart,"hey, i found a short cut through your hedgemaze."
10350,Bart,fun mom! fun mom! fun mom!
10351,Bart,how is that the lesson? the point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. so we should party hard and wreck the place.
10357,Bart,"chapter-book crowd? that's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?"
10363,Bart,"our crew needs you, bouvier. you've read enough fantasy novels to choke a hippogriff!"
10364,Bart,all we need now is a computer guy...
2173,Bart,but mom!
10365,Bart,"i keep going over the job from every angle, but i can't shake the feeling that we're missing something."
10369,Bart,"a troll, that's it! our book could be about an orphan troll!"
2178,Bart,"throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
10371,Bart,"it's good. ""weekly reader star selection"" good."
2183,Bart,i've never felt this way about a girl before. my long search is finally over.
2184,Bart,hi. i'm bart simpson. i was incredibly moved by your reading. i don't think god's words have ever sounded so plausible.
10375,Bart,fake author?
2186,Bart,"yes ma'am. i'd like to return to your wonderful sunday school, please."
10379,Bart,"rule number one of book heists: ""never fall in love with the book."" we queer the deal -- we lose the money!"
2188,Bart,"you know, the great thing about sunday school is we're finally learning something we can use."
2190,Bart,must... fight... satan. make it... up to him... later.
10383,Bart,the central computer is through here. all we have to do is upload our file and--
10387,Bart,is there any better feeling than waiting for a live krusty show to start?
2202,Bart,"but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
2213,Bart,"um, actually, i was hoping i could sit down for just a second."
2218,Bart,"oh, the glue will slow me down."
2219,Bart,nothin's ever gonna stop me.
10411,Bart,who's fatso flanagan?
2221,Bart,"uh, we should get to class."
10413,Bart,i like the early closing time.
10414,Bart,"well, people also love a quitter... sarah palin... the beatles..."
10416,Bart,"they're pretty funny. once i used one on milhouse. he was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out."
2228,Bart,"oh lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song."
2240,Bart,"you know, with the way you're treating me, why should i protect you?"
2242,Bart,yeah. this is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
2243,Bart,"give it up, lis. she's a criminal mastermind. she's got a 108 iq, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red fruit loops."
10436,Bart,withdrawn.
2246,Bart,"i just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, i really learned a lot... i'm a little wiser and a little less na√Øve."
10440,Bart,"helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
2250,Bart,"ah, action news, the last place an impressionable kid can go for tv violence."
10442,Bart,i just un-friended skinner!
10446,Bart,that's even sadder than being friends with milhouse!
2256,Bart,i'm saved! i love being a s-s-s-simpson!
10452,Bart,"c'mon, man. at least listen to what i have to say."
10458,Bart,"milhouse, you're the closest thing i have to a brother. a brother with the wisdom of an older sister. and that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. but in the end, they're still a family. what do you say... brother?"
10461,Bart,"c'mon, man. a few more balloons and this'll look really awesome."
10462,Bart,milhouse.
2273,Bart,mr. honeybunny!
10466,Bart,ay carumba!
10467,Bart,from now on i'll dominate you... in ways you don't realize.
2280,Bart,"you go, mom. for the greater good."
2281,Bart,"good luck tonight, sis. i'll try not to hurt you."
2285,Bart,damn fda. why can't it all be marshmallow?
10479,Bart,okay. that was the last school myth and it's officially... cracked.
10482,Bart,"milhouse, i've just figured out a way to make school cool again."
2293,Bart,"hey lis, i found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
10485,Bart,"gentlemen, we just created a myth."
10488,Bart,yeah! i could sneak into the school and write whatever i want on the chalkboard!
2301,Bart,there's a u.f.o. outside my window!! seriously!
2308,Bart,"listen to this. ""unexplainable behavior. individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with ufos, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions."""
10500,Bart,"come on, man, we wouldn't leave you behind."
10503,Bart,"open mine! quick, before it suffocates!"
10512,Bart,there. finished.
10514,Bart,you're in.
2328,Bart,"hi, dad."
2333,Bart,"same old space, huh, dad?"
2334,Bart,every week there's a canal.
2341,Bart,"been there, done that."
10535,Bart,i wanna show you i understand how you feel. and they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
10541,Bart,"as a graffiti artist, there're so many people to thank... people who build walls... nighttime, for being dark..."
2350,Bart,"empty my pockets you say? well, certainly, but i fail to see how..."
2354,Bart,still dark. better use the generator.
2355,Bart,is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
2356,Bart,why don't they look anything like their names?
10548,Bart,"isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?"
10556,Bart,pathetic. a kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
2365,Bart,"but then, you've always been proud of me."
2366,Bart,uh... i guess so.
10557,Bart,"company physical coming up, huh?"
10562,Bart,amen.
10564,Bart,that movie's for babies.
2373,Bart,"hey, shut up."
2374,Bart,"dad, the plan!"
10566,Bart,get that stuff off!
10567,Bart,now!
10569,Bart,"listen lady, you do not two-time the man with the skull t-shirt."
2378,Bart,"it's a cow, man."
2379,Bart,cool!
10579,Bart,isn't that what used to be the beanie baby store?
10581,Bart,"hey, the first time we lost maggie was in this store."
10585,Bart,i'm just not ready for cookies!
10587,Bart,"listen... i could get wedgied for this, but jimbo's a jerk. you can do better."
2396,Bart,"hello, southern hemisphere? which way does the water go in your toilet?"
10589,Bart,it's not fair! you know that's hilarious!
2398,Bart,i can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!
10592,Bart,"oh, it's you."
2403,Bart,"indeed. we need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going. and, please -- stand clear!"
10597,Bart,"man, they have every entrance covered. you'd have to be a navy seal to get in or out."
2406,Bart,huh?
10598,Bart,what are you doing here?
10603,Bart,"sorry kid, but there comes a day when that just doesn't do anything anymore."
10604,Bart,"want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!"
2414,Bart,"i don't think so. you're all the way in australia. hey, i think i hear a dingo eatin' your baby."
2417,Bart,"hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... i'm being indicted for fraud in australia."
10612,Bart,mooooom! daaaaaad!
2428,Bart,"i get it, dad."
10622,Bart,i knew it. it was all a dream.
10624,Bart,"whoa, a ""fun schedule!"" there's so much to do! ""laser-tag"", ""waterslide bobsled"" oh! ""ice cream snowball fight"" starts in five minutes!"
2436,Bart,and this is for the united states of america.
10630,Bart,why can't vacation last forever?!! i've got to do something.
2442,Bart,s'allright?
10636,Bart,"hey guys! can you believe how awesome this is? if it wasn't for this virus thing, we'd all be back at our old sucky lives -- instead you're here, where you can be lovey-dovey all the time! come on, kiss! kiss!"
10638,Bart,can't anybody enjoy their forever vacation!?
10643,Bart,that was just treat williams in a virus movie.
2452,Bart,"wait! joy of movement increasing... love of dance, impossible to resist... toes twinkling... look at me, girls. i'm doing ballet...and i love it!"
10645,Bart,"that's fair. sorry. i deserve it. ow, that one really hurt!"
2455,Bart,"no, i fear the girls will laugh at me. i fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me."
10650,Bart,but the slide's just like our cruise! a short awesome thing that just shows you how boring the rest of your life is!
2462,Bart,why did she just leave me here when i clearly need medical attention?
2464,Bart,maps to movie stars homes! mapa por las casas de las cineastas! top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
2465,Bart,"i may be just a boy, but i have an idea. if i may, i'd like to show you a few slides."
2466,Bart,here's springfield as it appears from space. somewhere in this windy valley is the lost dutchman's mine.
2469,Bart,"hello, i'm bart simpson. in the past, i've brought you such classic films as ""homer in the shower,"" and ""homer on the toilet."" and now, i give you... ""the eternal struggle."""
2471,Bart,"hey man, i really love your show. i think all kids should watch it. i suddenly feel so dirty."
2472,Bart,"you bad-mouthed mcgyver, didn't you?"
2476,Bart,meh.
10668,Bart,"what the hey, mrs. k.?"
10674,Bart,maggie knows how to keep a secret. why can't you?
2483,Bart,"wow, lisa. looking at you makes me want to get married for a third time. i met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at hugh's bachelor party."
10675,Bart,i'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
10677,Bart,"what?! without awards shows, how would i know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""glee"" is a comedy?"
2486,Bart,"i don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out."
2499,Bart,twenty-five.
2501,Bart,"hey, jerkface! you have the face of a jerk!"
2506,Bart,"well, i have to coordinate, don't i?"
2509,Bart,we've gotta get the dogs outta there!
2514,Bart,best two out of three.
10706,Bart,"yeah, she got to drink milk as a kid instead of white paint."
10707,Bart,no sir.
10712,Bart,"mom, can we go to new york to find this girl i used to know?"
2521,Bart,it's hard to see what's going on. i can only make out the fat soldiers.
10713,Bart,"well, don't buy 'em!"
10718,Bart,"come on, let's go find mary! this is the address her brother gave me."
10719,Bart,hey!
2532,Bart,the school's on strike. maybe forever. overload. pleasure overload.
2533,Bart,awesome.
10724,Bart,let's talk about somethin' else. something nice.
2536,Bart,now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
2537,Bart,"you know, i heard skinner say the teachers will crack any minute."
10732,Bart,um... i've gotta go.
2544,Bart,in my weaker moments i almost pity them. then i just remind myself they're trying to teach.
10736,Bart,"i can't, because mary's the girl that proves that girls can like me. and she wouldn't like me anymore if i gave her up. so i won't, even if you torture me like you do the english language."
2546,Bart,may i?
2547,Bart,horrifying.
2550,Bart,"well, then. i guess i'll just have to get into the crawl space again."
10742,Bart,"y'know, it's really not fair you're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover!"
10746,Bart,now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at george lucas.
2555,Bart,"zuh? wait, that's it! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together."
10748,Bart,it's homer! before his boobs came in!
2562,Bart,"um, the guy who chopped up george washington?"
2565,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i can't take the test. i have a stomach ache."
10760,Bart,"mom, how come you didn't do my homework last night?"
10763,Bart,lousy surface dwellers...
2575,Bart,what kind of legal fees?
2577,Bart,five hundred dollars!
10772,Bart,lowering your blinds. i'd hate for your carpet to fade.
2584,Bart,"lisa, look what i've got!"
2585,Bart,ta-daa!
2590,Bart,"i borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?"
2592,Bart,"wow, mom, i never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before."
10792,Bart,i know this music! it was a bugs bunny!
10793,Bart,i did.
2602,Bart,"aah. oh, good, somebody's shadow. i'll just turn and brag about my work."
2603,Bart,it was an accident.
2605,Bart,"mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring springfield."
2607,Bart,"hey, gonna win some this season?"
10805,Bart,"dad, over here!"
2615,Bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
10807,Bart,"dad, i'm walking on my hands, and the lions think they're gonna eat me!"
2620,Bart,the lemon tree's gone!
10813,Bart,"i think i'm done here. lisa, go nuts."
2622,Bart,"that lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. we'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead."
10814,Bart,"yeah it was great! this one guy was part of another guy's gang, i mean ""kkangpae,"" but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him!"
2624,Bart,and now i am going to teach some kids a lesson.
10815,Bart,"come on dude, this party rocks! love the temporary tattoo station!"
10816,Bart,hey! my dad worked really hard to make that. he took a class to learn denim painting!
10817,Bart,no one bad-mouths my dad except me!
10822,Bart,why do you think everything's lame?
10836,Bart,you have a story with an ending?!
10838,Bart,finish the damn story. i've got a hockey game tonight.
2647,Bart,roman numerals. they never even tried to teach us that in school.
2651,Bart,i don't got it.
2652,Bart,"okay. think, bart. where have you seen roman numerals before? i know, ""rocky vee!"" that was the fifth one. so ""rocky five"" plus ""rocky two"" equals ""rocky seven: adrian's revenge!"""
10846,Bart,"we tricked you! / eat nerf, homeboy!"
10847,Bart,"hey, dad. are we going camping?"
2658,Bart,i'll get the gate.
10850,Bart,"aren't they just saying ""refrigerator?"""
10851,Bart,"bye forever, milhouse!"
10852,Bart,ay carumba.
2662,Bart,eat my shorrrrrrrts!
10853,Bart,"dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? we're already bored."
2664,Bart,yuck. what reeks?
10856,Bart,i've got to be honest with you. it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on.
2666,Bart,"well, um, yeah. i guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
2667,Bart,huh? wahw!
2670,Bart,"that's my dog, man."
2673,Bart,"no, my dog!"
10866,Bart,nothing a few george washingtons won't solve.
2678,Bart,could so!
10872,Bart,"well, well, well."
2683,Bart,"nah, he's just a cheap imitation of radioactive man."
10876,Bart,"when i start, i'll tell ya."
10877,Bart,"hey, why aren't you eating that?"
10881,Bart,"lisa, i wanna pass that test, but i need your help."
2693,Bart,"watch out, radioactive man!!!!!"
10885,Bart,will you stop that?!
2699,Bart,"good news, gentlemen. i've grown that extra inch you wanted, plus several feet more."
10896,Bart,how 'bout asking that japanese guy who set the world record for eating hot dogs? he's like a successful version of dad.
10900,Bart,all you need to know is i'm a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous. ma'am.
10908,Bart,"get out of my face, cootie breath! i did miss you. you stink! come over saturday. i'm gonna have to push you in the mud now."
2718,Bart,ah-ha!
2719,Bart,"but milhouse, being a star is every patriotic american's dream."
10912,Bart,"soon, baby, soon. let me just kill milhouse's character. he thinks we're on the same team."
2725,Bart,but they told us to wear 'em.
10917,Bart,"all eyes on you, baby."
2728,Bart,"here you go, todd. the city edition."
2729,Bart,i hate this place.
2730,Bart,watch itchy and scratchy!
2731,Bart,i never heard maggie laugh like that before.
2732,Bart,"when she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
2735,Bart,remember how mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
10930,Bart,back pats?! this is a break up!
10932,Bart,"little talk? you guys are having a big fight! this is the problem with women! they don't say what they mean, until it's too late!"
10938,Bart,"mary? that's odd, i thought i was calling the suicide not line. because i'm doin' great. so, um, how are you handling ""taking a break?"""
2753,Bart,"any time, chummmmm...p."
2758,Bart,"poor gullible lisa. i'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."
2762,Bart,"man, what's gotten into you?"
10954,Bart,"don't worry, i'll clean it up. get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors."
2764,Bart,stupid automatic door.
2767,Bart,"i know that's funny, but i'm just not laughing."
10964,Bart,"okay, first, tone it down. time to teach you to be a man."
2775,Bart,wait! wait for me!
2780,Bart,"okay, okay. milhouse's grandmother lives on 257th street, and i'm on third."
2781,Bart,"well, finally, a little luck."
10979,Bart,"lady, my stomach's full and i wanna go. that's how it works in this country."
10982,Bart,you sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
2792,Bart,there's no change in your piggy bank.
10984,Bart,"grampa, you were the original bad boy!"
2794,Bart,uh huh.
2795,Bart,what a load of crappy-crap-crap.
10988,Bart,i'll bring you home my dessert.
2800,Bart,"hey, that's my chop!"
10995,Bart,you are the luckiest people in the world! you get to look at me!
10996,Bart,"listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!"
10998,Bart,"you know it, glamorous. eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then i start fighting dirty."
10999,Bart,"sure, here you go."
11001,Bart,you all stink!
2818,Bart,"...and then he raked me across the chest. and the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared -- groundskeeper willie."
2819,Bart,"um... we didn't mention groundskeeper willie, mom."
11011,Bart,"you guys, i swear i didn't do it."
11014,Bart,no.
11019,Bart,"nice try, pop."
11025,Bart,what's the matter? not a vegetarian?

2847,Bart,"not me, sister. when i grow up i wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like dad."
2849,Bart,he's a nuclear safety technician.
11043,Bart,"ew, locusts. darkness, yawn. bingo! flanders, are you willing to get lovejoy back by hook or by crook?"
11044,Bart,"yes, but if i do something will you look the other way?"
2854,Bart,whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
2855,Bart,"where have you been, granny? did they freeze you or something?"
11050,Bart,"for every one of my cartoons that you erase, i rip up a family vacation photo. and just so you know i mean business, here's an ear!"
2860,Bart,"spill it, muddy mae, or we're calling the cops!"

11067,Bart,"uh, he told me he was going to nap most of the week."
2884,Bart,mo-om! you're embarrassing me in front of the army guys.
2885,Bart,"um, dad..."

2905,Bart,whoa!!
2907,Bart,buy me bonestorm or go to hell!!
2909,Bart,"those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game."
2911,Bart,"mo-om, i'm not a little kid anymore. tuck-in time is lame."
2922,Bart,i'm outside. i got away with it! i'm free!

11138,Bart,he laughed as he heard that old codger's house-sizzles.
2947,Bart,"oh great, the tuck-in express in right on time."
2948,Bart,"hey, mom. you didn't wake me up."
11140,Bart,we had to escape from this behatted mammal...

11147,Bart,i'm alive! all patched up! end of story.

11173,Bart,"dear lord, please help me land safely, or transform this basket into a flying killer robot that i control with my mind, amen."
11175,Bart,"now, i, bart simpson, shall send the first coaster down the track."
11176,Bart,"but milhouse, i already let you push me on the swings."
11178,Bart,eat safety bar!
11179,Bart,because your seat was behind mine!
11184,Bart,"no, you're not. because if you tell people i cheated, that means your system failed."
11188,Bart,"it's not american football, it's just football!"
11192,Bart,she's heading for prairie dog village!
3004,Bart,whatcha doing?
3005,Bart,"hey, cool, what does this do?"
3006,Bart,"whoa, man."
3008,Bart,"if you get one up his butt, it's a million points."

3024,Bart,"boy, i sure could go for a hundred tacos right about now."
3025,Bart,"really?! wow, i should've started a long time ago!"
3029,Bart,"uh, that's a post-dated check, remember. don't cash it 'til the year ten thousand."
3032,Bart,"lisa's autograph... apu's autograph... oh, whaddaya know, jimbo's real name is corky... aannnnd krusty... hey! ""cayman islands offshore holding corporation""?"

3038,Bart,"it doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. as long as you're on tv, people will respect you."
11229,Bart,"mom, is that true?"
11232,Bart,mom!
3041,Bart,i can't believe krusty is really gone.

11244,Bart,"okay, i washed your car like you asked, i did your paper route, and i'm sorry. i really am. this could be the turning point of my life. where you, as a school guy, made a difference. what do you think? can i go on that sub?"
3054,Bart,"well, if you're not krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?"
11246,Bart,you think so?
3058,Bart,"c'mon, lis, krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity."
3059,Bart,"krusty's tired of having phonies around, pretending to be his friends. i'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is."
3063,Bart,"yeah, dad! you're a big fat loudmouth. and you can walk when you have to."
11255,Bart,no you don't. yet.
3066,Bart,"you missed the race, mama."

11271,Bart,"what? no, i got it from this."
11274,Bart,"need directions, or a bottle of water?"
11276,Bart,"if you smell your farts in a dream, you die?"

3086,Bart,itchy the lucky mouse in: manhattan madness.
11282,Bart,"chins up, homer. you don't need a theater to watch the movie. you just have to illegally download it."

11287,Bart,i just want to know who dropped the dime on dad. lousy rat.
11289,Bart,"oh man, i would love to pirate that."
3098,Bart,"he's not a regular bum, mom. he's a genius bum. he created itchy. and he's the father of cartoon violence."
11300,Bart,"fine, nelson gets a valentine. an old one from the box."
11301,Bart,"perfect. bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock."
3124,Bart,what the hell is going on?

11352,Bart,"well... my dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
11358,Bart,he's just riding the thermals from dad's butt.
11359,Bart,i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out.
11360,Bart,can i visit him tomorrow?
3169,Bart,ssshh! they'll know you're in there!
3173,Bart,"forget it. c'mon, it's 11 o'clock. i need some sugar."
3174,Bart,"well, milhouse, i guess interesting stuff does happen to people in springfield."
3175,Bart,there's just not enough time to hear 'em all...
11366,Bart,so how do we fix him?
3180,Bart,...and then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. why is he always making up those crazy stories?
11372,Bart,"no offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny."
3184,Bart,"look, if you're going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?"
11377,Bart,"well, i guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage."
3186,Bart,"mmm-hmm. you bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town. how come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?"
11380,Bart,enough!
11383,Bart,fascinating.

3204,Bart,"you're rich, grampa! you did it! and burns can never take that away from you!"
3205,Bart,"you never were, grampa."
11397,Bart,and we're scared of that because...?
11399,Bart,well... i really think you should watch your temper.
3208,Bart,"there's no denying it, sis."
3209,Bart,"hey, what's this one for?"
11402,Bart,hey! leave him alone. i too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.

3243,Bart,hot stuff comin' through!
11448,Bart,nice real estate. you've got a deal.
3265,Bart,maybe it was just the cat.
11457,Bart,"you can't spell ""crime"" without ""me."""
11458,Bart,what the?
3268,Bart,i don't care. i can't breathe in here.
11462,Bart,i helped snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. it was an honorable arrangement. but i never thought he'd steal from you.
11466,Bart,you ratted him out? he's got a kid!
11468,Bart,i didn't say there'd be a sleepover.
3277,Bart,"hey, dad."
11470,Bart,you're going straight?
3281,Bart,"hey, you built a model city. is that the school?"
11478,Bart,"every time i do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist."

3313,Bart,"way to go, dad! take those punches!"

11508,Bart,just give me the cash and you'll get your drivers license back.
3317,Bart,uh-oh.
3318,Bart,"i got your tooth, dad!"
11510,Bart,"maybe when i've got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, i don't know, a low bar?"
11511,Bart,aren't those full of germs?
3323,Bart,more food.

3342,Bart,"wow, man! what is this place?"

11557,Bart,"yeah, yeah. thank you, mel. but i am not here to talk about myself. milhouse, would you join me at the podium?"
11559,Bart,"rather than try to figure out what happened, milhouse had the courage to move on. to me, that's a hero."
3369,Bart,who's chase?
11561,Bart,come on. you were in world war two.
11563,Bart,"wow, that sounds pretty sweet."

11569,Bart,"look, maggie. i undid my deed. so i'm just gonna take your feather and say goodnight."
3378,Bart,hmmm.

11574,Bart,"hey, dad! we made popcorn!"
3385,Bart,i'm gonna go claim some valuables at the lost and found.
3387,Bart,you're just mad cause there's no clock in your hat.
3389,Bart,"so then i says to mabel, i says..."

3490,Bart,"dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
3492,Bart,nope. something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
11684,Bart,"i've created a fake miss hoover profile. when lassen friends her, we'll know everything about him."
3497,Bart,"dad, i'm scared."
11690,Bart,"so if we go there with a camera to film lassen humiliating himself, i'll get revenge for him making me into this!"
11691,Bart,i was trying to even it out!
11693,Bart,"dad, don't worry, i got you a place."
11695,Bart,"milhouse, everyone here is a total freak. we have to find a way to completely humiliate lassen."
11698,Bart,fire retardant?!
3507,Bart,he's just faking it to get out of jail! he's a maniac!
11699,Bart,"if lassen can't light that thing, he'll be humiliated. what good is an ignis who can't blaze the guy?"
3511,Bart,"he's planning something evil, i know it. it must have something to do with the town's water supply."
11703,Bart,what's a game show?
11704,Bart,you mean more popular but not as good?
3514,Bart,"i won't be happy until i find out what you're up to. wherever you go and whatever you do, i'll be there watching and waiting."
3515,Bart,i lied. now help me rummage through bob's trash for clues. then i promise we'll go to the water slide.
11711,Bart,"they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve. i'll help you, kid."
11715,Bart,i thought we were just going to ask if he had seen homer.
11716,Bart,"all right, i'm sick of waiting."
3525,Bart,"ah, what the hell."
11717,Bart,it's nine-ten a.m.! i know what they're doing. they're up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the hollywood christmas parade.

12121,Bart,"oh, boy!"
12122,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. there are no winners, only losers. there are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the american revolution, world war ii, and the star wars trilogy. if you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. well, good night, everybody. peace, man."

4881,Bart,"hey, dad, gimme fifty bucks. i gotta buy some things. uh, better make it a hundred."
4883,Bart,"oh, get with the times, man. it's jerry rude and the bathroom bunch."

13078,Bart,"yo, homer! can you take me to when you were ten to see if i can kick your butt?"
4887,Bart,hey lis.

4898,Bart,"hey, i'm still checkin' out japanese tv."
13090,Bart,could you please stop fighting in front of us?
13092,Bart,"jenda, that's not what i meant."
4904,Bart,"then we had to do two hours of origami, followed by flower arranging and meditation."
13096,Bart,so that's how jenda dumped me.
4906,Bart,"knife goes in, guts come out. knife goes in, guts come out..."
13099,Bart,why'd you buy the first hover car ever made? didn't you know it'd take time to work out the kinks?
4909,Bart,"sure thing, dad."
4913,Bart,"goodbye, japan. i'll miss your kentucky fried chicken and your sparkling, whale-free seas."
13109,Bart,"a career? no problem, i speak three languages."

4932,Bart,"yeah, it all kinda came together."
13124,Bart,i'd better go talk to him.
4938,Bart,he's just flamboyant.
13130,Bart,this machine lets us look into the future. wouldn't that be romantic?
4943,Bart,all right. i'll do it for you.
13138,Bart,"dad, the earring could plug the hole."
4948,Bart,"claritin ""d""?"
4951,Bart,"well, it's not like i never saw a dog before."
4960,Bart,"no, but here's a book called ""chicken soup for the loser"" that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats."
4968,Bart,it can read your electronic organizer from space.
4970,Bart,who else? major league baseball.
4985,Bart,"when i can't stop fiddlin' / i just takes me ritalin / i'm poppin' and sailin', man!"
4991,Bart,and there's that awful script from the cable guy!
4992,Bart,"wait a minute, they're gonna kill dad!"
4995,Bart,you mean you killed ned flanders.
5003,Bart,look at me!

5048,Bart,"no need, dad. over the years i've learned to find father figures wherever i can... construction workers, the internet... and nelson, here."

5052,Bart,"gee, sorry for being born."
5054,Bart,"yeah, but now their umbilical cords have fallen off!"
5059,Bart,uh-huh.

5166,Bart,"i'll give it a whirl, ralphie boy."
5167,Bart,devil be gone!
5168,Bart,number of miracles performed by bart: two. number performed by lisa: zero.

5194,Bart,"okay, god. if you did give me a power, let it work now. not just for me, but for my dad."
5204,Bart,"nah, it's not so bad. here we can spit on the floor."
5205,Bart,who are those pleasant old men?
5211,Bart,"hey, dad."
5213,Bart,"dad, if we're gonna race duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?"
5229,Bart,"boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy."
5230,Bart,move your damn butt.
5247,Bart,"dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars."
5257,Bart,"you're right, i'm sorry. tell you what: saturday night we'll go out for steaks, just you and me."
5261,Bart,look at her. must be great to be a baby and be so easily amused.
5262,Bart,"oh, no!"
5266,Bart,"i'm not ridin' a girls bike. hey, it's gettin' away! step on it! ya! ya!"
5280,Bart,"hey, i bought it from a guy on your reservation."
5288,Bart,yes!
5294,Bart,don't you mean present?
5297,Bart,"president-elect. i could've been president, but i'm too real. people can't deal with what i'm layin' down. they're just like, ""whoa, dude, you can't say that."" and i'm like, ""watch me."""
5301,Bart,flanders is a soft touch. he'll give us the money for sure.
5304,Bart,my little one.
5307,Bart,"now, we'd like to play a jimmy buffet song, but he un-coolly charges people to cover them. so here's a cap'n bart original. wasted once more in daquiritaville..."
5308,Bart,"oh, no. i've got half a beer in there! and ""bewitched"" is on!"

5342,Bart,thank you. down low.
5344,Bart,wow. you're really asking for my help?
5349,Bart,billy carter's ghost?!
5351,Bart,i guess i am an embarrassment.
5354,Bart,you're meeting with debt collectors and you don't want my help? do you know how crazy that is?
5361,Bart,legalize it.
5364,Bart,why did a vision of my future include a story about homer and lincoln's gold?
5370,Bart,i can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
5372,Bart,he'll pay a lot to get this back.
5378,Bart,you think we should enter?
5380,Bart,"hey, here's a camera."
5398,Bart,i'm betting it's hunger and rage.
5400,Bart,mom! lisa's growing!
5401,Bart,do you have any hobo chunks we can throw to him?
5403,Bart,the gi-ant gator!
5419,Bart,wait a minute. everybody thinks we're at camp this week. we can stay wherever we want.
5432,Bart,"well, do you see him or not?"
5433,Bart,are you saying he's right on the other side of that plant?
5438,Bart,what will we find? boogers... or nazi gold?
5439,Bart,no way.
5447,Bart,you don't seem to be trying very hard.
5455,Bart,"okay, maybe not."
5458,Bart,"the kids are saying if you say bloody margie five times, she'll appear. but then she gouges your eyes out."
5460,Bart,"mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot."
5468,Bart,the funniest stuff came right out of real life.
5469,Bart,"cowabunga, dude!"
5478,Bart,"if esposito thinks he's going to muscle us, he's wrong."
5479,Bart,"when willie asked me to be a presenter at the new awareness awards, i had to think about it... for about a microsecond."
5491,Bart,that was close!
5497,Bart,"speaking of which, how about seconds?"
5513,Bart,"dad, we're not in their area code anymore."
5516,Bart,"dad, you got syrup on your sash."
5517,Bart,give it back! that's my novelty flying disc.
5520,Bart,"dad, i don't think this is such a good idea."
5530,Bart,clear!
5535,Bart,eh.
5538,Bart,k. the c.?
5540,Bart,two-fifty-six?
5545,Bart,i guess.
5557,Bart,get out! what's the catch?
5569,Bart,"wanna rehearse, dad?"
5575,Bart,i took a swing at a cop.
5577,Bart,i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
5579,Bart,"you know, it might've been jimbo."
5581,Bart,"nice to have you back, homer."
5589,Bart,nuh-uh!
5590,Bart,"maybe i can make some money, dad. my magic act is really coming along."
5593,Bart,"yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's little league games!"
5596,Bart,"hey, homer! check it out!"
5600,Bart,"so in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
5606,Bart,"nice use of the lingo, homer."
5608,Bart,"wow, look at all this loot! what should we buy first?"
5612,Bart,he's the bestest dog ever. he's light brown and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.
5615,Bart,dad?
5617,Bart,"okay, i'm sold."
5618,Bart,"run, dad!"
5627,Bart,"okay, we're all locked up now..."
5634,Bart,"dad, willie got arrested 'cause of us!"

5686,Bart,that trash can must have unkinked your back.
5689,Bart,"hey, check it out!"
5691,Bart,"hey dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box."
5702,Bart,we had to buy lunch for that homeless guy.
5705,Bart,how could you have it planned out? you just heard about the problem.
5706,Bart,yeah. and why did we have to do this all the way from home?
5738,Bart,"...so from now on, all hats are banned from the school."
5745,Bart,"we were good, dad. they asked us to play in the krusty klassic!"
5746,Bart,we can wipe out b.c. in our lifetime.
5747,Bart,"i may have the looks, but he's the trophy husband."
5749,Bart,lisa's your teammate?
5755,Bart,nutsy the clown.
5770,Bart,this is for sideshow bob.
5776,Bart,"eh, i winna da race! viva italia!"
5778,Bart,i use up all-a my english.
5779,Bart,"grazie, springfield!"
5780,Bart,mob... stranger. mob... stranger. stranger.
5782,Bart,"well, it says here your name is ""l.t. smash."""

5870,Bart,ow! mo-om...
5871,Bart,"ice cream at church? i'm intrigued, yet suspicious."
5872,Bart,"we can take whatever we want, right?"
5873,Bart,you're right. we could use this for witchcraft.
5875,Bart,kinda.
5892,Bart,teamsters are sleeping in my room.
5902,Bart,"boy, that story had everything, a giant, house crushing, meteor..."
5903,Bart,"hey, flanders gave us toothpaste."
5910,Bart,we're out of milk.

5955,Bart,"c'mon, dad. let's go."
5956,Bart,"c'mon, dad. i gotta go to the bathroom."
5959,Bart,would you mind? i'm trying to do my homework.
5962,Bart,what'd you do that for?
5964,Bart,who said that?
5973,Bart,"everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will."
5977,Bart,more diggin'.
5996,Bart,we have a person-to-person call for marge simpson.
5999,Bart,"oh, sorry."
6001,Bart,it's the body!
6002,Bart,then how do you explain this?
6014,Bart,now it's headed for the church.
6020,Bart,"yes, father."
6028,Bart,"you're a little light here, dad."
6031,Bart,"hey, this is taffy!"
6038,Bart,"okay, but it's my first time."
6047,Bart,"yeah, dad! you can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!"
6049,Bart,the prostitute with a heart of gold.

6068,Bart,"dad just got a library card in west springfield. he checked out ten books on oil rigging and a book called ""dying for dummies."""
6073,Bart,your dad's mcbain?
6076,Bart,"wow! the q-tip he used to kill ross perot! ho-ho, everything in your house is so cool."
6085,Bart,"ohhh, he'll sleep tonight."

6089,Bart,that's it. i'm blowing off the dance. this is the biggest thing that's happened to me since chocolate milk.
6090,Bart,sey-mour...
6092,Bart,loser principal!
6096,Bart,"all right, i know what to do. i'll dump her like she's never been dumped before, then we'll go right back to being friends."
6099,Bart,"milhouse? greta? well, no one has to draw me a picture."
6108,Bart,"this is for love, dad. someday you'll feel what i feel."
6111,Bart,there it is -- wolfcastle's movie set.
6113,Bart,but she might say no.
6114,Bart,"milhouse, she's only dating you to get back at me."
6128,Bart,help!
6133,Bart,"hey, wait a minute. these animals are stuffed."
6147,Bart,"oh, he's not bothering me any more. buck mccoy helped me."
6149,Bart,what's this lunchbox made of?
6168,Bart,that is just grotesque.
6170,Bart,"way to go, buck. i feel my faith growing anew."
6171,Bart,"buck, you're my hero again."
6172,Bart,"well, there's krusty, itchy, scratchy, poochie, america's firefighters and then you, dad."

6196,Bart,cool. does he get to marry his mom?
6197,Bart,"could that fat ghost be telling the truth? first i've got to get uncle claudius to confess, then i've gotta kill him."
6201,Bart,"no, i think it's niagular."
6208,Bart,"ay caramba, que mujer tonta! veinte horas estudiar por nada!"
6223,Bart,"as long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house."
6228,Bart,why him?
6229,Bart,why does danger dog mean more to me than school or church?
6230,Bart,mine is danger dude. but he's a dog.
6231,Bart,oh yeah.
6232,Bart,"well, i'm my own toughest critic, but i think it's genius. now to sell it for millions."

6310,Bart,"put him down, boy! put him down!"
6311,Bart,"yeah, if dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?"

6326,Bart,"rest in peace, pal."
6328,Bart,calf's in the field so you sneak up slow / grab 'im by the tail and go man go...
6333,Bart,"no, it was the night you got loaded at moe's and the car had to be towed home."
6345,Bart,"and the lord said, ""let there be crap."""
6360,Bart,"an ""a""? copacetic."

6621,Bart,nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. all that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
6622,Bart,"hey, check out this hood ornament i stole."
6625,Bart,time to get that hood's ornament.
6630,Bart,how'd you get dad to go along with this?
6633,Bart,"dad, we weren't playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking."

6641,Bart,disneyland!
6646,Bart,"oh, it shows! i haven't had a strangle that smooth since i was four."

7067,Bart,"okay, if i use my head, i can keep out of trouble. better stay out of the sandbox... i could be buried alive... maybe the slide..."
7069,Bart,"hello, ladies."

7088,Bart,"gina, before we get any closer, there's something you need to know about me. i think girls are icky-pants."
7089,Bart,great. i can get these handcuffs off before i get a full-blown case of the cooties.

7110,Bart,"we got a runner. snipers, take your shot."
7111,Bart,"mom, what are you doin' here? did our house burn down? whoa, that'd be cool."

7149,Bart,"hey, i just zinged you."
7150,Bart,"i'm grown up, i'm grown up!"
7158,Bart,"c'mon, pie man, hit him! that's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!"
7164,Bart,"okay, ladies. don't you have a poodle to dress up?"

7261,Bart,i'm not hungry.
7263,Bart,"well, at least she's not singing streisand."
7264,Bart,...and that's where i found him.
7266,Bart,"so, now that you're happy again, i guess you won't beat me up at school anymore."
7269,Bart,i didn't think anyone successful came from springfield.

7360,Bart,"hell yeah! i'm representin' at ""murder 4 life,"" know what i'm sayin'?"
7368,Bart,"damn, this ride is pimped-out."
7374,Bart,"no, it's not about you."
7380,Bart,the kidnappers say if you worry too much... they'll kill me.
7385,Bart,"look, if you tell what i did, i'll get in trouble."
7394,Bart,shhh. don't ruin the moment.

7446,Bart,what the hell's menopause?
7456,Bart,you're a bread compartment!
7457,Bart,"oh, do we have to?"
7459,Bart,you know what started all this trouble? this motor home. how could a vehicle this cool destroy a marriage that crappy?
7460,Bart,take this back to the dealer?
7461,Bart,"slowly, slowly -- the rv dealer is across town under that gorilla blimp."
7464,Bart,prove it!
7477,Bart,"thanks, mother dexter! i'll be back tomorrow."
7487,Bart,i'm tired of this. i wanna look at a different future.
7496,Bart,"i was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined."
7498,Bart,"eh, i got standards. i don't hand out high-fives like chiclets."
7505,Bart,i'unno. he was dead when i found him.
7523,Bart,this can't be legal!
7527,Bart,"they can't see or hear us, right?"
7542,Bart,"yeah. for once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? would that be so hard?"
7546,Bart,whoa!
7556,Bart,"look at me, i'm a grad student. i'm thirty years old and i made six hundred dollars last year."
7559,Bart,"hey, this is one of those dirty websites."
7568,Bart,what kind of a knight is that?
7569,Bart,ay carumba.
7572,Bart,milhouse! don't open your mouth!
7574,Bart,"no way! i didn't do it! unlike all the other stuff i told you i didn't do, which i did!"
7575,Bart,"i didn't do it! mom, you believe me, don't you?"
7576,Bart,"mom, that's a school for the blind."
7578,Bart,"thanks for the history lesson, sis."
7585,Bart,you do?
7590,Bart,"whoa, this stuff is great! it's way better than the comics i get at the dentist."
7591,Bart,"...then father sean quoted eminem in his sermon. and in art class, we painted saint joan burning at the stake, and mine was the grossest! catholics rock!"
7600,Bart,"you just don't get it. i've made a sacred commitment to the catholic church, and... paintball! awesome!"
7601,Bart,die! die! die!
7602,Bart,"easy on the zeal, church-os! i've got something to say."
7603,Bart,"don't you get it -- it's all christianity, people! the little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities!"
7609,Bart,"boy, homer. i've never seen mom this mad."
7622,Bart,again!
7628,Bart,"pay the man, homer."
7630,Bart,"all right, commercials!"
7633,Bart,"yeah, if dad ever rolls over, you're dead."
7636,Bart,"hey mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?"
7664,Bart,does this mean you and dad might get a d-a-v-u-r-s?
7668,Bart,how many times do i have to tell you: no rodgers and hammerstein!
7671,Bart,"okay. when mom and dad see this dummy fall in the river, they'll think it's me, and they'll realize what really matters: each other."
7673,Bart,"now, i'll get my mom and dad's attention, and you shove the dummy in the water. any questions?"
7674,Bart,pile of dog doo. let's roll.
7677,Bart,this is all my fault! i planted mom's bra in milhouse's parents' bed!
7680,Bart,"no, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards."
7682,Bart,time to destroy the one who did this to me.
7683,Bart,did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
7684,Bart,eat my shorts.
7687,Bart,what are you talking about?
7691,Bart,"i said i'm a human, not a girl."
7692,Bart,can i stay with you guys tonight?
7694,Bart,"i get it, i get it! sucks to be you. goodnight."
7696,Bart,"no fair! dad gets to kill wild animals, but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist."
7697,Bart,that's not even a mask. it's axle grease!
7699,Bart,"mom, can we buy a magnesium-vapor soak tub?"
7702,Bart,"ooh -- small hill. pedal, pedal, pedal!"
7704,Bart,moms don't get lonely.
7723,Bart,what'd it say?
7724,Bart,"hey, we could have tea in my treehouse."
7726,Bart,"mom, this is great! it makes our real house look like a pile of crap."
7728,Bart,i can't wait to use our new krusty the clown tea service!
7732,Bart,"hey, there is no way that bart simpson is a mama's boy."
7738,Bart,ay carumba!
7739,Bart,"hey, mom."
7743,Bart,sure... why not? it'll be fun.
7744,Bart,"you know, mother, i wasn't sure about tonight. but seeing us dressed the same really feels right!"
7752,Bart,cool...
7759,Bart,heeere's bart!
7765,Bart,what's with the canadian flag on your backpack?
7768,Bart,"dad, cheese truck!"
7771,Bart,"c'mon, slice, dice, and serve on rice."
7772,Bart,"yeah, this is italy -- look, the town drunk is two years old."
7789,Bart,how's things with you and frank?
7791,Bart,"so, where's the skin-man?"
7792,Bart,ay carumba.
7793,Bart,"thank you, satan!"
7795,Bart,now i gotta warn you. we could get in trouble.
7796,Bart,"oh, my god! my dad had a long talk with me about this, but you can't believe it till you see it!"
7799,Bart,can i cut a deal? i'll give you milhouse.
7801,Bart,"dad, if you take me to vegas, i'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack."
7803,Bart,nobody tells bart simpson what to do.
7806,Bart,"dad, neither of us wanna go. why are you doing this? where's the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose?"
7807,Bart,"fight back, fun homer! together we can win!"
7810,Bart,did you see that? they were eating melon for breakfast!
7827,Bart,"oh yeah, that's why."
7828,Bart,hee-eere.
7835,Bart,"you're on, lis."
7836,Bart,care to concede that bet?
7840,Bart,"where'd it go?! where'd it go?! oh, it's in the cap."
7844,Bart,because i'm a screw-up. my sister's the smart one -- all i do is get in trouble.
7847,Bart,i need an operation?
7855,Bart,"cheer up, toot-toot. have some of my ice cream."
7869,Bart,then itchy used an ice cream scoop to scoop out scratchy's heart and make it a sundae. the end.
7898,Bart,"it is gonna be awesome! now i can walk down the hall with ""bart junior"" hangin' out. isn't that right, bart junior?"
7904,Bart,"hey lis, you missed it. while you were at girls' school, nelson totally whaled on this dork."
7906,Bart,"so, did you tell mom you got beat up?"
7907,Bart,"hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. i'll teach you how to be a boy."
7914,Bart,i guess i'm gonna have to get this party started.
7927,Bart,we've got to tell dad!
7929,Bart,look at this garden of f's. you planted them all!
7937,Bart,oh... so that's why everyone's been sayin' that all summer.
7939,Bart,i'll never forget you.
7949,Bart,so do i!
7951,Bart,"you can take off the wig, milhouse."
7959,Bart,"oh, papa."
7961,Bart,"don't worry, dude. we'll hook you up with some tunes."
7962,Bart,"look at me, i'm otto! i'm a hundred years old and i drive a school bus!"
7969,Bart,you said you meant to make brownies. any other lies?
7974,Bart,"thanks, but i'm going into bootleg dvds."
7976,Bart,yeah.
7977,Bart,yes. of course.
7981,Bart,absolutely not.
7985,Bart,"lisa, you've got to be more careful! i need you to teach me all about the world of juzz."
7991,Bart,says you!
7995,Bart,the doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
8009,Bart,"these games are so old. who got these high scores? pilgrims? hmm, never saw this one before."
8019,Bart,"yes, you might say he'll ""blow up."""
8020,Bart,"i'm not a big fan of detention. you might say, it drives me nuts."
8021,Bart,i brought you breakfast in bed.
8024,Bart,no! i'm allergic!
8027,Bart,kids don't die!
8032,Bart,"dad, you're eating dr. phil!"
8036,Bart,"krusty, what's that monster?"
8043,Bart,"no, my go-- yes, him."
8044,Bart,"finally, someone who does whatever i say."
8046,Bart,"oh, it's always the jews' fault."
8050,Bart,"uh, paw."
8060,Bart,"don't worry, dad. you'll do great."
8069,Bart,i've always done it. just like i only eat the eyes off a lobster.
8073,Bart,"it's not coffee, it's hot pepsi!"
8074,Bart,"man, mom and dad are really going at it."
8078,Bart,"yup, he'll be all alone on his birthday! oh, i wish i could see it. boo hoo! i'm nelson. no one likes me."
8080,Bart,hey!
8082,Bart,kind of?
8089,Bart,nelson... nobody's coming.
8091,Bart,maybe you can have fun with just me.
8092,Bart,wait... i have an idea.
8094,Bart,"yeah, yeah, it was uh, super fun. good times. hey, ralph! have i got a half a sandwich for you."
8095,Bart,"um, nelson, i was just thinking about us being ""best friends."""
8101,Bart,"from then on, my life changed."
8105,Bart,"hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. it's offensive."
8110,Bart,"sorry, i was uh... stealing loose grapes at the grocery store."
8115,Bart,no! i can't do it! you're a nut bar! a whack-job! a kooka-dooka!
8118,Bart,"we sure are far from the rest of 'em. funny how that happened, huh?"
8124,Bart,where'd you get it?
8131,Bart,"please, santa?"
8136,Bart,problem solved.
8138,Bart,"whoa, gil's a big shot!"
8139,Bart,there's a spot!
8154,Bart,"my story takes place in a time i call ""the past""."
8160,Bart,"so you see, revenge is great. and there's three ways to talk about it. although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a halloween story..."
8161,Bart,"hey lis, check it out! with some clever scissor work, i can make the ""lakeland butter"" indian maiden show me her boobs."
8163,Bart,"cool -- look what snap's doing to pop, while crackle watches!"
8170,Bart,no way -- i don't want my guts touching some sick guy!
8176,Bart,"shut up, shut up, shut up!"
8180,Bart,"man, this town's got everything!"
8191,Bart,how religious can you be if you're pregnant?
32775,Homer,"come on out, boy."
32776,Homer,"y'ello. she what?! oh, my god! well i'm gonna settle this once and for all! meet me at the place we discussed."
32779,Homer,don't worry. i have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
32802,Homer,"and he has hair! bart, get me my suicide axe."
32816,Homer,"ooo, i think he's a keeper."
32817,Homer,that's right.
32828,Homer,you guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.
32830,Homer,ready... for... pick up. ready! for! pick up!
32835,Homer,we're not here for the game. the game is nothing. the game is crap. the game makes me sick!
32836,Homer,"the real reason we americans put up with sports, is for this..."
32838,Homer,"since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. what childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
32852,Homer,"maybe i can finally meet jim jarmusch and ask him who he is. hey, that's him!"
32854,Homer,what else?
32864,Homer,don't you dare post that review.
32867,Homer,i never wanted to be famous for being mean. i wanted to be famous for catching santa claus.
32874,Homer,"i don't want to get mad, but i will!"
32877,Homer,"don't worry -- i'm ready for this. bart, fetch ""the defender."""
32878,Homer,that's where the food sleeps!
32886,Homer,no thanks.
32890,Homer,you left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. so i filled it with food. but i'm never full.
32892,Homer,i'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
32897,Homer,asleep with your eyes open? mom?
32898,Homer,mom!
32899,Homer,my mother's dead.
32909,Homer,woo hoo!
32910,Homer,"aw, ma. you always knew just how to make everything all right."
32913,Homer,no...
32914,Homer,"okay, this is it. i've got one last chance to make up for the things i said to my mom. i will avenge you!"
32915,Homer,"i'm really glad you corrected me, lisa. people are always really glad when they're corrected."
32919,Homer,"to spare, eh?"
32930,Homer,i don't think so.
32937,Homer,"thanks, boy."
32944,Homer,bart's having girl trouble. you better go talk to him.
32945,Homer,i thought i was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
32946,Homer,"fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings."""
32948,Homer,"uh, we'll stick with the coins."
32956,Homer,this is a classic nineteen seventy-eight pizza hut! mmm... terrible.
32963,Homer,"yeah. i'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. do you have change for a nickel?"
32965,Homer,"you got it, boy."
32967,Homer,three-peat.
32975,Homer,flanders!
32979,Homer,i brought you something.
32990,Homer,let's roll.
32992,Homer,daddy's home! i brought you kids some stuff from work!
33001,Homer,i'm not convinced.
33002,Homer,still on the fence.
33003,Homer,now i believe you.
33019,Homer,"marge, what's going on?"
33024,Homer,and how did you know i wouldn't be there?
33028,Homer,you hang onto resentment like a confederate widow.
33029,Homer,"yeah, but you hold onto the big things! the point is, the more i got to know you, the more i got to like you."
33041,Homer,"hey, he went into a construction site!"
33042,Homer,bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. what's his angle?
33043,Homer,we're doing laundry.
33046,Homer,our little boy has lost his mind. let's get him.
33055,Homer,"hmmm, you make a good case. i'll take it!"
33057,Homer,i was gonna bet it on the dogs!
33063,Homer,"well marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
33064,Homer,"stop it, both of you! don't make me drive into that tree! you know i will!"
33074,Homer,give me back my newspaper!
33078,Homer,"thank you, future bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!"
33081,Homer,occupied!
33083,Homer,no.
33095,Homer,"then i now pronounce us ""just dating."""
33096,Homer,i love kissing you. i never want to knock it off.
33097,Homer,knock it off!
33102,Homer,"eat gravel, hags!"
33104,Homer,uh-oh.
33105,Homer,how many times do i have to say i'm sorry?
33109,Homer,"no, get two of your own."
33112,Homer,"no, i'm talking to you, at this great party!"
33114,Homer,or you!
33116,Homer,she's not strange! she's fun! and she doesn't get jealous when i talk to other women!
33119,Homer,what a cute couple. she's gonna take him for a lot of money.
33126,Homer,what?! but i have urges!
33129,Homer,marge?
33135,Homer,marge? is that you?
33145,Homer,that takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
33148,Homer,"you're just as bad as me. and you used to be better, so that makes you worse! i don't think we can ever trust each other again."
33151,Homer,yeah. i missed her like five times.
33158,Homer,4 ever. i couldn't even keep a promise i made to a tree. maybe it's not too late! maybe i can still save our love. if i just show her that carving...
33167,Homer,but we're married.
33169,Homer,woo-hoo! adult situations!
33171,Homer,"six cups, please. and put it on my tab."
33175,Homer,"hey moe, gimme a--"
33185,Homer,the gay guy?
33189,Homer,"okay, everyone. rotate one to your right."
33192,Homer,"marge, if i had a hundred dollars for every customer i'd broken up, i'd have exactly this amount. 'cause that's what i charge!"
33200,Homer,"really? well, i did bring this envelope full of money."
33204,Homer,"she won! and like any prudent gambler, i know when to walk away: never!"
33215,Homer,"well, sweetie, daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. you'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. i hope you're not mad."
33216,Homer,you sure you're not mad?
33219,Homer,she's gone. can you drive me home? i'm a little drunk.
33224,Homer,"lisa's mad at me, and now she's using marge's maiden name instead of mine."
33227,Homer,"dear lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. sorry, he told me i needed a hundred and forty-four letters. what was my point again? oh right. bouvier or simpson, i cherish you."
33229,Homer,what does it do?
33230,Homer,"okay. what can i do for you? please, i'm begging you!"
33234,Homer,"milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... salaam alaikum!"
33238,Homer,"oh, i can't believe that till i see a fictional tv program espousing your point of view."
33246,Homer,"care to cut? watch this, lenny."
33258,Homer,"all right, sweetie. but if i wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
33259,Homer,now do flanders!
33264,Homer,oh my god!
33272,Homer,a computer!
33281,Homer,uh... stay where you are!
33291,Homer,duh!

33303,Homer,and mine was snakes and yours was...
33304,Homer,"really? i thought it was lisa with a beard of bees. well whatever, brace yourself."
33308,Homer,i knew it!
33312,Homer,"oh yeah, yeah, that's what i meant too. i have no... inclination..."
33313,Homer,yep.
33316,Homer,"your bees died days ago. these are their angry, mutant descendants. and they're tough enough to live in any environment."
33317,Homer,"hm, i'm not sure. let me check."
33322,Homer,"uh, 'cause no one's making me. buh-bye."
33329,Homer,we... i... you come up with an excuse!
33331,Homer,"if you'll show me to your bathroom, i'd like to pretend to wash my hands."
33332,Homer,"when they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?"
33375,Homer,", or woo hoo?"
33383,Homer,i respect your choice. now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins.
33385,Homer,"now, dondelinger, i want some answers."
33392,Homer,"come on, stir! i must see more!"
33402,Homer,"marge, the way i feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
33405,Homer,i'm class president.
33416,Homer,my own plaque! and one for vice president butthead! cool.
33417,Homer,"is that why you brought me here, spirits?"
33421,Homer,"hey, was there another plaque here before?"
33429,Homer,"absolutely. insurance is the greatest deal ever. if i get hurt, i get paid. and man, do i get hurt."
33435,Homer,must be in the glove box.
33449,Homer,kniiiife!
33450,Homer,got it!
33455,Homer,oh mardi gras / oh mardi gras / you see a lot of boo-bies...
33459,Homer,"ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
33460,Homer,no problem.
33469,Homer,"marge, don't worry. it's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. they stopped calling us. in fact, everyone did!"
33473,Homer,"don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. i ripped all the copper wire out of the walls."
33475,Homer,goodbye.
33480,Homer,he saved our ass!
33486,Homer,"some friend you are. the minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. you'd better just pray i don't find out where you live!"
33491,Homer,"who is this ""dad"" you speak of, lisa simpson?"
33501,Homer,"it is me, jesus!"
33506,Homer,"don't worry, marge."
33508,Homer,i'm using you!
33514,Homer,"i know it seems that way, because i'm such a vivid storyteller. now here's another story called ""bart's mistake."" we were walking home when"
33515,Homer,how could this have happened?
33528,Homer,i finally feel like part of a family!
33532,Homer,is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
33536,Homer,"good, but not great. i'll go get some rat poison."
33537,Homer,"no, you stupid dog -- that's maggie's bunny!"
33538,Homer,not in front of the poison man!
33544,Homer,"let's see: i need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but i can only take one thing at a time. i can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and i can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
33551,Homer,"now, i need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of god. and i'll be watching you too, in case god's busy making tornadoes or not existing."
33556,Homer,'cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. now give her back so i can take her home to my rat-infested house!
33559,Homer,"oh no, oh no, ohhh no. there is no way homer simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun."
33564,Homer,cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
33566,Homer,"you told me something, but i wasn't listening!"
33571,Homer,hot tubs!
33577,Homer,go back to your day spas!
33581,Homer,"hey, what happened to the bubbles?"
33587,Homer,lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
33591,Homer,"oh, i miss her."
33598,Homer,our first refund.
33608,Homer,i can't tell if those are questions or statements.
33610,Homer,it was apt.
33614,Homer,"oh my god, she fainted! let's go get smelling salts!"
33620,Homer,"sweetie, any place i'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
33625,Homer,"did you hear that, santa? she said yes! yes! now, back to your cold, airless tomb."
33627,Homer,"check out this rocket ship cake, marge."
33630,Homer,what if we...
33632,Homer,why not?
33634,Homer,"no matter what i do, marge yells at me. if she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
33636,Homer,what the? i'm chained up like a common bicycle!
33644,Homer,whose side are you on?
33647,Homer,"what's fun about fire ants? they're-- oh, you're being sarcastic."
33650,Homer,marge! moe and maya are here for a double date.
33670,Homer,"impossibly high. now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!"
33673,Homer,"now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
33674,Homer,"moe, what are you doing?"
33679,Homer,"aw, burrowing your head into your daddy. a sign that my baby is happy and confident."
33681,Homer,there you are!
33689,Homer,see you when the moon comes out.
33691,Homer,"i'll save you, maggie!"
33699,Homer,"moe, this was a great thing for you. you went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. and sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. and that means someone can love you again. and that'll make you smile."
33703,Homer,don't shake your fist at me!
33707,Homer,"marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. that's the most a parent can do."
33713,Homer,'ut 'uz it 'ay?
33716,Homer,"ooh, lamb-kebab!"
33725,Homer,"well, at least i can eat again!"
33731,Homer,ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
33732,Homer,i still taste over-tones of pink!
33733,Homer,hm. it feels like food. but it has no flavor whatsoever.
33735,Homer,"man, who comes up with this stuff?"
33737,Homer,"son, from now on, i'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
33749,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
33752,Homer,"i don't have to ""helicopter"" bart -- i've got a backup plan called ""lisa."""
33756,Homer,that makes sense. movin' on.
33763,Homer,"time to take control of my son's life. let's see, what can he build..."
33767,Homer,perfect!
33768,Homer,i did it! i helped my son! helicopter homer away!
33783,Homer,what's the hardest model there is?
33784,Homer,"attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. my son and i are going to build westminster abbey!"
33787,Homer,"but first, as part of ""operation popularity,"" lisa and i are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
33788,Homer,brittany and kaitlin are here! where's my spray-on tan?
33791,Homer,i am such a great parent to both my kids.
33795,Homer,"naw, that kinda creeps me out."
33798,Homer,geoffrey chaucer?! what are you doing here?
33799,Homer,anne of cleves!
33805,Homer,there are no flights to london till five!
33807,Homer,i'm sorry. i got carried away. from now on the only thing i'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. but at least i made lisa popular.
33833,Homer,"goodnight, marge."
33845,Homer,i'll get us some brewskies.
33852,Homer,we're not the only ones having a good time.
33859,Homer,"you know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife."
33861,Homer,i went to a movie.
33868,Homer,"what do you think, marge? maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
33874,Homer,"hey, there's no way i could ever be as good as that guy."
33878,Homer,"he who laughs last, laughs dead."
33883,Homer,"""dammit, morpheus. not everyone believes what you believe."""
33890,Homer,"no, dear. i'm a man, dear."
33893,Homer,drinking makes me slee-py
33895,Homer,ow!
33898,Homer,me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
33903,Homer,"let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. lisa?"
33905,Homer,you? awesome. next.
33909,Homer,fine. i'll give back the oscars i stole from the lobby.

33919,Homer,"me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? then i get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then i see the driver is a chicken?"
33928,Homer,is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
33931,Homer,one cheese cube couldn't hurt.
33942,Homer,"how ya doin', man?"
33946,Homer,just you and me?
33948,Homer,you just said both those things to me.
33954,Homer,"i said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
33955,Homer,you're the first teacher that ever got me.
33959,Homer,"great. go nuts. but remember, we never had this discussion."
33962,Homer,"not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly."
33963,Homer,maybe.
33968,Homer,kill! kill. kill.
33970,Homer,it wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a bavarian castle!
33988,Homer,woo hoo!
33991,Homer,the math checks out!
33996,Homer,then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
34004,Homer,"well, this day can't get any crazier."

34014,Homer,while turning gay the other day / a thought occurred to me...
34025,Homer,woo-hoo! our boss is our best buddy!
34031,Homer,"oh, well... i didn't know that."
34037,Homer,his astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! this is not good! this is not good!
34038,Homer,"marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?"
34039,Homer,"stupid carl... ""update the phone list, homer!"" ""you put my contact lenses in backwards, homer!"" i'm sorry, honey."
34047,Homer,"okay. kiss me, baby! kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!"
34053,Homer,french nuclear commissioner etienne ducharme.
34056,Homer,where i should've been all along...

34078,Homer,where's the hooch?
34082,Homer,"oh sweetie, i found you! now, who's gonna find us? help!"

34112,Homer,"i know you miss him, boy. so let's you and me spend some quality father and son time."
34115,Homer,"did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
34126,Homer,"no, i get my news off the internet."
34128,Homer,nope.
34134,Homer,"what the?! well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
34135,Homer,"stay out of this, dad!"
34136,Homer,that's it! here's your ring back.
34137,Homer,it's a father-son commitment band that i bought and never told you about!
34141,Homer,"why you little... oh, i can't. when i look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
34146,Homer,isn't that cute? he thinks he's a pack.
34154,Homer,"dad, i don't have the right words to say how i really feel about you, but at least i know how to beat up a guy who does."
34156,Homer,really? me? you mean it?
34157,Homer,"i've been waiting for this day for so long. the year is nineteen forty-six. in a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. and that flower is an angry japanese monster named godzilla. how am i doin', dad?"
34160,Homer,"aw c'mon, marge. there's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head."
34169,Homer,"you nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'."
34170,Homer,do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
34175,Homer,you can't win us back with mere donuts.
34176,Homer,that is the most amazing donut i've ever tasted.
34179,Homer,potato!
34180,Homer,tomato!
34189,Homer,"a disc? please be compact, please be compact! woo-hoo!"
34196,Homer,i'm almost there... i can see the church steeple in the distance...
34201,Homer,i did it! i'm gonna make it!
34204,Homer,i didn't make it?
34210,Homer,oh yeah.
34213,Homer,"oh barney, that's brilliant! just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
34217,Homer,why you little...

34223,Homer,why... i'm just...
34234,Homer,sorry boy. you have school tomorrow.
34237,Homer,"blackmail your father in space, will you?!"
34243,Homer,what do i wear?
34247,Homer,"okay, i'm taking off the blindfold..."
34254,Homer,and you like potato...
34255,Homer,and you like tomato...
34262,Homer,how about bromance?
34264,Homer,this bromance just got interesting.
34266,Homer,"what, they come here on saturday night to clean the ice? losers."
34271,Homer,there's a winter olympics?
34278,Homer,"oh, a pork bao, a shrimp bao, everywhere a bao bao / homer simpson wins a gold / sliding rocks on ice... bao bao!"
34281,Homer,uh-oh.
34286,Homer,"ooo, you're hot when you're horny..."
34300,Homer,"that's a great story, lisa! and you should stop reading right there."
34307,Homer,"listen, wrinkles! if you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. or i can make things very uncomfortable for you."
34315,Homer,i say this boy needs more homework.
34316,Homer,"i don't have to do it with him, do i?"
34318,Homer,"hm. clean dishes. i either have to unload them, or, uh..."
34326,Homer,you don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
34327,Homer,well don't be wrong in front of our son!
34330,Homer,what the?! then i wanna eat at moe's express!
34332,Homer,well how could i ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
34338,Homer,let me say to you all: i'm pretty sure this is not a dream!
34349,Homer,yeah.
34354,Homer,fine. i'll do both at once. we should both take a role in vacation planning!
34355,Homer,bart!
34366,Homer,"seatbelts, kids!"
34369,Homer,your mother thinks i'm working on the car!
34370,Homer,talk to grampa. he used to be a man.
34379,Homer,i finally caught one of bart's school plays.
34388,Homer,they're okay with applesauce.
34389,Homer,a truckload of applesauce!
34390,Homer,"flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. but the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
34392,Homer,he's going for the record! he's going for the record!
34393,Homer,"flanders, you're not supposed to help him."
34395,Homer,pan-thers!
34398,Homer,that is going right on stupidflanders.org.
34399,Homer,"this really means a lot to you, huh?"
34402,Homer,"i'm not, it's my ringtone."
34410,Homer,"but he is buried here, right?"
34414,Homer,what? but i thought we'd be neighbors in heaven. goofing on all the new dead people...
34426,Homer,"pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato."
34431,Homer,"as you wish, but look not upon her with lust. and do not send her friendly emails. that's how it begins."
34436,Homer,"because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? they tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. but we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
34444,Homer,"i say burns owes us a party. let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
34451,Homer,but--
34461,Homer,use that image any way you want.
34464,Homer,i don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
34466,Homer,ooh! we mock your very decency.
34468,Homer,"well, at least we've got the best asbestos."
34469,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but i wish mr. burns was back."
34479,Homer,"shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything."
34485,Homer,okay. ever been to moe's?
34488,Homer,"oh man, this is so awesome! i can't believe i'm having breakfast where the cops do."
34490,Homer,wow. so this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
34500,Homer,is he gonna be okay?
34516,Homer,"well, i was kind of ungrateful. you did save my life."
34522,Homer,"no, ice cold."
34524,Homer,"it's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. lamp, computer, jacob's ladder..."
34525,Homer,how long has this been running?
34526,Homer,are you calling me fat?
34528,Homer,"now, on to the next funny booth."
34531,Homer,"well, i'm not usually one to take the word of a dane... plus, how can i afford it?"
34533,Homer,"hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
34538,Homer,"hello, local utility? you greedy bastards have gouged homer simpson for the last time."
34545,Homer,but we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
34552,Homer,"man, who are these belts made for, french supermodels?"
34553,Homer,"sure. lisa, bring the car around."
34559,Homer,coming!
34563,Homer,it was my idea to put the whale in the water.
34569,Homer,"now, lisa, i know you miss your whale. so i got you a pet that will never die. an invisible dog."
34570,Homer,"aw, look. he's doing his business."
34571,Homer,"hey! not on the rug! you bad dog! ow! ow! ow! stop biting my leg! ow! alright, that's it! you're going outside!"
34573,Homer,why couldn't i be eaten by a giraffe? that would be fun!
34584,Homer,"hey, i'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which i mean you."
34587,Homer,guess what company had a giveaway at moe's last night?
34591,Homer,i'll have to check it out sometime.
34594,Homer,i'm on my way!
34596,Homer,woo-hoo!
34597,Homer,/
34617,Homer,"so, marge, what were we talking about?"
34618,Homer,"sorry, honey. i wasn't listening. and i won't be listening now."
34623,Homer,moe is running off with one of our wives?!
34637,Homer,why you--
34644,Homer,i don't know.
34649,Homer,she's packing her bag!
34663,Homer,"stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette."
34664,Homer,ice cream!
34665,Homer,nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
34672,Homer,"help us! help us, for the love of god! won't somebody help us?!"
34691,Homer,after the title page it's bob dole's memoirs.
34693,Homer,i organized the kitchen. i labeled everything with a label maker...
34699,Homer,"well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. so, i decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny i left in my pants went."
34715,Homer,"uh, what region is america?"
34718,Homer,fifty bucks each?! that's your life savings?!
34721,Homer,"well, it's a cat -- i'm not sure it's the cat."
34722,Homer,"you know what, honey? just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
34723,Homer,"after bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made."
34724,Homer,"come on, marge -- let's hit the buffet."
34729,Homer,check and mate.
34731,Homer,"you got to enjoy that bag for nothing! we can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
34735,Homer,i wish. what the hell are you doing?!
34740,Homer,how do you know my name?
34746,Homer,"hello, flanders. don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
34748,Homer,"that's a problem for future homer. man, i don't envy that guy."
34749,Homer,"hey pal, howya doin'?"
34751,Homer,woo hoo! underpants dinner!
34753,Homer,"sorry marge, i gotta call bullcrap on that. the '69 mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about ron swoboda's wife and kids? not me -- and, i assume, not ron swoboda!"
34756,Homer,...then pete rose plowed into his friend ray fosse...
34761,Homer,"oh man, i'm never comin' down."
34776,Homer,"marge, can i have a word with you in private?"
34782,Homer,"well, we'd better do it quick. because he's making scones!"
34784,Homer,never mind.
34785,Homer,"ooh, got a text."
34788,Homer,this proves nothing. roger could've been the one that killed them!
34792,Homer,"we had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
34801,Homer,i get the drumstick!
34806,Homer,excuse me?
34811,Homer,pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
34812,Homer,"whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
34815,Homer,and not the good kind!
34821,Homer,"nice part of town you got here. too bad you keep it so far away. now that we're best friends, can i get the baby elf?"
34825,Homer,you're lucky you're behind glass.
34826,Homer,"sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
34831,Homer,be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
34834,Homer,"what is troubling you, my son? i mean, my girl son?"
34835,Homer,"hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. sooner or later, everyone meets their ""homer."""
34837,Homer,"oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. g'night."
34839,Homer,"nothing, sweetie, nothing! here, let me explain."
34861,Homer,"marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you."
34868,Homer,"yeah, i've done all i can do in that medium."
34870,Homer,"and so the bloody hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
34871,Homer,"ker-shaw, ker-shew / i'm after you / with my bloody noose / strong enough to hang ten moose / ker-shaw, ker-shew / it's just a story, but it's really true!"
34882,Homer,"hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
34883,Homer,danica patrick in my thoughts!
34889,Homer,stupid dog!
34892,Homer,a shrink who takes kids and pets?
34895,Homer,oh baby! well whaddaya know! oh come on!
34900,Homer,it was still too much.
34903,Homer,"marge, i'm watching a rerun of an important bowl game."
34912,Homer,"i'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
34914,Homer,it's almost over.
34917,Homer,"kids, remember when i promised to feed us from that victory garden? well, instead i grew this tree!"
34919,Homer,"sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could."
34921,Homer,why couldn't it have been me?
34926,Homer,"now remember, pack only necessities."
34932,Homer,ai-yi-yi-yi!
34933,Homer,i got the week off by telling mr. burns i had a neck injury!
34934,Homer,"mr. burns, why'd you come to see me?"
34936,Homer,coming!
34937,Homer,"fine, i'll come clean."
34944,Homer,what the hell?!
34945,Homer,"c'mon, lou. gimme a break!"
34947,Homer,this is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
34950,Homer,ten minutes? i can't wait that long! i left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!
34963,Homer,ayyyy! ohhhh! ayyyy! ohhhh!
34964,Homer,fuhgetaboutit!
34968,Homer,just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
34971,Homer,but i haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
34973,Homer,blue pants power!
34975,Homer,oh. that beating.
34987,Homer,"well, i guess i could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette."
34989,Homer,this is horrible! i keep smelling my own breath!
34990,Homer,my neck is kind of itchy.
34992,Homer,"tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
34994,Homer,ayyyy!
35004,Homer,"no, no, i oversold it."
35018,Homer,"and me? now, i'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
35022,Homer,are you through with the chair? i've got to do the taxes.
35025,Homer,hm.
35026,Homer,"been a while since our wives got together, huh?"
35029,Homer,because you're my best friend in the room.
35032,Homer,stupid flanders' wi-fi!
35033,Homer,"ion. hmm... no. ""irene ryan is tv's granny."""
35034,Homer,this is late for marge. i assume. i've never been home at this hour.
35036,Homer,great. that's great. but i have to get to work in the morning.
35052,Homer,"check out my tolerance, marge. i'm going to use the men's room."
35056,Homer,everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
35068,Homer,"marge, not in front of the refrigerator."
35072,Homer,that's great.
35075,Homer,"hmm, if this were a tv show that would be a helluva act break."
35077,Homer,you still see that crow on shows sometimes.
35079,Homer,can't lose that. it's the best picture of me i have.
35094,Homer,step away from the traitor!
35100,Homer,"well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the tv."
35105,Homer,drive my kids to school?! never!
35108,Homer,"oh marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties."
35117,Homer,"yes, that's exactly it!"
35125,Homer,"marge, marge, put down that broom. you've got nothing to be afraid of from them. i'm a wingman. part of a great tradition including val kilmer from ""top gun,"" wedge antilles from ""star wars,"" and me, from now. and you know why i'm a great wingman? because i have the confidence that comes from knowing i get to go home to you."
35128,Homer,"well, i guess i do have a ""type."""
35138,Homer,"wealthy? hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. eh?"
35143,Homer,he what?...
35145,Homer,observe.
35157,Homer,i'd like to thank mr. speedy pants repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the bangles. see you at the cool party!
35159,Homer,"if i find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble."
35161,Homer,oscars? what are you talking about? my son gave me this list of awesome things to do in l.a.
35162,Homer,hmm... who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
35166,Homer,"oh, hi! ricky gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, sir ridley. i love your movies. or as i call them, ""films."" umm, glad i bumped into you, actually. because, uh, i'm looking to expand beyond comedy. i know what you're thinking, sir ridley. you're thinking ""oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. i'm gonna have to put him in my new film. what do you think?"
35172,Homer,it does!
35174,Homer,why are you guys eating so fast?
35191,Homer,flat tire? no problem!
35195,Homer,"their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
35207,Homer,i can't do reefer comedy -- i'm drunk. two different animals.
35213,Homer,yes! will i get to meet dave?
35219,Homer,"don't worry, cheech. i know all the classic bits of you and chong."
35232,Homer,stop speaking spanish!
35233,Homer,it's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from cheech and chunk.
35234,Homer,"yes, sir."
35242,Homer,"come on, surrender to the moment! don't make the mistake i always do of thinking too much before you act!"
35258,Homer,"well, this has been great. we should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting."
35259,Homer,"oh, that's right! i hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city."
35261,Homer,"come on, party pooper -- bust a move!"
35267,Homer,"oh, i don't know if i can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. i-- whoo!... but i sincerely whoo!"
35274,Homer,"well of course, i would love to be a more sensitive father. you know that."
35277,Homer,i miss my friends from drunk driving school. they were so cool.
35286,Homer,"no doc, please! i'm just a little boy!"
35287,Homer,"dr. zander, you made me see my life through bart's neck, and i swear, i will never, ever strangle my boy again."
35289,Homer,"hello, boy."
35301,Homer,all right.
35302,Homer,why you little...
35309,Homer,what?!
35315,Homer,"son, you and i are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist."
35331,Homer,"i'll save you, lisa!"
35333,Homer,"and, here you go. ""do not give your coat to--"" dammit!"
35339,Homer,"well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" blob and blob lite. tweedle yuck and tweedle blecch."
35343,Homer,i'm trying. i swear i'm trying.
35346,Homer,i decorated her car for nothing.
35348,Homer,"fat tony! are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at christmas? and then an old italian nun finds it. and she's all... no, no, no, oh, no, no! he's too beautiful to die! ohhhh!"
35360,Homer,you know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
35363,Homer,sorry.
35364,Homer,how could tony cheat on me so soon?
35369,Homer,"you were right, marge. these people are not for us."
35374,Homer,"fine, whatever."
35375,Homer,i'll just keep cutting till i hit something solid.
35385,Homer,woo hoo!
35394,Homer,"oh yeah. men are such dogs, and vice versa."
35399,Homer,when i look at you -- all i see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! foibles! foibles! foibles!
35400,Homer,"sorry sarah, i'm retired."
35404,Homer,"c'mon, bro, don't hassle me!"
35405,Homer,"stop that. okay, okay. you win. i'll teach you how to make love to your wife!"
35407,Homer,"i can't. they won't let me. lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
35408,Homer,suck! of course!
35414,Homer,another hairdresser?
35417,Homer,"i love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
35421,Homer,time for a shortcut.
35426,Homer,who's alone in the vehicle?
35428,Homer,maggie!
35429,Homer,"well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. this is from a gas station men's room. they put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. these are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
35443,Homer,"hey, kids!"
35448,Homer,xbox.
35455,Homer,all pooted out.
35457,Homer,little help...
35458,Homer,but you learned! you grew!
35467,Homer,"whoa! flanders, this chick does not get our thing!"
35468,Homer,"yeah, language."
35472,Homer,just the opposite of real life.
35473,Homer,"yeah, isn't this place great? if you're single you can come here every night."
35476,Homer,"oh ned, i never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
35499,Homer,duck in the bathroom.
35503,Homer,"while i'm here, i might as well pre-punch out..."
35507,Homer,"uh, listen, if you could indulge me... larry and i fist-bump every morning. like that..."
35518,Homer,"charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
35530,Homer,sure. why not.
35532,Homer,"wayne, stop! that's mr. burns."
35536,Homer,that robot took our jobs!
35537,Homer,he said it.
35538,Homer,or maybe it was him.
35540,Homer,"your voice is so gravelly, just like lauren bacall's."
35542,Homer,"not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
35564,Homer,i don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
35569,Homer,what? two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
35576,Homer,are you covering me up?!
35579,Homer,okay... i'm on the floor... i can't move... so far a normal sunday morning.
35592,Homer,"oh man, what's this bite gonna do? my wrists are tingling... i feel new powers surging within me..."
35593,Homer,"...i want you to find out what's making that funny noise in homer simpson's car. it's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. but you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. and you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
35603,Homer,"""in the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"
35605,Homer,"assistant? well, i have been pretty overworked lately."
35625,Homer,up or down?
35629,Homer,this is terrible. what am i gonna do?
35639,Homer,"i'm having problems with my new boss roz. she's the most evil person to come out of ohio since lebron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
35644,Homer,hail flanders! mightier than jesus!
35646,Homer,"uh, i just came to say that you're perfect. so perfect, i think mr. burns should give you a hug."
35650,Homer,what is perception?
35653,Homer,need more butter! and not the unsalted.
35656,Homer,is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
35657,Homer,"wow, video games sure have changed since i was a kid. how many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? thirty thousand? certainly not fifty."
35659,Homer,"man, how many quarters does this game take?"
35680,Homer,jealous? me?! that is to laugh! the very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
35684,Homer,really? you'd let me in on your thing? even though i think it's stupid?
35689,Homer,food dad! food dad! food dad!
35706,Homer,this better be dinner theater!
35709,Homer,now that's my kind of foam.
35715,Homer,"all right, you can each have one toy."
35729,Homer,you're the zephyr.
35730,Homer,it won't be like kansas city.
35734,Homer,you're in.
35746,Homer,or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
35747,Homer,no.
35753,Homer,british fonzie is right. our story is actually more important... than money.
35755,Homer,kansas city.
35756,Homer,woo-hoo! all right!
35758,Homer,"hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
35760,Homer,so... why are you here? is it about that unauthorized krusty lookalike i hired for lisa's first communion? what was his name?
35763,Homer,"good one... uh... mr. burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke."
35764,Homer,"c'mon, just pick a popular song."
35769,Homer,"the last thing i understood in that was ""pants."""
35779,Homer,"yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect."
35780,Homer,"wow, i can't believe i'm eating steak with the mayor. the next time i vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
35783,Homer,"wow, these seats are amazing."
35798,Homer,"it already is killing me, marge. you're the only one i can talk to. my wife just doesn't get it."
35799,Homer,"my job is my wife. loneliness, my mistress. despair, my sex buddy. angst is a chick i met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy."
35812,Homer,"oh marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
35813,Homer,"not sure what you're going for, but"
35817,Homer,"uh-oh. if you've got that, then..."
35819,Homer,this family time is so precious. gotta go.
35821,Homer,my co-workers are like a family. but in some ways my family is like a family too...
35826,Homer,"yep, your worries are over. i'm back to being a boring old safety inspector at a nuclear power plant."
35829,Homer,my pants are splitting wide open!
35832,Homer,only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
35839,Homer,what about mimes?
35843,Homer,"i'll never eat turkey again. marge, we got any ham?"
35856,Homer,"hey, sweetie. marge said there was some family tension. and at christmas of all times."
35859,Homer,this is where my father is.
35862,Homer,"dad, these are your great-grandsons."
35871,Homer,absolutely. let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
35881,Homer,but i have to go to the bathroom!
35886,Homer,"look, all i want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!"
35888,Homer,i regret nothing... except this part!
35891,Homer,and why is there moisture in between the windows?!
35901,Homer,not so fast!
35903,Homer,"but i do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. i bet chuck the cameraman and steve the sound guy know where i'm coming from."
35904,Homer,"yeah, that's what i'm talkin' about! those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing americans!"
35905,Homer,"aw, son. now i regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
35906,Homer,finally. but i want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
35910,Homer,audio book read by lenny. i'm not just another loudmouth. i'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say but not racist things!
35911,Homer,let's go to the map.
35920,Homer,why? oh why?
35922,Homer,"welcome back to ""gut check."" i have something very, very pro-american to share with you. come with me."
35926,Homer,"when march madness spills into april -- that's the gravy! when someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! when you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"
35927,Homer,so get on the boat... the gravy boat.
35935,Homer,i don't know. can't we get chris christie to run?
35937,Homer,ted nugent! i made love on my honeymoon to your sweet music. you're my man.
35941,Homer,can we get some pizza on the way?
35942,Homer,they sell some at the gas station.
35944,Homer,do you give 'em out for fans? 'cause i'm a fan.
35945,Homer,what's this? some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
35949,Homer,"no, no, john hancock! i don't need insurance! sam adams, i'm sorry i made fun of your winter ale!"
35952,Homer,"yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?"
35964,Homer,my fellow americans... i am full of crap.
35970,Homer,down in front!
35972,Homer,but i'm invested in the characters.
35973,Homer,i make my own turnoffs.
35982,Homer,woo hoo!
35983,Homer,unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
35984,Homer,draw the curtain.
35994,Homer,and i've created something that created something incredibly popular!
35997,Homer,then why did you say it?
36002,Homer,what the! that idiot cut me off!
36003,Homer,"i'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his springface profile picture to a shot of a monkey. get that, marge? a monkey!"
36006,Homer,"come on, lisa!"
36010,Homer,witty.
36014,Homer,"oh marge, this is brilliant."
36034,Homer,"don't worry. my last words will be ""i can outrun that lion."""
36042,Homer,"yeah. we're like family to you. i'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
36044,Homer,"now, now, now just a second here! now, i know we're not perfect. but, uh, i believe it was sammy hagar who said--"
36045,Homer,"i always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
36047,Homer,"wait! if you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
36052,Homer,fine.
36053,Homer,please. put that down.
36060,Homer,"yep, i never realized how much i hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
36062,Homer,"hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
36064,Homer,"oh, ""smithers""!"
36066,Homer,excellent.
36068,Homer,do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
36076,Homer,nooo!
36079,Homer,"this is the outlands, boy. ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! power on!"
36080,Homer,"i was wrong, there are bad ideas! there are terrible ideas!"
36089,Homer,yes! awake! let's do this!
36091,Homer,and brace yourself: i put some thought into it.
36097,Homer,wow. i don't believe the simpsons will be shopping at the kwik-e-mart anymore.
36100,Homer,would you sign this for my wife marge? she's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
36104,Homer,i repeat. one...
36107,Homer,onnneee.
36109,Homer,a pity kiss?! that tears it! i'm gonna call that paula paul and give her a piece of my mind!
36128,Homer,"hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
36132,Homer,"hey bart, check this out."
36133,Homer,"look at me, i'm mr. fatso! it's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."
36135,Homer,what? no! it can't be!
36141,Homer,"oh, what's the use? when a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
36143,Homer,you just ruined my car.
36158,Homer,a common misconception.
36162,Homer,"marge, from time to time i've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" where would i find this marvelous contraption?"
36173,Homer,free? uh...
36178,Homer,now that's what i call looking out for number one.
36180,Homer,you stupid...
36181,Homer,"son, i'm afraid the uralarm whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke."
36185,Homer,what about cupid? he's smokin' hot.
36190,Homer,my brain's fine! in my dreams i'm an intermediate skier!
36201,Homer,"thank you, death. and may i ask what's taking so long with larry king?"
36205,Homer,wow!
36207,Homer,why you little...
36213,Homer,goodbye.
36223,Homer,yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. i did it when i was in that alcohol-induced coma.
36226,Homer,"what the-- section 1 of article 21 of the state constitution is amended to read: section 1. in the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of congress at the beginning of each decade, the legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of congressional, state senate and assembly districts. liquor... mustn't think of liquor..."
36231,Homer,"oh man, i'd better have some coffee and iced tea."
36233,Homer,"then i'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! oooh, cake!"
36237,Homer,"oh lord, i have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. if you can weasel me out of this physical, i will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. amen. now to mumble in a religious fashion. dear god, oh, lord oh god, oh, lord..."
36239,Homer,a must!
36243,Homer,"nice parking, idiot."
36247,Homer,it's a simple question! are you a: working hard or b:
36248,Homer,"i guess i just met the joker of the group. better watch out for you on april fool's day, am i right? i said, am i right? am i r--"
36252,Homer,"when the moon hits your eye / like a big pizza pie / that's amore / when the world seems... when you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid."
36253,Homer,"ah, here it is: hydraulic systems flush... eeprom bios autoboot... conversation mode? they can talk?!"
36255,Homer,"well, at least it doesn't feel pain."
36266,Homer,"okay, i'm up again."
36279,Homer,no! i'm already using it to put my keys in!
36285,Homer,sonofa-- why did you do that?
36292,Homer,"guys, thank you. the words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but i'm glad yours was saving me. the saddest part is none of this had to happen, if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker. or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
36299,Homer,"okay, what's an appropriate movie for you boys?"
36303,Homer,"now, to save on calories, i won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie."
36307,Homer,ooh!
36311,Homer,it's programmed to my specifications!
36317,Homer,"huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet."
36324,Homer,sued it.
36326,Homer,"well, islands are always entertaining, from gilligan to iwo jima."
36336,Homer,and where...
36340,Homer,the kids are away and maggie's napping...
36348,Homer,"i'm sorry, sweetie. it's just a strandie discussion group. yes it is! we discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
36349,Homer,"thanks, marge. you ruined my show. now i'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
36363,Homer,then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
36368,Homer,and the ocean'll do all of the work!
36369,Homer,"ocean sex rules! go to hell, land sex!"
36375,Homer,"man, i kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! i won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! i got robbed by marauders on the way home."
36378,Homer,choke on my numb blue hands!
36383,Homer,he turned that russian guy into swiss cheese!
36386,Homer,"oh man, marge is pissed. look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."
36388,Homer,yeah.
36407,Homer,i wish i could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
36413,Homer,sometimes marge says i turn it into a trashcan.
36418,Homer,you know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. how many hardboiled eggs do you think i can eat?
36426,Homer,"it was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. of course she fell for me and of course i wanted no part of her. now, the only one who can help us is stradivarius cain."
36444,Homer,"yes, sweetie?"
36446,Homer,"oh yes, lisa, very seriously. whee."
36449,Homer,what?! why do i succeed at everything i audition for?
36453,Homer,"mmm, historically inaccurate."
36458,Homer,"outta my way, stupid flanders!"
36466,Homer,"why you little... they're both bad, and i suspect you know it!"
36471,Homer,"he took the time to press the shift key, marge! i think he knows what he's talking about."
36472,Homer,"oh marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies."
36475,Homer,because his avatar is darth maul! the second-coolest darth!
36477,Homer,"yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry."
36480,Homer,i thought i heard clicks and pops!
36485,Homer,where are they going with this?
36492,Homer,"hey lisa, come on."
36495,Homer,can i just trim the hem?
36498,Homer,"lisa, can you come down?"
36499,Homer,"sweetie, i've been thinking. now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. the problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught."
36501,Homer,parenting. it's the one job you always know you're doing right.
36502,Homer,"i love my homer face yeah that's what i said / right where it should be on the front of my head / stubble, muzzle, overbite, two eyes that really bug / these are the components of my homer-riffic mug / d'oh, oooh, d'oh, oooh, / i shave it close, trim hairs from my nose / d'oh, oooh, d'oh, oooh, i clean my ears, 'cause that's how i hears / i like my / i like my / i really like my homer face"
36505,Homer,gap's too small!
36516,Homer,but they're playing the purple sox!
36521,Homer,it didn't feel like success.
36531,Homer,"oh-oh-oh oh, thank god you woke up!"
36534,Homer,damn you and your fluted neck!
36539,Homer,"heh, no kidding, i saw your reviews."
36541,Homer,do we screw them on the credit?
36542,Homer,at least the pennant works both ways.
36544,Homer,two stray dogs?
36555,Homer,nope. / not me. / do we even still have that thing?
36558,Homer,day one.
36561,Homer,a hero.
36567,Homer,wait! don't kill the monster without me!
36569,Homer,what the?
36579,Homer,"you, me and marge?"
36581,Homer,"now, before we start, what's the safe word?"
36585,Homer,i'll get right on it.
36594,Homer,"wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth."
36601,Homer,"whatever you want, sweetie."
36605,Homer,"honey, i am so sorry. i guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have."
36611,Homer,watch it!
36622,Homer,"okay, good, we're talking..."
36631,Homer,"well, i expected a little argument."
36632,Homer,"geez. i mean, i'm no luis guzman, but i'm all right."
36636,Homer,but i was really looking forward to...
36638,Homer,"two adults, please."
36640,Homer,pushy sign! don't tell me what to try!
36649,Homer,that settles it. no banks for me.
36652,Homer,"open file, click and...invested! hey lisa, check out your college fund!"
36659,Homer,i'm not superman.
36670,Homer,"flimsy lead, take me away!"
36671,Homer,"excuse me, have you seen this man?"
36684,Homer,"well, it's a good thing i didn't because i'd be pretty devastated right now."
36689,Homer,"hey, i'm startin' to remember why i don't remember so much."
36706,Homer,"when i prayed for this concert to be over, i didn't mean like this!"
36708,Homer,bart! this is america. anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
36712,Homer,oh?
36724,Homer,will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
36727,Homer,have fun getting coffee for roy disney the third.
36733,Homer,stop!
36738,Homer,"look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. give it to me!"
36739,Homer,i knew you were weak.
36740,Homer,"you are weak, but no."
36743,Homer,"you're making me mad and i want, i want to shoot you now! / i don't have to see it."
36745,Homer,"come on weakling, get it from me."
36747,Homer,"well, you ain't so--"
36753,Homer,can this day get any worse?
36764,Homer,"you can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""tapped out."""
36769,Homer,but i'm not alone. i'm doing some face time with lenny.
36777,Homer,aww. that'll be my screensaver.
36778,Homer,why you little...
36787,Homer,"dohhh! sauce, cheese, topping!"
36789,Homer,it still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
36791,Homer,"oh lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. then you switched it off knowing full well i had declined thy infernal mapple care. please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. and please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen."
36799,Homer,"moe, i could believe this was a random occurrence, or i could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. i'm choosin' hope! moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
36805,Homer,i don't know what to believe anymore. maybe it's time to call satan. is that a two-one-two?
36808,Homer,guess it must've been the person who knew i needed hope most of all.
36825,Homer,no more donuts?
36828,Homer,tell me everything about you.
36829,Homer,you're from portland? i've heard of people being from there.
36838,Homer,"okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. i've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, i assume -- so don't screw it up."
36842,Homer,check out my new look!
36846,Homer,"boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. it's not gonna win me back."
36848,Homer,"honey, i'm not cool. i was never cool. i didn't go to college. every cd i have i bought at a carwash. black-and-white films make me angry. i can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" i only know david cross from the chipmunks movie. not only do i like van halen, but i think they keep getting better..."
36851,Homer,"no, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. that's terence's parenting style--"
36852,Homer,"well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches."
36853,Homer,wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. the. essence.
36855,Homer,i hope t-rex likes the present i made him.
36858,Homer,i thought it made blimp tires!
36861,Homer,"o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up."
36873,Homer,"stupid town... at least i've still got moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going..."
36880,Homer,"your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!"
36884,Homer,"well, i can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt."
36898,Homer,it's real to them!
36905,Homer,not a crier.
36912,Homer,it's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
36917,Homer,"that's short for ""rrright you are!"""
36923,Homer,"i don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! wrong, wrong, wrong!"
36929,Homer,"and then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the santa part."
36931,Homer,"but, there was one thing i wasn't prepared for..."
36938,Homer,what flavor?
36939,Homer,"if it doesn't matter, then i call snickers."
36940,Homer,my dog.
36947,Homer,it's always my kids.
36958,Homer,what cool kid thing's in here?
36959,Homer,never!
36967,Homer,"oh my god! this unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!"
36969,Homer,it's based on nothing!
36970,Homer,"i'd slash my wrists! but how, without my electric knife?!"
36971,Homer,i can't conceive of any.
36978,Homer,maybe.
36981,Homer,"i wish. son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies."
36987,Homer,"aw. uh, listen, i've gotta know. you're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?"
37031,Homer,"all right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot."
37033,Homer,"we're cool, right boy?"
37037,Homer,"stay with me, man. stay with me."
37038,Homer,"no, no! you're the first successful business i've ever run!"
37039,Homer,"the pillows are safe at my workstation. as for the quarters... well, i'm ashamed to tell you what i did."
37040,Homer,how long have you been in there?
37042,Homer,...and i wish that mr. teeny gets a banana ... that the isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... i wish that wishing wells worked so i wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things i do ...
37043,Homer,"way to get us back on topic, marge."
37051,Homer,maybe the last words i'll ever write.
37054,Homer,that is the stupidest...
37071,Homer,"oh, how very kind of you. i am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! one lump, please."
37077,Homer,"okay, i'll nudge 'em with the car. we'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
37086,Homer,maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
37088,Homer,worrywart marge. you don't look a trojan horse in the mouth.
37097,Homer,"hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend."
37101,Homer,i don't like the way they just rip the paper off. santa's little helper my ass.
37114,Homer,why you little...
37116,Homer,i win!
37119,Homer,what the?
37132,Homer,when you're older.
37135,Homer,standard hotel boilerplate. it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
37140,Homer,shows how much she... knooooows! it's hurting my eyes!
37146,Homer,after we finish watching the movie.
37159,Homer,"if they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
37160,Homer,"okay, now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
37172,Homer,...thimble from monopoly game...
37176,Homer,wanna split it while we snuggle?
37196,Homer,"high-five me, marge!"
37212,Homer,"just admit who you are, and you can find new love."
37214,Homer,fine.
37224,Homer,"apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. just like you and me. swear to god."
37226,Homer,"heel? oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like grampa!"
37230,Homer,it's found footage!
37238,Homer,"now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, i'll be on my way."
37242,Homer,this room just got a whole lot cooler.
37252,Homer,"i hate unions. there's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
37255,Homer,"marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" but don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. so, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
37262,Homer,hmm...
37265,Homer,"it's not for me to judge, ned because... i am the better man!"
37269,Homer,"fear not, people. i will lead you safely across."
37271,Homer,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
37280,Homer,this is praying?! let me outta here!
37285,Homer,now have me sleeping under a cactus!
37291,Homer,her husband's gonna be there too.
37296,Homer,oh yeah.
37298,Homer,what? what? you're interesting. why would you say that?
37308,Homer,"well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch."
37312,Homer,fleeing didn't work. i have no choice. i will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!
37313,Homer,"i'm fightin' for ya, babe. fighting like i would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. and to show you how serious i am..."
37318,Homer,i think it would!
37321,Homer,where can i find a better voice-activated search machine?
37327,Homer,"oh. well, you know how in the special olympics they give medals just for showing up?"
37339,Homer,hello dere!
37341,Homer,"listen pal, this may sound kinda kinky, but i would like to, uh, please my wife."
37347,Homer,quick! call the procter and gamble help line!
37379,Homer,"it's an honor, sir."
37385,Homer,someone finally took one!
37386,Homer,day by day... day by day... the deacon's job... is pretty okay... pretty okaaay... i'm going to be a deacon... day by day... i'm already a deacon... day by day...
37387,Homer,"son, i'd love to, but... i'm a deacon now. my butt's place is in my pants."
37392,Homer,day by day / day by day / i've got three kids / and two are okay / two are okay! / one of them is the baby / the smart one is mine maybe / i hope the boy gets rabies / day by day by day / day by day... / oh i pray / day by day by day by daaay!
37397,Homer,...so i stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
37398,Homer,nothin's gonna delete these!
37400,Homer,i took a class where you do chest compressions to a bee gees song.
37401,Homer,how deep is your love... how deep is your love...
37406,Homer,"well, uh, i was just leaving, but moe... had an accident."
37413,Homer,the crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
37423,Homer,sausage fingers!
37430,Homer,you're cool with it? i haven't even told my wife.
37433,Homer,"yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true."
37435,Homer,"no, it's something else."
37440,Homer,to me it's legs versus boobs.
37452,Homer,to the best feeling in the world -- money.
37453,Homer,"guys, i got big plans for these winnings. i'm going to build... a swimming pool."
37456,Homer,i hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
37463,Homer,"i know, me too. it's the ultimate screw-over."
37469,Homer,i thought it was superman's superman-cave.
37472,Homer,i've already taken care of that.
37474,Homer,"just say he's black, moe."
37496,Homer,"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. the carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."
37497,Homer,"the carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
37502,Homer,"i've learned something about the people of iceland. you've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister."
37503,Homer,"you've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. and to do that, you have to be stubborn."
37508,Homer,we don't get together to share our emotions. we get together to escape them.
37524,Homer,she won't see it like this. i'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
37525,Homer,you stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
37531,Homer,"marge, i am focused on this like a laser. ""laser."" that's a funny word. it's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" and speaking of losers, i've lost my train of thought. oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
37536,Homer,"um, marge, i have to go."
37545,Homer,"and what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
37547,Homer,"wow, moe. great shrub costume."
37551,Homer,costume drama or naughty comedy?
37553,Homer,"my only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; i often go online to see how lindsay wagner's looking now - fabulous; and i once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. but it's no secret how much i love my margie."
37561,Homer,"ooh, my lava's almost cooled!"
37565,Homer,i'm gonna have forty key chains! / and i don't even have forty keys! / swag!
37577,Homer,"uh, i'll pass on the pork."
37580,Homer,can i just get a glass of water?
37586,Homer,and do you love lasagna... like me?
37588,Homer,"hanging up the receiver, eh?"
37589,Homer,how much did you say?
37591,Homer,lisa. i'll miss you when this is all over.
37592,Homer,this conversation.
37611,Homer,and they also gave me an alcohol detox.
37622,Homer,"hey, hey, it's not what you think, lou. lou! lou! lou! lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
37628,Homer,oops.
37630,Homer,"hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, i finally get my man cave."
37641,Homer,"marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus."
37646,Homer,the poor lonely fellow is about to die.
37647,Homer,"let me worry about how. but you know, you could make his last day a happy one. and the ring is just the icing on the cake."
37648,Homer,the ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. now let's get you married.
37654,Homer,one of us! gooble goo!
37661,Homer,"...and that, kids, is how i met your mother."
37672,Homer,you misheard that on purpose!
37679,Homer,what the?
37684,Homer,and together we are.
37685,Homer,"i'll handle this. ""dear weirdo, pick up weirdo kid."" and send."
37692,Homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."
37698,Homer,eduardo?! is it really you? why are you here?
37703,Homer,do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
37709,Homer,"i don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but i feel great."
37711,Homer,"mmm, melon collie."
37712,Homer,"well, what was your childhood dream?"
37715,Homer,eduardo. i haven't felt this good in years. you're like the tooth fairy except you don't collect human bones.
37722,Homer,"ooh, indigo!"
37725,Homer,"aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half."
37728,Homer,"no matter what, homer simpson has done it. and soon i hope i remember who homer simpson is and his relationship to me. but i have no regrets. in fact, all this has given me a sense of calm i've never had before."
37730,Homer,eduardo? eduardo! eduardo!
37733,Homer,"no time for breakfast, marge. just give me a banana."
37739,Homer,"who's president now, alexander hamilton?"
37743,Homer,everyone has a cellphone. mine's at home.
37747,Homer,you like lies? here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...
37748,Homer,"okay homer, remember your lamaze training..."
37752,Homer,"oh! oh wait, there's more!"
37758,Homer,"good game, everyone. i never dreamed a night where you'd discovered i was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note."
37766,Homer,where's hoju? where's hoju? where's hoju?!
37772,Homer,"um, november."
37774,Homer,oh baby!
37777,Homer,tell me what a cow says!
37778,Homer,my other baby mama!
37779,Homer,"marge, it's not what you think!"
37788,Homer,"oh man, i really overdid it tonight."
37789,Homer,"no. i'm exhausted from ""head, shoulders, knees and toes. knees and toes."" it's the ""toes"" that get ya, marge. it's the toes..."
37790,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge. i am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
37794,Homer,"hey, oh oh oh! now maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
37797,Homer,"okay, i know what'll cheer you kids up. seeing me out-monkey the monkeys."
37801,Homer,"i'm sorry, homer junior. you'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill."
37808,Homer,"i guess this is it, little guy."
37809,Homer,the most beautiful words a father can hear.
37814,Homer,that's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.
37821,Homer,fine. you're mike singletary. enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
37854,Homer,"oh, you know what this means, kids?"
37870,Homer,what? i'm saving them from the struggle of life.
37871,Homer,vegetables?!
37874,Homer,"come on, i'll drive you to the airport."
37880,Homer,"they're talking about the movie! hurry up, you idiot! no, no, don't stop! i'm sorry i got mad. i'll do that thing you like."
37883,Homer,"if you all go, then i have to pay for a babysitter!"
37884,Homer,emily-beth? we can't afford emily-beth! she brings her own puppets!
37891,Homer,"hey... they tricked us! that's a commercial! if i wanted to pay for commercials i can't skip, i'd sign up for hulu plus!"
37893,Homer,"what happened to the movies? first they got worse than tv, and now this!"
37900,Homer,"gentlemen, i am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
37902,Homer,"welcome to ""cinema pirate-diso."" tonight's movie is ""life is funny,"" directed by judd apatow. it's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. so for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
37909,Homer,one of you turned me in? who was it?
37915,Homer,whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
37927,Homer,well you did. and they got laughs. solid laughs.
37931,Homer,at first my wife didn't believe in me. maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
37940,Homer,and tell your friends it was great! buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
37949,Homer,and now to moe's.
37955,Homer,"not garbage, americana."
37957,Homer,not a word.
37969,Homer,glowing rods / glowing rods / it's making me / weak and dizzy...
37970,Homer,who told you that?
37980,Homer,"springfield city hall was built for the spencer tracy movie ""meet me at city hall"". it was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
37983,Homer,"glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant i can afford."
37987,Homer,"squeeze here. rotate there. pause for sweet talk. oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
37993,Homer,about the glasses...
37997,Homer,"anyway, i'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
37998,Homer,"hey, everybody!"
38004,Homer,"um, mr. burns, sir? can i get another pair of glasses? maybe two pair. one for the beach house. can i also get a beach house? two beach houses..."
38006,Homer,what the-- burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
38017,Homer,mr. burns!
38033,Homer,"well, as long as i'm paying for the time..."
38034,Homer,"ow! where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
38036,Homer,"okay, marge. but first, well, i have something i need to tell you. something i did you might be mad about, and rightly so."
38040,Homer,who bought it?
38041,Homer,excuse me. i have to make a call.
38044,Homer,"sorry son, i only have twenties. and if god needs money, why doesn't he just write another bible? the first one sold pretty well."
38051,Homer,where's... my... mon... ey?
38053,Homer,"pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, marge."
38054,Homer,quit pressuring me!
38060,Homer,"oh, i know what that means. there comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. finally! i was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
38074,Homer,"i'm eating the food of the future. beep, boop. what is... love? boop, beep, boop."
38076,Homer,go! go! go!
38077,Homer,real doctor or phd?
38082,Homer,that's why i've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
38083,Homer,i like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
38086,Homer,sorry.
38090,Homer,how dare you torture my children with mozart!
38092,Homer,"if it's not final, who cares?"
38093,Homer,"if it's important, they'll call back."
38101,Homer,"i mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
38112,Homer,oh my god! this counts as exercise? i'm barely moving and i'm smelling cinnebun. sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. i'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
38113,Homer,"uh, okay! um... i can't."
38118,Homer,falsies.
38119,Homer,oh my god! i know that kid! we've gotta help him!
38129,Homer,emojis. now she's gone too far.
38132,Homer,"the kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave."
38135,Homer,she thinks she's decided. don't say a thing. don't blow this!
38137,Homer,kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
38145,Homer,"nobody touch it! bart, stop looking at it!"
38146,Homer,"no, you'll wear it out!"
38148,Homer,"split it? whoa. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
38152,Homer,whoa! whoa! whoa!
38157,Homer,"are they, marge? if you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
38162,Homer,homer looks into marge's eyes.
38174,Homer,"with that painting we could have what these people have. a money cushion. no more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
38179,Homer,"the paddles, marge! look at the paddles!"
38181,Homer,"excuse me, we're trying to find ""caf√© artiste."""
38184,Homer,"so, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
38186,Homer,"okay, all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde, find caf√© artiste, and they'll back up kirk's story. that will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
38195,Homer,who?
38198,Homer,then why did the auction house say it was real?
38207,Homer,pathetic.
38212,Homer,"lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."
38213,Homer,when did you come up with the idea? you must've worked on it for days.
38218,Homer,"of course i am, but how do you know?"
38223,Homer,it's okay. i'm an american!
38224,Homer,"sure, why not?"
38226,Homer,i believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one d would disagree with you.
38230,Homer,the stomach wants what it wants. i need some air.
38235,Homer,get outta here!
38240,Homer,why so quiet?
38244,Homer,fine. marge is always complaining i never fix things. give me another.
38245,Homer,i carry my own.
38259,Homer,no penalty.
38260,Homer,i've never seen anything so beautiful.
38263,Homer,um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. turn on eighty-nine point nine.
38269,Homer,"am i gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
38275,Homer,"yes i did! i heard ""competitive eater""!"
38282,Homer,wait. let me get this straight. sit and eat? that's my punishment?
38292,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid!"
38295,Homer,woo-hoo! i got a date with my daughter!
38302,Homer,"maggie, help me with this shirt."
38317,Homer,"oh, how much did i eat?!"
38320,Homer,legs pumping! blood flowing!
38321,Homer,two at a time! heart exploding.
38322,Homer,all that's left are clever last words.
38325,Homer,"amen, baby! did you make potato salad for the wake?"
38331,Homer,"bonk! bonk! bonk! ooh, corner! ba-donk!"
38333,Homer,"it's not exactly fun and games for me either, marge."
38337,Homer,just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...
38344,Homer,sure.
38346,Homer,"open your stance a little, there. yeah, that's it. do your worst, kids!"
38350,Homer,"lookin' good, santa's little hybrid."
38361,Homer,yeah... well just talk about sports!
38363,Homer,and you never bought a replacement?
38365,Homer,"what is your problem, boy?"
38367,Homer,eat the nuts! they're your dinner!
38371,Homer,"do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
38373,Homer,anything else?
38377,Homer,"huh? maybe you're right, boy. it's time i was a better father. and i'll start by saving us. i just need to facilitate some horse intercourse."
38380,Homer,not like that. it's like this. ...smithers ... ...mr. largo... ...danny kaye... what? everyone knows.
38383,Homer,that horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
38390,Homer,roll in hay!
38397,Homer,fine.
38403,Homer,oh. thank you. why was that on the military history channel?
38412,Homer,"well, as we say in russia: ""goodbye in russian""!"
38415,Homer,more?
38416,Homer,what the?
38423,Homer,it might be easier with maggie. she's always getting letters from the daycare center.
38435,Homer,"dad, is that story really true?"
38437,Homer,"don't worry, marge. as a favor to you, i'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp."
38439,Homer,"ah, july fourth-- no fireworks?! can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?"
38440,Homer,"marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. the fourth of july is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into america's car window. god bless her."
38456,Homer,sometimes when we touch
38457,Homer,"one more year, tops."
38460,Homer,it's a song? i thought we were just riffing.
38462,Homer,usher! will you stop that person who's shushing?!
38464,Homer,what's on tv?
38466,Homer,all muscle. in minnesota i'd be a supermodel!
38474,Homer,bubble wrap!
38475,Homer,"your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
38481,Homer,i'm in charge. you do what i say.
38489,Homer,today's our draft! i've got to pick a good fantasy team! when i lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
38491,Homer,"marge, i want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team."
38498,Homer,i don't know. eat your broccoli.
38513,Homer,are you crazy? we'll never make it! drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
38522,Homer,absolutely not.
38526,Homer,okily dokahama?!
38527,Homer,it's all gonna thaw!
38529,Homer,and i will wait and worry!
38532,Homer,"still hungry, buddy?"
38533,Homer,lucky.
38541,Homer,"well, you woke up the right man in bed."
38542,Homer,"i love you, marjorie. and i've had my share of failures, sure. and sometimes i get pretty nervous. but thanks for talking it out with me. i think i can finally get to sleep now."
38543,Homer,make love now?
38545,Homer,"marge, come on, let's celebrate! it's your first day!"
38553,Homer,whew!
38554,Homer,"marge, have you ever seen pants do this?"
38566,Homer,"yeah, i'll be sure to take a look at that."
38568,Homer,"bart, you went to hell and came back a winner, like jesus. now come on, boy! pull me apart like string cheese."
38571,Homer,stupid blood. asking me for a favor.
38573,Homer,the bed is lifting me! the elevator at work can't even do that! i demand you put me down right after the sex!
38576,Homer,"hey... if you're homer simpson, show me your driver's license."
38580,Homer,i can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
38581,Homer,can you be more specific?
38586,Homer,"i think he gets it. see, he--"
38592,Homer,wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. what's going on?
38596,Homer,safety first.
38601,Homer,and now i banish you from paradise! i'm glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
38610,Homer,authentic italian food.
38612,Homer,magical nonsense.
38615,Homer,high-quality spanish language programming.
38622,Homer,excellent?
38623,Homer,well... one.
38630,Homer,"was on fire. was. i finally get a job i was good at, and now i have to give it up."
38633,Homer,so you don't miss that politics lady at all?
38637,Homer,wait... i finally get what you're saying. fracking is great. but the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
38641,Homer,"relax, marge. it's probably just homer comin' home late from moe's."
38650,Homer,"okay, so what are you?"
38651,Homer,prove it. what happens to homer simpson in the future?
38657,Homer,you future guys have a word for everything... pal.
38662,Homer,what the?
38671,Homer,my bowling buddy.
38672,Homer,why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
38673,Homer,prove it. when's your birthday?
38679,Homer,"good night, friend. you'll always have a special place here with us."
38682,Homer,"oh, thank you."
38693,Homer,poking through.
38694,Homer,"oh, marge, i can't stand it when you cry at dinner. the pork chops look traumatized. the mashed potatoes can't stand watch. even the children seem upset. so trust me, i will come through for you, baby."
38696,Homer,"so, what do you say, marge?"
38697,Homer,and i want you to believe me too. isn't it great how much we agree?
38698,Homer,"compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
38708,Homer,a place that's filled with sun and sand / a desert steampunk disneyland / keep expectations lowww... / swing low sweet chariot...
38709,Homer,"homer simpson, i love you."
38730,Homer,oh my god... i'm amazing.
38736,Homer,"i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. like what's his name from the who. or that guy from led zeppelin who wasn't page, plant or bonham. those are the only two i know for sure."
38739,Homer,i don't know guys. i'm not sure i'm feeling this. the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
38744,Homer,"guys, are you feeling this? are you feeling this?"
38751,Homer,i still want one.
38753,Homer,"well son, i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write... down the names of and then cover. but then i remember: i'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
38765,Homer,i'm not jealous. i'm envious. jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. envy is wanting what someone else has. what i feel is envy.
38775,Homer,i'll never have a per diem.
38776,Homer,apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if i didn't help him get over his stage fright with his kwik-e-mart shirt...
38778,Homer,"look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. what a sellout. cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat..."
38789,Homer,i'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
38791,Homer,okay! okay! i'll stay for one beer.
38795,Homer,i am so late!
38796,Homer,"marge, think about what you're saying. it's sir isaac newton's birthday!"
38798,Homer,the ghost of marge future!
38806,Homer,gimme another one.
38813,Homer,... ...
38815,Homer,even the anchor store's closed.
38816,Homer,any uplifting holiday movies?
38820,Homer,flanders? what are you doing here?
38821,Homer,"say flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? and don't say ""jesus."""
38839,Homer,thank you magical creatures of the mall.
38840,Homer,you have all taught me a christmas message i'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.
38842,Homer,no.
38846,Homer,turn it off!
38848,Homer,"don't worry, this time i'm gonna write down where i parked."
38856,Homer,this is so fake.
38865,Homer,look at all these knobs and buttons. they are clearly a superior race. but maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
38869,Homer,i say we take this bucket home!
38875,Homer,you're the doctor.
38877,Homer,this isn't a happy thing!
38878,Homer,okay.
38888,Homer,and away we go!
38894,Homer,"sex mate? clearly you've never been married. but it's great, i'm telling you."
38899,Homer,you forgot to glaze me!
38901,Homer,"glaze, please."
38916,Homer,they have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
38925,Homer,dammit! this circus wi-fi is a joke!
38943,Homer,no i'm not.
38948,Homer,ew! gross!
38955,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
38957,Homer,hey! ow! ow! i thought you were my best friend! ow! ow!
38958,Homer,"um, mrs. simpson?"
38963,Homer,"...did i say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
38966,Homer,today was fun.
38972,Homer,...your ma says i should do something with you. need some help with your homework?
38978,Homer,change back to what?
38979,Homer,bloated corpse under the water. i'd say he's been there a few months at least. interesting the way his lips move just like mine. why do you ask?
38984,Homer,"marge, sweetie, i'm not gonna lie. i must have tied one on at moe's. if you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?"
38988,Homer,the best. wonder what ever happened to him.
38996,Homer,"this means war! boy, bring my toupee!"
39006,Homer,"okay. bart, think of a name. make it great. insanely, unbelievably great!"
39012,Homer,"and now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg."
39014,Homer,"hey elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where i work tomorrow."
39019,Homer,ditto.
39020,Homer,"aw, man, i wish those were white meatballs."
39023,Homer,um...
39024,Homer,i gotcha!
39025,Homer,well duh!
39028,Homer,"careful, elon. he's not as kindly as he appears."
39030,Homer,"wow. elon, you're like willie wonka without the underpaid munchkins."
39034,Homer,"well, i'm not one for just talking."
39036,Homer,since you came down from the sky
39038,Homer,you really came back from that tommy john surgery.
39039,Homer,more of what?
39040,Homer,"no. it's elon. i don't care how much he likes me, i don't wanna be friends with him anymore. none of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. sky pies are lie pies! of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?"
39046,Homer,"i could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am i."
39048,Homer,"well, i've saved you one last prize from the cracker jack box that is my brain. use it as you will."
39049,Homer,on a miami dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.
39055,Homer,simpler time.
39059,Homer,"thank you, roll of masking tape!"
39068,Homer,can't you say something to make me feel better?
39069,Homer,"fine. i got it. starting right now, a year-long juice cleanse; every morning, i get a colonic, and i sleep in a sauna every night."
39083,Homer,i am big.
39087,Homer,"no, marge! you have to listen! that place you sent me to changed my life!"
39092,Homer,"from now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words."
39093,Homer,"chubby, chunky, blobbo, slobbo, fat bastard, michelin man, stay-puft, chumbawamba, it is balloon!, papa grand√©, augustus gloop, beached whale, big boned, wisconsin skinny, butterball, dumptruck, jelly belly, pudgy wudgy, lard ass, blubberino, buddha belly, hurry eat tubman, one ton soup, blob saget, chub hub, calvin cool whip, manfred manboobs, 21 lump street, walking before picture, fatso, harvey milk chocolate, obese want cannoli, mahatma gumbo, salvador deli, elmer pantry, k.f.c. and the sponge cake band, snackie onassis... the foodie blues, hoagie carmichael and wide load."
39096,Homer,"sorry, fellas. there's a movement i have to join. i've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating."
39100,Homer,there we go. comin' up... what can i do for you?
39108,Homer,what albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. he knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
39112,Homer,can i ask you something? what is it that keeps you with me?
39125,Homer,we don't look at you that way.
39126,Homer,good ol' dae ho. used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. and all i had to do was let him copy some keys.
39127,Homer,that's where all the problems are!
39146,Homer,"uh, just a second. hey, marge. yeah, i'm workin' late. yep, special project."
39147,Homer,"sorry, marge. but i am the royal babysitter. if i start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
39152,Homer,can i try it?
39154,Homer,and you gave it to him?
39161,Homer,"guys, thanks for bailing me out. but i still have a huge problem."
39162,Homer,"um, yeah, sure. hello, this is the princess. i'm with homer simpson and i do declare he's wonderful. oh, that's right, i'm from south africa. fiddle dee dee."
39169,Homer,but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
39190,Homer,are you gonna put my head in a vise?
39194,Homer,i knew you had a vise! i knew it!
39195,Homer,no deal!
39202,Homer,pardon my galoshes.
39210,Homer,"marge, where's the extension cord?"
39211,Homer,sorry. i'm just a big kid and i love christmas so much.
39212,Homer,...every year.
39215,Homer,y'ello.
39224,Homer,mm-hmm... mmm-hmm... mmm-hmm...
39227,Homer,hey! what's with this?
39231,Homer,"oh, good. because i do love you and i don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."
39237,Homer,"well, let's see."
39243,Homer,wow. can i do that?
39246,Homer,"huh, when do we get paid?"
39267,Homer,"nobody knows. it's a secret. i didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on christmas, i'd do anything."
39275,Homer,santa?
39278,Homer,thirteen bucks. we can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
39281,Homer,"sorry, barney. i may be a total washout as a father, but i'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on christmas eve."
39283,Homer,"well, okay. let's go."
39286,Homer,"hey, barney, which one is whirlwind?"
39290,Homer,whoa! ninety-nine times thirteen equals mer-ry christmas!
39300,Homer,"find any winners, son?"
39307,Homer,bart!
39310,Homer,rudolph with your nose... over here... / so you can guide my sleigh today....
39312,Homer,"oh, wait! here's a good one -- ""do""."
39330,Homer,"come on, bart, your mother's only trying to help. so go ahead and enjoy the show."
39337,Homer,gotcha!
39340,Homer,"well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, i think. now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we simpsons have dreamed about for generations. you may outsmart someone."
39342,Homer,what?
39345,Homer,but i'm not a genius. why should i suffer?
39351,Homer,let's go get a burger.
39352,Homer,"sorry, bart. your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some swedish meatball."
39361,Homer,what?
39365,Homer,"but -- son, if you don't come out i can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
39366,Homer,nothin's easy.
39372,Homer,those perfectionists? forget it.
39373,Homer,i'm no supervising technician. i'm a technical supervisor. i've never done anything worthwhile in my life. i'm a big worthless nothing.
39377,Homer,"moe, i think i'll have another -- -- whoops. moe, i'm a little low on funds. you think could cover me just this once?"
39383,Homer,"there must be some beer here somewhere... ah, maybe in here."
39385,Homer,i need money!
39386,Homer,"oh, no, what have i done? i smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? a few measly cents. not even enough to buy one beer. wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
39388,Homer,"""dear family: i am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. by the time you read this, i will be in my watery grave. i can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'stand tall, have courage and never give up.' i only hope i can provide a better model in death than i did in life. warmest regards, love homer j. simpson."""
39391,Homer,"well, live and learn."
39396,Homer,i think we should put a stop sign at d street and twelfth. the other --
39400,Homer,"ah, what a great family! but come on, we all know this is small potatoes. there is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."
39404,Homer,thank you.
39406,Homer,"our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or i. many of them, incompetent boobs. i know this because i have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. and i say, this stinks!"
39411,Homer,"safety? but, sir, if truth be known, i actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. there were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
39426,Homer,"look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. i don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic."
39428,Homer,"i'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while i can, marge. i don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic."
39436,Homer,"why you, listen to me you..."
39437,Homer,"no, heh, heh, heh. just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man."
39443,Homer,gotcha!
39444,Homer,marge! knock it off!
39445,Homer,is it used?
39469,Homer,probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
39471,Homer,"no, no. i want to be alone with my thought."
39475,Homer,"you can't talk that way about my kids. or, at least two of them."
39480,Homer,"now, look, you know and i know this family needs help. professional help. so i made us an appointment with dr. marvin monroe."
39505,Homer,wow! five hundred smackers!
39512,Homer,"well, you see, boy. it never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
39519,Homer,"bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something."
39521,Homer,"so, what's the problem, son?"
39523,Homer,what? and violate the code of the school yard? i'd rather bart died.
39525,Homer,"yeah, right! this ought to be good for a laugh."
39528,Homer,now here's that bully of yours. show me your stuff.
39538,Homer,cupcakes.
39552,Homer,"get out of the way! how come he's not ducking? ugh! wait a minute, i can't get my... get out of the way, stupid!"
39558,Homer,well... eh... er...eh...
39561,Homer,"you're right. bart, vacuum this floor!"
39568,Homer,let's hear it.
39571,Homer,"bart, go easy on me. i'm your dad."
39578,Homer,"oh. me, too."
39580,Homer,gimme some quarters. i'm doing my laundry.
39593,Homer,ha ha! i got you. don't try that. i got ya. i'll block you. and the crowd is on its feet as hurricane homer moves in for the kill.
39596,Homer,"oh, noooo!"
39597,Homer,"my game! my game! i coulda beat the boy! marge, how could you? i was so close."
39600,Homer,bart! i suppose it has..uh..various features?
39605,Homer,where is it?
39607,Homer,wait till flanders gets a load of this.
39612,Homer,is that a good siren? am i approved?
39613,Homer,oh.
39619,Homer,"oh, well, i don't know. would it be alright if i conferred with my family?"
39623,Homer,hey flanders! look what i got!
39625,Homer,"that's the spirit. ready or not, nature here we come!"
39626,Homer,bart!
39627,Homer,lisa!
39632,Homer,what do you think? should we stop here?
39633,Homer,all righty.
39641,Homer,what am i going to do? i've murdered us all.
39642,Homer,shut up!
39649,Homer,a rattler!
39650,Homer,"run, you fool!"
39661,Homer,this young sapling ought to do the trick.
39676,Homer,plemk heh feh.
39688,Homer,no!
39689,Homer,"son, we're in this mess together. no matter how tempting it might be, i can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
39701,Homer,all right!
39710,Homer,what was it about?
39712,Homer,what! those cute little monkeys? that's terrible. who told you that?
39718,Homer,"now i've seen everything. black marbleized with a liquid center. the ""stealth bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
39726,Homer,just a statue? is the statue of liberty just a statue? is the leaning tower of piza just a statue?
39745,Homer,hmmmm!
39747,Homer,"ah, sounds delightful. just you and me and the balladeers."
39749,Homer,"what's that, patty?"
39757,Homer,"well, if that's how you feel, i'll take it back."
39764,Homer,"eat, mm-hm."
39768,Homer,"sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
39772,Homer,marge?
39773,Homer,nothing.
39780,Homer,"you know, i've been thinking... everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. but your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. i don't know how you do it. you've just got a gift, i guess. i've always thought so. i just never mentioned it. but it's time you knew how i feel. i don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...goodbye, my wife."
39786,Homer,"oh, it was delightful. the frosting on the cake was this thick. and eugene fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. and he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in valve maintenance."
39787,Homer,"pffft. i have to warn you, marge -- i think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly."
39793,Homer,"no, my supervisor."
39799,Homer,"ooh, look at him squirm."
39803,Homer,"sorry, buddy. you got me confused with fred flintstone."
39804,Homer,"oooh, liberty bell! another liberty bell! one more and i'm a millionaire. come on, liberty bell! please, please, please please, please please. that purple fruit thing! where were you yesterday?"
39807,Homer,"man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
39813,Homer,look marge... honey... baby doll... i...
39830,Homer,anybody home?
39836,Homer,yes i do. because i'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and i'm tired.
39837,Homer,"oh, he does not!"
39842,Homer,marge. marge. we're gonna try one more place. the sapphire lounge. bart! i said look at the floor!
39847,Homer,could you tell him a little about yourself?
39853,Homer,uh-oh. wait a minute. wait a minute. stop the music... quiet please... i have something to say. quiet!
39862,Homer,oh marge! i still hurt! marge! marge!
39883,Homer,"please, please kids. stop fighting. maybe lisa's right about america being a land of opportunity, and maybe adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers."
39887,Homer,"nice and cozy, adil?"
39894,Homer,uh... maybe. hold on a second.
39917,Homer,"goodbye, adil. i'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted."
39918,Homer,"he needs me. hey, boy."
39932,Homer,"yes, sir."
39933,Homer,"well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty."
39950,Homer,"hey, turn it up. i love hearing those whack-os."
39953,Homer,"let's just say, i don't feel like goin' home tonight. jar, please."
39957,Homer,"oh, no."
39965,Homer,...and i've made reservations at the chez paree.
39982,Homer,why?
39984,Homer,"oui, oui. after you. and i'll be seeing you later."
39988,Homer,"you know, marge, this is just like when we were dating."
39990,Homer,no problemo. we'll just get off at the next exit.
39995,Homer,whoa!
40009,Homer,"uh... uh... no. are you sure this microphone works? uh, well, i wouldn't say i aided her. this is on, right? because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
40012,Homer,yeah. yeah!
40023,Homer,psst... marge. come take a look at this.
40034,Homer,whoo hoo! all right!
40035,Homer,yeah!
40041,Homer,"okay. the colors of the italian flag are red, white and what?"
40045,Homer,"marge, weren't you listening? this is a miracle breakthrough. not one of these cheapo sucker deals."
40055,Homer,you got me!
40065,Homer,hello?
40067,Homer,"i'll call you back, marge."
40070,Homer,huh?
40080,Homer,"ooh, i like this."
40086,Homer,"well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
40089,Homer,the key!
40090,Homer,"sure thing, mr. burns."
40107,Homer,"i don't have a thousand bucks! but you do, don't you, marge? you do... you do. you've been squirreling it away, haven't you? saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? right? right?"
40109,Homer,"yeah, well, thanks for the speech, karl, but i can't give it. look at me!"
40110,Homer,what do you mean?
40111,Homer,"no, i can't. i'm just a big fool."
40112,Homer,how do you know?
40120,Homer,"oh, better hurry up."
40138,Homer,hey! pretty slick!
40149,Homer,an ancient indian what...?
40153,Homer,better than your eyes bursting. ewww!
40157,Homer,"the burgers are getting cold, guys. holy moly."
40176,Homer,"-- or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you."
40186,Homer,"take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
40193,Homer,so... someone will punch in for me.
40196,Homer,"uh, uh, just resting my eyes."
40198,Homer,"hello, marge. sorry i didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me."
40199,Homer,"echo, echo..."
40200,Homer,"huh? what th... uh, mr. burns?"
40201,Homer,"sorry, sir. it's just me, homer simpson. is everything all right?"
40207,Homer,"uh... don't get me wrong. i mean you're an honest man. i just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'course i'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. i mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't."
40212,Homer,"oh, marge. what's the big deal? i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had."
40213,Homer,"i hope burns and i can count on your support, honey."
40226,Homer,huh?
40229,Homer,"are you all right, mr. burns?"
40230,Homer,"bart, would you like to say grace?"
40240,Homer,"sure, we get a nice mix here."
40241,Homer,"lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. it comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
40246,Homer,"what's the matter, boy?"
40249,Homer,hey everybody! how you doin'? look at me! i'm homer simpson! heh...heh.
40252,Homer,"hey, burns! hey, ""rag arm""!"
40255,Homer,rub it in.
40272,Homer,"nope, this was my own bright idea. c'mon, we gotta hurry. don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. save room for your nachos."
40274,Homer,"oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
40277,Homer,"you wanted to see me, ""tex""?"
40281,Homer,i'll say!
40285,Homer,it won't be so bad. you'll die someplace else.
40294,Homer,wow!
40295,Homer,"kids, look! street crime!"
40309,Homer,"mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. uh oh."
40312,Homer,it was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
40327,Homer,holy moly! it's... it's... beautiful!
40331,Homer,"all right, knock it off!"
40341,Homer,"no, no, marge. don't backpedal. you were right the first time. he's perfect. perfect in every way."
40343,Homer,flanders!
40344,Homer,dear neighbor... 
40352,Homer,"that was just a practice shot, boy."
40358,Homer,"yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?"
40359,Homer,oh yeah! well i think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
40369,Homer,it just is. that's why.
40374,Homer,because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. and i'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
40379,Homer,"oh, yeah? wanna bet?"
40387,Homer,"keep your left arm straight, bart... rotate your shoulders..."
40391,Homer,"good morning, son! oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
40403,Homer,ow.
40421,Homer,"oh, i love those kids! they've got such a great attitude!"
40431,Homer,"don't worry, marge'll fix everything."
40432,Homer,"hey, what are you doing?! no! drop that drumstick! bad dog! bad santa's little helper. come on... gimme that. gimme that."
40433,Homer,"okay, out you go!"
40434,Homer,"yes, dad."
40440,Homer,"we can, and will!"
40444,Homer,it's your fault i'm bald!
40445,Homer,"damn, no spots."
40454,Homer,"oh, cruel fate. why do you mock me?"
40458,Homer,"oh, good, unfinished. this shouldn't take long."
40460,Homer,how much longer was sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?
40463,Homer,sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
40473,Homer,ewwww.
40481,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll try."
40491,Homer,why that little liar! i should... and i was gonna play pickle with him.
40505,Homer,"i knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. let's see now... ah, here it is. the complete handyman's bookshelf. volume one. spice rack."
40509,Homer,"keep her away from me, marge! she's got that crazy look in her eyes again."
40511,Homer,"hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?"
40514,Homer,oh. what are you doing?
40515,Homer,"heh, heh, heh."
40537,Homer,"oh. what's wrong, marge?"
40538,Homer,"hey, don't worry marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in springfield elementary school is gonna come and see this thing."
40541,Homer,"hey, yeah! who are you? i saw you chasing bart's ambulance..."
40543,Homer,"well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. and besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. nothing serious."
40545,Homer,"yeah. if i wasn't so spineless, i'd march into mr. burns' office right now and..."
40554,Homer,well... i dunno... you and i might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
40560,Homer,"oh, dr. hibbert from johns hopkins medical school?"
40571,Homer,will that hold up in court?
40572,Homer,"oh, marge."
40575,Homer,"no i don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. uh oh i better answer. no, thank you."
40597,Homer,"okay, okay, okay, okay. where do you want to go?"
40601,Homer,"oh, try me."
40607,Homer,"oh, okay, okay!"
40608,Homer,"oh, okay. hello!"
40610,Homer,good thing i'm open-minded.
40614,Homer,"... oh, oh, and two of these things."
40616,Homer,you're the doctor!
40621,Homer,"beautiful language, isn't it, marge?"
40626,Homer,"oooh! it's good news, isn't it?"
40630,Homer,why you little --
40631,Homer,what's after fear? what's after fear?
40638,Homer,almost.
40647,Homer,have man-to-man with bart.
40652,Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. there and there. don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. now, some aftershave."
40656,Homer,listen to lisa play her sax.
40666,Homer,"i'm sorry, officer. i know i was going too fast. just give me a ticket."
40667,Homer,"this is a videotape for my daughter, maggie. hi, maggie. i'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. oooooooh. hope that didn't scare you. well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... he was a simple man. a kind man. a gentle man who loved his children and..."
40668,Homer,hello? yeah he's here who is this? bart's friend milhouse. bart! get your butt down here!
40669,Homer,dad --
40672,Homer,"i just want you to know that i love you, dad."
40680,Homer,"oh, i really wanted to do that one."
40688,Homer,"thanks a lot, barney. i just wasted my one phone call on your stupid ma--"
40691,Homer,"hey, barney, look. it was on my list, along with a lot of other things i didn't get to do today. hey, my boss!"
40698,Homer,"come on, barney, i gotta get home."
40704,Homer,"okay, okay."
40706,Homer,that was beautiful.
40708,Homer,"goodbye, lisa -- i know you'll make me proud."
40715,Homer,"i'm alive! i'm alive. and i couldn't be happier. from this day forward, i vow to live life to its fullest!"
40722,Homer,how's this?
40726,Homer,"oh, how i miss tv! dear, god. just give me one channel!"
40727,Homer,bart!
40731,Homer,but we're early for lunch. let's go grab a burger.
40740,Homer,maybe we should get together some time.
40747,Homer,"dad, i'm in love."
40752,Homer,"hi, i'm homer simpson. i need some guidance, counselor."
40754,Homer,oh.
40756,Homer,far out!
40762,Homer,"fifty-five! that's ridiculous! sure, they'll save a few lives. but millions will be late!"
40770,Homer,with pleasure.
40774,Homer,"well, a... you see the problem is, you don't know me. i have references. just ask coach flanagan, and ask mr. seckofsky and barney gumbel."
40776,Homer,"well, what's the good word?"
40779,Homer,what?
40780,Homer,"yeah, so...."
40785,Homer,"ooh, lost a few. oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. uh-oh, a zit. no problemo."
40788,Homer,it helps me study. heh-heh-heh.
40804,Homer,"oh, okay."
40807,Homer,"i was afraid you'd cancel our date so i stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... i hope."
40810,Homer,"you wish, dondelinger."
40813,Homer,"oh, isn't she great? hail queen marge! woo woo! long live the queen!"
40817,Homer,inspiration point.
40818,Homer,"naw, that's okay. i'm broke. i'll walk home."
40820,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll walk in the mud!"
40821,Homer,marge?
40822,Homer,sure.
40826,Homer,and i never have.
40829,Homer,"boy, what's this world coming to?"
40831,Homer,"hey, stop, cable man! stop!"
40840,Homer,"nothing a month? yeah, i think we can swing that."
40854,Homer,"well, duh."
40859,Homer,whooo!
40862,Homer,"we could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable tv."
40870,Homer,good boy.
40871,Homer,hey lisa -- racing from belmont? horsies!
40877,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, i think it's coming down."
40881,Homer,get out of my house! i don't wanna associate with criminals.
40888,Homer,"oh, didja swipe those from work?"
40895,Homer,will you quit staring at me like that!
40897,Homer,yeah.
40898,Homer,"no... no i... it wasn't me... it was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... i would never..."
40899,Homer,"oh, sure, sure. be my guest."
40903,Homer,"excuse me. i hate to interrupt your judging me, but i wanted you to know i've made a couple of really important decisions. number one: i'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. and number two: i'm not very fond of any of you."
40906,Homer,"cable clippers, please."
40908,Homer,third time's the charm.
40909,Homer,ooh! barbecue!
40910,Homer,this is like some beautiful dream.
40919,Homer,"oh yeah, yeah, yeah. but i thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched."
40921,Homer,all right.
40922,Homer,okay.
40923,Homer,hey! why should she have a better husband than you do?
40924,Homer,must find man. must find man. must find man.
40926,Homer,"one seafood burrito, apu."
40931,Homer,"oh, no reason, really. i was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. a payback for all the crummy things bart has done to your school."
40938,Homer,"hey, selma's no prize pig herself you know."
40942,Homer,"take it to the hoop, selma."
40947,Homer,"well, no panta-ma-mime, either."
40948,Homer,the hospital? y'ello... oh my god!
40953,Homer,"i'm going to find my brother. i don't care what it takes. if i have to move heaven and earth, i'm going to find him!"
40967,Homer,just take it and tell me!
40971,Homer,"h! of course. that could stand for herbert! it's a long shot, but..."
40974,Homer,"woo woo! the h stands for herbert! herb, were you adopted?"
40985,Homer,"marge, this can't be the right address."
40987,Homer,herb?
40990,Homer,"... and our three children, bart, lisa and maggie."
41010,Homer,"all right. wooo, what's that doohickey?"
41017,Homer,"uh, may i be excused, please?"
41021,Homer,"oh, great."
41022,Homer,"ah, unky herb, i don't know anything about cars."
41026,Homer,all right you eggheads! i want a place in this car to put my drink!
41028,Homer,and i'm not done yet. you know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? that should be on every car.
41035,Homer,"all my life, i have searched for a car that feels a certain way."
41037,Homer,"gee, herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. i can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if i'd never come into your life."
41047,Homer,y'ello.
41049,Homer,"are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? i am going to explain this to you one more time, and then i am going to hang up on you. it is not my dog. i tied my dog outside myself. i am looking at him right --"
41050,Homer,"hey lenny, i need to leave early. cover for me, will ya?"
41053,Homer,oooh! oooh! how much? how much? how much?
41059,Homer,"oh, a hundred and twenty-five bucks!"
41063,Homer,"yep! hee, hee. read 'em and weep."
41072,Homer,mmmm. macamadamia nuts.
41073,Homer,"oh, so that's your little plan! get us addicted, then jack up the price! well, you win."

14398,Homer,"but marge, she never loses. she's got a gift. aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
14402,Homer,"well, that sounds great honey, but next sunday i'm going bowling with barney."
14423,Homer,"money comes and money goes, but what i have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"

14470,Homer,barney! you're gonna pull her arm off.
14473,Homer,hmmm.
14477,Homer,"listen, marge, uh, how would you feel if i told you the dog ran away?"
14479,Homer,"now, marge. maggie was very young. it's not like we got so attached to her. no. marge, isn't life funny? one day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. oh."
14481,Homer,uh... she's small... she's a girl...
14491,Homer,"marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
14496,Homer,dammit! son of a --

14501,Homer,"look, if this is about your camcorder -- i lost it, okay?"
14506,Homer,aye-aye! admiral butthead.
14510,Homer,"well marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. bring on the swear jar."
14517,Homer,you dirty bas...
14520,Homer,"oh fudge, that's broken."
14528,Homer,step aside everyone. sensitive love letters are my specialty.

14533,Homer,"how about, ""with a love that will echo through the ages?"""
14534,Homer,why you little...
14540,Homer,"look, i know it wasn't our best season."
14543,Homer,"come here boy, i want to show you something."

14586,Homer,"look, i didn't steal that copper wire. i just thought they were throwing it out. here, take it."
14611,Homer,"hey, you did the best you could."

14625,Homer,what?
14641,Homer,bart! close the gate.
14656,Homer,"ooh, they all look great."

14693,Homer,"hey moe, you got any fudd?"
14696,Homer,do you think i could get a copy of it?
14697,Homer,"lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
14699,Homer,i guess so.
14709,Homer,i make a lot of stupid decisions...
14715,Homer,no... i think it was lenny.
14722,Homer,i'm sure lurleen will love it.
14727,Homer,"you, off the bench."
14738,Homer,uh... i gotta go.
14740,Homer,"forget it, pal. they don't call me colonel homer because i'm some dumb-ass army guy."
14742,Homer,is there anything you need?
14744,Homer,at least could i have my dollar ba...
14752,Homer,pfft.
14754,Homer,"gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, i'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
14771,Homer,"now, just meet me back here after the show."
14772,Homer,"boy, some of the best times i've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
14774,Homer,there was a little spanish flea... a record star he thought he'd be... he heard of singers like beatles... the chipmunks he'd seen on tv... why not a little spanish flea? and so he hid... inside a dog...
14775,Homer,i'll be right back.
14776,Homer,"well, that's a waste of money. we already have a guitar."
14779,Homer,"hey, i thought i was supposed to encourage him."
14790,Homer,that guy has gotta go.
14794,Homer,why you little...
14795,Homer,what the...
14802,Homer,"oh lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
14806,Homer,forbearance is the watchword. that triumvirate of twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
14809,Homer,ooh...a sextet of ale.
14811,Homer,the vernal equinox?
14814,Homer,yuh. yuh. yuh.
14836,Homer,pfft! heavyweight championship. there's like three of those. that couch was one of a kind.
14838,Homer,"i feel so empty. so alone, so... couchless."
14839,Homer,wow. the spine melter 2000.
14854,Homer,nah.
14864,Homer,"i dunno, herb. people are afraid of new things. you should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
14868,Homer,"what do i get? what do i get? it's not another punch in the face is it? because if it is, i don't want it."
14880,Homer,you know a d turns into a b so easily. you just got greedy.
14883,Homer,"thanks son. now, you've got little hands. can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
14889,Homer,oh no you're not.
14907,Homer,"kids, back me up."
14912,Homer,"you see, marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
14920,Homer,i'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
14921,Homer,"but marge, what about dessert?"
14925,Homer,so what time does this play start?
14927,Homer,probably not much of it.
14942,Homer,"ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. la-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la..."
14949,Homer,forget it. i'm not going.
14972,Homer,could this be the best day of my life?
14974,Homer,"ah, my beloved family. how was church?"
14975,Homer,"i, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. and i owe it all to skipping church!"
14976,Homer,"like fun i don't. marge, i'm never going to church again."
14977,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no, no, no. well, yes."
14979,Homer,and don't you think that the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
14986,Homer,well... kind of... but...
14988,Homer,i'm not a bad guy. i work hard and i love my kids. so why should i spend half my sunday hearing about how i'm going to hell?
14990,Homer,you know what i really hate about church? those boring sermons.
14991,Homer,give him one for me.
14993,Homer,"sure, honey."
14997,Homer,"well, i wasn't sure i was doing the right thing. but then god himself told me i should seek a new path."
14998,Homer,"yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and i knew that was special 'cause i usually dream about naked... marge."
15006,Homer,"kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. he had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. and that man's name was... i forget. but the point is... uh, i forget that too. marge, you know who i'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
15009,Homer,"ooh! an interview with lorne michaels... wait, that's no good. hey, now we're talkin'. ""our unabashed dictionary defines iud as 'love springs internal'."" i don't get it."
15023,Homer,"well, that's just great."
15024,Homer,"you know, i have a feeling there's a lesson here."
15026,Homer,"i was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that i am."
15028,Homer,"god, i gotta ask you somethin'. what's the meaning of life?"
15035,Homer,"ho-mer, ho-mer, ho-mer.."
15036,Homer,"oh, it's no fair. we'll never have a buffer."

15057,Homer,"hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl."
15058,Homer,"well, if i could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, i would. but to me, she's beautiful."
15062,Homer,i'll tell you when you're older.

16396,Homer,ohh... what does it matter? we're doomed!
16398,Homer,"well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, i'll just be in charge of the rationing."
16400,Homer,why couldn't i be on one of the smart rafts. i bet they're having the time of their life.
16402,Homer,"all right, well that's okay. when they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
16404,Homer,it's better to be safe than sorry. sorry.
16408,Homer,"son, there's something i was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, i want you to have it now."

16479,Homer,mmmm... foot long chili dog.
16487,Homer,okay.
16499,Homer,"lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
16500,Homer,and you know what the best part is? we've really done something for the children.
16506,Homer,"hey, marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, i bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino."
16519,Homer,"you've gotta improvise, lisa. cloves, tom collins mix, frozen pie crust."
16520,Homer,"ah, come on, lisa, there's no reason to... let's go see mom."
16524,Homer,"aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it."
16527,Homer,"oh, nothing, marge. just a little incident involving the boogeyman. of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
16542,Homer,can't talk. robbed. go hell.
16548,Homer,and remember when i...
16550,Homer,woo hoo!
16555,Homer,"hello, police? are you sitting down? good. i wish to report a robbery!"
16557,Homer,yep. it's on here.

16567,Homer,"sorry, dad. you're too old."
16568,Homer,"aw, dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. aren't they? aren't they? huh? yes they are. yes they are..."
16569,Homer,"marge, we're responsible adults and..."
16571,Homer,"okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. now we need code names. i'll be ""cueball."" skinner can be ""eightball"", barney will be ""twelveball,"" and moe, you can be ""cueball."""
16581,Homer,move along there.
16587,Homer,"you better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
16593,Homer,"oh, that might be a typo."
16597,Homer,uh... marge?
16600,Homer,"listen, mr. cat burglar, i vow to go without sleep and guard the springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time."
16602,Homer,"dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. just stand around and don't steal anything."
16619,Homer,no kidding.
16625,Homer,"ahh, the morning horoscope. ""today will be a day like every other day."" it just gets worse and worse."
16628,Homer,"just a minute! don't hang up! y'ello... you'll have to speak up, i'm wearing a towel."
16636,Homer,"hello, everybody. i'm archie bell and i'm also the drells. we got a new song called, 'tighten up' and this is the music you tighten up with."
16639,Homer,"it's okay, son. who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? you're doing what you want to do with your life. nothing else matters."
16646,Homer,what the hell are you readin' books for?
16648,Homer,how do you figure boy?
16649,Homer,"all right, but after leno i'm all laughed out you know."
16655,Homer,your old meat made me sick!
16658,Homer,ooh. rancid meat attack. stupid parasites. is there no way i can find justice?
16667,Homer,"no, don't kill me! i didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! i was unaware! i was unawaaare!"
16679,Homer,well you deserve it. all these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
16683,Homer,everything really wrapped up nicely. much quicker than usual.
16684,Homer,and we've all found happiness... every one of us.
16695,Homer,are you really the head of the kwik-e-mart?
16699,Homer,"no need to apologize, apu. it was as much my fault as it was yours."
16707,Homer,"look, maggie! it's sgt. thug's mountaintop command post, complete with death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
16714,Homer,yes. but there's more.
16716,Homer,and we can't watch fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in syria.
16722,Homer,"hello. well, today's the day for homer j. i know i'm gonna win this time."
16726,Homer,nobody respects me at work.
16728,Homer,"ah, tv respects me. it laughs with me, not at me."
16729,Homer,boring.
16741,Homer,and may the best man win. he's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. meet me up in that tree later and i'll tell you more.
16743,Homer,who's doin' what now?
16758,Homer,it's beautiful. it's the most awe inspiring sight i have ever seen.
16766,Homer,i'll bash you good.
16774,Homer,"heh-heh-heh, i did it. second in line and all i had to do was miss eight days of work."
16778,Homer,"not flanders. anybody, but flanders."
16780,Homer,excellent guitar riff.
16782,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. but they didn't have the guts."
16785,Homer,i know i shouldn't eat thee but... mmmm... sacri-licious.
16788,Homer,"flanders, i decided i'd like to go to the game with you."
16789,Homer,"well, yeah."
16797,Homer,"nacho, nacho man / i want to be a nacho man."
16800,Homer,"losers! losers! kiss my big springfield behind, shelbyville!"

16812,Homer,now you got a law suit on your hands. just kidding.
16814,Homer,yeah.
16815,Homer,hey what gives? i thought you had a satellite dish.
16825,Homer,"come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. oh, i can do it faster that that."
16829,Homer,yes way.
16830,Homer,"don't worry, i brought my rappin' ronnie reagan tape. it always makes the trip go faster."
16835,Homer,"i'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the simpsons and the flanders. if this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the flimpsons."
16840,Homer,too late.
16844,Homer,"right, no reporters."
16849,Homer,"hey flanders, over here. i got us some kick-ass seats."
16852,Homer,"right back atcha, buddy."
16864,Homer,"are you mad, woman? you never know when an old calendar might come in handy. sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? and these tv guides... so many memories."
16867,Homer,what's the point of all this cleaning? are we so vain?
16868,Homer,use only in a well ventilated area.
16870,Homer,nothing.
16873,Homer,y'ello?
16876,Homer,"we'll call you back! bart! with ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. we could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
16885,Homer,shut up.
16887,Homer,"hey, any more arboretums around here?"
16893,Homer,well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
16894,Homer,"then that's what i'll do, smart guy."
16898,Homer,your kid flew five feet. that counts as a ride. two bucks.
16903,Homer,this town is full of deadbeats. we can't afford this elephant.
16905,Homer,"what do you mean? it's an elephant, isn't it?"
16908,Homer,"so, your bid is zero."
16917,Homer,"that wasn't part of our deal, blackheart! that wasn't paaaaart!!"
16924,Homer,"yes, of course i would. who wouldn't like that? to be part of the music scene..."
16931,Homer,all right. we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
16943,Homer,"there sure is. kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. the lesson is, never try. right in the butt. that was great."
16944,Homer,"woo hoo! we're rich! bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. we want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
16946,Homer,boo!
16950,Homer,okay. lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
16951,Homer,that was the end piece. that's it! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. go to your room!
16953,Homer,my secret shame.
16964,Homer,"and now i want you to meet your new brother, hans moleman."
16966,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. they let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
16968,Homer,"but marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
16976,Homer,jury duty. i'll see that quimby kid hang for this.
16993,Homer,"got it, barn?"
16999,Homer,pfft. what do babies know?
17003,Homer,"hee, hee, hee, hee. that is funny."
17006,Homer,not at all.
17013,Homer,"dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
17024,Homer,i was bluffing.
17036,Homer,i've failed again. everybody can teach a class but me. i'm an idiot. what am i gonna tell my wife and kids?
17039,Homer,"look, everyone! now that i'm a teacher, i've sewed patches on my elbows."
17041,Homer,"yes, lisa. daddy's a teacher."
17047,Homer,"ew. okay, let's get started."
17051,Homer,"uh, yes, yes. to the untrained eye i'm eating an orange. but to the eye that has brains, i am making a point about marriage. for you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
17052,Homer,"first you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
17056,Homer,i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
17059,Homer,"come on, marge. let me in! there's crickets out here."
17060,Homer,"marge, i didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
17067,Homer,"now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
17072,Homer,and how's my little major leaguer? catch any junebugs today?
17080,Homer,"but, i learned my lesson. it'll never happen again."
17089,Homer,together?
17091,Homer,"lisa, you will respect your new mother. now give her a kiss. kisss herrr."
17093,Homer,"ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. oh, i miss marge. lisa you're smart. help me trick her into taking me back."
17096,Homer,"all right, brain. it's all up to you. if you don't think of what it is, we'll lose marge forever."
17097,Homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
17108,Homer,"hey, this is dated two weeks ago."
17110,Homer,"hey, moe!"
17112,Homer,i got the idea when i noticed the refrigerator was cold.
17116,Homer,"ooh, the tinkler. i like the sound of that. we'll take it."
17117,Homer,"all right, everybody in the pool!"
17118,Homer,is it a pool yet?
17128,Homer,not everything. there's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
17131,Homer,"hm, i'm gonna need a bigger drill."
17135,Homer,jackknifed sugar truck. sugar?
17136,Homer,"don't worry, buddy. here's a quarter. call for help at the nearest phone... i'll keep an eye on things here."
17137,Homer,"we hit the jackpot, here! white gold! texas tea... sweetener."
17140,Homer,"those are prizes. ooo, a blasting cap!"
17150,Homer,"never! never, marge! i can't live the buttoned-down life like you. i want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. oh, i'll never be the darling of the so called ""city fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this homer simpson."
17159,Homer,like what?
17166,Homer,"oh, okay."
17169,Homer,"okay, marge. as long as we're traumatizing the kids, i have a scandalous story of my own."
17170,Homer,hi.
17178,Homer,see you tomorrow....
17185,Homer,"but at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
17192,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. love isn't hopeless. look, maybe i'm no expert on the subject. but there was one time i got it right..."
17199,Homer,"i've got a problem. once you stop this car, i'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then i'll never be able to let you go."
17205,Homer,oh yes.
17207,Homer,suckers.
17218,Homer,don't mind if i do.
17220,Homer,"north. ""south."" nuts to this! i'm going to take a shortcut."
17229,Homer,oh look! it's the twelve noon robot parade! hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
17240,Homer,back you robots! nobody ruins my family vacation but me. and maybe the boy.
17243,Homer,but there are five of us.
17255,Homer,we're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
17257,Homer,"hey, mr. smithers!"
17259,Homer,"well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
17262,Homer,"hm, not a drop in the house. what do you know?"
17264,Homer,"sorry, sorry. don't worry, there's plenty i can do to keep myself occupied. maybe i'll check out that axe collection. see ya later."
17267,Homer,you don't look so happy.
17274,Homer,daaaa-vid lettermaaaan!
17277,Homer,"television! teacher, mother, secret lover."
17284,Homer,"y'know, marge, i've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that i'm really a lucky guy."
17293,Homer,"but that was just one little insignificant mosquito. that can't change the future, right? right?"
17297,Homer,what the hell are you smiling at?
17302,Homer,this time i'm not gonna touch a thing.
17315,Homer,"no, it's not that. didn't you hear? they have no bananas. they have no bananas today."
17316,Homer,new glasses?
17319,Homer,"it was, marge. admit it."
17324,Homer,why you little... how can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
17325,Homer,"tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
17328,Homer,to the little girl's room!
17348,Homer,"ah, sorry bart, lisa and i are going out for gelato. we'd ask you to come but, you know..."
17352,Homer,"and if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
17356,Homer,i asked for ketchup. i'm eating salad here.
17365,Homer,"oh my god, marge. a penalty shot, with only four seconds left. it's your child versus mine! the winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore."
17373,Homer,i feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
17374,Homer,"brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... gimme those, etc."
17375,Homer,i don't know.
17376,Homer,mmm hmm. keep going.
17386,Homer,"so, a graduate student, huh? how come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
17387,Homer,"nobody's blaming you. hey, could you take the wheel for a second? i have to scratch myself in two places at once."
17389,Homer,"hey, kids. lots of candy left for breakfast."
17392,Homer,"marge, i swear i didn't touch her. you know how bashful i am. i can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
17395,Homer,"well lisa, remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
17402,Homer,uh-huh?
17403,Homer,"you mean, i'm on my own? i've never been on my own. oh no! on own! on own! i need help. oh, god help me! help me, god!"
17404,Homer,y'ello?
17406,Homer,"...somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed, she was sitting on the gummy venus so i grabbed it off of her. oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. i just wish i had another one right now. but the most important thing is..."
17409,Homer,"awww, crap!"
17410,Homer,"... somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so i grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! i just wish i had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
17416,Homer,whaa?
17421,Homer,how come you guys hesitated?
17428,Homer,"oh, gotta go. innocent!"
17433,Homer,huh?
17439,Homer,"please, marge. how often can i see a movie of this caliber on late-night tv?"
17458,Homer,kids-here's-fifty-dollars-why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-aunts'-house-stay-there-phone-call-you-later-now-now-now.
17460,Homer,you want me to spend more time with dad? what about my new year's resolution?
17465,Homer,great. i'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
17473,Homer,you're the screw-up!
17479,Homer,"but when i do it, it's cute."
17488,Homer,here's where it all started to go wrong. how'm i supposed to be a good dad when i never had one myself?
17495,Homer,"aw, dad."
17501,Homer,can't.
17503,Homer,"yes. cris-a-tunity. you're right! i've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. that's it. i'm going to find a new bar to drink in. and i'm gonna get drunker than i've been in my entire life! bart, where's my wallet?"
17510,Homer,"here, puff! here puff!"
17513,Homer,"ooh, my liver hurts."
17515,Homer,"uh, but i am a pilot."
17518,Homer,"yeah, that's exactly why i'm here."
17525,Homer,"come on marge, i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. i want to explore the world. i want to watch tv in a different time zone. i want to visit strange exotic malls. i'm sick of eating hoagies. i want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. i want to live, marge! won't you let me live? won't you please?"
17540,Homer,she's fine.
17555,Homer,"oh, being stuck on this god forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite i have."
17558,Homer,"don't worry about a thing, honey. i'm gonna help you through this."
17566,Homer,"all right, econo-save, you just made the list."
17571,Homer,shut up.
17575,Homer,"well, something did."
17577,Homer,all i have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
17583,Homer,"you'd better run, egg!"
17584,Homer,"why don't people like me, marge?"
17598,Homer,"number one? ha ha. what kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""hello, my name is number one."" and so forth."

17637,Homer,"oh i win again, don't i? woo hoo."
17640,Homer,"lisa, you were right. my happiness is fading."

17692,Homer,"it's okay, marge. they pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
17703,Homer,i'm gonna make it after all!
17706,Homer,"well, it was my major."
17707,Homer,"so here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and i won't ask for anything more. if that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. okay, deal. in gratitude, i present you this offering of cookies and milk. if you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. thy will be done."

17915,Homer,"that's it! i'll make money with a chauffeur job. good thing you turned on that tv, lisa."
17925,Homer,"nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
17928,Homer,i'll never forgive myself for this.

18082,Homer,"marge, i want you to take care of yourself out there. you've become very dear to me."
18084,Homer,mmm. incapacitating.
18094,Homer,"oh, you've become such a cop! and, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs."
18096,Homer,"hey, marge. how's my little piglet?"
18102,Homer,"what're you gonna do about it? what're you gonna do? ooh, i'm officer marge, i'm gonna arrest you! whoa! etc."

18193,Homer,"oh, maggie. i got nothing against maggie."

18255,Homer,"look, kids! i just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
18256,Homer,that's a typo.
18259,Homer,"i've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection."
18266,Homer,it's just a little airborne! it's still good! it's still good!
18270,Homer,"marge, since i'm not talking to lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
18287,Homer,nuts!
18290,Homer,eggheads. what do they know?
18293,Homer,"well... i acquired it legally, you can be sure of that."
18298,Homer,don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
18301,Homer,bart?! is that you?
18305,Homer,"oh, no. better ride this one out in the closet."
18313,Homer,hello? can anybody hear me?
18314,Homer,i'm somewhere where i don't know where i am.
18318,Homer,but i seem to be trapped in here.
18349,Homer,"um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
18353,Homer,yes i can.
18354,Homer,"yuh-huh, that's the deal. no more exercise program! no more traffic! no more blood drives or charity walks!"
18358,Homer,"oh yeah? well, we'll just see about that, little miss smart guy."

18362,Homer,"oh, it's a dream come true, boy! i can, nay, i must, eat everything i've always wanted. now c'mon! every second i'm out of bed, i'm burning precious calories. now get grabbin'!"
18378,Homer,"oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
18383,Homer,i pity those poor suckers on the freeway. gas-brake-honk. gas-brake-honk. honk-honk-punch. gas-gas-gas.
18388,Homer,"core temperature normal. not too shabby. ""vent radioactive gas?"" n-o."
18390,Homer,bart and lisa have to go to school while i get to stay home. nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
18403,Homer,"hey, all i have to type is ""y."""
18413,Homer,"hmmm, i can feel three kinds of softness."
18415,Homer,"hey, what are you kids looking at?"
18420,Homer,what are you talking about?
18426,Homer,marge?... lisa?... flanders?...
18432,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? it's all my fault."
18433,Homer,shut up!
18434,Homer,i gotta call the plant and warn them!
18435,Homer,"i'm gonna have to shut it down myself. fat, don't fail me now."
18441,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. it was pretty scary up there. but... for a while i feared for my life."
18446,Homer,"best six hundred bucks i ever spent. c'mon, boy. we've earned this saturday, now let's make the most of it."
18447,Homer,sixty-one... sixty-two... sixty-three...
18448,Homer,that's m'name.
18452,Homer,"""youngest daughter..."" well, how about this? this thing says my mother's still alive. she died when i was a kid."
18458,Homer,"i hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. hey, wait a minute... mom?"
18493,Homer,free duff! viva life!
18494,Homer,"they didn't have any aspirin, so i got you some cigarettes."
18495,Homer,"heh, heh. why jerk my neck around like a goon when tyranno-vision decides what i should look at?"
18500,Homer,"i'm sure they're fine, honey."
18502,Homer,"well, i wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. now let's roll."
18507,Homer,relax. what is mind? no matter. what is matter? never mind.
18523,Homer,hello. my name is mr. burns. i believe you have a letter for me.
18525,Homer,"oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane!"
18528,Homer,"simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree"
18533,Homer,don't mind if i do.
18535,Homer,"but it won't make you unhappy, right? hey! space food sticks! oh, i wish i had these on my space adventure! did you know i was blasted into space two years ago, mom?"
18551,Homer,uh-oh. somebody's got tired little legs.
18555,Homer,pfft. must have been a pretty slow century.
18559,Homer,"eh, what are you gonna do?"
18563,Homer,"i don't think so, stupid!"
18564,Homer,"no, i want roast beef, you clod!"
18574,Homer,"five hundred dollars?! no problem. would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
18580,Homer,"hey, everybody, if you want to ask burns for a favor, now's the time! he's doped up or dyin' or something!"
18587,Homer,"so i got up all my courage. right away, my lips started to move and i came up with a chant that won the match."
18600,Homer,welcome aboard. it wasn't any easier.
18606,Homer,awww.
18628,Homer,"so, anyone here from... evergreen terrace?"
18641,Homer,stupid president. why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
18643,Homer,"i voted for prell to go back to the old glass bottle. after that, i became deeply cynical."
18647,Homer,"hey, jerk! move your fanny!"
18649,Homer,"all right. his story checks out. marge, would you love me more if i were president? 'cause i'll do it if it will make you happy."
18651,Homer,"he spanked you? you, bart simpson?"
18658,Homer,"no, you're gonna get trouble."
18661,Homer,this is gonna be sweet. two hundred bottle rockets and george bush doing toe touches by an open window.
18667,Homer,bingo.
18677,Homer,"jerry, i think you and i are gonna get along just fi--"
18678,Homer,"oh, he wants that corn so much!"
18693,Homer,that's one way.
18694,Homer,not an issue.
18695,Homer,huh?
18697,Homer,"marge, did you know that kennedy and lincoln had the same handicap?"
18699,Homer,seat down.
18707,Homer,and what are you doing with his ball?
18709,Homer,"these aren't reptile eggs! you've been cheating! no matter where mr. burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!"
18710,Homer,so you're not the best golfer here! wait'll i tell everyone about this! you stink!
18712,Homer,i'm driving up to the main building. they've got valet parking tonight.
18713,Homer,"but marge, valets. for once, maybe someone will call me ""sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
18714,Homer,"i'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. you know, the one i tried to say on the radio? heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
18715,Homer,"i just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
18717,Homer,our savings?!
18720,Homer,"well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts."
18721,Homer,"yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."
18722,Homer,best night's sleep i ever had.
18726,Homer,wow.
18727,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'm sure he's up in heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- john dillinger, ty cobb, joseph stalin... i wish i were dead."
18728,Homer,"don't let krusty's death get you down, boy. people die all the time. just like that. why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. well, good night."
18736,Homer,"woo hoo! hear ye! hear ye! the homer broadcasting system is on the air! all hollering, all the time! i'm gonna make the..."
18739,Homer,"i don't understand thee, marge."
18743,Homer,"i believe you, honey."
18755,Homer,"okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. i know a much better way to get attention..."
18756,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about jebediah springfield."
18757,Homer,"dig him up! dig up that corpse!! if you really love jebediah springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
18760,Homer,what a jip.
18761,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. let's go home."
18766,Homer,all right! liver!
18768,Homer,"um, is this the chair i'll be sitting on?"
18769,Homer,"uh-huh. but this is the chair, right?"
18772,Homer,"uh, mr. smithers? i don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
18783,Homer,"well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
18788,Homer,it's mr. smithers. he's calling for you.
18791,Homer,"no time, marge. i think mr. burns wants me to do some long division."
18795,Homer,i punched mr. burns right in his 104 year-old face.
18800,Homer,"well, can i at least drive you home, mr. burns? it's five o'clock."
18801,Homer,"would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
18805,Homer,"mr. smithers, wait!"
18811,Homer,uh-oh.
18813,Homer,"son, this is mrs. burns! i just called to say i don't love you. you are a bad son, montel!"
18815,Homer,okay.
18816,Homer,i'll show you.
18819,Homer,"bye, kids. on your way back, pick up a six pack of beer."
18827,Homer,forget it.
18831,Homer,what for?
18837,Homer,"oh, i love legitimate theater."
18847,Homer,'cause they won't hire an assistant.
18850,Homer,"uh... oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. as a safety inspector, i am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
18855,Homer,"hi, lisa. how's your spring break going?"
18860,Homer,"well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here i trust. ready?"
18864,Homer,eh... truth. ask me anything.
18873,Homer,"i've already forgotten his name. it was larsen something, right?"
18876,Homer,i promise.
18881,Homer,"y'ello, oak ridge? this is springfield nuclear. we need to order a... uh...t-437 safety command console."
18884,Homer,helms calls for donut tax?!
18891,Homer,... the dog!
18896,Homer,"second class? what about social security, bus discounts, medic-alert jewelry, gold bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
18897,Homer,who is it?
18908,Homer,we're here! we're queer! we don't want any more bears!
18911,Homer,"ahh, not a bear in sight. the bear patrol must be working like a charm."
18912,Homer,"thank you, honey."
18919,Homer,bear patrol tax: $5?! what?! this is an outrage! it's the biggest tax increase in history!
18924,Homer,you? pfft. i don't believe it.
18929,Homer,"hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
18941,Homer,"now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the u.s, so let's do that. uh, springfield, springfield... ah, right here."
18945,Homer,"yeah, native americans like us."
18957,Homer,"i see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. now, i can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
18959,Homer,"but this is grand funk railroad! you guys back there know grand funk, right?"
18962,Homer,"and when i listen to a really good song, i start nodding my head, like i'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" and then sometimes i switch it up like ""no, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
18969,Homer,"there can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the us festival."
18974,Homer,you make me feel like dancing...
18975,Homer,"you wouldn't understand, dad. you're not with it."
18980,Homer,i did? i must be getting forgetful in my old age. open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
18984,Homer,"hey, a freak show!"
18989,Homer,alright. yeah.
18991,Homer,what did i say? what's going on?
18995,Homer,uh-oh.
19003,Homer,"homer simpson, smiling politely. you know, my kids think you're the greatest. and thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future i can't possibly provide."
19009,Homer,"hello, ticket-holders!"
19019,Homer,nope.
19031,Homer,"wait, marge. maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."
19035,Homer,"hey. hmm, somebody's travelin' light."
19043,Homer,"it's low tide, boys."
19051,Homer,no lighter?... nothin'?
19055,Homer,"well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
19058,Homer,"fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."
19060,Homer,"yeah, three nosy kids. and you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
19063,Homer,"lisa, please. yes, bart, you have a twin brother. you see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
19065,Homer,"we'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
19073,Homer,"i suppose you'll want to probe me. well, might as well get it over with."
19095,Homer,"just bring the rut with you, honey. come on, take a look."
19100,Homer,we'll never sell this rotten dump.
19104,Homer,i'm gonna miss springfield. this town's been awfully good to us.
19105,Homer,"here we are, 15201 maple systems road... our new home."
19114,Homer,yeah.
19115,Homer,ye... no.
19119,Homer,are you guys working?
19121,Homer,"hey, call me homer."
19122,Homer,"hey, what's with you sad sacks?"
19125,Homer,i can't buy that. only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. guys like me? i'm a guy like me!
19126,Homer,"all right, team, it's the fourth quarter. the lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
19127,Homer,"hey, if tom landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then i should just quit right now."
19130,Homer,"sir, i need to know where i can get some business hammocks."
19136,Homer,"oh, the hammock district."
19139,Homer,oh.
19144,Homer,i've never noticed this office before.
19145,Homer,"eh, you have any sugar around here?"
19151,Homer,"what?! we've got it great here. and for the first time in my life, i'm actually good at my job. my team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
19164,Homer,like bull you don't! come on!
19172,Homer,big deal. i didn't even get my kid's belt back. the only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
19179,Homer,woo hoo!
19184,Homer,why not?
19190,Homer,then i can just push him over.
19191,Homer,no one.
19203,Homer,"well, i don't think it's that unlikely."
19211,Homer,"eh, not mine."
19224,Homer,so lazy.
19234,Homer,of course not. we'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
19238,Homer,just a second.
19240,Homer,"marge, it's not a real kidnapping. it's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
19241,Homer,still?
19244,Homer,stupid economic recovery!
19246,Homer,"heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
19251,Homer,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
19253,Homer,"sorry, sorry. my fault."
19257,Homer,a whole week of just father and son! see you at dinner.
19260,Homer,"no, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
19263,Homer,knock yourself out.
19265,Homer,hello.
19267,Homer,"'preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. and i gotta live with him."
19273,Homer,"i told you last night, no! where is bart, anyway? his dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
19274,Homer,"bart, where are you?! come on! i have to be up at six a.m. to swipe flanders' newspaper!"
19278,Homer,"yes, everyone loves rules..."
19279,Homer,"oh, yeah, drugs. ya gotta have drugs."
19282,Homer,"oh, no?! well, if homer simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then homer simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! that's..."
19287,Homer,my friends! stop!
19291,Homer,"you could close down moe's or the kwik-e-mart, and nobody would care / but the heart and soul of springfield's in our maison derriere..."
19295,Homer,easy...
19296,Homer,"marge, can't we get some clear plates? i can't see the tv."
19308,Homer,"ooh, here we go!"
19309,Homer,that's a door?
19314,Homer,i sleep in a big bed with my wife.
19317,Homer,for what?
19319,Homer,that doesn't sound like something i'd say.
19325,Homer,it can't just be sex. it can't.
19333,Homer,'cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
19334,Homer,mm-hm.
19335,Homer,"oh, i knew this would happen. our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
19336,Homer,that's your advice?! go to bed!
19339,Homer,"oh, of course, my sweet. i'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you."
19351,Homer,it doesn't matter. all i want to know is: will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
19366,Homer,"hey, who shot the auto-dialer? marge's auto-dialer?"
19367,Homer,... is it... wah?
19374,Homer,use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
19384,Homer,the living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
19399,Homer,because humans are obnoxious sometimes. humans hate things.
19405,Homer,"hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
19427,Homer,"aw, lousy wiggum. now the whole town thinks i'm a chili wuss..."
19428,Homer,"maybe i do, son. maybe i do."
19430,Homer,"more, please."
19432,Homer,"heh, heh! my finest hour! and marge wasn't even here to see it."
19439,Homer,oh... kay. i think i'm gonna be leaving now.
19441,Homer,note to self: stop doing anything.
19443,Homer,huh? a tortoise?
19448,Homer,marge! thank god you're here! where's the car?
19451,Homer,who said that?
19464,Homer,carl?
19475,Homer,"look at these records! jim nabors, glen campbell, the doodletown pipers! now look at her records... they stink! maybe i had that crazy dream for a reason..."
19478,Homer,"hey, barney! soul mate! let me buy you a beer."
19484,Homer,the loneliest man in the world! he'll understand me!
19486,Homer,"here i come, buddy! no more loneliness for homer and earl...."
19497,Homer,"oh, sure. give me the one with all the monsters."
19501,Homer,omigod! the ship!
19513,Homer,"no time for you, old man!"
19522,Homer,oh. it's bart. i can't believe it. i'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
19527,Homer,you don't have to humiliate me.
19530,Homer,ow.
19534,Homer,"i am so sorry. whatever you do, don't tell marge. god, i love her. i-- hey, a penny!"
19535,Homer,"so i says ""blue m & m, red m & m, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
19544,Homer,you do?
19545,Homer,"thank you, son. and do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
19553,Homer,it's him!
19555,Homer,bwah! bwah! bwaaaaah!
19557,Homer,"good work, son! we did it! we did it!"
19574,Homer,"hey, pretzels!"
19577,Homer,"that means thank you, marge."
19578,Homer,you could call 'em whitey whackers.
19583,Homer,"you're my last hope. i've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. your help could make all the difference in the world."
19586,Homer,"yeah, my wife is raking it in."
19592,Homer,"oh, thank god. it's only grampa."
19596,Homer,look at him. he's gonna do something. and you know it's gonna be good!
19598,Homer,"hey, that's the fire alarm!"
19601,Homer,"hit 'em, carl! you too, lenny!"
19603,Homer,huh?
19607,Homer,"uh, i lost my map."
19614,Homer,"wow. you sure know how to cheat, mr. burns."
19617,Homer,no going through the window for us!
19619,Homer,"oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
19622,Homer,oh?
19623,Homer,"use it wisely, my friend."
19625,Homer,"um, i don't see one. unless..."
19626,Homer,no. there's no way out.
19628,Homer,we sure did!
19630,Homer,shhh! you're causing more avalanches. .
19634,Homer,we could build snowmen.
19640,Homer,you and what army?
19642,Homer,"oh lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
19645,Homer,"marge, get me a beer."
19652,Homer,"now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. i'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. just like my hair!"
19657,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... i'll give up the civil war re-creation society i love so much."
19660,Homer,gimme those.
19671,Homer,"marge, do we know them?"
19672,Homer,come on -- isn't he the guy i bowl with? the black guy?
19673,Homer,"oh yeah. so, you worked for carl, eh?"
19678,Homer,not till you're fifteen.
19683,Homer,shary bobbins! i want another beer!
19687,Homer,indubitably!
19695,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin' ""howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
19696,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin'-- i don't sound like that, do i? oh, i don't like having such a hilarious voice."
19697,Homer,ruff ruff! i'm poochie the rockin' dog.
19699,Homer,huh? i can't. i don't remember what i did.
19703,Homer,you? but you're a lady.
19706,Homer,"uh, i guess. is this episode going on the air live?"
19723,Homer,"well, i guess i learned my lesson. the thing is, i lost creative control of the project. and i forgot to ask for any money. well, live and learn."
19735,Homer,"i practically insist. shall we say, 5 o'clock? the snacking hour?"
19738,Homer,"oh. i'll just be another minute, john. have a seat."
19741,Homer,"oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
19744,Homer,right...
19745,Homer,"ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! i danced with a gay! marge, lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. promise me!"
19747,Homer,"whoa, not me. and not because john's gay, but because he's a sneak. he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
19753,Homer,bart! where'd you get that shirt?
19762,Homer,"you know. it's... it's not... usual! if there was a law, it would be against it!"
19764,Homer,"yeah! and that's another thing! i resent ""you people"" using that word. that's our word for making fun of you. we need it! well, i'm taking back our word and i'm taking back my son!"
19766,Homer,"don't worry, boy. we're gonna set you straight. by tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular burt reynolds."
19767,Homer,just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. father and son.
19768,Homer,"just remember, son, whatever happens --i'll always love you."
19770,Homer,nothing. just sit. i'll be back.
19771,Homer,well it's been two hours. how do you feel?
19772,Homer,that's a good start. let's get you a pack. what's your brand?
19778,Homer,i don't know! this is a nightmare! you're all sick!
19784,Homer,"stand aside, marge. i'm taking the boy deer hunting. he's going to grow up straight for once."
19790,Homer,"that is a very immature attitude, young man."
19792,Homer,"oh, she'd never go. she's a vegetarian."
19793,Homer,no... this whole thing is my fault. i've been a lousy dad.
19802,Homer,just... my bones... and organs...
19806,Homer,i've been tenderized.
19812,Homer,"your mother's right, bart. sure, you're the one who ruined all of sideshow bob's criminal schemes --"
19814,Homer,in a medium-security prison.
19815,Homer,unless he gets out somehow.
19830,Homer,"aw, i love this pedestrian mall! there's practically no traffic!"
19832,Homer,you've never been?
19833,Homer,"nah, i'm really more of a slacker."
19834,Homer,"look, marge! a restaurant owned by celebrities! i always wanted to be a celebrity!"
19835,Homer,"wow, even moe's moved to fancy new digs."
19838,Homer,don't laugh at me! i was once like you!
19839,Homer,"what's the matter, marge? i thought you loved jello shooters."
19840,Homer,"oh, come on marge, relax! lisa's in charge. she's the responsible one."
19848,Homer,"glad you're finally back in business, moe."
19861,Homer,"before! before! you're living in the past, marge! quit living in the past."
19865,Homer,"you see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
19866,Homer,"wait a minute. i forgot to make sure the coast was clear. aw, it's probably clear. let's go."
19867,Homer,"i can explain, marge! please let me explain! oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
19874,Homer,call me beer baron.
19877,Homer,"""make it,"" eh?"
19878,Homer,"forty-two bathtubs, please."
19885,Homer,ka-blammo.
19888,Homer,it's hot!
19900,Homer,last time i help you.
19902,Homer,"to alcohol! the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
19903,Homer,"alright, men. get ready to blast off!"
19906,Homer,"wait a minute. bart's teacher's name is ""krabappel?"" i've been calling her ""crandall."" why didn't someone tell me? oh, i've been making an idiot out of myself."
19912,Homer,"yes! my precious ""cartoons!"" ""who pumped ethyl?!"""
19918,Homer,"oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day."
19924,Homer,crowds give him gas.
19925,Homer,"wow, tv's kent brockman."
19930,Homer,laddie?
19942,Homer,now i can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
19947,Homer,"hey, why don't you try the old folks home? they practically live in their own filth!"
19951,Homer,"so, um, how's life in the gutter?"
19952,Homer,"see that, boy? why aren't you making any business deals?"
19954,Homer,"please be flanders, please be flanders, please be flanders..."
19958,Homer,"oh, i hope you learned your lesson, lisa. never help anyone."
19962,Homer,dammit!!
19963,Homer,who cares? this is the best part of the week!
19966,Homer,wanna come with?
19969,Homer,okay. who's up for some scrounging?
19970,Homer,"hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
19971,Homer,"oh my god! help me, lisa!"
19972,Homer,wh... what's going on? wh... wha... why am i on a japanese box?
19976,Homer,"but marge, i'm obsessed with it! where did it come from? what is it a box of? how'd my face get on it?!"
19977,Homer,"akira, can you read this for me?"
19993,Homer,now that's religion.
19996,Homer,yes.
19997,Homer,i don't know. i'm kind of dizzy. i should probably go home sick.
20005,Homer,"oh. oh, i'm sorry."
20010,Homer,that got it.
20015,Homer,okay. do i have to do anything?
20017,Homer,"no, i won't accept that."
20020,Homer,this dinner has to go absolutely perfect if grimy and me are going to be friends. lisa -- be perfect.
20021,Homer,marge -- perfect. bart -- perfect. other kid -- perfect.
20032,Homer,sure. you've never been?
20035,Homer,what are you saying?
20038,Homer,no he won't. he hates me.
20046,Homer,then i added some fins to lower wind resistance. and this racing stripe here i feel is pretty sharp.
20050,Homer,over there.
20055,Homer,i'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
20058,Homer,"marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?"
20067,Homer,i wish our special guest tim conway didn't have to leave so soon.
20068,Homer,"well, that's all the time we have. so this is the simpson family saying: ""as you walk down the road of life..."""
20069,Homer,"you've really done it this time, bart! you're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
20079,Homer,marge? you got that? marge?!
20087,Homer,"hey everybody, i'm peter pantsless!"
20092,Homer,throw it away! nothing good has ever come out of new york city!
20093,Homer,my vehicle!
20094,Homer,"oh, i don't want to go to new york city."
20096,Homer,it's time i told you about a chapter of my life i hoped would be closed forever. i was on my way to the harrisburg coat outlet to buy an irregular coat. but it required a stopover in new york city.
20101,Homer,don't you start.
20104,Homer,oh. hi.
20105,Homer,"now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. so if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the ozarks."
20107,Homer,"oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
20109,Homer,your vehicle is illegally parked at one world trade plaza. hmmm...
20119,Homer,"hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?"
20122,Homer,"mmmm. now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?"
20123,Homer,blech! eww! geesh! i'll take a crab juice.
20134,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow!
20137,Homer,"aha! i've got it! brain, how can i ever thank you?"
20142,Homer,"so long, mr. boot."
20150,Homer,"we'll see, honey."
20151,Homer,we'll see.
20155,Homer,"not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
20156,Homer,fair enough.
20159,Homer,and why is marge here?
20164,Homer,"hey, everybody, look! armin tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
20170,Homer,guessing how much elvis weighed...
20171,Homer,watching shows like gentle ben...
20173,Homer,disco duck and fleetwood mac...
20175,Homer,what a bad father.
20178,Homer,"bart, make her stop."
20181,Homer,"don't worry, son. if that bothers you, i'll destroy something maggie loves."
20185,Homer,lousy traumatic childhood.
20189,Homer,no problem. i'll just give her a sip of beer. come on maggie -- it's miller time! yes-it's-mil-ler-time!
20193,Homer,"oh, it's beautiful! oh! oh, let's put bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
20200,Homer,"marge, he's five. his life is over. lisa's the wave of the future."
20203,Homer,hm.
20204,Homer,"well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
20212,Homer,ohhh. so hottt.
20216,Homer,"oh, marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! and our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
20217,Homer,"marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
20220,Homer,"all right, all right, i promise. there must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
20221,Homer,mmmm... re-circulated air.
20229,Homer,"eh, works for me."
20236,Homer,"next, i'll tell you the origin of maggie's pacifier."
20255,Homer,little lisa-a-a...
20258,Homer,"oh, i've lost everything. i can't go on. no, no, no! i can't just wallow in sadness. it's time to laugh again. i'm the last man alive!"
20267,Homer,"die, you chalk-faced goons!"
20271,Homer,marge! kids! you're alive!
20274,Homer,"so, who wants to steal some ferraris?"
20282,Homer,"oh, man that's good."
20285,Homer,"bart, are you in there? have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
20295,Homer,something i should have done a long time ago.
20296,Homer,i'll teach you to mess with my machine!
20312,Homer,all done.
20313,Homer,"i'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
20319,Homer,five hundred dollars! forget it.
20324,Homer,baby.
20330,Homer,i'd kill you if i had my gun.
20334,Homer,marge kicked me out.
20337,Homer,"come on, come on, open up!"
20340,Homer,yeah.
20341,Homer,former president.
20345,Homer,okay. open your eyes!
20346,Homer,"hey, it's a handgun! isn't it great? this is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
20349,Homer,tv said that? but i have to have a gun. it's in the constitution.
20352,Homer,"a gun is not a weapon, marge. it's a tool. like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. you just need more education on the subject. tell you what: you come with me to an nra meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
20353,Homer,pull!
20357,Homer,"oh, come on, be fair marge. for once in your life, be fair."
20358,Homer,sorry.
20361,Homer,i'll do it! i'll rob the kwik-e-mart.
20363,Homer,"sure thing, honey."
20368,Homer,"listen, if it'll make you feel any better, i'll put the safety on."
20369,Homer,"oops, guess it already was on."
20370,Homer,uh. i'd better just put it down.
20371,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll do it. for you."
20381,Homer,anyone else want a beer?
20386,Homer,this stinks. i want my family back.
20387,Homer,"marge? sorry. marge? oh, sorry. marge?"
20388,Homer,sorry.
20394,Homer,"freeze, bad guy!"
20395,Homer,"i know i said that, but what i secretly meant was..."
20401,Homer,"there you go, bart, pee wee football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches."
20403,Homer,"hey, flanders. you're the worst coach this team has ever had."
20406,Homer,"ahh, you got lucky, flanders! and fix that hat!"
20408,Homer,"well, i'm tellin' ya, flanders can't coach at all! now i'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
20412,Homer,flaaaan-ders... flaaaan-ders...
20425,Homer,"well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, i'd like to hear it."
20432,Homer,"good practice, team. okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
20436,Homer,"now just because i'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. he calls me ""coach"" just like everyone else. which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
20437,Homer,"what is it, sweetie?"
20439,Homer,"son, you can do anything you want. i have total faith in you."
20452,Homer,"come on, guys. we can't play without bart. he's the heart of this team!"
20459,Homer,so...

20641,Homer,"okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
20642,Homer,"oh yeah? we'll show 'em. come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."
20645,Homer,"yeah, you're right, moe. you're always moe."
20646,Homer,"you take that back, barney!"
20654,Homer,"marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!"
20659,Homer,oopsie.
20661,Homer,i knew this would happen.
20665,Homer,"oh, it's true! we weren't robbed! that part we made up! but the rest is true!"
20674,Homer,what the hell's goin' on?
20676,Homer,the hell it is!
20689,Homer,singing is the lowest form of communication.
20717,Homer,"hey, come on! he doesn't have any money. look at his clothes."
20719,Homer,"sure, anything you want."
20731,Homer,i guess not.
20732,Homer,"buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world."
20735,Homer,gimme ten rings.
20743,Homer,it's a ring toss game.
20746,Homer,can't you stay in the whack-a-mole game?
20747,Homer,"look at 'em, bart. if a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone."
20753,Homer,cooder! what have you done to our house?
20755,Homer,carnies took over our house. you've gotta help us.
20759,Homer,it took me years to forge that groove.
20762,Homer,i've got it!
20766,Homer,that's right.
20774,Homer,"i always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school."
20781,Homer,i see. and when is it?
20782,Homer,and what are you charging for this free weekend?
20785,Homer,"marge, marge, marge. remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
20789,Homer,"na na na na na na na na fish-ing / na na na na na na na na fish-ing / fish-ing, fish-ing--"
20794,Homer,what kind of beer?
20798,Homer,"now wait a minute, moe --"
20803,Homer,"oh, my mistake."
20804,Homer,"you gonna finish that, bony?"
20807,Homer,act ii
20818,Homer,"see, marge? our lives are so much better now!"
20820,Homer,"yes, it would be nice if he'd buy american, but what are ya gonna do?"
20826,Homer,the leader knows all and sees all.
20828,Homer,beer?
20844,Homer,"maude, eh?"
20845,Homer,"no time to answer that, marge. i'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise."
20849,Homer,mmm... memo.
20862,Homer,"oh, right. i reluctantly accept your proposal."
20863,Homer,"hey, what the hell's going on?!"
20866,Homer,"that's where you're wrong, pal!"
20873,Homer,oh i get it. i get jokes.
20878,Homer,booo!
20880,Homer,krusty's gone nuts...
20881,Homer,"i'll cover ya, honey."
20891,Homer,"aw, i understand, kids. i'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
20901,Homer,"oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. but that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
20915,Homer,mmmm... me.
20927,Homer,that's what you get for not hailing to the chimp.
20936,Homer,"aw, thanks, boy. i'll give you two packs for that candy bar."
20937,Homer,why you little...
20941,Homer,"but moe, we're best friends..."
20944,Homer,hawaii? what about hawaii? moe? who's going to hawaii? am i going to hawaii?
20947,Homer,must kill moe. wheeeeee! must kill moe. wheeeeee!
20948,Homer,you!
20950,Homer,"i... also sleep... g'night, mommy..."
20968,Homer,"fine, she doesn't get her skin!"
20974,Homer,"marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat."
20975,Homer,"lisa, it's me, daddy, your father. i rounded up every simpson in the tri-city area, so i can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the simpson genes. this is your great-uncle chet. go ahead, chet, tell her what you do."
20984,Homer,"oh well, thanks, honey. remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a simpson and a success."
20986,Homer,"yeah. good things don't end with ""eum."" they end with ""mania""... or ""teria."" will there be beer?"
20988,Homer,i'm gonna try the sex education computer!
20991,Homer,"woo hoo! beer, beer, beer!"
20995,Homer,"""da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."" ""after the beep."""
21004,Homer,fired. i can't believe it.
21011,Homer,"well, i think i can make it out. ""are you a homosex..."""
21020,Homer,"aw, that's sweet, honey. i'll bring you back a hat."
21022,Homer,"oh, he did, did he? i'll show him! i'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
21027,Homer,"uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
21028,Homer,i like you.
21029,Homer,maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
21040,Homer,i always thought lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
21041,Homer,no!
21046,Homer,"well, i guess that's everyone. except earring-boy."
21053,Homer,with a knife.
21064,Homer,"damage report, mr. moe."
21066,Homer,"yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
21077,Homer,"mr. moe, prepare to surface."
21084,Homer,"i don't think so, son."
21095,Homer,"shutup! shutup! if i don't hear you, it's not illegal. okay, i need some deductions! deductions! ah! business gifts!"
21096,Homer,here you go. keep using nuclear power.
21098,Homer,"if i don't see it, it's not illegal!"
21099,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
21107,Homer,i'm very happy to meet you.
21108,Homer,"okay, but could you pay me under the table? i got a little tax problem."
21109,Homer,"not spy, squeal. i've got no choice."
21119,Homer,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. end transmission."
21123,Homer,losers...
21128,Homer,"uhh, i don't know what to tell you."
21129,Homer,"well, mr. burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
21142,Homer,i'm gonna write the best darn article... oh wait.
21146,Homer,but i can't leave the country! what about my wife and kids?
21148,Homer,woo hoo! we can gamble!
21164,Homer,"enfeebled?! oo, i know just the guy! be right back."
21169,Homer,"this ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."
21176,Homer,would you... stop that! you're a helper monkey. this isn't helping!
21181,Homer,"no, no. he's fine. go on, mojo, show marge your happy dance."
21183,Homer,they didn't have lord huggington?
21186,Homer,oh-ho yeahhh...
21191,Homer,"ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... garbage water! oh-ho-ho!"
21194,Homer,"you guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! yeah, i'm talkin' to you! you trash-eatin' stink bags!"
21197,Homer,"that was yesterday, moron!"
21201,Homer,"siddown, honey. the men will clear the table!"
21209,Homer,"yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do. anyway, i think those garbage men are starting to crack."
21224,Homer,you want to know what i think?
21226,Homer,i want to register to run for sanitation commissioner. and tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
21227,Homer,"why you little... no one's gonna beat ya, son. you're gonna get such a beating."
21228,Homer,"hey, vote simpson... hi... nice to see ya... heh, thanks for comin' out... keep puttin' on weight, huh? lenny, my man."
21232,Homer,"take a hike, kojak."
21234,Homer,"quiet, you! i know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. but i also know you care about the race for sanitation commissioner. so, let me give ya the 911..."
21242,Homer,can't someone else do it?
21253,Homer,"well, then you shoulda been early."
21259,Homer,fifty cents? not likely.
21264,Homer,"jean-paul, how are the new uniforms? do they match the suede boots? beautiful. did you get the new trucks? are they amphibious? well, there's only one way to find out. we can always buy more."
21265,Homer,"yes, i gotta work hard, honey. daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
21266,Homer,"oh, the garbage man can, marge. the garbage man can."
21270,Homer,"they let me sign checks with a stamp, marge. a stamp!"
21272,Homer,"'mornin', boys."
21280,Homer,"now, uh, you were saying how great i was...?"
21284,Homer,"yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
21286,Homer,"yeah, but can he do this?"
21293,Homer,i agree. let's surrender.
21294,Homer,"hmm... all right, but don't lose them. they're my only pair."
21303,Homer,"oh, great. now the cat knows."
21328,Homer,"hospital, please."
21334,Homer,you? did?
21337,Homer,"that's right, brad and neil. i only eat power sauce -- the bar with apple-saucicity."
21340,Homer,"oh, man, this is hard."
21343,Homer,"wake up, you lazy sherpas. we've got a mountain to climb!"
21348,Homer,"hey, deng xiao-ping died."
21357,Homer,"""last entry. i have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. worse still, that treacherous skunk abe simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
21362,Homer,"hey. wait a minute. i'm on the top. i actually did it. i climbed the unclimbable mountain! bow down before me, everyone! for i am your king!"
21365,Homer,"why don't you tell me, son? see any interesting flags up there?"
21366,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
21369,Homer,"huh? whuh? hyuwhuh? i'm awake! i'm awake! i'm a productive member of the team! you can't fire me, i quit! please, i have a family! well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer."
21372,Homer,hope this stuff holds.
21373,Homer,hello?
21382,Homer,"uh, yesss... but now i have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
21386,Homer,has anyone seen my little girl?
21390,Homer,"keep it moving, marge. this isn't a parking lot."
21391,Homer,"uh, yes sir, mr. burns, sir."
21401,Homer,"oh, no! i'm gonna go off the end of the --"
21408,Homer,"stupid risks are what make life worth living. now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. but me, i'm a risk taker. and that's why i have so many adventures."
21413,Homer,good. you're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
21415,Homer,uh... not this exquisite.
21419,Homer,"anytime, honey. just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. now let's get home before your mother kills us."
21424,Homer,"oh, happy anniversary, marge."
21425,Homer,"hey, look what was in here. a program from that guy's funeral."
21428,Homer,you mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? why was i not informed?
21434,Homer,"so, you gonna..."
21442,Homer,ahh!
21450,Homer,the food!
21452,Homer,okay.
21457,Homer,"when you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
21459,Homer,that was close!
21462,Homer,"bart, i told you not to leave that tv on."
21473,Homer,"there's the dirty girl i married. come on, i have a disgusting idea."
21480,Homer,it hasn't changed since that magical evening when i knocked you up.
21484,Homer,"ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?"
21496,Homer,"no, that was not the thing."
21499,Homer,why don't you take a picture? it lasts longer.
21511,Homer,and now for the profit taking.
21514,Homer,"no, through savings and wise investments. of course with grease!"
21515,Homer,where do you think you're goin'?
21520,Homer,and i get my money from grease. what's the problem?
21523,Homer,"li-sa, i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. but apparently this new girl is. so my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
21525,Homer,oh i'll say. look at that redheaded kid. there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
21526,Homer,all right. we'll try it your way.
21531,Homer,"hey, that's my shovel."
21532,Homer,"oh, i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. i've been muscled out of everything i've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
21539,Homer,mmm... i knew i should have attached those somehow.
21542,Homer,it's not working.
21544,Homer,bringin' up the rear.
21547,Homer,and now we wait. so... is this your school?
21548,Homer,"uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... scotland."
21556,Homer,half my life gone! and i'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
21560,Homer,"no, i don't deserve sugar. i'm halfway to my grave, and i haven't accomplished anything. oh, i am not looking forward to my funeral."
21563,Homer,"i've wasted half my life, marge. do you know how many memories i have? three! standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. thirty-eight years and that's all i have to show for it."
21566,Homer,"oh, all right. maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong."
21567,Homer,all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir.
21569,Homer,hike.
21570,Homer,"oh, i shoulda punted. turn it off! turn it off!"
21572,Homer,"no one man can do all that. you're a liar, honey. a dirty, rotten liar."
21573,Homer,"really? a restaurant? well, now i don't know what to think."
21578,Homer,"and these hardy boys books are great, too. this one is about smugglers."
21579,Homer,"no, not this one. ""the smugglers of pirate cove."" it's about pirates."
21583,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, lenny. but here's one that's even more spellbinding. once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison. and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph..."
21587,Homer,... and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. some kind of scary telephone i guess. or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.
21589,Homer,"marge, that's it! that's why i haven't done anything with my life! i need to be more like thomas edison!"
21593,Homer,"yes, you did. i remember your exact words. you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
21599,Homer,"uh, this isn't working. i've got to try a different approach."
21601,Homer,shutup.
21602,Homer,"as long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. now, here's how it works: lisa, you say one thing, then bart, you say another. just toss out things and i'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea."
21604,Homer,uh-huh.
21611,Homer,you mean like an electric blanketmobile?
21612,Homer,hamburger earmuffs!
21619,Homer,this will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
21625,Homer,"oh, look what you did. now i have to get my cold cream gun."
21630,Homer,yes? yes? yes?
21642,Homer,that chair might be the only one he made.
21645,Homer,taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon.
21655,Homer,"oh. well then, we'll take it out on eli whitney."
21659,Homer,"mail call! gather 'round, everyone!"
21660,Homer,"all right. one for ""resident""..."
21667,Homer,nah. they mess up my hair.
21668,Homer,ooh. ball one.
21675,Homer,all right.
21678,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i'll get him. ba-art!"
21683,Homer,"and get a little something for yourself, sweetheart."
21685,Homer,"or reading comic books. what am i, kreskin? you tell me what he's doing."
21686,Homer,"oh, man. this is the most exciting thing i've seen since haley's comet collided with the moon!"
21689,Homer,why is this taking so long? bart was born in about five minutes.
21690,Homer,"really? well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
21696,Homer,stupid cards.
21704,Homer,"i know you are, but what am i?"
21705,Homer,"it's hammer time, snitchy."
21706,Homer,"oh, my god!"
21710,Homer,there. now no murderers can get in... or out.
21713,Homer,"daddy would like a word with you, barty!"
21714,Homer,but i look so youthful and hunky.
21721,Homer,"i'll show you, hair!"
21723,Homer,... show you...
21732,Homer,look at him go.
21734,Homer,i just lost my appetite.
21739,Homer,"look, marge! maggie lost her baby legs!"
21743,Homer,"hello-- oh, great. mormons."
21750,Homer,"oh, i was having the most wonderful dream. i had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
21753,Homer,"aw, four a.m. now i'll never get back to..."
21755,Homer,"screw this. hang on, everyone. we're takin' the ol' simpson shortcut."
21757,Homer,"eat my dust, suckers!"
21758,Homer,"mmmm. ugh, pesticides! carbomate, if i'm not mistaken. yep, carbomate."
21759,Homer,i see it.
21761,Homer,lower! lower!
21768,Homer,tow rope?
21770,Homer,here we go!
21772,Homer,"faster, marge! faster! the snapping turtles are massing!"
21778,Homer,"oh, this is not good."
21782,Homer,"ohhh my god, i am such a huge, huge fan of yours, miss basinger."
21783,Homer,"well, i am a married man..."
21784,Homer,billy baldwin!
21785,Homer,"so, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?"
21786,Homer,wait! tell me over breakfast. who's for pancakes?
21787,Homer,"oh, i don't want to be a bother. anyway, what are you two big hollywood stars doing in good ol' springfield?"
21788,Homer,"oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... bethesda?"
21794,Homer,"yeah, you owe me that much."
21795,Homer,absolutely. if you promise to keep mine.
21798,Homer,nowhere famous.
21811,Homer,it's called a lawnmower. i invented it. you want one?
21820,Homer,"oh, there's that movie script i wrote. where did you find it?"
21821,Homer,"the important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. either one of you. it's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. ron howard's attached to direct."
21827,Homer,i might have.
21834,Homer,"i'm looking at you, horshak."
21839,Homer,"oh, how could alec and kim just cut me out of their lives?"
21840,Homer,"when kim makes a manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. and would it kill you to put some fennel in it?"
21858,Homer,"yes, i do."
21864,Homer,"slow down, fellas. i've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future."
21887,Homer,"my head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. i'll do it!"
21891,Homer,bummer... love-in... dean rusk... by george i've got it!
21893,Homer,"no way, narc. bodily functions are a natural thing."
21900,Homer,"that was cool. think i'll stick around. we've got everything we need right here. good times, sunshine, free love..."
21911,Homer,"never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!"
21914,Homer,marge. not in front of the hippies.
21917,Homer,"no, no, no. marge was definitely freaked out."
21919,Homer,i'm sensing some negative vibes here. but i promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
21924,Homer,perhaps in time.
21926,Homer,"well, i do walk through pretty much anything... ohh, you kids are sweet."
21928,Homer,"sleep gentle hippies, sleep. let old homer jay set things right."
21929,Homer,"good morning, starshine. seth."
21935,Homer,"look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man."
21936,Homer,"hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on."
21940,Homer,can't you just prune some of the leaves so i can watch tv?
21947,Homer,"why? we're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free."
21960,Homer,no problem. i picked some up at the store.
21963,Homer,"okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. according to my driver's license, i weigh 140 pounds."
21968,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!"
21974,Homer,"feel that, marge? he likes you!"
21975,Homer,and now for the main course...
21983,Homer,here's a little playmate for you.
21984,Homer,"hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. what's wrong with you?"
21986,Homer,"sorry, marge. pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. but don't worry. i put him in a nice hot bath."
21990,Homer,"oh god, that's tasty. i wish pinchy were here to enjoy this. ohhh, pinchy!"
21992,Homer,uh-oh. tape must have fallen off.
22001,Homer,"hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!"
22004,Homer,"what the heck is this, a tea party? somebody kill somebody!"
22011,Homer,"wow, get a load of that toilet."
22012,Homer,"we're almost home, dad. only a couple more times over the horizon."
22013,Homer,you just sit back and relax. i'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
22023,Homer,"""apes-a-poppin'!"" oooh, the airline version!"
22028,Homer,procedure. deadly procedure.
22031,Homer,"yeah, i guess."
22033,Homer,"marge, i've been thinking. what if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, i gave grampa that artificial kidney i invented?"
22035,Homer,i owe dad so much. those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
22043,Homer,i'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
22050,Homer,a tramp steamer! that's perfect!
22059,Homer,"well, back on land, my name was homer simpson. and i guess it is here, too. i promised my dad one of my kidneys, but i chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
22065,Homer,"all right, i'm gonna..."
22068,Homer,"boy, that..."
22069,Homer,ow!
22073,Homer,you butchers! give it back! gimme that! gim--
22083,Homer,you stupid nerds! he's trying to save you money on long distance!
22090,Homer,"oh, how was i supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?"
22102,Homer,access denied.
22108,Homer,"oh, honey, don't be so naive. that's how the world works. sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
22118,Homer,go nuts.
22121,Homer,"okay, we'll call it even."
22123,Homer,his corpse is climbing the building!
22128,Homer,"ooh, the mafia guy's all mad. oh, what are you gonna do? call your godfather? huh? ooh, godfather. break it down!"
22138,Homer,"okay, mr. burns, fat tony, what's-his-name... fat tony?!"
22140,Homer,"mayor, fat tony asked me to give you this--"
22143,Homer,potatoes are clean. the poison must be in the steak.
22160,Homer,really? you think i should get it washed?
22163,Homer,"ten dollars?! what is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
22166,Homer,"well, we'll see about that."
22168,Homer,"that's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. how, you ask? with a phony senior discount card!"
22176,Homer,fire in the hole!
22188,Homer,congratulations! welcome to the homer simpson program.
22197,Homer,then we're goin' to las vegas! which is actually back in that direction.
22199,Homer,"relax, i called her from the gas station."
22201,Homer,i don't think so.
22203,Homer,hey! lance murdock!
22204,Homer,"he's a daredevil, ned. he laughs at death."
22205,Homer,"ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! pick him!"
22208,Homer,bo-ring.
22218,Homer,"oh, never mind. just pay attention."
22222,Homer,"and for you, ned?"
22226,Homer,"hey, smooth move, flanders!"
22240,Homer,"chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig..."
22263,Homer,"oh, stupid isotopes. hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
22267,Homer,and it sucked!
22276,Homer,wooooo! 'topes ruuuule!
22281,Homer,isotoooopes! wooo!
22286,Homer,last night?
22293,Homer,"kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! and they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! so-- oh, right. sorry."
22294,Homer,"marge, kite."
22298,Homer,bo-ring. go back to that infamy guy.
22307,Homer,"wow, a val-u-qual coupon book!"
22308,Homer,let's see. ten percent off carpet cleaning. ten! two pizzas for the price of one at doughy's.
22316,Homer,no.
22319,Homer,"no! wait! this is all my fault! oh, if i could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires..."
22326,Homer,homer simpson at the super bowl?

22342,Homer,"okay, dan. fire away."
22346,Homer,"scalping tickets to the super bowl. have you no shame, sir? i should give you a royal caning."
22347,Homer,"aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. wally and i have all the tickets we need."
22360,Homer,i didn't ask for your life story. just give me the key.
22370,Homer,"hey, howyadoin'?"
22371,Homer,"well, it's about time."
22378,Homer,"dog, cat?"
22379,Homer,"oh, i can't wait. look, marge, i had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
22393,Homer,take it or leave it... carl.
22398,Homer,shutup! i'm not your clown! don't diminish me!
22401,Homer,i can't understand what happened. why did they change homer simpson's character from cool to stupid?
22405,Homer,"people are laughing at me, marge. let's get outta here. forget the baby's medicine."
22415,Homer,it better have.
22425,Homer,"yes, briefly."
22433,Homer,so i want the monogram to read m-a-x p-o-w-
22435,Homer,"and if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
22441,Homer,"marge, this is thai food. from now on, i want it morning, noon and night."
22442,Homer,when trent steel bought me some.
22443,Homer,he's max power's oldest and dearest friend.
22450,Homer,and i counted the pennies in the ashtray.
22454,Homer,"anyway, marge. uh, how do you feel about the economy?"
22455,Homer,"so i said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come i can't eat the walls?"""
22459,Homer,whuh?!
22463,Homer,"what's going on, trent? where are you taking me?"
22465,Homer,"oh, marge. i thought it would be fun to be on springfield's ""a"" list, but these people are nuts."
22475,Homer,what?
22483,Homer,"sh-sh-sh. anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon..."
22484,Homer,"i'm never eatin' chili again. ooh, chili!"
22494,Homer,"""you're a-peeling. let's never split."" that's funny 'cause they're monkeys. so long, rejects."
22497,Homer,sweet mint julep... i'll be at moe's.
22507,Homer,"yeah, i hate that song."
22516,Homer,"c'mon, apu. make your move."
22517,Homer,i'unno. gasoline? axes? i got some stuff in the trunk.
22522,Homer,"oh, baby. we got him now. there's no escape from the airport."
22527,Homer,"sir elton, my noble friends and i would like to dub you a knight of the... grand concourse."
22532,Homer,"hey, you with the scarf! stop skywriting!"
22533,Homer,i am so sick of that damn code!
22547,Homer,canyonero...
22557,Homer,"are you saying i'm gay? because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
22559,Homer,sucker.
22561,Homer,"marge, you've been out there all morning."
22562,Homer,so... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
22565,Homer,at least i've got a license.
22577,Homer,marge!
22581,Homer,nice rhino.
22584,Homer,"oh, marge, you saved me!"
22585,Homer,is there anything that guy doesn't know?
22589,Homer,i've got to warn everybody about hitler! and get to the ice cream store!
22590,Homer,shut up! you haven't even been born yet.
22595,Homer,"hey, marge, what's your favorite radio station?"
22597,Homer,what's your favorite radio station?
22600,Homer,they know i'm kidding.
22615,Homer,wha?!
22618,Homer,"it's called caring, marge."
22622,Homer,wha?! i heard a yell. did you touch a wire?
22635,Homer,"oh, honey, you missed a great race. bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and i won!"
22643,Homer,great. maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
22650,Homer,"i'm sorry, lisa. oh, it's not your fault. i know we love each other, dad, but we're two very different people. and, much as i hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart."
22651,Homer,"oh lisa, honey, i won't ever let that happen."
22652,Homer,"nah, you must be thinking of your mother. i'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... can't we just go in?"
22654,Homer,"other cultures are fine. i'm just saying i can get along in life without a ""tooth brush."""
22656,Homer,absolutely not. my little girl's tummy hurts. do you have anything to stop her complaining?
22663,Homer,"heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something."
22666,Homer,"okay, i'm ready to get out now... yoo hoo! hippie lady! hippie lady?! hey! hippie lady!"
22670,Homer,hi sweetie.
22679,Homer,"c'mon, everybody, we're going to the slaughterhouse!"
22686,Homer,it's you! you're him! you're tony randall!
22697,Homer,don't you have school?
22698,Homer,"ah, touch√©."
22700,Homer,aren't you gonna say bye?
22701,Homer,that didn't sound like you meant it.
22703,Homer,why you gotta... come on! ah! now i'm gettin' the hang of this thing. i don't know why i didn't become a trucker before.
22707,Homer,that little punk.
22712,Homer,for now...
22714,Homer,stupid!
22721,Homer,okay-we're-all-set-let's-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal!
22723,Homer,i fell asleep at the wheel! but we didn't crash. it's a miracle!
22725,Homer,the what now?
22728,Homer,"wow! you guys are even lazier than me! well, don't worry. i'll keep your secret."
22729,Homer,"hey, bart, watch me run down this old lady."
22733,Homer,"relax, everybody! the navitron auto-drive system is driving the truck for me! but keep it a secret! it's a big scam! okay?"
22737,Homer,"oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
22738,Homer,"eat water, good buddy."
22739,Homer,"i think we lost 'em, bart."
22740,Homer,"well, well, well. looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy."
22745,Homer,"i'm not red, i'm homer."
22750,Homer,"well, son. i guess it's time to go home."
22751,Homer,"no, but i'm sure the good lord will provide."
22752,Homer,thank you.
22753,Homer,"oh, man. this is the hottest easter ever."
22759,Homer,is there!
22760,Homer,don't mind if i do!
22761,Homer,"uh, good morning, lord. i just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate."
22768,Homer,you're pretty uptight for a naked chick. you know what would loosen you up? a little fruit.
22776,Homer,"this is my fault. i shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""applegate"" thing."
22783,Homer,"oh, yeah. definitely pain!"
22784,Homer,this sucks. things were so much better back in the garden.
22787,Homer,i never used those pizza coupons.
22791,Homer,you put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / you put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...
22805,Homer,we can all burn evidence in it.
22806,Homer,"there, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?"
22810,Homer,stupid lisa.
22814,Homer,come on... fit you...
22816,Homer,why?! why must life be so hard? why must i fail in every attempt at masonry?
22820,Homer,"but, but..."
22822,Homer,all right! my bumper fell off!
22823,Homer,not my fault! act of god! act of god!
22829,Homer,"uh... all right! just go ahead and sue me. everybody else does! the average settlement is $68,000."
22840,Homer,"astrid said the key to my art is anger. but you know me, i'm mister mellow."
22846,Homer,is it about pies?
22853,Homer,"marge, i've screwed up everything i've ever done. i mean, look at bart. but i finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. and that feels pretty good."
22865,Homer,matt groening? what's he doing in a museum? he can barely draw.
22875,Homer,eww...
22882,Homer,why'd he do that?
22892,Homer,"wake up! wake up, springfield!"
22903,Homer,"just for the prototype, honey."
22910,Homer,"to you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover."
22911,Homer,he says what we're all thinking.
22918,Homer,"boy, lenny, you sure look hungry. have some nuts."
22919,Homer,"now if you want to be the life of the party like lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item."
22923,Homer,"now, watch this..."
22926,Homer,but you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow! ta-daa!
22927,Homer,"now if i drop her, no more tears."
22929,Homer,you flush one down / it swirls around / nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
22932,Homer,and i do! woo!
22933,Homer,"oh, we stopped those when the kids said i was too fat to carry."
22937,Homer,"pew, well, i dodged a bullet."
22938,Homer,clown.
22943,Homer,i do!
22944,Homer,i don't know. just give me the dollar.
22959,Homer,"ooo, arthur fortune. you know what that fabulous man just did? he gave the springfield zoo two male pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
22963,Homer,"do you really think you can capture the loch ness monster? i mean, he's eluded leonard nimoy and peter graves."
22964,Homer,"hey, willie. that old couple looks just like you."
22966,Homer,"uh, to work in your power plant?"
22971,Homer,no way! aberdeen rules!
22975,Homer,"so what do we do with our friend here? uh, throw him in the dumpster?"
22981,Homer,i'm hot... so very hot...
22982,Homer,fours?
22983,Homer,ow! ow! oh!
22992,Homer,"yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale."
22998,Homer,"uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
22999,Homer,"well, i don't, but the block association seems to. they wanted a ""traditional"" santa claus."
23003,Homer,please be kind.
23009,Homer,it's time to get homer-erotic.
23011,Homer,i've got something for you.
23027,Homer,"come on, lisa! monkeys!"
23029,Homer,ahh! undo! undo! uhh.
23041,Homer,"maybe you're right, ned. maybe you're right."
23047,Homer,"well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund."
23048,Homer,"a little late for ""could've's,"" marge."
23051,Homer,"oh, so flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?"
23059,Homer,here's our room!
23063,Homer,whew. all that seizing made me hungry.
23065,Homer,i can't believe they stuck us at taxachusetts.
23084,Homer,it's a crane. the japanese believe they bring good luck.
23089,Homer,"do ""ow that hurts."""
23093,Homer,"well, at least we're past the lightning round."
23098,Homer,it burns! it burns!
23099,Homer,"before i go, i want to say something. game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. but somewhere along the line, you lost your way. for shame."
23106,Homer,"yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too."
23107,Homer,"relax, we're in an electric car."
23114,Homer,"um, i'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. can i have my prize now?"
23117,Homer,"aww, movie tickets! that hardly seems worth destroying a car."
23121,Homer,okay...
23123,Homer,i will now.
23125,Homer,at least the jimmy stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
23129,Homer,got a pencil?
23133,Homer,"door, marge."
23137,Homer,huh?
23146,Homer,"sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. mel's movie really stinks."
23155,Homer,it was symbolism. he was mad.
23167,Homer,i'm on it.
23169,Homer,sorry i asked.
23193,Homer,"well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture."
23196,Homer,"no, wait. a ghost who wins the lottery! you could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. ooh, what about indiana jones? does anyone own the rights to that?"
23203,Homer,candy bar?
23215,Homer,"geez, what's the big deal? look, i'll even eat some."
23217,Homer,"way to guilt him, marge!"
23221,Homer,"i tell ya, the kid's a wonder. he organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
23230,Homer,oh... marge!
23234,Homer,"well, sure, if it's true."
23235,Homer,ray j. funny... or o.j. funny?
23239,Homer,"hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
23241,Homer,he quit blinking. he says that's when they get ya.
23251,Homer,the frame store! you monster!
23252,Homer,and mark mcgwire gave you an autographed bat.
23257,Homer,"oh, right. ambulance! think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards."
23263,Homer,i'll have you know i wandered off from the tour.
23264,Homer,"oh, i like food all right."
23281,Homer,we make a good team. a groin-grabbingly good team!
23289,Homer,why you little...
23290,Homer,welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. but this is only the beginning...
23300,Homer,sorry.
23301,Homer,"for you, perhaps."
23304,Homer,"oh, that's classic."
23325,Homer,"oh, marge, something bad usually happens to me when i go in anywhere."
23327,Homer,"so what are you up to, young lady?"
23339,Homer,finally getting my comeuppance.
23340,Homer,but it was worth it to get back our super sugar crisp cereal.
23346,Homer,to make sure that no one knows that you're dead. and if anyone asks... you're not dead.
23347,Homer,hey maude! look who's helping me clean the chimney.
23349,Homer,"relax, i'm fine. but when i do die, i don't want any autopsies."
23353,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
23357,Homer,"we'll miss you, buddy."
23359,Homer,"you know, i've never liked that little wiener milhouse."
23362,Homer,who is this?
23363,Homer,"no, it's homer."
23365,Homer,"okay, marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
23369,Homer,"now, flanders, i want you to..."
23370,Homer,"he's undead, all right."
23377,Homer,doin' what now?
23380,Homer,"well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. let's just have some milk and go to bed..."
23385,Homer,"wonders, lisa? or blunders?"
23386,Homer,"implied, lisa? or implode?"
23396,Homer,and there's nobody guarding it. let's go!
23403,Homer,the sun? that's the hottest place on earth!
23405,Homer,"ooo, you don't want to get zorro mad."
23408,Homer,"you're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
23412,Homer,"woo! you go, zorro!"
23413,Homer,why that little... he insulted your honor!
23415,Homer,i challenge you to a duel.
23417,Homer,"uh, uh. ""h"" is for homer."
23427,Homer,duelling at dawn? how did it ever come to this?
23430,Homer,"oh, honey, i had the worst nightmare. this glove kept slapping people and i was getting blamed."
23433,Homer,"save me, marge. i saved you!"
23434,Homer,"oh marge, that's in the past. just let it go."
23436,Homer,"flanders, you gotta help me. is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
23441,Homer,"come on, carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."
23442,Homer,"come on, move it!"
23445,Homer,zo-rrooo!
23460,Homer,this car was made in guatemala.
23462,Homer,"i'm sorry, i believe in good grooming."
23468,Homer,"something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil."
23478,Homer,wait a minute.
23485,Homer,shut up and kiss me.
23487,Homer,"that's all it takes. if we learned one thing from ""the amazing colossal man,"" and ""grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
23489,Homer,"brace yourselves, everybody. you're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. you might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
23498,Homer,who cares what it is? it's growing! i've saved the farm!
23501,Homer,"oh, great. i got a field full of mutants."
23503,Homer,"aw, thanks honey."
23505,Homer,don't push. there's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
23509,Homer,"i wish i could make a difference, lisa, but i'm just one man."
23511,Homer,one hundred and... may i speak to my family for a moment?
23513,Homer,"oh, yeah. let's take it."
23534,Homer,after pie.
23538,Homer,"oooh, where's waldo?"
23550,Homer,"oh, marge, i'm sorry. i can't make it."
23552,Homer,"yeah, so i'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what i really want."
23555,Homer,"hey, guys. is it normal to see burns' face on a bowling ball?"
23562,Homer,ow!
23565,Homer,"get down, get down, get down!"
23566,Homer,woo hoo! this is the greatest day of my life!
23575,Homer,"um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?"
23576,Homer,"hey, this was supposed to be about me. now, any other questions? pumpkin face? headgear? chicken pox? smelly? lazy eye? spikey head? okay, class dismissed. rock on!"
23580,Homer,flavor of the month? me?
23586,Homer,"hey, i thought you never talked."
23595,Homer,what was that about?
23598,Homer,you're right!
23603,Homer,i wanna live!
23606,Homer,"oh, lord... you saved me. i guess you had some higher purpose in mind."
23609,Homer,that's it! kids are the answer! i'll dedicate my life to my children.
23614,Homer,"lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
23615,Homer,"i've been so blind. i'll lavish my attention on maggie, the forgotten simpson."
23619,Homer,there you are.
23622,Homer,"whee! whee! don't be scared, maggie. daddy won't drop you. whee!"
23626,Homer,come to daddy! come to daddy!
23631,Homer,nothing to worry about. just a little wave.
23635,Homer,"maggie, you're swimming! you swam out to save me."
23638,Homer,then don't.
23646,Homer,he's named after what he is.
23647,Homer,"yes, i will have the... pl_penl√ºgen. and don't skimp on the d__dlem√ºnch."
23652,Homer,"whoa, too much information! thanks for the mental picture. why don't you tell us what you really think?"
23654,Homer,more than i wanted to knoooow!
23656,Homer,"so, how's the tribe comin' along? any papooses?"
23659,Homer,"well, don't worry, i can help ya. i'm all about ideas."
23664,Homer,and that's my cue to exit.
23672,Homer,i've been waiting so long to hear that.
23685,Homer,"please, mr. kidkill, look into your heart. i know these babies have a lifetime contract. but what if i put together an even better act for you? something sensational!"
23687,Homer,"okay, okay... don't panic. release the mongoose!"
23689,Homer,what an age we live in.
23695,Homer,"that's right, never!"
23708,Homer,"you know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles."
23714,Homer,oink! oink! oink!
23716,Homer,"and what if we don't, pops?"
23717,Homer,they printed my photo of our gang!
23718,Homer,carl looks great. can't take a bad picture of that guy.
23723,Homer,sorry.
23726,Homer,and some pogs.
23727,Homer,"hello, police? can you send a swat team to 742 evergreen ter..."
23730,Homer,"okay, bikers, that's it. benjamin franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? they're gone! woo hoo!"
23736,Homer,i just don't want to be alone.
23737,Homer,"excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
23738,Homer,that's more like it. i'm looking for...
23739,Homer,i'll show you.
23743,Homer,"no! my wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. i took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
23764,Homer,hah! if i had a nickel for every time i've heard that...
23769,Homer,"um, uh... mr. coleman, i've been thinking... my wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... aw, heck! would you like to spend christmas with us?"
23778,Homer,useless? this flash cube has two flashes left!
23795,Homer,uh... better than that.
23801,Homer,'mornin'...
23805,Homer,"oh, it's a great hat. no one's questioning the hat."

24031,Homer,i can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. and furthermore...
24042,Homer,"no they didn't. they just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit."

24064,Homer,"i know, i know. it's never easy."
24066,Homer,"sleep tight, neddie."
24069,Homer,"yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""i love you,"" or ""you're special."" you know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."
24070,Homer,"now, now, now. don't beat yourself up. i'm the one who drove her out of her seat. i'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. i'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation..."

24098,Homer,"oh, wake up, ned. you think maude isn't dating in heaven?"
24102,Homer,"that's right, ned. those floozies we married in vegas were crazy about you."
24107,Homer,the mother's the voice of reason.

24113,Homer,"yes, i'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. from... anonymous."

25740,Homer,"oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
25744,Homer,see for yourself.
25748,Homer,"i owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."

25894,Homer,"all right, all right. come on, bart."
25895,Homer,that's my little slugger.
25900,Homer,"well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
25904,Homer,"ah, son, it's a little chilly. maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
25905,Homer,what's the big deal? he sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
25915,Homer,we're free! your mother set us free!
25917,Homer,"heyyy, how 'bout that? ha, ha."
25925,Homer,"you know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. and you don't even have to say ""bad."" it could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
25936,Homer,"she lives in a houseboat? wow, she is so cool."
25938,Homer,cops!
25941,Homer,"oh, it's just a friendly seal."
25942,Homer,shut-uuuup...

25994,Homer,"hi, formico."
25998,Homer,"there you go, doll."
25999,Homer,"look, buddy, i don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
26004,Homer,um... the rabbits are cute.

26010,Homer,"moe, we want our bar back."
26011,Homer,"oh, so you're ashamed of us. well, you've turned into a big phony."
26013,Homer,i believe i had a hat.
26014,Homer,suckers!
26018,Homer,"but when i'm passionate about something, i see it through to the end."
26020,Homer,barkeep!
26022,Homer,as soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
26023,Homer,"she's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. hee, hee."
26024,Homer,we're rockin' great!
26027,Homer,"bar? i see no bar. this is a hunting club...which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""
26028,Homer,"which i'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy."
26031,Homer,"okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. come on, turkey. join your friends."
26033,Homer,"here, turkey, turkey... turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey..."
26034,Homer,nobody's gonna kill you.
26050,Homer,"these fortunes are terrible. they're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
26052,Homer,you will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
26053,Homer,"okay, let's see... ""the price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
26059,Homer,"oh. he ran his own casino, stole the loch ness monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun."
26065,Homer,"yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man burns."
26073,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!
26077,Homer,pistol whip?!
26082,Homer,hmm...
26083,Homer,good fire. good fire. keep burning. almost there.
26094,Homer,"hello. this is chad sexington, the model for burly paper towels."
26104,Homer,"no, huh?"
26110,Homer,"look at me, i'm angie dickinson! out of my way!"
26114,Homer,huh?... there have been so many classic simpson moments. i remember that time i tried to jump over springfield gorge...
26116,Homer,"it was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. and to kill the boredom, we sang."
26119,Homer,hey come on...
26121,Homer,"oh, hey, you guys can come with us."
26123,Homer,"yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
26125,Homer,this is it. this is the old quarry.
26130,Homer,"ooh, a movie! i call the couch!"
26131,Homer,"now the movie's turned into a play! still good, though."
26136,Homer,"when you have a rib-eye steak / you must floss it / oh, that meatloaf tasted great / you must floss it / now floss it, floss it good."
26138,Homer,science!?
26144,Homer,what was that?
26151,Homer,"five, four, three, two, one... countdown!"
26152,Homer,"okay nibbles, you can guide her down. step one: right in front of you is a blue handle. pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds..."
26153,Homer,"don't worry, i planned for this."
26157,Homer,i don't know how to feel.
26161,Homer,"hold that thought. bacon up that sausage, boy."
26164,Homer,it's go time.
26168,Homer,so you're back on the winning team?
26189,Homer,"okay, why are we in the woods? is this heaven?"
26193,Homer,gimme that beer!
26204,Homer,yep. our family is as functional as all get out.
26207,Homer,it's okay. we're married.
26209,Homer,"look, i did marry her, but i abandoned her. amber, tell her how i abandoned you."
26216,Homer,use both hands...
26223,Homer,i would if it wasn't for the kids.
26239,Homer,"the simpsons are goin' to mars, so pack your... or maybe i'll think of something else."
26247,Homer,group stunt?
26248,Homer,denver?
26249,Homer,fellow springfielders. i have called you all here so we can enter the duff book of world records.
26250,Homer,we're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
26252,Homer,"wow, my vision is coming to life!"
26255,Homer,why you little!
26256,Homer,wait a minute.
26259,Homer,"now that everyone's so open about being fat, i can finally stop sucking in my gut."
26261,Homer,wait. you went to a sugar factory? were there oompa-loompas?
26262,Homer,"well, well. if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
26264,Homer,i was hoping we could do that together.
26266,Homer,get in the car.
26267,Homer,"thank you, erin choco-snitch. that was a group effort."
26269,Homer,nothing left! nothing left!
26274,Homer,cool.
26277,Homer,i'm only doin' this one more time.
26281,Homer,that wasn't part of the deal!
26283,Homer,'cause i sure haven't.
26293,Homer,"ooh, they're showing the filling now. can they do that?"
26294,Homer,what the hell is that?
26300,Homer,"come on, show the movie!"
26309,Homer,uh-oh.
26316,Homer,"sure thing, alky."
26319,Homer,ostrich burgers! get your ostrich burgers!
26320,Homer,"okay, you pick one out and i'll punch it to death."
26326,Homer,"yes, and i was merely reading the title: ""i'm gonna kill you."""
26327,Homer,yep. nothin' to get excited about.
26330,Homer,"marge, i could stand here and argue with you, but then i'd have to get a new glass of milk. goodnight, honey."
26332,Homer,what?! nooo!
26341,Homer,"that's okay, marge, you're a good wet blanket. the kind i like wrapped around me."
26346,Homer,"spill it, moneybags."
26351,Homer,one squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
26352,Homer,"yeah, i..."
26366,Homer,"hello, dondelinger."
26376,Homer,"goodbye, my darling."
26378,Homer,what did carl think?
26387,Homer,"artie, thanks for saving my life. now, i believe there's a little matter of the million dollars..."
26390,Homer,"goodnight, honey."
26397,Homer,monkeys cry.
26409,Homer,"hello, gentlemen. would you care to meet my new best friend..."
26411,Homer,"these courtside seats are great. thanks for the hookup, wolfie."
26439,Homer,one of the wheels broke off my chair today. but i didn't make a movie about it.
26443,Homer,i've seen drunker.
26444,Homer,for shame!
26454,Homer,here you go. just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. i'll wait in the car.
26455,Homer,that hurts. but i just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
26473,Homer,that was a d.w.i.
26475,Homer,"dad, get up."
26480,Homer,"you're slow to react, dad."
26485,Homer,"straight up, marge. that hoochie only likes you because you can drive."
26489,Homer,and another thing: no death races!
26503,Homer,"that mini-van had the biggest cup holders. and change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!"
26511,Homer,forget it. sacrificing animals is barbaric. now have the slaves kill the wounded.
26513,Homer,"boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!"
26523,Homer,"oh, i'm sorry i was gone so long. but i'm gonna do something i haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash."
26526,Homer,"oh, here's the story of joan of arc..."
26538,Homer,i'm pretty sure it wasn't.
26554,Homer,not again! ow! let's try 'em together.
26564,Homer,then it's settled. the simpsons are going to brazil.
26566,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. so in august... it's cold?"
26568,Homer,"so it's opposite land. crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
26570,Homer,woo hoo!
26571,Homer,"forget every word, boy. it's useless."
26574,Homer,take me to the hotel / my hands are on a guy's ass / boy this dude must work out...
26576,Homer,"i got it, i got, i got it."
26577,Homer,"hey, and a mini-bar hat."
26578,Homer,...i will eat this toblerone / and i will not pay!
26584,Homer,"we'll do our best, honey. now let's get goin'."
26585,Homer,check please.
26587,Homer,how did you know?!
26589,Homer,i hope they're goin' somewhere good.
26590,Homer,"okay boy, let's strut our stuff. i go to rio"") i'm in rio / and i'm walking on the beach / i'm in my speedo..."
26593,Homer,ahhh...
26597,Homer,woo hoo!
26611,Homer,"hey, cut it out! put her down!"
26613,Homer,"okay, that was not cool. we need to lay down some ground rules--"
26615,Homer,"all right, that's it. shoo, you stupid crows! shoo! shoo! shoo!"
26625,Homer,"okay, let's see: ""toke as needed. caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""
26629,Homer,i could walk up to the president and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
26630,Homer,"marge, i just realized: i am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". and if you tell anyone..."
26631,Homer,"hey, it's me. i got marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out."
26633,Homer,"which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. ever."
26636,Homer,"oh-ho-ho-ho right, the god dude. hey, i got a question for you."
26641,Homer,"done and done. now, do wiggum."
26642,Homer,i said wiggum!
26645,Homer,you're covered with a very fine fuzz.
26656,Homer,"whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""the matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. medically."
26660,Homer,"well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands."
26661,Homer,"although, wow!"
26665,Homer,never!
26674,Homer,this stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows friends. but i promised my family i wouldn't smoke it anymore.
26677,Homer,"oh, man. oh, man. we killed mr. burns. mr. burns is gonna be so mad."
26685,Homer,mr. burns has left the building!
26706,Homer,stupid lawn chair!
26709,Homer,"this'll teach that stupid chair. i'm on fire! oh, i hope no one's drawing this. ow!"
26719,Homer,"stupid ""bart-toon""! bart-toon, that's clever. i'm gonna kill him!"
26720,Homer,"stop it! the more you rock, the angrier i get!"
26723,Homer,that's just so obvious!
26729,Homer,very well. i'm not gonna be angry dad for one day longer. i'm giving up anger forever!
26730,Homer,i said anger.
26738,Homer,dirty diapers on strings!
26742,Homer,"well son, i wanna show you how grateful i am. let's go fishing."
26752,Homer,she likes you! put in a good word for grape.
26758,Homer,don't worry. i'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. so cold... so cold...
26760,Homer,why do you always take the side of local merchants?
26761,Homer,"now apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. and here's proof."
26766,Homer,"nothing, nothing. there's nothing eating me up inside."
26779,Homer,"okay, this isn't easy, so i'm just gonna come out and say it."
26782,Homer,yes. you are scum.
26788,Homer,yeah! 'cause if they don't...
26802,Homer,"are you okay, lisa?"
26805,Homer,"hey, where's my keg?"
26827,Homer,"hey, hey, hey, no peeking."
26846,Homer,"thank god. i'm out of matches. oh no, here's another one."
26849,Homer,"eh, you're the shut-in."
26851,Homer,"yeah, i've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking."
26852,Homer,my pleasure.
26872,Homer,gimme some peanuts.
26876,Homer,mrs. bellamy's necklace!
26877,Homer,"you know chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
26879,Homer,can't you do anything? surprise witnesses? evidence tampering? play the race card. play it.
26882,Homer,just think of them as twinkling stars.
26884,Homer,now you do it for me.
26885,Homer,"goodbye, marge."
26886,Homer,what?!
26889,Homer,"well, i'm glad everyone's all right, but i think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for tv ratings."
26891,Homer,"so hot, so sticky..."
26902,Homer,"you've got to set limits, marge."
26903,Homer,yeah. wiggum couldn't catch cooties at milhouse's birthday party.
26905,Homer,"i admit it. i did screw up, but i won't feel guilty until i can put a human face on this."
26906,Homer,wrong answer.
26909,Homer,"see, when you don't use milhouse, it's hard. i love this kid."
26919,Homer,did you steal dolls from my daughter?
26923,Homer,"hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. and i felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
26924,Homer,cheese!
26926,Homer,"you know, i've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, smithers, poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, kwik-e-mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. but protecting springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
26928,Homer,"fellas, i'm starting my own private police force. will you join me?"
26934,Homer,"you're pushing your luck, pal."
26936,Homer,"is this you? if it is, don't dial nine one one. simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two."
26942,Homer,woo hoo! i'm chief of police.
26956,Homer,"yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. and if you kill him, someone'll take his place. and that's pretty much the end of it. the town'll be yours."
26964,Homer,the hammock man! i'm glad he's a little early today.
26970,Homer,you wanna be my slave?
26972,Homer,"speed it up, ugly."
26984,Homer,"yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card."
26988,Homer,"now before i abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?"
26991,Homer,"okay, everyone out!"
26997,Homer,good news.
26999,Homer,"it's okay, boy. you'll be shooting angels in heaven."
27002,Homer,gimme!
27006,Homer,"hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?"
27031,Homer,"hi, moe, got any beer?"
27034,Homer,and you can live with that.
27038,Homer,"jewish? oh, no, i'm not jewish."
27043,Homer,i've had just about enough of you.
27044,Homer,i'm outta here...
27045,Homer,"hey, you want my keys?"
27048,Homer,"running after the car, huh? let's see if you can follow this."
27059,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty great..."

27069,Homer,"""the rolling stones rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!!"" but i thought you guys were mad at me. for once in my life, i'm confused."
27073,Homer,"i'm okay. i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you..."
27075,Homer,what was that?
27077,Homer,woo! std's!
27084,Homer,"ooh, i'm telling mr. jagger."

27129,Homer,"test... ""test test, you're testin' my love for you, check check, you're checkin' to see if i'm true..."""
27139,Homer,i hate reality shows...
27144,Homer,"come on, kids. daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
27150,Homer,"oh, it's red wire to red wire. what idiot dreamed that up?"
27158,Homer,the status quo.
27161,Homer,this is where the kids were last seen.
27165,Homer,dew-ey! dew-ey! dew-ey!
27171,Homer,"well, if bart can be ""el barto""..."
27173,Homer,"huh? oh, right. can you hold it?"
27174,Homer,my real ring's inside a turtle.
27191,Homer,uh... i was gettin' around to it.
27202,Homer,"not at all, sweetie. at least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one."
27206,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
27208,Homer,woo hoo! i got skybox tickets! and with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. life is...
27209,Homer,"check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. if you can call that hockey."
27210,Homer,why can't they just be happy for my success?
27211,Homer,"fine, watch your stupid eagles concert."
27212,Homer,whatever.
27213,Homer,because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
27214,Homer,hm. better add some more nails.
27219,Homer,"eh, that was boring. let's get a hotel."
27225,Homer,"1895, forget it. we'd be too late to save lincoln and too early to save kennedy."
27228,Homer,i'll teach you to whistle on the sabbath!
27233,Homer,"befoul an army helmet? you'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?"
27240,Homer,"all right, let's take that..."
27241,Homer,this comes off.
27243,Homer,"you've been in there over an hour, boy! other people have to confess too, you know. oh, i can't hold it in. i hate this house!"
27255,Homer,"savages! i'll handle this, marge."
27256,Homer,we come in peace. we takem your land.
27258,Homer,and now to wreck their precious helicopter.
27260,Homer,that lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
27268,Homer,perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
27271,Homer,your family is invited to a free weekend at stagnant springs spa.
27276,Homer,"triple, no. definitely no."
27277,Homer,"so, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?"
27279,Homer,you'll understand someday when you have kids.
27285,Homer,i just wanted to impress you.
27287,Homer,"uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, i'd like to buy a copy of jugs and ammo."
27307,Homer,"phew, just italians."
27313,Homer,we're up so high. where could that shot have come from?
27315,Homer,your king needs these stilts!
27323,Homer,"yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. goodnight, son."
27325,Homer,"goodnight, sleepyhead. do you have to poop?"
27326,Homer,you know what made me feel better about myself? that award i got for world's greatest dad.
27332,Homer,it's even boring to fly over it!
27344,Homer,"one churro, please."
27347,Homer,i love that little shill. let's get her that diary.
27359,Homer,mostly no.
27363,Homer,"oh, what have i done? children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
27366,Homer,i did it for the insurance money.
27376,Homer,"i need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think i'm a good dad."
27380,Homer,dot com.
27381,Homer,"ah, the information i've been waiting for."
27392,Homer,"oh yes. well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! how did you spend a thousand dollars?"
27393,Homer,a forty dollar steak?!
27394,Homer,you've been living like a king on my dollar... super unleaded gas... silver bullets?
27400,Homer,"uh, rock strongo."
27406,Homer,"lisa, this is from your mom."
27416,Homer,dexter colt. the man who framed my daughter.
27419,Homer,now what are you gonna do? you can't shoot all of us.
27423,Homer,"well, it wasn't easy, honey, but i'm glad you love me again."
27432,Homer,got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
27433,Homer,the weights that changed you from a bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
27436,Homer,perfect!
27444,Homer,don't worry. everything is fine. what the hell is that?
27452,Homer,marge?
27453,Homer,"listen kids, your mom is going to be living in the basement. but with our love, she'll get better soon."
27456,Homer,"wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! isn't it, kids?"
27458,Homer,yes way!
27461,Homer,"no, actually, i'm going to eat twice as much."
27467,Homer,your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
27472,Homer,denser?!
27473,Homer,marge?
27476,Homer,"ready for a real workout, marge?"
27484,Homer,huh?
27498,Homer,"die, monster!"
27500,Homer,"o lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz."
27501,Homer,yes!
27520,Homer,"he's not giving it to me, god is. because i prayed for it."
27528,Homer,"i can't get enough of you, baby..."
27529,Homer,we'll just see about that.
27530,Homer,"i'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now."
27534,Homer,"eh, god's cool."
27536,Homer,"everybody, look at the much-needed rain. thank you, god. now turn the rainwater into wine."
27540,Homer,it's such a mess. watch the teeth!
27546,Homer,"i know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, daddy's a hero!"
27547,Homer,"see, bart. i saved you."
27553,Homer,who is it?
27562,Homer,why you little...! why you little...!
27563,Homer,"son, i just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, i'm gonna be the best dad i can."
27565,Homer,mmmmm... garnish.
27566,Homer,what the--? half goes to bart. half goes to my vegas wife. what's left for moe?
27568,Homer,i was told this would be televised!
27569,Homer,"go ahead, leave. you'll come crawling back."
27572,Homer,"look out, son. this one's got a little mustard on it!"
27573,Homer,attaboy! we just won the world series! you and me together! yeah!
27574,Homer,"of all the sites on all the web, i had to click onto his."
27577,Homer,for the past week i've been carrying around this bag of sugar. it's taught me how to love and care for a child.
27582,Homer,"you know son, i've been doing a lot of thinking. i was wrong to exploit you, and i won't do it again."
27584,Homer,"psst, mr. hawk. may i have a word with you?"
27587,Homer,"yeah, i make up words too. anyway, i was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so i can be a hero to my boy again."
27588,Homer,groovy.
27591,Homer,not very!
27594,Homer,"woo hoo! i rule this pseudo sport! come back to me, boy!"
27598,Homer,anything... as long as i can give the money to my son.
27601,Homer,what did they say about my scalp?
27603,Homer,"wow, i can't wait to pack that into my colon."
27604,Homer,"i got arm veins, don't i?"
27610,Homer,"hm, now without lettuce."
27623,Homer,you don't understand. it's not just a sandwich. it's about brotherhood. it's about freedom. it's about three days since i've had one! i'm getting the shakes... and i'm getting the fries!
27624,Homer,this can only be good.
27626,Homer,the pig?
27627,Homer,"welcome to the real world, hippies!"
27628,Homer,"lisa? is this what i've come to? fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? mister, i'll take that car."
27632,Homer,it came out again.
27633,Homer,"enough talk. dip me, my love."
27638,Homer,ooh! lemme guess. skinner's mother. she sure knows how to swing it.
27641,Homer,now wait just a minute -- i used to worry marge was too good for me. she was always thinking of ways to improve me. but then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. so we're all where we want to be.
27643,Homer,"hello? yes, i'm ned flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. oh yes, i she does look pregnant. now, who might you be? a tabloid? is that one of those really strong mints? hello? hello?"
27650,Homer,uh-oh. here comes helen fielding.
27655,Homer,marge germs!
27659,Homer,i'm on my way. you man the rake.
27661,Homer,never!
27663,Homer,"now cookie, do you think you can sell this house?"
27664,Homer,"see, it all works out?"
27666,Homer,that's a great idea. why didn't you say something before?
27671,Homer,"it's just an expression, marge."
27672,Homer,"eh, i'm still undecided."
27677,Homer,from the unknown toaster.
27680,Homer,"sir, i studied under ed mcmahon!"
27681,Homer,how 'bout before?
27682,Homer,you call this a bicameral legislature?
27686,Homer,"oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire."
27687,Homer,"children, so na√Øve."
27691,Homer,"thanks for the love tip, ""60 minutes ii."""
27699,Homer,marge doesn't think i'm sexy. what am i supposed to do?
27702,Homer,"""releasing your inner screenplay,"" ""create an online kennel,"" ooh, ""strip for your wife!"""
27703,Homer,dr. hibbert? you're the teacher?
27711,Homer,"oooh, published by kinko's!"
27713,Homer,yes!
27719,Homer,do your homework!
27720,Homer,don't do so much homework!
27722,Homer,"you, let's love. now!"
27723,Homer,go on ahead. i'll just slow you down.
27729,Homer,"mr. burns, i've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency."
27735,Homer,i gave mr. burns the best years of my life. and how much respect does he give me?
27746,Homer,hello!
27749,Homer,"that's right. and as my first act... mr. burns, you're fired!"
27752,Homer,mr. burns?
27757,Homer,... iffic management!
27758,Homer,"unlike mr. burns, i will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. and now, as i ascend this crystal staircase to my office, i say: avert your gaze!"
27776,Homer,mr. burns! where's mr. smithers?
27777,Homer,"how did you ever run this place? you've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon..."
27782,Homer,there you go.
27783,Homer,"from now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest dad."
27785,Homer,"oh, you want a piece of me?"
27795,Homer,duh-uh.
27811,Homer,"oh, that takes me back."
27815,Homer,"oh, right. chinese guy, chinese guy, frisbee dog..."
27817,Homer,now let's see. this is either an old coconut... or tom hayden.
27818,Homer,it's the only worthwhile thing i ever made that wasn't lisa.
27822,Homer,"puzzle piece, come out and play-ay."
27825,Homer,t-shirt from our first rock concert...
27831,Homer,let's go to ihop! i'm drivin'.
27833,Homer,"why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment."
27840,Homer,"more like, where didn't i find it. it was practically everywhere."
27841,Homer,quit changing the subject. how do you feel about me right now?
27842,Homer,so you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
27843,Homer,fine. i'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.
27852,Homer,you don't have a doorknob.
27872,Homer,how much do you tip a leg waxer? i need to know by tomorrow!
27876,Homer,weird al yankovic!
27878,Homer,"which one was better: ""livin' la pizza loca"" or ""another one bites the crust""?"
27879,Homer,"yeah, like you and allan sherman."
27880,Homer,it would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
27892,Homer,"you know, moe, i was just thinking. my problems with marge started because i drink too much. and then tonight alcohol only made things worse. maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
27903,Homer,"flanders, i am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. but even i have my limits. now beat it!"
27916,Homer,"hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?"
27923,Homer,those poor hats.
27924,Homer,"coming, sweetie!"
27925,Homer,can you shoot one where i'm rambo and my wife is betty boop?
27933,Homer,stop shoving! the little one isn't getting any.
27943,Homer,"look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats."
27946,Homer,who is he?!
27950,Homer,only losers buy wood. we're going to nature's lumberyard.
27953,Homer,did frank lloyd wright have to deal with people like you?
27959,Homer,"heck no, the amish did it. who knows more about electricity than the amish?"
27961,Homer,head burning... legs freezing. middle... very pleasant.
27962,Homer,"oh thank god, the dog's here! pull me free, boy."
27964,Homer,hey! where are you goin'? i'm your pal! i took you for a walk once!
27966,Homer,move the net under the window.
27977,Homer,"i want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. marge, prepare the emergency ham."
27982,Homer,"who are you, my biographer?"
27983,Homer,"boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of marge."
27986,Homer,"aww. there, there, boy. i'll help you get him back. he may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a simpson that isn't."
27993,Homer,"marge, they're just hams, okay."
27994,Homer,"well, boy, now that we got you back, i'm never gonna let you go again."
27998,Homer,"yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna."
28005,Homer,can i get a phone that plays the mexican hat dance?
28007,Homer,"barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
28009,Homer,black power! black power!

28021,Homer,"that reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in shelbyville."
28024,Homer,where is your mother? i've gotta get to moe's.
28030,Homer,"you know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy i am."
28033,Homer,"calm down, stresserella!"
28035,Homer,"marge, you don't know what you're saying!"
28038,Homer,psst. bishop to queen four.
28039,Homer,"i said, ""bishop to queen four."""
28040,Homer,"thanks, mr. burns. i owe it all to walking."
28041,Homer,how 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
28054,Homer,"i say ""of course i can -- screw you!"""
28055,Homer,"oh, i love to perambulate / it's standing still i really hate / so let me please reiterate / i love to..."
28060,Homer,"hot! hot! hot! warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!"
28062,Homer,"marge, you're trying to hurt me!"
28065,Homer,"who's ""we""? got a mouse in your purse?"
28066,Homer,nothing could be farther from the...

28122,Homer,"ooo, a hotdog!"
28124,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
28130,Homer,look at those pants. they're standing up with no one in them.
28131,Homer,"oh my god, i'm late for work."
28133,Homer,"yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. she--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
28135,Homer,"i said, pipe down, amtrak."
28140,Homer,your turn.
28141,Homer,moe?! what are you doing here?
28142,Homer,"that's it, moe. this is just too weird. you are not allowed to see maggie anymore."
28146,Homer,"yeah. you know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."
28149,Homer,thank goodness.
28152,Homer,"oh my god, i've gotta save her!"
28155,Homer,"or worse, am i right?"
28157,Homer,"you kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! eat fire, punks!"
28159,Homer,beat the lumps. beat the lumps. beat the lumps.
28162,Homer,does this mean they'll never cancel the jim belushi show?
28164,Homer,"death, death, we miss you so much. you were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. and you made nascar racing exciting."
28171,Homer,"jasper, your time has come!"
28175,Homer,hm.
28181,Homer,come on!
28185,Homer,"the nobel prize! finally. so, uh it's for what, my whole deal?"
28196,Homer,this counts as a bath!
28197,Homer,whom? whom?
28199,Homer,"honey, this is your moment in the sun. and i couldn't be more pleased for your happiness."
28208,Homer,this is what happens when i go for six hours without sleep.
28211,Homer,oh my god!
28216,Homer,"marge, i don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
28217,Homer,"all right, i will."
28219,Homer,psst. hey pal. hey buddy. wake up. wanna go on an adventure with your old man?
28231,Homer,fine.
28234,Homer,"i barely know my mother. and every time i see her, she's taken away again. and when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
28241,Homer,"you weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and i want you to see it."
28245,Homer,no! i can't lose my mother again! don't take her away!
28247,Homer,you're right. people should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
28250,Homer,next.
28251,Homer,pass.
28268,Homer,"i couldn't sleep, because i thought there might be a sign of my mom in one of these articles. they never did find her body."
28269,Homer,"last week's garbage. i missed the pick-up date. but it doesn't matter, because my mom is alive. see?"
28275,Homer,woo-hoo!
28278,Homer,i'd like to cash in these chips. give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
28287,Homer,"oh, i'm so confused."
28294,Homer,"why can't you have a normal dream, like being an olympic figure skater?"
28295,Homer,are you crazy? i'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
28296,Homer,i'unno. how 'bout a horse whisperer?
28298,Homer,one thousand dollars. do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
28304,Homer,what?
28324,Homer,"you mean ""macbeth""?"
28325,Homer,"what? by saying ""macbeth""?"
28333,Homer,"okay, let's see. oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
28347,Homer,"dear god of england: please let me go. in return i will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and i'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, i can't do it. it's so stupid!"
28351,Homer,"boy, it's a good thing i'm leaving before i went nuts. goodbye sparkly elves."
28357,Homer,"see ya in atlanta, jerk!"
28358,Homer,"lady, you're gorgeous. you make dame edna look like a dude!"
28370,Homer,"yeah, it's impressive. but i still haven't found the perfect gift for marge. only imperfect stuff for me."
28371,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't fatty and smell-ma."
28377,Homer,"that's it, kids. suckle daddy's sugar ball."
28394,Homer,"oh god, they're in our food! teddy grahams, gummi bears..."
28395,Homer,are you a care bear?
28396,Homer,why does a bear need a crowbar?
28399,Homer,"you cowardly swede! you face that bear like a man, or i'll never speak to you again."
28403,Homer,"check it out, ladies. the suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
28407,Homer,"lisa, the point of moby dick is ""be yourself."""
28410,Homer,"gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
28411,Homer,"no way. if something happens to me, you have to carry on the simpson name."
28412,Homer,"that is so cool. all right, you can come."
28413,Homer,i never realized how hot this suit is. i'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
28416,Homer,"i guess this is it. if i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die a man."
28419,Homer,"hey, you're not mean. it was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. we're not so different. give me a hug."
28420,Homer,jeez! i don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.
28429,Homer,"all right, all right i'm still thinking!"
28431,Homer,"it's so easy to condemn, so hard to create."
28432,Homer,what can i say? i love nature...
28435,Homer,time to whiz in a foaming bowl of china...
28440,Homer,"oh god, it's baby blood!"
28441,Homer,bart! you're not hitting hard enough!
28443,Homer,"you just lost a box, pal!"
28455,Homer,"why so formal, lenny? you're my go-to guy."
28457,Homer,"please welcome new panelist, barney gumbel."
28460,Homer,"so did i, son. and look where i am today."
28461,Homer,"boy, everybody loves my show."
28467,Homer,"well, that's all over now. from now on, we will focus solely on important issues."
28468,Homer,"every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. yet, the imf insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules."
28477,Homer,i love the holiday season.
28479,Homer,oh my god! a dvd player.
28489,Homer,i need money for christmas... can i get anything for this joe dimaggio baseball card? it's kinda old.
28499,Homer,"uh, sure, you know it. the biggest tree from the finest lot in town!"
28503,Homer,"oh, it just needs a little love."
28510,Homer,that's not true. i cared what you thought once you found out.
28514,Homer,"mr. mcgrew! i love that blind, senile old man."
28519,Homer,unloved by al? noooooooo!
28523,Homer,i just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. it was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at christmas. and get this: he learns a lesson!
28525,Homer,"yes, but this time i'm sober. ish."
28528,Homer,you're welcome!
28530,Homer,"and i filed down all the sharp corners. see, your eye is completely safe."
28536,Homer,"being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner."
28537,Homer,and here's another act of christian charity i pulled out of my butt.
28538,Homer,i built a skating rink for the whole town!
28545,Homer,"i've got it... when everyone's asleep, i'll take away their presents. then they'll be happy! thanks, buddha."
28548,Homer,"they don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
28553,Homer,"look, maggie! funny daddy!"
28554,Homer,too hard.
28557,Homer,nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.
28562,Homer,"wrong, lady! oh wait, the baby."
28565,Homer,"honey, no one messes with my mrs. i'll come down on those guys like the garage door on bart's bike."
28567,Homer,"here comes my commercial. in six, five, four..."
28569,Homer,"but newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. who really opposes ""families come first?"""
28580,Homer,"bart, that creepy kid's here!"
28586,Homer,"son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?"
28596,Homer,"first of all, thank you. secondly..."
28598,Homer,"robot, i command you: do something cool!"
28604,Homer,like a dog. or a snowman!
28610,Homer,"i like you, son."
28612,Homer,"well, i've been busy, son. they really need me over at the nuclear plank."
28619,Homer,i just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
28622,Homer,"you think you've got problems, look what i just pulled out of my arm!"
28625,Homer,can you do my back?
28629,Homer,and i'm the luckiest--
28645,Homer,that's it! i'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!
28647,Homer,"...you probably want to talk this over, so i'll leave you two ""alone."" excuse me."
28655,Homer,"kids, kids. those aren't your toys. they're to keep daddy asleep and awake."
28659,Homer,"fine, fine. i'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment."
28663,Homer,why don't you admit i know it's around here somewhere?
28665,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah. i need some dinner, stat! and the kids need some cpr lessons."
28667,Homer,"oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. i'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
28672,Homer,no problem.
28673,Homer,two hundred and eighty-six pages!
28678,Homer,"oh, yes."
28686,Homer,"well, then maybe i will."
28690,Homer,how can you write such horrible things about me?
28694,Homer,"well, i'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
28700,Homer,would you help me be a better husband?
28704,Homer,"that's right. i love you marge, and i realize now i should show you more often. the end of your book was the wakeup call i needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
28712,Homer,a lot of that went in my lungs.
28713,Homer,"that's great. i'm honored to drink to apu and, uh... apulina."
28717,Homer,home sweet home. now to watch some tv.
28718,Homer,five bucks? i don't need your sharity! i'll dance for my money!
28729,Homer,nope.
28731,Homer,"i heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor."
28733,Homer,mr. bo-jangles / mr. bo-jangles / we're all bo-jangles / who killed bo-jangles? / maybe it was you...
28737,Homer,i don't understand.
28738,Homer,"hoo boy, are you in trouble."
28755,Homer,are you saying my daughter can't cut it? just because i owe you fourteen thousand dollars? i'll show you!
28758,Homer,"i'm sorry we wasted your time, your lordship."
28759,Homer,"oh, maggie will do just fine. she'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
28762,Homer,woo-hoo! i got that one right too!
28770,Homer,i'll be right back.
28775,Homer,"i know, we'll use reverse psychology. maggie, don't press the red button!"
28776,Homer,damn it!
28780,Homer,"well, i think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. namely, food."
28781,Homer,how'd you get in here?
28788,Homer,what would jesus view?
28795,Homer,"oh honey, don't be scared. look, they killed the evil doll."
28797,Homer,"honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?"
28802,Homer,okay. you have the right to remain sexy. anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. if you cannot afford a sex-torney--
28806,Homer,but i did delete him from my bulk email list.
28811,Homer,"guys, i'd like you to meet artie ziff."
28824,Homer,"i miss you guys so much. the smell of marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when i go boom... this place has become like a prison to me!"
28835,Homer,that was you!?
28841,Homer,"well yeah, legally. but if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?"
28859,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing."
28862,Homer,nurse it! nurse it!
28864,Homer,i'm in no condition to drive. wait -- i shouldn't listen to myself. i'm drunk.
28865,Homer,"okay, okay. remember the rules for drinking and driving. drive slow but not too slow. drink some cola to keep yourself alert."
28867,Homer,"nice work, cruise control."
28875,Homer,"listen, moe. i did something really terrible to someone i love."
28876,Homer,"well, what i did was..."
28877,Homer,can i have some peanuts?
28880,Homer,"lisa, lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. macarthur park is melting in the dark / all that sweet green icing rolling down / someone left my cake out in the li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li- li... li... li... li..."
28885,Homer,dammit!
28887,Homer,"i have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. i put you behind the wheel and i'm so, so, so sorry."
28895,Homer,"hey, anything's possible. with a little help from my bible."
28898,Homer,woo hoo!
28908,Homer,put that sissy down!
28914,Homer,love you.
28919,Homer,"son, i want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive."
28922,Homer,she sure loves that couch.
28923,Homer,"come on, it's your last night of freedom. you gotta have some fun."
28924,Homer,"hey, take it easy on skinner. he's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
28929,Homer,"yeah marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. oh uh, by the way... can i borrow your car tomorrow? mine's acting up."
28932,Homer,"right, naked duffman?"
28941,Homer,"really? boy, it sucks to be you. anyhoo, if there's one thing i know, it's how to win back a furious woman. we'll go to her house, and i'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
28948,Homer,uh-oh.
28950,Homer,"string quartet, are you tuned up?"
28955,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get something to eat."
28956,Homer,i don't see skinner anywhere.
28958,Homer,"okay marge, i hear ya. now that krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems."
28962,Homer,"marge, you just agreed to raise the kids klingon!"
28965,Homer,i say you don't exist!
28968,Homer,exactly.
28969,Homer,where do i begin? to tell the story of how great a love can be...
28978,Homer,remember our honeymoon?
28979,Homer,"marge, let's do it."
28985,Homer,"boy, it's great being here without those children of yours."
28987,Homer,you keep thinking that!
28993,Homer,occupied!
29004,Homer,this must be what it's like to be in space.
29015,Homer,i'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! the only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
29019,Homer,judge a pig competition?... but i'm no super-genius! or are i?
29022,Homer,comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
29025,Homer,hold it right there!
29032,Homer,"somebody ought to take him down a peg. or, should i say, down a pie."
29044,Homer,"watch it, one more step. welcome to my secret lair."
29055,Homer,i've run out of pie-related puns!
29057,Homer,i already work for you.
29060,Homer,nooo! not community service -- i can't stand helping others! i just can't!
29061,Homer,"no, not him! anyone but him! i've had my problems with him. everyone has. but like every monster, he just wants to be loved."
29066,Homer,you know i'm not pie man.
29067,Homer,"oh come on, she's a little girl."
29069,Homer,the dalai lama!
29070,Homer,i can't do this in front of lisa. why does she have to believe in things?
29078,Homer,"eww! i kissed that sad, weird kid!"
29088,Homer,whee! recess!
29109,Homer,what about now?
29110,Homer,what about now?
29115,Homer,i sure did. i kept it right next to my ibm stock... king.
29116,Homer,because somehow you realized i was a good guy after all?
29124,Homer,"bart, pass the corn. bart, pass the corn!"
29125,Homer,everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
29128,Homer,uh-oh.
29133,Homer,y'ello. appear on your tv show?! tell our side of the story?! you'll see us there?! goodbye?! dial tone?!
29135,Homer,"son, i've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. don't rock the boat. don't even get in the boat."
29144,Homer,who are you?
29145,Homer,i don't want to be in any stupid talent show. not without my tennessee walking horses.
29151,Homer,"because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. and this time i want it tight!"
29162,Homer,"now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. i'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop."
29170,Homer,"okay, three bucks."
29178,Homer,everyone okay?
29181,Homer,that was totally worth it.
29184,Homer,"well, if that's your custom."
29195,Homer,trying to get a frisbee off the roof.
29196,Homer,"oh, there's the frisbee."
29201,Homer,"so, what'd i die of? too much happiness? naked girl avalanche?"
29209,Homer,"fine, i'll never go back. starting tomorrow. today is lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
29218,Homer,"hold on, maggie! daddy's coming!"
29221,Homer,captain!
29235,Homer,i've got you deep in the heart of me...
29248,Homer,all right.
29256,Homer,what man would want you now?
29267,Homer,"i'm proud of you, honey."
29272,Homer,but win the contest?
29284,Homer,good. that'll save us some time. okay... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed?
29285,Homer,exactly. and we're poor because we have kids. and the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
29295,Homer,"nice try, loser. i bet you made up a fake test."
29307,Homer,"but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
29309,Homer,"open-ended! c'mon, lisa. say everything's fine. everything's fine."
29310,Homer,prove it.
29325,Homer,"oh come on, marge. the only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
29337,Homer,"all right. but while i'm gone, boy, you think about what you did."
29340,Homer,and i'm growing ashamed of my penis.
29342,Homer,"okay, you go save lisa. i'll stay here with the women."
29343,Homer,what do women want?!
29351,Homer,"bart's shirt is a classic, marge. just like ""keep on truckin'"". as if i would ever want to stop truckin'."
29352,Homer,"i've been reading this magazine for years, but i never dreamed my son would be on the cover."
29357,Homer,"bart, can i ask you an important question?"
29361,Homer,it's awesome. you know what i've gotten into? sleeping 'til noon.
29368,Homer,the couch is like that tree!
29374,Homer,"oh, you'll win for sure. you and science go together like lenny and carl. the science is carl."
29380,Homer,"are you a terrorist? no. ""would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" no. i will never tire of the bar scene!"
29381,Homer,"let's see, i can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano..."
29387,Homer,i never complain about your frilly pillows.
29395,Homer,damn him to hell.
29398,Homer,"yo, yo, yo! keep it on the low flow!"
29401,Homer,"oh, i doubt it. but we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out."
29402,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
29403,Homer,re-straint! re-straint! re-straint!
29409,Homer,that's him to a t!
29412,Homer,"c'mon, marge. this place is great. free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future."
29419,Homer,dad?
29424,Homer,marge? bart? lisa?
29431,Homer,no cameras?
29432,Homer,"listen you two, i'll tell you who the true god is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!"
29442,Homer,don't dump me out! i can lose weight! just give me a chance.
29454,Homer,"i've never been so embarrassed. and the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! i'll see you all at lupper!"
29455,Homer,"why did i ever have kids? i could have written symphonies, or been shakespeare."
29460,Homer,put up my house? but i just paid it off... what would marge say?
29465,Homer,"look, look. i can see you're upset. if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
29467,Homer,that's because i hate her.
29473,Homer,"whew, that's a relief!"
29483,Homer,can i learn it at a happy place?
29484,Homer,what do i do?
29495,Homer,marge!
29501,Homer,"marge, i just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on moe, here's my card."
29515,Homer,sure do.
29520,Homer,woo hoo! but why?
29526,Homer,"ooh, i forgot crotch grabbing. that'll be the sun."
29529,Homer,y'ello.
29532,Homer,"all right, all right, i'll work it out."
29534,Homer,today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
29535,Homer,"first, i want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
29538,Homer,i'm the worst thing to happen to sports since fox.
29544,Homer,dammit!
29564,Homer,go seminoles! cover-the-point-spread! cover-the-point-spread!
29573,Homer,"i love you too, jerry."
29578,Homer,bart's gone! i checked everywhere!
29585,Homer,oh yeah? send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
29589,Homer,"hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which i've already lost, for the rights to bart's story. so i have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
29596,Homer,love the lie!
29600,Homer,"eh, who needs tourists? they never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
29604,Homer,now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
29619,Homer,"oh kent, not anything. it has to exist. or does it?"
29623,Homer,i wasn't joking.
29629,Homer,correction. the first blimp that got her pregnant.
29632,Homer,"yeah, ""bride of the monster."""
29633,Homer,got him! uh-oh.
29635,Homer,and please let thy holy spirit open the heart of my wife. amen.
29636,Homer,you handsome devil. someday they'll let you and me get married! can you imagine the children?
29639,Homer,"if anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
29646,Homer,"welcome to sprawl*mart... pimple cream in aisle five! buenos nachos -- ask about our se√±or discount. hey, rabbi, jesus loves ya. just kidding."
29647,Homer,that coot happens to be my father. please continue.
29650,Homer,"aw, dammit! chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?"
29652,Homer,"this twenty-foot pole will make bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. and i used my sprawl*mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. it'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
29665,Homer,"now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
29667,Homer,i'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
29673,Homer,i know. that was for the other patients.
29674,Homer,my thingies!
29678,Homer,"and how 'bout me getting off work by saying i'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. yes, there are many kinds of heroes."
29680,Homer,i'll give you one.
29681,Homer,hey dragon! you fly like a girl!
29683,Homer,nooooooo!!
29688,Homer,"and this is marge, our surprisingly hot nanny."
29690,Homer,"i've heard of these guys. you can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
29694,Homer,i finally get this play!
29696,Homer,i'm a chinese acrobat!
29700,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.--
29709,Homer,who told you that?
29717,Homer,"wait, you're not bart! eh, close enough."
29718,Homer,hmmm. seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. i'll keep one.
29720,Homer,stupid spider... afraid of dying.
29721,Homer,aha! huh?
29726,Homer,"don't worry. if i croak, you'll marry lenny. or moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game i invented. i got all the rules written down... up here."
29727,Homer,"sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. but i'm not gonna die for many, many years."
29728,Homer,haven't we all?
29742,Homer,"marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
29747,Homer,you banged?
29750,Homer,"kids, your mother and i have decided to take a little break from each other. while we deal with our issues, i plan to go on ""motorhome makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. all i need is for someone to start a show called ""motorhome makeover."""
29754,Homer,we'll have christmas tomorrow!
29755,Homer,woo hoo! free gas!
29759,Homer,it's a deal! woo hoo!
29761,Homer,these are my new friends. they like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
29765,Homer,name one way i'm not!
29768,Homer,that was my woodstock!
29771,Homer,"if you need me, i'll be in my trailer!"
29790,Homer,make it seven!
29797,Homer,"squealin'? no, i just wanted to help him."
29799,Homer,"mr. burns, i've thought about it, and i don't wanna be a snitch. it's not an honorable life."
29800,Homer,"well, i am a sucker for a little hat."
29815,Homer,"marge, they're gonna kill me! i only did what i had to do to survive... in a style befitting a french monarch."
29819,Homer,we'll be safe in the gas chamber.
29822,Homer,the guards are sadistic and cruel!
29828,Homer,what'd i miss? what'd i miss?
29830,Homer,why? is it messing you up?
29832,Homer,"oh, marge..."
29836,Homer,hey! come back with my patio furniture!
29837,Homer,"stupid flounders. hey, i've got a great idea. we'll find some new lady friends."
29839,Homer,there's a dvd player but it doesn't work.
29841,Homer,"you wish, loser!"
29843,Homer,"boy, i think i see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. e-z."
29844,Homer,"son, say hello to edna."
29851,Homer,you don't know the half of it.
29854,Homer,around the loop of death...and out the mail slot! then it's the yard's problem.
29855,Homer,"aw, that's it. i'm going to moe's!"
29856,Homer,it's raining outside.
29864,Homer,"hey, watch what you say about him. i think ray could be the one."
29865,Homer,"well, i can see i'm not wanted here."
29872,Homer,"wow, it's been so long since i've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig i am."
29877,Homer,to my new buddy. now all we need is an awesome theme song. whatever plays next on the jukebox.
29879,Homer,i think that means six more weeks of autumn.
29888,Homer,"some day that bowl will overflow, and i'll be there."
29891,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
29894,Homer,don't worry -- ray'll be back any minute.
29898,Homer,"you know son, my dad used to take me down to johnson's hardware. old man johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. when they built this place, he hung himself."
29904,Homer,something like that.
29907,Homer,now. now. nnnow.
29913,Homer,what's going on? where are my shoes?
29914,Homer,what am i doing here? let me go!
29919,Homer,there has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like flanders and bart... wait! the bartender at knockers.
29922,Homer,"aw, what did he die of?"
29925,Homer,"nope, just you, marge and yogi bear. kidding!"
29935,Homer,"so, ray does exist?!"
29940,Homer,what time's the show on?
29945,Homer,"and if i wanna see it, what time should i watch it?"
29956,Homer,on the radio.
29961,Homer,"aw, my little boy's in love."
29965,Homer,"you get better, son. meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""
29967,Homer,"lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. c'mon, everybody get in here. hurry."
29985,Homer,but who else needs to lose weight? maggie? grampa? my seldom-seen half brother herb?
29986,Homer,why is everyone looking at me?
29987,Homer,"i am not too fat. i'm alive, aren't i?"
29989,Homer,where will i sleep?
29991,Homer,i don't wanna.
29996,Homer,i need change for a dollar.
30006,Homer,"and she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. oh, thank you for this angel, lord!"
30011,Homer,"of course, sweetie. you and i are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken hellhole."
30016,Homer,let daddy go talk to the man.
30019,Homer,"don't worry honey, the song i wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""moon river"" sound like a farting orangutan."
30022,Homer,you think i can't kill you? there's a hundred little punks graduating from syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! get outta here!
30023,Homer,"hey, these are red vines. here you go, sweetie. daddy got you your candy."
30030,Homer,it's called smoozing!
30031,Homer,"hey, come back! i'm calming down! we'll have family fun! family funnnnn!"
30032,Homer,"hey, everybody...i brought a guest."
30036,Homer,i'm not mr. simpson. that ship has sailed. i'm colonel cool! and i'm the captain on this rocket to the stars.
30044,Homer,flanders?
30046,Homer,lisa.
30065,Homer,blood is raining from the sky!
30074,Homer,up bup bup!
30075,Homer,"three fifteen p.m., may 18th! that's when the rapture will be!"
30076,Homer,a week? that's...seven days from now!
30079,Homer,"here's my angle: there's no way in god's heaven i should get into god's heaven. but maybe he'll let me in, if i warn others the apocalypse is coming, as i previously shouted."
30082,Homer,"marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
30088,Homer,"but sweetheart, i have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this."
30092,Homer,"goodbye, stupid earth!"
30097,Homer,"lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?"
30103,Homer,"...ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! twelve apostles... but jesus was at the last supper too! this changes everything."
30116,Homer,thanks. listen... could you do me one more favor?
30121,Homer,"lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. really top notch. but i can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
30127,Homer,"just send me back to earth, and put off this whole rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so."
30137,Homer,"prison overcrowding, i've got a solution for that. oh my god! u-s-a! u-s-a!"
30156,Homer,"sensual, isn't it? and the best part is stupid flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. hence my nickname, stupid flanders."
30160,Homer,"uh, we're watching the latest photos from mars. ho, great stuff. worth every billion."
30168,Homer,oh yeah.
30173,Homer,"um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, i want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all..."
30175,Homer,"hey coach, do you mind turning down the music? my baby's trying to take a nap."
30180,Homer,when are you gonna stop poking me? will it be soon?
30189,Homer,i saw my advantage and i took it. that's what heroes do.
30190,Homer,"okay, ned. get ready for your welcome home surprise."
30191,Homer,maybe. we don't know that for sure.
30192,Homer,go nuts.
30194,Homer,"boy, i can't believe you got expelled. well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!"
30201,Homer,classic grampa.
30205,Homer,mickey mouse's dog?
30207,Homer,you've transformed breakfast into dinner. it's a miracle!
30214,Homer,"uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
30219,Homer,"woo hoo! i'm clean! in your face, lord!"
30223,Homer,"marge, no one is saying twelve. nine, ten, tops. see..."
30244,Homer,"it's not my fault the raiders lost, it's professor pigskin's!"
30250,Homer,"it got your hopes up, didn't it?"
30252,Homer,because you look even more beautiful now than the day i married you.
30254,Homer,"look, if you promise never to tell her, i'll let you be in the movie."
30259,Homer,where are you going?
30264,Homer,"well, we'd better go eat that yogurt."
30273,Homer,"well, what if marge tries to call while i'm talking to you?"
30293,Homer,"it wasn't all bad. as part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
30312,Homer,rubes.
30323,Homer,stamps? those are for snail mail! stamps rule! i mean suck!
30326,Homer,two four six eight! i hate stamps! they aren't great!
30335,Homer,i can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
30337,Homer,i thought it was twenty.
30342,Homer,"oh, and that dr. hibbert was so boring... ""homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... homer, we must discuss your test results... homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
30344,Homer,"you see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
30345,Homer,"oh, and i spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
30350,Homer,"boy, lisa's room really is scary."
30352,Homer,you know that racecar bed i made him?
30358,Homer,"now marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
30359,Homer,"run, marge! start the car!"
30363,Homer,"although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
30365,Homer,"lisa, honey, please wake up. if you do, i'll get you a new pony."
30375,Homer,"i dunno, maybe. plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
30381,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... maggie!"
30385,Homer,i have to do this for work.
30393,Homer,"i just got fired. better check the ""want ads."""
30398,Homer,"that's ridiculous! no woman would want to have sex with that loser! and, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. good stuff."
30404,Homer,i'm still not hearing no.
30408,Homer,"resident... occupant... i can't open these. ooh, a traffic ticket!"
30409,Homer,i'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
30414,Homer,"bart! we're all disappointed there's no potato salad! but for god's sake, don't jump!"
30422,Homer,"wow. a robot kid would be a blast. we can confuse him and make his head explode. ""this statement is a lie. but if it's a lie then it must be true. but if it's true, then it must be..."" kaboom!"
30425,Homer,"wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!"
30426,Homer,and he's great with the neighbors.
30430,Homer,"here, make me a kitty!"
30431,Homer,"lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. in the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the american dream."
30437,Homer,you wanted to believe the lie!
30441,Homer,suckers.
30444,Homer,yes i am! i mean...
30445,Homer,oh no! i've been killed!
30446,Homer,outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. hee-hee.
30451,Homer,marge isn't home.
30462,Homer,"three hundred and six, three hundred and seven..."
30466,Homer,just liftin' this dumbbell.
30480,Homer,"moe, i'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing i barely liked in the first place."
30484,Homer,"marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world."
30492,Homer,"oh, can i come with you? i know i can't."
30497,Homer,what the hell is this?
30500,Homer,"aw, isn't that cute?"
30504,Homer,"yeah, but i know how to win women back. i even won you back after i lost our wedding album in a bar bet."
30506,Homer,"i'm sorry i made you feel bad, honey. but i'm gonna show you just how much i care about your feelings. one adult and one baby, please."
30509,Homer,does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
30510,Homer,"oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. it's a little harder to shut up."
30511,Homer,"oh, i know! but how can i undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
30518,Homer,salamander awayyy!
30523,Homer,"look, lisa. i made safety happen!"
30525,Homer,son-of-a... questions? comments?
30533,Homer,this looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
30536,Homer,that's more like it!
30551,Homer,"hey, people may not love homer simpson, but they love this suit. just like they love their stupid american flag."
30552,Homer,it's the smell of impending victory.
30555,Homer,but aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
30558,Homer,what the? it must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
30568,Homer,silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
30578,Homer,hmmm. i bet she'd be a good friend for marge. she looks defeated too!
30582,Homer,"marge, i did it! i found a woman to be your new friend! she's waiting in the living room!"
30593,Homer,"oh, well... i try to have a good time."
30617,Homer,let me check the navigation system...
30634,Homer,i thought i was doing donald trump.
30644,Homer,opera? they have that here too?
30650,Homer,"hey, knock it off."
30660,Homer,my god... it's over... we're free!
30661,Homer,i said we're free!
30678,Homer,"uh yes, i'm a reporter with the local paper. i'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. do you mind if i ask you some questions?"
30687,Homer,uh... well i... i think you're my pappy!
30706,Homer,dad...
30707,Homer,wait. can we have a moment in private?
30709,Homer,but how?
30711,Homer,"aw, dad."
30713,Homer,send up two hams!
30721,Homer,"boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
30722,Homer,i don't tell your mother how much i've lost.
30728,Homer,it's no use.
30734,Homer,"look at me, i use a napkin."
30735,Homer,"i bet they're from massachusetts. you know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
30736,Homer,"don't forget to wash your hands, shakespeare."
30739,Homer,fine. but the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
30744,Homer,i'm stuck!
30750,Homer,shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
30753,Homer,i'm gonna double kill you! and then i'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. then i'll dig you up and kill you again! that's the beauty of a shallow grave.
30757,Homer,"hey, i enjoy you plenty."
30759,Homer,"thank you, colonel."
30761,Homer,i miss bart! i can't leave him in that awful camp!
30762,Homer,"i'm comin', boy!"
30764,Homer,"woo hoo! vegas here i come! oh right, bart."
30770,Homer,try this one...
30776,Homer,"oh, wouldn't it be adequate?"
30778,Homer,"through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, i haven't even thought of it yet."
30784,Homer,fine.
30789,Homer,i'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
30802,Homer,i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!
30804,Homer,moe has a cappuccino machine??!!
30807,Homer,you didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.
30812,Homer,i figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. money which we could use to pay for bart's operation.
30816,Homer,"don't worry, marge. me and ""terrible two"" here are gonna win that computer for you."
30818,Homer,"now to begin ""operation: slight edge""."
30820,Homer,"he's headed for the old mill. no, cheatie, no!"
30825,Homer,a living duck! i wished too hard and he became real!
30830,Homer,"so marge, in tomorrow's game i'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
30836,Homer,"old showbiz animals, eh? do you think any of the gremlins from the ""gremlins"" movie are there?"
30839,Homer,my son's been ape-napped!
30840,Homer,aren't you gonna do something?
30856,Homer,i mean the one at the house.
30864,Homer,"ooo, ""two and a half men!"" you can see the soulless emptiness in charlie sheen's eyes."
30866,Homer,"oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."
30867,Homer,"wow, i can actually feel the heat."
30868,Homer,can you at least take a picture of me with the tv?
30871,Homer,oh marge! i love you! i love you! i love you!
30883,Homer,i'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
30892,Homer,"ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on fox. why'd you do it?"
30919,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
30928,Homer,"hey, marge it's what i've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury."
30930,Homer,"send someone right over! ooh, here he is."
30943,Homer,a cow took my ipod and i punched it!
30946,Homer,"okay, apu said his cousin kavi could help me out."
30950,Homer,finally.
30953,Homer,"uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... did i say ""um""?"
30955,Homer,just outsource it to lisa. outsourcing is the answer to everything.
30962,Homer,i won a free soda! i am a god!
30967,Homer,may firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
30969,Homer,"yeah, he's funny."
30973,Homer,"outta my way, you god-fearing buckleheads!"
30975,Homer,"please, you've gotta help me! if they find me they'll kill me."
30976,Homer,"oh lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me."
30981,Homer,she's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
30986,Homer,"but baby, a man has needs."
30997,Homer,"catch me, flanders!"
31003,Homer,"all right, i can see this is all up to me."
31004,Homer,"swim, fatty, swim!"
31008,Homer,"hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by tom stoppard. this isn't a book, it's a play! book."
31014,Homer,"pinball machines, the renaissance..."
31015,Homer,"oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
31026,Homer,"but sweetie, i just wanted to tell the '74 oakland a's how i felt about them."
31030,Homer,"on second thought, i am brenda wine cooler."
31034,Homer,"mark and tracy, i remember the first words i heard you say: ""i do."""
31037,Homer,she's opening her eyes!
31041,Homer,jogging?!
31049,Homer,why you little...
31051,Homer,why you little...
31054,Homer,"see that ball of fire? that's the sun. it goes by many names: apollo's lantern, day-moon, old blazey. the important thing is never to touch it."
31080,Homer,"i sure have, pardner."
31086,Homer,"you just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. in ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. and there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. and you blew her off."
31100,Homer,all right. just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
31101,Homer,woo-hoo! weapons!
31104,Homer,time to do what i do best -- ruin it for everybody.
31109,Homer,"wow, this 3-d is amazing! you can actually feel the vase!"
31111,Homer,good riddance. their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
31124,Homer,nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.
31141,Homer,buck mitchell!
31147,Homer,"buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own marge."
31148,Homer,"good idea, honey. buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?"
31158,Homer,don't tell the hamburger in my car.
31163,Homer,i used to be so embarrassed buying these.
31166,Homer,"yeah, they beat me up at work. look at the word they wrote on my skull."
31169,Homer,"oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. real fair. class act."
31179,Homer,"mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
31184,Homer,"everything. and i learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""shark tale""."
31186,Homer,ow! i hurt my fist and my palm. i thought you guys were lookin' out for me.
31199,Homer,"hey, if i poisoned them, would i be doing this?"
31202,Homer,spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! just give us the pills. clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
31206,Homer,"transport yourself to the shores of nova scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
31211,Homer,"oh! let me know when and if you want sex, honey!"
31214,Homer,i love you so much. damn you!
31216,Homer,"oh, son. i like you more, now that other people like you."
31219,Homer,beware of el taco belly!
31223,Homer,i guess.
31231,Homer,"this doesn't look easy, but i'll bet it is."
31234,Homer,"okay, now you do me."
31235,Homer,i did! i made a foot rest.
31238,Homer,"yep, it'll do that."
31239,Homer,simpsons manly-man handyman at your service.
31245,Homer,...annnd done.
31247,Homer,"uh... like all manly men, i have a vivid imagination."
31262,Homer,hmm... let me mull that over.
31264,Homer,i don't know anything about struts.
31267,Homer,"sweetie, you don't understand. if i can do this myself, then all those lies i told will be true. don't you want daddy's lies to be true?"
31270,Homer,and now i give you... the zoominator!
31275,Homer,uh-oh. oh. why must we preserve america's historic roller coasters?
31279,Homer,"marge, i realized something when i was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. i'm just glad i have you as my safety bar."
31282,Homer,"ooh, a space marshmallow!"
31293,Homer,"ooh, teenagers... no! today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them."
31294,Homer,i'll savor you!
31300,Homer,"you're right. starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner."
31305,Homer,it's amazing. he tastes just like jeffrey tambor.
31310,Homer,"hey boy, where's your mud buddy? i have a little job for him."
31313,Homer,writing's for nerds.
31317,Homer,"go ahead and hide, you coward!"
31319,Homer,that's alien talk!
31332,Homer,"aw, no, daddy's just teasing. of course you could. you could keep it under a hundred. yes, you could."
31333,Homer,no she couldn't.
31337,Homer,"man, you've got an awesome voice."
31339,Homer,"hm, sounded better in my head."
31346,Homer,i will!
31361,Homer,"stupid army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance."
31363,Homer,hmm... let's see what your hangover has to say!
31368,Homer,"c'mon, memory, wake up!"
31375,Homer,"oh, i was supposed to take moe fishing today! everybody hide!"
31376,Homer,says you.
31377,Homer,"whoa, marge, who'd you piss off?"
31378,Homer,"moe, you live in a hotel? you're just like ""eloise""!"
31380,Homer,"oooh, moe's a poet! he has a soul! flutter your wings! it's teatime in buttercup junction!"
31388,Homer,fine. i'll drive between sips.
31400,Homer,"no, not now."
31408,Homer,you're not ice cream... faker!
31410,Homer,ice cream man! ice cream man!
31413,Homer,nooooo!
31433,Homer,"marge, you're a genius. you should make sculptures of other people! like lenny, or carl, or the new james bond. will america accept a british james bond? i can't wait to find out!"
31436,Homer,let me just put on some romantic music.
31447,Homer,must jettison excess weight!
31461,Homer,"if you won't talk to me, i'll send in polaroids to show you how sad i am that i let you down."
31465,Homer,"marge, where are you? did you change your name? is it kelly? kelly!!!"
31473,Homer,"and, as always, have fun watching."
31474,Homer,goooo... lovemaking!
31479,Homer,yeah. how'd you afford this kick-ass party?
31484,Homer,"oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. broken, lonely grownups."
31497,Homer,"oh, greystash. greystash! oh, hello, lisa."
31500,Homer,greystash looked krubb right in the eye and said...
31503,Homer,now lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
31506,Homer,no man should outlive his fictional wizard! no man!
31510,Homer,"you're getting a cab, old man. in fact, i believe i see it now."
31514,Homer,why did you let that loser into our home?
31516,Homer,really? who's gonna make him?
31519,Homer,lower the boom!
31522,Homer,"oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors."
31527,Homer,"well, i guess i'll have to wait for marge to show some backbone and-- you again?!"
31529,Homer,"those legs go on forever. oh wait, they stop right there."
31531,Homer,"for your information, since i bought it i put on a ton of weight."
31532,Homer,their drunken singing is ruining st. patrick's day!
31536,Homer,"and to think, he and i once shared a shower."
31538,Homer,there's water under the seat!
31545,Homer,"oh marge, i'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate."
31547,Homer,"i didn't say ""stop."""
31557,Homer,"a green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:"
31565,Homer,terrible.
31570,Homer,"dear marge, how are you? i am fine. the waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. and the salt water is rising. what's next? pepper water? ha ha. love ya, homer simpson."
31579,Homer,what's the code word?
31581,Homer,do you think your mother will ever remarry?
31589,Homer,then they brought us home...
31597,Homer,may we? may we? mais oui!
31601,Homer,you moron! i'm already alive!
31606,Homer,revenge! okay.
31607,Homer,"oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane."
31609,Homer,where did you come from?
31618,Homer,"ooh, a penny!"
31619,Homer,this is my lucky day.
31620,Homer,"madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen."
31622,Homer,here it is: the harmless chair of relaxation!
31623,Homer,little do you know that the count of monte cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
31633,Homer,"is it ""the count of monte cristo?"" 'cause i love that story."
31642,Homer,or my wife!
31643,Homer,or my...
31647,Homer,i don't know. let's just lay here till we figure it out.
31653,Homer,floor it!
31660,Homer,"i need you to go the gas station. tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs."
31696,Homer,i just thought for once i could be the cool guy in your movie. but all i am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
31709,Homer,look at those dumb hillbillies! i bet they don't even know what... something is.
31712,Homer,"okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!"
31713,Homer,look out for the stairs!
31719,Homer,"i've got three bathrooms, don't i? next."
31725,Homer,"sure, but i think you're exaggerating the problem."
31730,Homer,a talking bear is eating my father!
31733,Homer,"oh, why did i borrow that roof from him?"
31743,Homer,"hola, i am esteban de la sexface. that means stephen of the sexface."
31744,Homer,oh baby.
31745,Homer,dos selmas? ay-yi-yi!
31746,Homer,i guess i always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
31747,Homer,"a thousand, eh?"
31748,Homer,nooooooo...
31750,Homer,"hey selma, want some rice?"
31760,Homer,uh-huh... uh-huh...
31762,Homer,or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
31768,Homer,i'm going with the cologne i wore on our first date.
31770,Homer,"oh, captain janeway! your mission ended too soon! too soon..."
31771,Homer,"here i am on the space shuttle, orbiting earth."
31776,Homer,krusty! how 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
31786,Homer,no problem. hey drederick!
31791,Homer,"boy, i never thought i'd have my own dark room."
31804,Homer,"he's trying to make me look like a bad father. maggie, take the wheel!"
31808,Homer,and then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
31810,Homer,and my own medicine!
31813,Homer,listen to 'em. they're on top of the world while i'm sittin' here pretending i have a stool.
31815,Homer,you guys are right -- i should get back in the game. but i threw away my camera.
31821,Homer,"ooh, papa john's."
31824,Homer,never!
31832,Homer,i'll be your ref!
31837,Homer,so... tired.
31845,Homer,well i'm throwing you both out of the game!
31854,Homer,"lisa, sweetie, i was just following the rules."
31865,Homer,i sure do.
31868,Homer,"i got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
31873,Homer,i guess i could just sit on a bed...
31886,Homer,a common problem. try this.
31888,Homer,"relax. i'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. and i've got the answer to your problems -- the snugulux, by matrimonium!"
31890,Homer,"the lovejoys?! if this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you i had had like a million doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!"
31892,Homer,"oh, i think i know what you're doing wrong. have you tried..."
31899,Homer,"it was made for elvis, but he found it tacky."
31903,Homer,sorry.
31910,Homer,"kiddy cork? ""thumbstitute?"" ""accuteat?"" ""bink 182?"""
31913,Homer,stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!
31916,Homer,"it's not working! you lousy, worthless piece of--"
31918,Homer,"that's ridiculous. if i had set up those dominoes, i'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
31920,Homer,mood swings?! mood swings. mood swings!
31925,Homer,"well son, your uncle homer is, like eighty percent of america, whacked-out on prescription drugs."
31944,Homer,any moment...
31955,Homer,and some stuff i wanted.
31959,Homer,look at me! i'm a fireman!
31968,Homer,"moe, i can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
31976,Homer,"split up?! marge, no! we can fix this marriage!"
31978,Homer,oh please take me back. the dating scene is a nightmare. i'm begging you!
31983,Homer,dammit!
31988,Homer,no. and never bring it up again.
31999,Homer,woo-hoo! business trip!
32000,Homer,"apu, i'm returning a yogurt i wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
32003,Homer,i'm still alive! you call that playing to win?!
32010,Homer,"hello, officer!"
32015,Homer,you butcher!
32019,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. time for the family portrait. let's bunch together now. here we go."
32021,Homer,perfecto. everybody smile. i'm going to set the automatic timer.
32022,Homer,almost ready! here we go.
32023,Homer,"okay, here we go."
32028,Homer,okay. hold still. this is the last picture on the role.
32030,Homer,nothing's gonna ruin this one. the timer's a tickin.
32032,Homer,this one's gonna be the simpsons at our finest.
32046,Homer,i'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
32049,Homer,uh... cone!
32062,Homer,"i'm sorry marge, but i won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."
32070,Homer,liberals!
32072,Homer,woo--
32080,Homer,me? but that's you!
32084,Homer,i do.
32085,Homer,my favorite is chicago deep dish.
32087,Homer,a p-p-p-p-p-private jet!
32091,Homer,"oh my god... lionel richie?! can you sing ""say you say me,"" but make it about beer?"
32095,Homer,"no! if i leave the plane, i'll be just like everyone else!"
32108,Homer,"oh, tell me more!"
32120,Homer,this i can do!
32131,Homer,"i'm gonna get there early, so i can get in good with the lunch truck guy."
32134,Homer,somebody's gotta do 'em.
32137,Homer,stop peppering me with questions!
32139,Homer,"so she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the johnson report!"
32145,Homer,"brands like ""miser's choice"" and ""day-old delights?"""
32146,Homer,"honey, there's something i have to tell you..."
32162,Homer,"and now, to taxi to the terminal."
32165,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
32172,Homer,i wanna say one.
32174,Homer,"don't worry, we'll just go home. your mother can cook."
32177,Homer,"everyone just act cool. if anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
32179,Homer,"mmmm, au jus! not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
32180,Homer,"oh, i can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"
32185,Homer,"my back! it hurts, and not in a good way!"
32199,Homer,ho danneggiato il mio piede!
32200,Homer,nei cieli bigi guardo fumar dai mille comignoli parigi.
32212,Homer,"keep reachin' for the stars, kid."
32214,Homer,but i need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. would you have me keep it fake?
32216,Homer,to the hottest girls in the room.
32220,Homer,"and may i say i'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
32222,Homer,"you guys go on, we're gonna walk home."
32226,Homer,"a lady motorcycle driver?! what is this, the twilight zone?"
32243,Homer,kick my heels up and
32253,Homer,"hey moe, got any milk?"
32272,Homer,i'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
32276,Homer,why? what happens if i point it this way?
32277,Homer,"ah, my first tow."
32278,Homer,"ah, my first tow."
32287,Homer,"guess what, boy. last night i towed your principal's car."
32290,Homer,who said that? i'll kill them with my power!
32291,Homer,oh my god... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
32292,Homer,"if my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two."
32296,Homer,you... let... go...
32298,Homer,i thought we were friends! i was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
32312,Homer,"and to pay you back, i'm returning your nose."
32318,Homer,think. think.
32329,Homer,gonna make it! gonna make it!
32333,Homer,"""make way for superman,"" said superman as he punched everyone at the coffee bean. chapter two..."""
32338,Homer,you have a new home now... with us.
32340,Homer,you don't owe him anything. moe was in the hospital for three weeks and i didn't visit him once.
32349,Homer,"out of my way, mystery skank!"
32352,Homer,now i'm .
32354,Homer,"hey, what's that?"
32362,Homer,i just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
32364,Homer,why do you think i'm kicking it?
32374,Homer,"oh marge, your tentacles feel so good. wait a minute... why am i getting words in edgewise?"
32381,Homer,homer -- bored!
32386,Homer,hold still! i'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
32388,Homer,"hm, i thought i was killed by that magic spaghetti!"
32397,Homer,uh...
32407,Homer,"hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of ocean spray? oh boy -- forget that. how about some... cap'n crunch? uh, seven seas italian dressing? no, no! uh, chicken of the sea tuna? billy ocean cd? the history of atlantic records?"
32408,Homer,"i want to, but i can't!"
32411,Homer,i gotta find out what color marge's eyes are.
32419,Homer,the girl i love's got beautiful hair / a blue bouffant from here to there
32420,Homer,snow white teeth and lips so red / she's the wilma to my fred
32423,Homer,"/ those eyes are gems beyond appraisal / stunning shade of purest... oh, what is it?! i was so close! let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! oh, it's hopeless! she'll never love me again."
32425,Homer,mmm... porkpie.
32431,Homer,i hear that.
32433,Homer,"hey, how ya doin'? i'm homer. my wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women."
32436,Homer,are you sure they're not talking about cars? because those are car words.
32440,Homer,a makeover!
32445,Homer,are you happy and full of life?
32448,Homer,"you guys gotta help me! if marge leaves i'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make."
32451,Homer,okay.
32455,Homer,and i know how i can knock myself out. i'll look at your bill.
32470,Homer,did someone order a super stud?
32474,Homer,noooo!
32484,Homer,hmm...
32490,Homer,"c'mon, lisa! the tv's been off for five whole minutes!"
32494,Homer,"good luck, with my finicky appetite."
32495,Homer,sold!
32497,Homer,more ribs for me!
32510,Homer,i don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
32522,Homer,eat hobo remains!
32523,Homer,"marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins."
32526,Homer,no more drinking.
32535,Homer,fine. google maps.
32542,Homer,marge had a black eye?! i could never do something like that! could i?
32544,Homer,the queen's private surgeonnn!
32550,Homer,"really? well, that's great, dad. how can i ever repay you?"
32564,Homer,"lisa, i'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. you wanna join me?"
32566,Homer,"well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old homer."
32567,Homer,i'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
32589,Homer,are you kidding? the mother of my children with the reason for my children! this is gonna be the greatest party ever!
32592,Homer,"so marge wasn't cheating on me, i never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. thank god i figured it out before i did anything stupid."
32594,Homer,oh my god! i'm not dead!
32597,Homer,marge put so much work into that party. the least i could do is be surprised. if only i could forget what happened today.
32598,Homer,"hmmm... the only problem is, i'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman. no doubt i'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. and that will make me want to jump off a--"
32602,Homer,oh yeah.
32603,Homer,who's an angry dog? who's an angry dog?
32605,Homer,oh no! he's talking to that mailroom guy.
32607,Homer,"now, back away from burns and i will let your dog live."
32619,Homer,"i think i'll miss you most of all, captain corndog's schnitzel palace. no tears, homer."
32621,Homer,a drive-up trashcan!
32623,Homer,cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
32625,Homer,now for a victory cigar.
32627,Homer,"i don't know about you, but i don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where i can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. i say we rebuild the fast-food district -- bigger and better than ever!"
32628,Homer,"c'mon, marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
32631,Homer,die hard two!
32633,Homer,he's got my vote.
32635,Homer,"oh my god, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!"
32637,Homer,"if you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!"
32647,Homer,"don't worry, kids. these wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
32651,Homer,"oh, it was a wonderful time. the iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling matt groening created ""futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a tv show called ""melrose place""..."
32655,Homer,a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.
32667,Homer,"and once we were back together, i was too happy ever to grunge again."
32675,Homer,"you'd think so, but..."
32676,Homer,they were the bonnie and clyde of their day. their names were... bonnie and clyde.
32679,Homer,loa...ner?
32680,Homer,wow. this is the kind of car you see in commercials! how much am i paying for this?
32685,Homer,none.
32696,Homer,uh-huh.
32699,Homer,"yeah, i can't believe all those years i used to drive that old piece of... what the?!"
32705,Homer,"sorry, maggie."
32712,Homer,"it's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
32716,Homer,what?! i'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
32719,Homer,work.
32723,Homer,well... i certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
32725,Homer,"mmm, lamb."
32727,Homer,"listen, baby. the other night was great, but it can never happen again. oh, who am i kidding? i have to see you right now!"
32732,Homer,"c'mon, boy. all the nerds are doin' it."
32736,Homer,"hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
32740,Homer,"son, while your mother and little mother are out, i'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
32741,Homer,i said secret.
32744,Homer,"thanks, son."
32746,Homer,"my hindu friend, this is a chance for your kwik-e-mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
32748,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait! you haven't seen our power point presentation. bart?"
32749,Homer,who could have done this?!
32750,Homer,this can only mean one thing.
32753,Homer,you stay right here.
32755,Homer,"enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits homer simpson... hey, they're not sleepy. they're just turning fuzzy..."
32759,Homer,when you cut 'em they multiply -- i can't fight that! now let's take care of those raccoons.
32763,Homer,gimme that!
32764,Homer,i can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
32765,Homer,i can't believe you were smoking. do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
53256,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. they were evidence in a murder trial!"
53259,Ned Flanders,i think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
53267,Ned Flanders,"sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
53269,Ned Flanders,phew.
53274,Ned Flanders,"a rude frenchman? well, i never!"
53279,Ned Flanders,yeah...
53281,Ned Flanders,"oooh, yes indeedy, homer. looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
53290,Ned Flanders,n-no... you see...
53309,Ned Flanders,"ah, yeah, i, i couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
53312,Ned Flanders,"hey, need any help, homer?"
53318,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank you, apu."
53321,Ned Flanders,you monster!
53327,Ned Flanders,"no, homer! i just need to talk."
53335,Ned Flanders,so that's why you maced me.
53337,Ned Flanders,ewwww.
53344,Ned Flanders,"okay, here goes nothin'."
53351,Ned Flanders,"eh, you boys can go with the simpsons. i'm not going to church today."
53364,Ned Flanders,"ah yeah, i never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. it was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
53365,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi bart. how much this time?"
53374,Ned Flanders,"homer, it's neddy. i baked you a little something to ease the pain."
53384,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just reimburse you right n-- wait a minute. this seems an awful lot like that movie, ""paper moon."""
53391,Ned Flanders,we're trapped!
53398,Ned Flanders,no. the church opposes them for some reason.
53400,Ned Flanders,"oooh, found a new short cut?"
53402,Ned Flanders,can't let this little doozy get out.
53408,Ned Flanders,ow! now what was that for?
53409,Ned Flanders,ow! ow!
53413,Ned Flanders,...and harry potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
53414,Ned Flanders,what the diddly-yo?!
53417,Ned Flanders,"i didn't have a ""crush"" on her."
53421,Ned Flanders,"uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, rachel. w-well what do you know? we both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
53435,Ned Flanders,"mm. well, goodnight, maude. i mean, maude. i mean, rachel. i mean, maude."
53438,Ned Flanders,"i sure appreciate you folks offering to go through maude's things. if it were up to me, i wouldn't throw anything away."
53441,Ned Flanders,oh my. the room looks so bare.
53445,Ned Flanders,"praiseland? rides, food, a tithing pond."
53446,Ned Flanders,you're right.
53448,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, that's a nice thought, toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
53451,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been closed for so long... and-and i thought i could turn it into a christian theme park."
53460,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, i'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
53469,Ned Flanders,i'm maude. god is super!
53473,Ned Flanders,"oh, maude, i turned your dream of a christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
53476,Ned Flanders,it's almost like she's alive again.
53478,Ned Flanders,"oh, there's no explaining god's will, roddy. that's like explaining how an airplane flies."
53481,Ned Flanders,"ah, ah, folks, i've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. you see..."
53487,Ned Flanders,i'm sure.
53505,Ned Flanders,"playing a prankeroo, eh?"
53507,Ned Flanders,"it's kind of you to offer, mr. burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
53521,Ned Flanders,hi-o-diddily-ysseus!
53523,Ned Flanders,well... i don't have one from you!
53531,Ned Flanders,i guess that could be arranged.
53532,Ned Flanders,...the grace of the lord jesus be with god's people. the end.
53548,Ned Flanders,nobody.
53555,Ned Flanders,no problem! discover okay?
53560,Ned Flanders,"oh, you'd win that bet. seems like i'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. or as i like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
53563,Ned Flanders,"well boys, good thing we brought the eye soap."
53567,Ned Flanders,"well, aren't you a super-duper recouper."
53569,Ned Flanders,you betcha. it's a nice break from the male sports i usually watch.
53571,Ned Flanders,"gosh, fifty thousand dollars? i'm donating this whole check to ""bibles for belgians."""
53574,Ned Flanders,the steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
53575,Ned Flanders,"well, whatever i've got i owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. plus a little prayer now and then."
53578,Ned Flanders,why do i always give in to him?
53579,Ned Flanders,it's his skull. it's hypnotic!
53591,Ned Flanders,"form of business? sole proprietorship. ""owner's marital status?"" happily married... to a dead woman."
53592,Ned Flanders,"mm hmm! open as a tomb on easter. now, what can i ding dong diddily do for ya?"
53594,Ned Flanders,do i! no i don't. but i can have 'em here by tuesday.
53595,Ned Flanders,"why, you are gorgeous."
53598,Ned Flanders,"well, it looks good... and it sounds pretty too."
53600,Ned Flanders,what the...? that's a pseu-diddily-eudonym.
53601,Ned Flanders,well i've got a date with a girl with no name / it sure feels good to be back in the game / at dessert maybe i can ask her her name / 'cause i can't pray for her without the right name...
53605,Ned Flanders,"no, it's sara sloane. i have a date with her tonight."
53608,Ned Flanders,"... rod says ""marco,"" and darn it if todd doesn't say ""polo"" right back! oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. you're probably bored silly."
53611,Ned Flanders,"yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between los angeles and new york. called america!"
53613,Ned Flanders,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. this movie's turning into sponge bob no-pants!"
53616,Ned Flanders,"well, that's uh, very interesting..."
53618,Ned Flanders,the paparazzi! i thought we fooled them with our cher-crow.
53622,Ned Flanders,"so anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. i guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. if you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
53629,Ned Flanders,"sara, i'm sorry, but i can't move to hollywood. heck, even dollywood's too far out for me. too many people appreciating it ironically."
53638,Ned Flanders,"sara, i love ya, but i get the feeling you're just... not a ned-head tonight. is something wrong?"
53654,Ned Flanders,why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
53663,Ned Flanders,"why thank you, homer. it's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
53667,Ned Flanders,"sin of pride, roddy."
53671,Ned Flanders,of course i am. they were bigger than jesus! but your boy went yoko and broke up my collection.
53672,Ned Flanders,oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. the only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. what these boys need is adult supervision.
53674,Ned Flanders,ahhhh...
53676,Ned Flanders,"oh well, you snooze you lose. but uh, can i have my photo albums back?"
53689,Ned Flanders,"why, i'll give you a jump, i'll rotate your tires, i'll even fold up that map for you. i know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
53695,Ned Flanders,stop!
53696,Ned Flanders,"friends, what homer did was wrong. but i've been thinking -- maybe i was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
53699,Ned Flanders,that is one bitchin' bike!
53706,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please make homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts i had about the girl on the raisin box."
53711,Ned Flanders,"now now, remember why we're here: to celebrate jasper's birthday."
53715,Ned Flanders,let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the visa.
53718,Ned Flanders,"come on, ned. just because you foresaw dr. hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. it was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
53729,Ned Flanders,quit whackin' my barrel!
53733,Ned Flanders,"homer, stay away from the nuclear plant."
53736,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
53738,Ned Flanders,press... destruct... button.
53742,Ned Flanders,"homer, fall backward!"
53743,Ned Flanders,"oh, you stupid son-of-a..."
53744,Ned Flanders,i just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
53748,Ned Flanders,"let's see... ""get bent."" well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. we'll take the whole box. get bent, everyone!"
53749,Ned Flanders,"i can't run, i'm wearing flip-flops!"
53756,Ned Flanders,"hello, neighborino to the north. i sure like the cut of your gibberish."
53758,Ned Flanders,anyone want some coffee for the ride back?
53763,Ned Flanders,one hundred dollars and fifty cents!
53765,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just call you friend. here's your tape... friend."
53774,Ned Flanders,"oh, i-i guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal european wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of miss ashley judd!"
53780,Ned Flanders,"well, we could use a new h.q. for the springfield philharmonic. they're playing gustav mahler in abject squalor."
53781,Ned Flanders,hey homer!
53783,Ned Flanders,i was wrong!
53785,Ned Flanders,"gee, i thought my vision was perfect. and here i was, worshiping false eyeballs."
53786,Ned Flanders,"uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
53788,Ned Flanders,"howdy, homer. you here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
53795,Ned Flanders,how could this have... oh.
53797,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't take money from a neighbor. although, business at the leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
53801,Ned Flanders,"well, i do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... now, do you have any pets?"
53804,Ned Flanders,"well, thank you."
53809,Ned Flanders,"well, mel, they're swell."
53811,Ned Flanders,get out!
53816,Ned Flanders,"well, toddy, you know how i said our friends are like the canaanites? today i realized they're more like the midianites."
53821,Ned Flanders,this town is sweeter than a cake made of pie. even the dogs curb themselves.
53841,Ned Flanders,"back off, you servants of the holy see!"
53858,Ned Flanders,aagh! paper cut!
53861,Ned Flanders,...and lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve / and cream and crimson and silver and rose / and azure and lemon and russet and grey...
53864,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, i don't i don't really want a computer. you know all those complete strangers googling each other. makes my flesh crawl."
53870,Ned Flanders,do you have one for a mailman?
53873,Ned Flanders,"hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
53874,Ned Flanders,hey homer! sneakin' kisses from the missus?
53876,Ned Flanders,"well, well. look at my dull-eyed angels."
53879,Ned Flanders,"well, i think it's about time you boys get to bed."
53888,Ned Flanders,"well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
53891,Ned Flanders,"roddy, get down! you're gonna fall!"
53893,Ned Flanders,evolution?!
53900,Ned Flanders,"oh, fine. take the cut."
53901,Ned Flanders,"tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
53907,Ned Flanders,there's no such thing as storks! it's all god!
53908,Ned Flanders,stop praying to that stork!
53912,Ned Flanders,as sure as i am that jesus hates hip hop!
53913,Ned Flanders,as a matter... homer...
53914,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm tryin' to..."
53915,Ned Flanders,"will you shut your yap, ya big monkey-faced gorilla!!!"
53928,Ned Flanders,"tonight's g-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! and while you enjoy this quiet riot, i'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
53933,Ned Flanders,why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
53936,Ned Flanders,"now bart, stay humble! your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head."
53953,Ned Flanders,perhaps i can be of some assistance.
53965,Ned Flanders,and the rest!
53968,Ned Flanders,and envy!
53970,Ned Flanders,"well then, my work is done."
53977,Ned Flanders,"they're outlaws?! i've been played like a pair of spoons! well, who am i to judge -- it's the depression, money's tight..."
53982,Ned Flanders,not me!
53990,Ned Flanders,"look homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our lord, who came back as bread. that's it."
54007,Ned Flanders,"homer, take the taser out of your pants."
54027,Ned Flanders,"you jumped bail, homer. i gotta bring you in."
54028,Ned Flanders,i figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at lisa's recital.
54038,Ned Flanders,"and in that mud, i'm plantin' the seed of friendship. name's ned flanders!"
54041,Ned Flanders,really? not married? and you were bicycling two abreast?
54044,Ned Flanders,since two this afternoon. welcome to our honeymoon!
54050,Ned Flanders,"oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
54055,Ned Flanders,don't you think i've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
54056,Ned Flanders,"red dog, this is mustache one. we have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
54058,Ned Flanders,"as the worm said to the plate of spaghetti, ""i... i..."
54078,Ned Flanders,it's not funny! that's how i swear!
54080,Ned Flanders,wha? who's that?
54089,Ned Flanders,"well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. but i love 'em. and, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. hope you don't mind."
54094,Ned Flanders,"well, yes."
54096,Ned Flanders,the parson?! he's coming here?
54102,Ned Flanders,one cran-bran for the flan-man.
54104,Ned Flanders,"well boys, daddy's back on the beam, thanks to christian prayer and doctor sheldon lowenstein!"
54105,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
54112,Ned Flanders,i never thought otherwise.
54119,Ned Flanders,"top of the mornin', homer."
54135,Ned Flanders,that man is beyond redemption!
54138,Ned Flanders,homer? homer?
54141,Ned Flanders,the old city. where b.c. turned into a.d.! let's go!
54152,Ned Flanders,"lord, i think i may have finally reached him..."
54163,Ned Flanders,banned for life?
54166,Ned Flanders,not. worth. saving.
54169,Ned Flanders,i did it! i reached him!
54172,Ned Flanders,you'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
54175,Ned Flanders,"homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
54179,Ned Flanders,i've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
54187,Ned Flanders,less radical... less radical!
54190,Ned Flanders,tushie!
54199,Ned Flanders,i'm standin' right here!
54200,Ned Flanders,but neighbor... why did you have to do this? i've tattled this town into a paradise!
54204,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, we've got some work to do."
54211,Ned Flanders,"yup, that's exactly... oh, you almost got me."
54215,Ned Flanders,"bart, call me walter matthau, 'cause i'm a bad-news bearer. i'm resigning as manager of your little league team."
54216,Ned Flanders,"in the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and i let it go without saying a word. i just don't like the monster i've become."
54227,Ned Flanders,"oh, isn't that a cute little choo-choo..."
54240,Ned Flanders,"and you're a former mrs. so, uh... where's your husband buried?"
54244,Ned Flanders,any chance i could see you again?
54247,Ned Flanders,oh yes they were! we deliberately chose a doctor stork so we could say it without lying.
54253,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?"
54255,Ned Flanders,actually... she sort of does.
54261,Ned Flanders,"homer, listen to me. for a long time now i've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with marge. then i remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
54262,Ned Flanders,someone to hold the other end of the sheet when i fold it up. someone to put in my prayers.
54269,Ned Flanders,oh i was just wondering how many boxes of staples i should order for the store. does ten sound like a lot to you? twenty? fifty? what does sound like a lot to you?
54271,Ned Flanders,"i can't do it! edna, call me delta airlines 'cause i can't handle your extra baggage."
54273,Ned Flanders,"you've been with a lot of men, but i forgive you!"
54288,Ned Flanders,really?
54294,Ned Flanders,"wake up, flanders! there is no hell, and there is no god. if there were, would he let me do this?"
54305,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, she went crazy. crazier than sleeping in on a sunday."
54320,Ned Flanders,i withdraw my... diddily...
54323,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i'm afraid this is the part of god's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
54325,Ned Flanders,but-but-but...
54327,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, i know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
54328,Ned Flanders,"you know, homer's givin' it the old bible college try. maybe i should have dialed down the doubting thomas."
54332,Ned Flanders,diddily... doodily...
54346,Ned Flanders,"well, sir... when we got married, i knew i'd find some spices in my chili. i guess they can go to springfield hellementary."
54356,Ned Flanders,"hey, the simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. what do you say, sweetie?"
54362,Ned Flanders,"yes, but jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. darnit, the bible said the devil would be attractive!"
54367,Ned Flanders,"gambling, eh? satan's most potent recruiting tool!"
54370,Ned Flanders,"edna, i'm not one for costumes, but i sure do like that feather in your hair."
54371,Ned Flanders,homer! homer! it's a miracle!
54372,Ned Flanders,"oh, i will! till i go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! but come outside and see the miracle!"
54373,Ned Flanders,"no, it's still where you buried it."
54378,Ned Flanders,"to be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief."
54383,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
54387,Ned Flanders,goes with the sugar!
54400,Ned Flanders,not praying to a character in a comic book.
54401,Ned Flanders,neither canonical nor comical.
54404,Ned Flanders,please don't use that word in bed.
54405,Ned Flanders,dare i take another sleep aid?
54406,Ned Flanders,better not take a full dose.
54411,Ned Flanders,nope... not that... not to my taste... flag that for later... finally!
54416,Ned Flanders,"i want you to punch me in the eye. if you do, then we're even, according to exodus, leviticus and matthew."
54419,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, homer. i'm insisting on a fisting."
54422,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to..."
54423,Ned Flanders,enough!
54433,Ned Flanders,"how long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
54437,Ned Flanders,church!
54440,Ned Flanders,"i don't understand that on any level, but yes."
54443,Ned Flanders,"reverend, we want you to come back."
54444,Ned Flanders,"reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
54446,Ned Flanders,none taken.
54448,Ned Flanders,neither! and i don't like it when other people rhyme!
54457,Ned Flanders,that sounds salty but you seem sweet. i'm gonna call you kettle corn!
54463,Ned Flanders,children... perhaps it's time that i explain the true meaning of christmas.
54465,Ned Flanders,"we may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of heaven, all thanks to homer simpson!"
54467,Ned Flanders,teen abstinence counseling! you get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their john han-bleeps.
54469,Ned Flanders,their skipping lessons are really payin' off!
54487,Ned Flanders,"right next to mount fu-gee, i'm glad to see ya!"
54495,Ned Flanders,"well that curled my lashes, but good for you."
54505,Ned Flanders,"oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
54510,Ned Flanders,yes indeedilly-doodily.
54512,Ned Flanders,"oooh, she's a beaut. hey, congratulations, simpson. i'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
54515,Ned Flanders,"well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there."
54517,Ned Flanders,"couldn't help overhearing, simpson. i've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
54521,Ned Flanders,"oh, your beer. uh, is draft okay? just put in the tap last week."
54522,Ned Flanders,"heh, heh. this is a tasty little lager that came all the way from holland."
54523,Ned Flanders,"my pleasure, study buddy."
54528,Ned Flanders,i feel terrible.
54529,Ned Flanders,sometimes i forget that we have things a little better than the simpsons. i drag him over here. he has a few beers. you can't blame him for erupting.
54536,Ned Flanders,dear neighbor...
54540,Ned Flanders,"say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?"
54541,Ned Flanders,"all right! this will be fun! oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
54542,Ned Flanders,"good shot, toddsky!"
54545,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpson."
54551,Ned Flanders,"no, i just --"
54552,Ned Flanders,"you know, simpson, you're starting to annoy me."
54567,Ned Flanders,"but... neither, i mean we're both... i mean, you have to do it too."
54575,Ned Flanders,"oh, are you sure? we got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
54578,Ned Flanders,that is the most dishonest thing i've ever heard.
52536,Ned Flanders,"sometimes maude, god bless her, she underlines passages in my bible because she can't find hers."
54587,Ned Flanders,"whoops, my heart rate's dropping. better skedaddley-do."
52543,Ned Flanders,"as of friday, i'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
52550,Ned Flanders,"you must have something you want to wish for, homer."
52554,Ned Flanders,"now, you put that money away. that was an accident."
52557,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, oh, i expect things to start picking up soon. i think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
52560,Ned Flanders,"come on, homer. tell him about the store. i'm dyin' out here."
52562,Ned Flanders,"hey, i'm flexible! you don't have to pay all at once. i'll be here all night if you change your mind."
52579,Ned Flanders,"no! you tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... i didn't listen. homer, you were a true friend."
52586,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely.
52589,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! this little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. now that i've saved the earth, maybe i oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
52591,Ned Flanders,hey ho simpson.
52592,Ned Flanders,"well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
52594,Ned Flanders,"all right, that's it, young man. no bible stories for you tonight."
52597,Ned Flanders,"no reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
52607,Ned Flanders,what?
52609,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, ya know, i owe you one, buddy. no sooner had i shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
52610,Ned Flanders,"ah, i tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
52615,Ned Flanders,"i think it's mom's turn, son."
52626,Ned Flanders,you're a dame and i'm a fella.
52627,Ned Flanders,all i want is one embrace.
52631,Ned Flanders,stella! stellla! can't you hear me yell-a? / you're puttin' me through hell-a / stella! stella!
52636,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
52640,Ned Flanders,"heck, you'd have done the same for me."
52646,Ned Flanders,"howdy-do, neighbor! good pipe weather. thought i'd fire up the briar."
52647,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely-do.
52655,Ned Flanders,i just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
52656,Ned Flanders,"sure, you can borrow it for a little while."
52678,Ned Flanders,"knock that off, you two. it's time for church!"
52679,Ned Flanders,what?! you give me one good reason.
52687,Ned Flanders,"well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
52688,Ned Flanders,hey!
52692,Ned Flanders,... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should.
52693,Ned Flanders,"maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
52695,Ned Flanders,toodledy-doo!
52705,Ned Flanders,hello? hello? hellodilly-odilly?
52714,Ned Flanders,"okay, kids, now i'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. but this should only be used in a life or death situation."
52715,Ned Flanders,"howdilly hey, camper bart. ready for today's meeting?"
52722,Ned Flanders,now what happened to that gosh darn map i brought?
52727,Ned Flanders,"paddle harder, homer. we gotta fight the current."
52734,Ned Flanders,"you know, homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
52742,Ned Flanders,you folks got robbed too? the burglar took my shroud of turin beach towels.
52758,Ned Flanders,"heydilly ho, window buddy. just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
52762,Ned Flanders,wait a second. you're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
52765,Ned Flanders,oh... well... that sounds super duper.
52774,Ned Flanders,i -- i think i hate homer simpson.
52778,Ned Flanders,we're not going anywhere.
52781,Ned Flanders,"i told you, officer. i'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
52787,Ned Flanders,just try and stop me.
52794,Ned Flanders,but i thought it might break the ice if we had a little q and a.
52799,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, were you drinking slice or yoo-hoo?"
52802,Ned Flanders,"well, cockily-doodily-doo, little buddies. let's thank the lord for another beautiful school day."
52804,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily.
52809,Ned Flanders,ohmygod! what have i done? i've killed her!
52819,Ned Flanders,"all right. it's true. i am a murderer. i over-watered maude's favorite ficus plant, i panicked, and then i buried the remains. i was hoping to replace it before you got home."
52824,Ned Flanders,"okay, everybody. let's see some big smiles."
52825,Ned Flanders,"just relax, let the hooks do their work."
52826,Ned Flanders,"now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. a nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
52827,Ned Flanders,you just be ready with that garbage bag.
52834,Ned Flanders,"well sir, sounds fair. toodle-oo, everybody. i'll, i'll scream when the comet gets here."
52837,Ned Flanders,okay.
52843,Ned Flanders,lucky i always keep a bible close to my heart.
52845,Ned Flanders,"now, maude, in our movie, you lay baby moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. okay? lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- action jackson!"
52851,Ned Flanders,"all right, i'd like to call this meeting of the pta to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? mrs. krabappel, why don't you begin?"
52858,Ned Flanders,oh.
52882,Ned Flanders,"well, children, it's saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play bombardment..."
52885,Ned Flanders,vulgate it is.
52888,Ned Flanders,well...
52892,Ned Flanders,"no, that ain't gonna do it."
52894,Ned Flanders,reverend... emergency... i... you... simpson kids... eedily... baptism... oodily... doodily-doodily...
52902,Ned Flanders,"rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh."
52904,Ned Flanders,"oh, gosh, homer, this is strictly a flanders affair. i've got family here from around the globe! here's jos√© flanders..."
52908,Ned Flanders,"help me! help me, lord!"
52915,Ned Flanders,into death.
52919,Ned Flanders,"well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at table glick. like this..."
52923,Ned Flanders,"now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
52925,Ned Flanders,"howdily-doodily there, president bush--or should i say president neighbor! i'm ned flanders, and this is maude, rod and todd."
52934,Ned Flanders,"better get the ol' snow shovel back from homer, huh?"
52936,Ned Flanders,why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? works for me when i get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
52938,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
52939,Ned Flanders,you ever operated a power boat?
52946,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. i was all set to go off on vacation, when i get called up for jury duty. oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
52957,Ned Flanders,"if it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! if it's tangy and brown, you're in cider town! now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
52960,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm as permissive as the next parent. i mean, just yesterday, i let todd buy some red hots with a cartoon devil on the box. but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
52967,Ned Flanders,"oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
52971,Ned Flanders,howdilly-dood...
52972,Ned Flanders,dang!
52978,Ned Flanders,"no, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
52980,Ned Flanders,it's all gone. everything... gone-diddily-on.
52990,Ned Flanders,"why me, lord? where have i gone wrong? i've always been nice to people. i don't drink or dance or swear. i've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. i've done everything the bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. what more could i do? i... i feel like i'm coming apart here. i want to yell out, but i... i... i just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. i... i...i..."
52992,Ned Flanders,it's a miracle!
52993,Ned Flanders,"it's wonderful. i... i... i don't know how i can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in springfield."
53000,Ned Flanders,"oh, okay ""dude."" i wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""man."" here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
53002,Ned Flanders,"what do we have here? the long, flabby arm of the law. the last case you got to the bottom of was a case of mallomars."
53004,Ned Flanders,"you ugly, hate-filled man."
53007,Ned Flanders,"ooh, kicking and screaming, please."
53011,Ned Flanders,"oh, sure. i was a good little boy."
53023,Ned Flanders,"oh, they hum like angels. you're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
53024,Ned Flanders,"no, that's not true. i... i... i don't like the service at the post office. y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. then, they've got those machines in the lobby. they're even faster. no help there. you might even say i hate the post office. that, and my parents. lousy beatniks! hey, that felt good!"
53028,Ned Flanders,"oh, i admit it! it's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! i just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
53036,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can honestly say that was the best episode of impy and chimpy i've ever seen."
53044,Ned Flanders,"well, if you're talking about root beer, i plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
53047,Ned Flanders,i think i swallowed a toothpick.
53051,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge, i... i appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... well, they... they're a lot worse."
53068,Ned Flanders,"oof! okay, nelson's our quarterback."
53071,Ned Flanders,"well, that's super-duper, lisa! in fact, we already have four girls on the team."
53077,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."
53081,Ned Flanders,"they're just words, neddie. words can't hurt ya."
53082,Ned Flanders,ow! that's it!
53084,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. half a brain, huh? well, you know what? it sounds like you just volunteered!"
53089,Ned Flanders,"hey-hey there, marge. just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
53091,Ned Flanders,i'll take four!
53094,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
53098,Ned Flanders,"hm. wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
53101,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm just gonna spill my guts: i love it to death! i'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
53113,Ned Flanders,"we appreciate the offer, marge, but i think we're going to be very happy here."
53114,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge? still got that deposit check?"
53118,Ned Flanders,i don't think that's gonna do it.
53131,Ned Flanders,"whoa! january first! better get goin' on those taxes, neddy!"
53142,Ned Flanders,heh. sports on a sunday? hm. i'd better check with reverend--
53144,Ned Flanders,bingo.
53147,Ned Flanders,"hm, maybe there is something in there."
53150,Ned Flanders,"hey, here come the simpsons. n-now be careful, homer. there's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
53152,Ned Flanders,"thanks for the tip, homer."
53153,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please make tonight's production better than ""othello"" with peter marshall."
53155,Ned Flanders,"well, that's not quite true--"
53161,Ned Flanders,"no, no, and double-no! i haven't done any of those things, folks. you name it, i haven't done it!"
53164,Ned Flanders,gosh darn it! am i that pre-diddley-dictable? i've wasted my whole dang diddley life.
53170,Ned Flanders,"yeah, i, i guess i do."
53173,Ned Flanders,so what about all this meat?
53182,Ned Flanders,"oh, gee, homer, this all looks so garish."
53183,Ned Flanders,"oh, the lights, the noise, the letter x -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. i'm overstimulated! i gotta get out of this town!"
53187,Ned Flanders,"no, homer, no! i wanna do something exciting, but i can't just go from zero to thirty like that! i-i could be killed."
53194,Ned Flanders,oh no. i-i mean common sense.
53198,Ned Flanders,"oh my goodness, homer. wake up!"
53200,Ned Flanders,"oh, i did it! i conquered my fears and i made up for a lot of lost livin'. and i owe it all to the homer simpson program."
53204,Ned Flanders,"homer! the bad news, ladies, is we already have wives."
53207,Ned Flanders,"what are we gonna do, homer? my kids are gonna be traumatized! and then there's maude. and then there's maude!"
53211,Ned Flanders,oh no!
53212,Ned Flanders,drederick tatum!
53215,Ned Flanders,what's the occasion?
53216,Ned Flanders,homer!
53227,Ned Flanders,not so deep the lord can't find him... and judge him.
53230,Ned Flanders,"oh adam, you're too kind."
53232,Ned Flanders,"you got it, eve."
53233,Ned Flanders,there you go.
53241,Ned Flanders,"so! this is how you repay me, adam!"
53247,Ned Flanders,what the flood?!
65537,Marge,"i know we shouldn't feed this, but grease brings raccoons."
65543,Marge,"i don't know, i don't know! i'm sure i don't know!"
57352,Marge,i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
65546,Marge,i brought this on us all. it began when i was a girl...
57354,Marge,weren't there three indians last year?
65550,Marge,i was supposed to be with all of you.
57361,Marge,"homer, why are they saying you're going to fight drederick tatum?"
65554,Marge,hummingbirds! hum and get it!
57364,Marge,"moe, i'm so glad i found you. please promise me you won't let homer get hurt."
57367,Marge,"celebrities at ringside tonight: star of the ""mcbain"" action films and featured player in the hollywood prostitution scandal, rainier wolfcastle; tv anchorman and springfield institution, mr. kent brockman."
65562,Marge,"no, i'm here to buy one myself."
65563,Marge,this car looks a little small. is the engine powerful?
57370,Marge,somebody stop the fight! where's the doctor?!
65567,Marge,uh-oh! do you hear that rattle?
65569,Marge,well i don't like it.
57377,Marge,"i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had. the mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage."
65580,Marge,"well, take a shower, 'cause we're gonna try it tonight!"
57391,Marge,can't we just go upstairs?
57400,Marge,"oh, all right, we'll go."
65593,Marge,"ooh, a christmas ornament museum! can we stop?"
65594,Marge,i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan.
65599,Marge,i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
65601,Marge,just yell across the house like you do everything else!
65602,Marge,we're not talking!
57410,Marge,springfield doesn't want places like this!
65606,Marge,homer? how many samples did you sell?
65607,Marge,i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
65608,Marge,"homie, maybe we should wait."
65611,Marge,another way is don't drink.
57419,Marge,the house is perfectly fine!
65621,Marge,there's exactly one rita lafleur living in springfield!
65625,Marge,"well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain."
65627,Marge,"so, this was after homer's mother left?"
65630,Marge,"abe, we were so worried."
57440,Marge,"it's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. and we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... ooh, an oyster mallet! ""made in u.s.a.""? eh, no thank you!"
65635,Marge,please say it's the vegetarianism!
65637,Marge,lisa... would you like some shrimp?
65639,Marge,homer! the roof is leaking!
57449,Marge,"so, did anyone see that new woodsy allen movie?"
65642,Marge,you're coming with us to the school fundraiser.
65644,Marge,i don't care for silent auctions. it just encourages hovering.
65645,Marge,that adult etch-a-sketch certainly has brightened your mood.
57453,Marge,i feel terrible. the van houtens split up at our party.
57464,Marge,none! they would have more sense than that.
65657,Marge,"relax, kids, just be yourselves."
65658,Marge,"""scientists prove cat heaven real, human heaven not"" that's so sad..."
65664,Marge,it sure is! there's nothing more natural than... that. it's just that maggie's already... milked me today!
65668,Marge,but i always thought you were cool.
65671,Marge,your father took you to a korean gangster film festival?
65673,Marge,parenting shouldn't have a style! parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! are you wearing a wallet chain?! you look like... a barista!
57482,Marge,"oh, there's so little left: creamed eels? corn nog? wadded beef?"
65676,Marge,"geez, is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie?"
65681,Marge,"fine! i admit it, you... nipple nazis! i give my baby formula!"
57491,Marge,i'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
65685,Marge,"see, see what i'm dealing with here, ned? we invited them here, and they repay us with insults and judgments."
65686,Marge,the cool people are everywhere! somehow they've even made the weather rainier!
57495,Marge,"ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
57503,Marge,"okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off. but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
57504,Marge,"mmm, i suppose i could..."
57506,Marge,"eight spices! oh, some must be doubles. ""or-uh-gahn-o?"" what the hell...?"
57507,Marge,remember your promise: no drinking.
65704,Marge,just hug already!
65706,Marge,"homer, i told you, don't call me ""mom."""
65707,Marge,"this isn't the learn zone. darn it, it's a fun place!"
57515,Marge,"i'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. you broke your promise, homer."
65709,Marge,"keep an eye on the kids, homer."
57517,Marge,"oh, homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
57523,Marge,"homer, don't you see? our differences are only skin-deep..."
65721,Marge,i'm going to bed.
65728,Marge,"i'm proud of you. society may have crumbled, but our decency hasn't."
65737,Marge,"""burly paper towels, burlyville, minnesota. dear sir or madam: your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels. but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three. i'm returning the extra towel, unused..."""
57548,Marge,"all right, helen, if i'm not wanted, i'll leave."
57552,Marge,"well, we're trying to, but you're blocking our way."
65751,Marge,enough with the singing!
57559,Marge,look at them. they've jumped on the one franchise i might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. i'm not cut out for the world of business.
65755,Marge,are you pushing?
65757,Marge,hey! hello!
65758,Marge,just cut the glass!
57567,Marge,thank you.
57568,Marge,excuse me. i had this spot first.
65766,Marge,uh oh. i wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians.
65768,Marge,i think i hear a slight accent.
65769,Marge,"that's where they filmed ""the wire""! step on it!"
65770,Marge,"maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass."
57576,Marge,"i was wrong to have a dream. wrong as usual. i mean, if you're nothing special, why kid yourself?"
57577,Marge,"listen to your mother, kids: aim low. aim so low, no one will even care if you succeed."
65778,Marge,i guess. as long as we don't make it a habit.
57589,Marge,"oh, it just sickens me. how could you do this to someone you love?"
57590,Marge,"oh, homer, i know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the mafia's not getting one cent of my money!"
57591,Marge,we're going to do what we do every day. we're going to make pretzels.
57592,Marge,"there, that's the last one."
65790,Marge,"turn right onto first street, head east. homer, watch the road! not this road, the other road!"
57600,Marge,hello?
57601,Marge,"excuse me, sir. i can't find my children."
57602,Marge,no.
65795,Marge,"bart, would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk?"
65800,Marge,a completed chore list!
65801,Marge,don't watch that dvd!
57610,Marge,what kind of hair?
57611,Marge,it's my hair. excuse me.
65806,Marge,i'm afraid so.
57615,Marge,well... i was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
65808,Marge,i wish i knew what happened...
57616,Marge,"homie, please, i never ask for much, but this is something i really need."
65810,Marge,"okay, no tv at all."
57617,Marge,pleased to meet you.
57625,Marge,"well that's nice, kids, but i don't know where we're going to find anyone like that."
65819,Marge,i don't think so. the u.s. embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield.
65820,Marge,maybe we should go.
57632,Marge,"oh, thank you."
57634,Marge,"shary, you did the best you could. but you can't change this family. neither can i. from now on i'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the ride."
65830,Marge,"homie, do you see anything?"
57639,Marge,kids? kids?
65832,Marge,the top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
57641,Marge,an occasional hug is all i ask.
65835,Marge,we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
65836,Marge,i wasn't laughing -- i was being worried.
65837,Marge,makeup and baby oil!
65838,Marge,it's not all lady stuff. look at all these fitness publications.
57644,Marge,mmm... okay. just be careful.
65842,Marge,"oh homie, you're so... enlightened."
65843,Marge,"oh honey, that's just silly! this'll show helen lovejoy, always bragging about her he-she cousin!"
65848,Marge,how about some fatties?
65850,Marge,i hope someone saw our ad.
65851,Marge,someone's coming!
57658,Marge,"oh, no. oh, no, no, no, no. no. it's a very, very old figurine."
57659,Marge,"well, i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret drinking problem..."
57663,Marge,"mmm, i don't think he's married, homer."
65856,Marge,"homer, do something! they're killing each other!"
65859,Marge,your behavior at that game was unacceptable! you're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
57668,Marge,you're being ridiculous.
65861,Marge,"i don't care if bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person."
65866,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe you struck my husband."
57675,Marge,"homie, i can hear you chewing on your pillow. what's wrong?"
65872,Marge,did you tell the teacher?
57682,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe! hmmm, you feel softer than before."
57684,Marge,someone should really go up there and talk to him.
65878,Marge,power.
57686,Marge,"oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
57688,Marge,but he's safely locked away!
57693,Marge,you can't ask god to kill someone!
57694,Marge,"oh, that sounds fabulous, homer. stores throw the best parties."
57696,Marge,"maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. that's why they hire teenagers."
65892,Marge,"when god rested on the seventh day, did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed?"
57700,Marge,"well, we have to run. i'm sure you kids will work things out. good night!"
57702,Marge,"uh, i don't think we should be driving here. the mayor's yelling at us."
65895,Marge,the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation.
65896,Marge,"that usually works, but not today."
57707,Marge,"oh my god, you walked into the fountain! get out of the fountain!"
57711,Marge,"his arm! oh, my special little guy, are you okay?!"
57712,Marge,"parades just bring out so many emotions in me: joy, excitement, looking..."
57715,Marge,all right.
65908,Marge,homer...
57718,Marge,that's funny... i used to be able to go down there.
57723,Marge,"well, it is. i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
57728,Marge,"that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
65922,Marge,ohhh.
57731,Marge,"oh, my goodness."
57733,Marge,"bills... bills... oo, a free sample of gasoline... a note from publishers' clearinghouse saying we're out of the running... oh look, lisa! you got something."
57734,Marge,"homer, this is yours."
65934,Marge,"everyone, please! calm down! reverend lovejoy is here!"
65942,Marge,what about my dress?
65943,Marge,what do you think?
65944,Marge,homer! you're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!
57752,Marge,"well, i'm sorry!"
57754,Marge,you told me about that candy bar you found three times!
65947,Marge,tell her she's wrong!
57755,Marge,"they're not going to close the plant, are they?"
57759,Marge,see!
65952,Marge,fine. what would you get rid of?
57764,Marge,"hey, calm down. you're wrinkling your church clothes!"
57768,Marge,it's crazy!
57769,Marge,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
57772,Marge,wow.
65968,Marge,thatta boy.
57780,Marge,i don't know... guilt?
57784,Marge,"oh, lenny, i'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
57786,Marge,"please, one at a time, one at a time! now, who has the most urgent problem?"
65979,Marge,don't stand up!
57788,Marge,"hello, listen lady."
57791,Marge,hello. listen lady.
65984,Marge,"got it, music lessons!"
65985,Marge,sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
65986,Marge,i was thinking something more artistic. something musical. you could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
65989,Marge,"so, how much are lessons?"
57799,Marge,oh my god... ned!
65992,Marge,"okay, check your mirrors. hands at ten and two. slowly back out of the driveway--"
57804,Marge,donny's discount gas!
65997,Marge,ugh. speaking of police...
57806,Marge,did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
66000,Marge,bart!
57810,Marge,they started it!
66004,Marge,mopped myself into a corner...
66005,Marge,"of course. but very, very, very angry at all the time i wasted."
57813,Marge,"hmmm... ""nitzi""..."
66007,Marge,i signed you up for the ten-and-below talent show next week!
57815,Marge,"calm down, homer. calm down. answer the door."
57820,Marge,"you'll have to face him sometime. and when you do, i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
66019,Marge,wrong. you have to walk all the way over to grampa to take a plate of cookies i baked.
57828,Marge,i said we were having a special guest tonight -- mr. tim conway.
57829,Marge,"you know homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
66024,Marge,stop it! no karate monsters at the dinner table!
57832,Marge,stakes!
66026,Marge,i've had it! no more karate monsters!
57834,Marge,"in a minute, homie. i have to get the door."
66030,Marge,"i still can't believe it was carl who took your winnings. i thought it would have been you, or you, or you."
57841,Marge,"well, it's time to say ""good night."""
66034,Marge,you're going so far away. i'll miss you.
57842,Marge,"he's just kidding. we'd like to thank fox, and the good people at budget lodge."
57843,Marge,we're like this all the time!
57845,Marge,"now, about your punishment, young man."
66039,Marge,"i know carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?"
57850,Marge,"well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
66044,Marge,"homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!"
66050,Marge,"trust me, homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from."
57859,Marge,why not?
57860,Marge,"oh, homer. of course you'll have a bad impression of new york if you only focus on the pimps and the chuds."
57861,Marge,great! we're all going to new york!
66055,Marge,one more to go and i'm done.
57876,Marge,"you know, when i was a girl, i always dreamed of being in a broadway audience."
66071,Marge,he's in the market! we might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
66072,Marge,"gee, i thought you'd be some kind of creep. but you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--"
57881,Marge,"uh huh, that explains the flags. what about the dog food?"
57882,Marge,let's bake him a cake.
57883,Marge,that's not a funny story.
66082,Marge,he says shows set during world war one are too sad. particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
66085,Marge,hello! it's moe from moe's tavern.
66087,Marge,can i have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
66088,Marge,no tattling!
57896,Marge,movies john travolta made...
66097,Marge,that's great. i wonder what surprise your father has in store.
57906,Marge,"homer, i can't get the baby to burp. could you try for a while?"
66099,Marge,that'll take hours! on our anniversary!
66100,Marge,when does it get better? when he's eight hundred pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie?
57908,Marge,"sure, honey. bart had just completed his first day at school. and bart just..."
57910,Marge,"bart, would you like to read a book?"
57911,Marge,would you like to color something?
66110,Marge,i'm marge simpson.
57918,Marge,"look, i knew private school would be expensive but i was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
66116,Marge,"no! no, that's bart's cereal!"
66117,Marge,"it's the only way i can get him to take his ""vitamins."""
57925,Marge,i guess it doesn't matter. all these things cost money and we just don't have it. unless...
66120,Marge,poor guy.
57930,Marge,"please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help lisa."
57932,Marge,"grampa, what are you talking about?"
57933,Marge,"as i was saying, things couldn't be worse for lisa or bart..."
66126,Marge,"well, what made you--"
57934,Marge,"what ""origin""? we get 'em for a dollar ninety-five down at the safeway."
66129,Marge,sorry. dear god... you know which one i mean... thank you for returning our homie. he's still got a lot of unfinished business down here.
66130,Marge,amen.
57940,Marge,"friends with mutants, right."
57942,Marge,what's going on down there? what's all this mist?
66136,Marge,for the better! and men don't change that way!
66137,Marge,"do you know what we're doing on sunday? brunch with the hibberts, then the tile store! he's like a husband in a widow's memory -- perfect!"
57946,Marge,"mm! shoo! shoo, fly!"
57947,Marge,they're like this every rainy day.
66140,Marge,"now, i'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. it's a catwoman costume i'm sure is unique."
57951,Marge,this is crazy! i'm not a witch!
57956,Marge,and this is for pushing me off the cliff.
66151,Marge,awww...
57962,Marge,i just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the flanders'.
66157,Marge,not me!
57966,Marge,what do you recommend?
66162,Marge,"well, for some reason it relaxes me. now do that thing gene simmons does."
57970,Marge,"no! no one's using this gun. the tv said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder."
57977,Marge,"but this is the first time since we've been married that i've actually feared for our lives. so i'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun."
66170,Marge,really?
66171,Marge,can we focus on my son? up in the sky?
66173,Marge,feels like this play date's gone on forever.
66174,Marge,did you eat a peanut?
66176,Marge,"kirk van houten, i hope you're not having a midlife crisis."
57985,Marge,why can't we stay here?
57986,Marge,no you're not. he's really not.
57989,Marge,yes.
57991,Marge,come down here.
57996,Marge,how did you know we were being robbed?
66191,Marge,if you're happy i'm happy.
66194,Marge,"jumping on the bed. but i never disobeyed my parents, till i married you."
58004,Marge,c-u-p! i wanna c-u-... oh my god!
58005,Marge,"milhouse, stop that!"
66205,Marge,how was work?
58014,Marge,"homer, please."
66208,Marge,why are you saying that?
66210,Marge,have you kids seen your father? surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
58019,Marge,"apu, you're a bachelor. get up there!"
66218,Marge,so this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
58026,Marge,ohhhh. here i am!
58028,Marge,"oh, bart and lisa! you remember your father, apu. well, this is your father, apu's mother."
58029,Marge,right. how much longer is she gonna be here? homer was a little sketchy on the details.
66223,Marge,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
66225,Marge,you know what? i think it's fine if homer spends a few hours now and then with... homer junior.
58033,Marge,"i don't know, but i'm sure it's spicy."
66228,Marge,what about your own children?
66229,Marge,three.
66232,Marge,"oh, for god's sake."
66233,Marge,"lisa, your food's getting cold!"
58040,Marge,"maybe so, but i'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
58045,Marge,what?! she didn't do anything.
58049,Marge,"any time, my angel."
66242,Marge,people's views change. bobby kennedy worked for joe mccarthy. larry david was on fridays.
66243,Marge,"isabel's only eight. as she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body... of beliefs. but she could always use a friend like you."
58051,Marge,is this all we're going to do today?
58057,Marge,i'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
66250,Marge,take a look at this.
66254,Marge,"sorry kids, i guess the hats and mittens will have to wait until next year."
58064,Marge,mr. hutz! i didn't know you sold real estate.
66257,Marge,"we can't afford christmas. and when you can't afford christmas, you've failed as a family. that's what all the big stores say."
66258,Marge,"well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't. our house is very odd that way."
58066,Marge,selling real estate could be just what i'm looking for. i'd really like to give it a try.
66260,Marge,these are our new boarders!
66264,Marge,where is the end?
58072,Marge,i passed!
66266,Marge,setting it up!
58073,Marge,"oh, thank you bart, thank you lisa, for all your help!"
58078,Marge,"i thought so too, but they said it sells."
66271,Marge,"it's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
58081,Marge,"and here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen, with gas range, central can-opener, and foam under-flooring for enhanced standability."
66275,Marge,the pudding will be jell-o.
66277,Marge,"listen, i just wanted to say i'm sorry i overreacted. thank you all for coming."
66278,Marge,we wish you a merry christmas / and a happy new year!
66279,Marge,no second verses! they creep me out.
58086,Marge,"oh. well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?"
58088,Marge,but... all i did was tell the truth.
66282,Marge,"ooo, date night! i'll go change my bra!"
66283,Marge,we'll call that nice girl who's getting her masters in child development.
66284,Marge,"bye bye, maggie!"
58091,Marge,that house is on fire.
66286,Marge,an illegal download? but hollywood says stealing from hollywood is wrong.
58094,Marge,i thought i'd do anything to succeed in business. but bending the truth... i don't know.
66289,Marge,what's going on here? is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
66291,Marge,"lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
66292,Marge,homer! what are you doing out of prison? you have to go back and give yourself up.
66293,Marge,your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
58099,Marge,"well, there it is..."
66295,Marge,i'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
58104,Marge,no. there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
66301,Marge,but the movie isn't in theaters till next week.
58113,Marge,"i'm glad you're not mad, but i lied to you! and i won't feel right until i return your deposit."
66307,Marge,no woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
66308,Marge,"now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
66310,Marge,"homer, i want you to take kumiko and comic book guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?"
66311,Marge,apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
66312,Marge,and getting the termites out of the trees.
58118,Marge,homer! look at this mob! the good toys are probably all gone.
58119,Marge,"hey, kids, i made your favorite cookies -- christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for bart."
66315,Marge,"now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
66316,Marge,what did i say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
66317,Marge,jesus says to love your enemies.
58121,Marge,bart! put down that yellow sweater! nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.
58122,Marge,seven a.m. no earlier. and you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause i got 'em!
58131,Marge,no. my husband is... at church.
58135,Marge,"well, if you mean the money, i suppose we'll just replace the items the burglar took from--"
58136,Marge,"slow down, homer."
66330,Marge,maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
66333,Marge,who's mommy's little girl? genealogy dot org says you are. you are!
66337,Marge,"okay, i guess."
58151,Marge,"they've forgiven us. it's a miracle! you know, deep down, people are pretty g-- hey, wait a minute! they're taking our stuff!"
66344,Marge,"oh i forgot to tell you, homie! i bumped into helen lovejoy today, and guess what?"
58154,Marge,we still have each other. and isn't that the best gift of all?
58156,Marge,"besides, it's mine. yoink!"
66356,Marge,homer!
58171,Marge,all right! all right! sorry!
58172,Marge,come onnn. you have to go outside to do your... business.
66366,Marge,"but ned, saying nay is your thing."
66372,Marge,"no! i'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and i might just have a secret weapon."
66373,Marge,maybe!
66374,Marge,and that's why nancy no is the most popular girl in promiseville high.
66376,Marge,"uh-oh. it's horndog hank. well, nancy knows how to keep him away."
58184,Marge,"i see. well then, no chores, no allowance."
66379,Marge,are you saying i'm wasting my time?
66380,Marge,well then maybe i need to give those kids a better example. goodnight!
58188,Marge,you can't go on that. you have a heart condition.
58190,Marge,but it doesn't look safe. and the guy running it looks a little seedy. no offense.
66385,Marge,"if you defeat this madman, i'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant."
66390,Marge,when are your relatives going to be here?
58198,Marge,"ooo, what a nice surprise! this is so generous of you, cooder."
66398,Marge,it's eighty-two degrees!
58206,Marge,over the sink! over the sink!
66400,Marge,your day is my day! we're the same age! you're turning into your father!
58209,Marge,"we don't want to kill them, bart. we just want our home back."
66402,Marge,"actually, homer got up early to count and sort pills. then he called the police when a frisbee landed on our lawn. then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel."
66403,Marge,i didn't mind that he grew bald... i didn't mind that he got fat... i didn't mind that he got fatter. but no one told me he'd get older than me.
58210,Marge,no fires!
58212,Marge,there must be a way to outsmart them.
58215,Marge,homer...
66414,Marge,"well, i guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
58223,Marge,homer!
66416,Marge,this could be our new living room painting!
66417,Marge,"oh please, homie..."
58226,Marge,"this is ridiculous, we're already married!"
58235,Marge,"all right, already! but do you love the leader more than having your very own, brand new -- hoverbikes?"
66433,Marge,see what happens when we get greedy?
58242,Marge,"hmm... would you like a tall frosty one, homer?"
58244,Marge,"homer, come back!"
58245,Marge,that's my husband!
66442,Marge,"oh, homer simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed kirk and luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about milhouse."
58255,Marge,what exactly is it your company does again?
66450,Marge,"eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on..."
58263,Marge,perfect. you'll grow into them.
66459,Marge,i'll come back with the fire truck. i just have to get the kids to school first.
58267,Marge,"what'd he say, lisa? what'd he say?"
66461,Marge,no! you didn't hear anything!
66462,Marge,it's for people who haven't had heart problems!
58269,Marge,they have those. they're government listings.
66464,Marge,"actually, i'm a little surprised lisa likes him."
58270,Marge,i've really gotta get dinner started...
58274,Marge,what on earth -- ?!
58275,Marge,"so, renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to moe. do you mind if i ask why?"
58277,Marge,"homer, i insist you steal that car."
66470,Marge,you know lisa's a vegetarian.
66474,Marge,hair volumizer... cologne?
66476,Marge,"all right, you've made your point."
58285,Marge,no snacks! dinner will be ready in three minutes!
66482,Marge,"remember that sewing machine you say i never use? well, i sold it and bought this dress!"
66483,Marge,sh-sh-sh!
66485,Marge,please let it be a bear that did this.
58294,Marge,"wait a minute, homer! you didn't ask everybody. what about the women?"
58295,Marge,"ooo... did you hear that, lisa?"
66488,Marge,if you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. that's all i ask...
58296,Marge,unless you're a man.
58297,Marge,it says the ceiling was donated by the velcro company.
66491,Marge,"now homie, i hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life."
58298,Marge,...and the floor was donated by american superball.
66493,Marge,no! i'm throwing you out of the house! you can live with your no-good son.
58300,Marge,wait there.
58305,Marge,"hello, ralph. when i was little, i used to play by myself, too."
66500,Marge,it's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twenty-seven times.
66501,Marge,phoo! you two don't know what a rough marriage is.
58308,Marge,you know who's nice?
66503,Marge,"no, i'm going to join him forever."
58311,Marge,i scheduled a play date.
58312,Marge,not hang out. play date!
66506,Marge,oh it's amazing how many cheerios maggie drops in the back seat.
58314,Marge,but...
58316,Marge,"he's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. and, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool."
58320,Marge,"""this is geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. so, here come de beep. here come de beep."""
58325,Marge,permission granted.
66518,Marge,i want friends. any friends.
58327,Marge,what on earth possessed you to get an earring?
58328,Marge,if milhouse jumped off a cliff--
66521,Marge,okay with no friends. that's the saddest thing i can imagine my daughter saying to me.
58332,Marge,i put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
58333,Marge,"homer, you know we don't have..."
66526,Marge,and stay in the living room. don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
66528,Marge,one drink.
66529,Marge,"you were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you."
58341,Marge,monkey! there's a monkey in the house!
66536,Marge,"don't you dare say ""ostrich eyes."""
58347,Marge,"oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be bart's people, bart."
58350,Marge,"oh, for pete sakes. why is that monkey wearing a diaper? i thought he was housebroken."
58361,Marge,oh lord! now what are we going to do? just let the trash pile up?
66556,Marge,try to forget that.
66560,Marge,lisa! bath time!
58371,Marge,how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
66564,Marge,how permissive?
66565,Marge,"no, no, it's a big thing."
58375,Marge,moving the whole town five miles down the road! it's crazy!
58376,Marge,that's what i call break-neck speed.
66569,Marge,yes. and i can tell how hard it was to lose your father. but at least you were there to share his final thoughts.
58379,Marge,me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
58380,Marge,"whatever you say, sweetie."
66581,Marge,they've been at it all night.
58389,Marge,"oh no, he fell! i can't look!"
66585,Marge,i'm afraid homer and bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
66586,Marge,there's only one thing left to try.
58394,Marge,bart! what have i told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?
58395,Marge,take those silly things off.
66589,Marge,ohh.
66591,Marge,well i don't like this trash talk. and i'm gonna do something about it. even if i have to bring in the big guns.
58399,Marge,"a bus? alone? absolutely not. it's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old. in a few years, when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus."
58400,Marge,"see, bart? there's another boy who played with glue."
58406,Marge,"oh, sorry."
66601,Marge,"...so, i cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
58409,Marge,"stop it, lisa!"
58410,Marge,and look as handsome as the day we were married.
66606,Marge,ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.
66607,Marge,"homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?"
58415,Marge,"well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic."
58419,Marge,"good night, homie."
58420,Marge,"yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the casbah."
66613,Marge,no!
58421,Marge,"oh. oh, did you want me to...?"
66618,Marge,"professor... could you say ""welcome to mother hubbard's sandwich cupboard"" without making any other noises?"
58426,Marge,"well, we used to..."
66625,Marge,"mother hubbard central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them. uniforms, fixins... it's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money. what kind of corporation does that?"
58436,Marge,"quick, the barn!"
66630,Marge,"why, why does this have to be so hard?"
66633,Marge,"i said wash! and bart, go work the deep fryer."
58442,Marge,"oh, isn't it romantic? doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see."
66635,Marge,"gil, i've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
58444,Marge,should we get started?
66639,Marge,good everybody. you won't believe it but we actually turned a profit today.
58452,Marge,"you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?"
66645,Marge,"you're working so hard you've lost weight! we're killing ourselves trying to run a restaurant no one goes to... i've never said this to you before, but i'm saying it now. i'm going to moe's."
58454,Marge,"oh, we drank so much that night."
66648,Marge,go on. please.
66649,Marge,"so you see, ms. zengler, the mother hubbard's express across the street is stealing all our business. it's not fair."
58456,Marge,"homer, a hand!"
58458,Marge,we have to get out of here!
66652,Marge,get the first aid kit!
66657,Marge,"i couldn't help noticing this school is located in... i'm not one to judge, but... um..."
66661,Marge,homer!
66663,Marge,the milkshakes have vanished!
66668,Marge,i'm just happy you're happy.
66669,Marge,homer simpson!
58484,Marge,"but they're counting on you to take tickets. and if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
58489,Marge,the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done.
58492,Marge,"all right, already! everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison!"
58495,Marge,i didn't tell you to quit your job.
58499,Marge,homer! you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
66693,Marge,i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. like in epcot center.
58502,Marge,"turn it off, homer."
58504,Marge,"homer, you've got it set on ""whore."""
58505,Marge,"no, bart. homer... all these inventions, they're..."
66699,Marge,"my sweet baby! ooh, it feels like you have a full diaper."
58509,Marge,"oh, dear. i hope i wasn't too rough on him."
58516,Marge,congratulations. your child or children have been selected to appear in who's who among american elementary school students.
58517,Marge,please submit their names along with ninety-five dollars for each handsome volume you wish to order.
66716,Marge,"finally. a normal person. thank you, miss... um..."
66718,Marge,suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
66720,Marge,it's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.
66728,Marge,the bass guitar? this doesn't really seem like... you.
58544,Marge,drug lab?!
58549,Marge,how's this for later?!
58550,Marge,why are you sitting like that? what are you hiding this time?
58551,Marge,eggs?
58553,Marge,oh my goodness! look!
66752,Marge,"moe szyslak. you didn't climb down our chimney just to say ""merry christmas."""
66756,Marge,what? i never give up hope.
58567,Marge,it's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
66764,Marge,"homie, i'm your present tonight. and the present is that i'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. because i realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining."
58574,Marge,"lisa, look out! a skeleton!"
58576,Marge,that means you'll have to be neutered.
58578,Marge,she's teething. look... her very first baby tooth.
58584,Marge,i guess i've been in denial. homer... kang is maggie's father.
58593,Marge,i can't believe it. jerry springer didn't solve our conflict.
66794,Marge,i really do miss my homie this time of night.
66797,Marge,"fine, you can go to school!"
58606,Marge,"homie, are you okay?"
66802,Marge,"before you fix him... can you change one little thing? i'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and i'd rather..."
66806,Marge,"oh, so good to have you back."
58614,Marge,you're joining the screen actor's guild?
58618,Marge,and that poncho is filthy! let me dry-clean it for you.
58619,Marge,"that ain't gonna happen, bub."
58622,Marge,we all blame you.
66816,Marge,it's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.
58627,Marge,"doctor, will he be all right?"
66820,Marge,"homer, it's a standing ovation, get up!"
66822,Marge,get up!
58631,Marge,"oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress."
66830,Marge,that's worse than what i thought!
58638,Marge,you don't have anything i want.
58644,Marge,with eight years of scrupulous honesty.
66838,Marge,"it's not that professor x wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't."
66839,Marge,that's not really what i was--
66840,Marge,absolutely.
66845,Marge,looks like this is all me.
66854,Marge,at last! i'll earn money for schlepping!
66856,Marge,"i'm... i'm sorry, but i'm not your mother."
58667,Marge,you can get drunk when we get home.
58672,Marge,"oh, no!"
58678,Marge,"well... i said i'd do it, so i guess i'll have to."
58679,Marge,no.
66872,Marge,apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
66873,Marge,and it's not even against the rules.
66874,Marge,not even homer?
58680,Marge,no.
66878,Marge,"huh? oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue."
58687,Marge,i've got maggie.
58691,Marge,nah!
66889,Marge,"homie, homie, i can finally tell you how we really got the money..."
58701,Marge,"you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me."
58704,Marge,that's it.
66898,Marge,my family loves your microwave lasagnas.
58707,Marge,"you know, homie, there's so much more two wives could do for you."
58708,Marge,"that's right. like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. to the bitter end."
66902,Marge,"homie, after all this, do you still believe in god?"
66905,Marge,oh... lisa's class.
66910,Marge,the simpsons.
58720,Marge,it's only 5:30.
58722,Marge,"i'm tired of that show. but i've been hearing good things about ""talk to the hand."" tom shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."""
66915,Marge,a tattoo!
66917,Marge,homer!
58725,Marge,"yeah, we're scared!"
66921,Marge,go get your money.
66925,Marge,where's that bart?
66927,Marge,thank god for homer's christmas bonus.
58737,Marge,"oh, honey. that is egg-ceptional."
66931,Marge,"but i think it does have something to do with your christmas bonus. i keep asking for it, but..."
66932,Marge,yes...
58740,Marge,nothing! i can't believe vincent price would lend his name to such a shoddy product.
58742,Marge,"well, we'll just see. murray hill 5-9232..."
58744,Marge,"oh, mister price, i loved you in the abominable doct..."
66938,Marge,homer!
58749,Marge,another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
58751,Marge,no dating.
66946,Marge,"we could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary."
58757,Marge,but this will be so confusing. the mailman won't know what to do. did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
66951,Marge,bart?
58759,Marge,"but i fell in love with homer simpson. i don't want to snuggle with ""max power."""
66954,Marge,homer!
66955,Marge,"nurturing your brilliant brain, so i got tickets to the opera tonight. hurry up, get dressed! it starts at eight."
58763,Marge,where'd you meet this trent steel? moe's?
66957,Marge,"bart, i feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... what's that word where you encourage something to grow?"
66961,Marge,shush.
66962,Marge,shhh!
58771,Marge,are you sure it's a federal law that i have to dance with you?
58775,Marge,swab? i thought it was a spray.
66972,Marge,"your father's gone, too."
66974,Marge,"oh, homer, how could you think of killing yourself? we love you."
58783,Marge,let go of those.
66977,Marge,"oh, homer. i am so proud of you."
66980,Marge,homer!
66982,Marge,"oh, what an adorable little girl."
58792,Marge,"well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
66986,Marge,"uh-huh. well, uh... i sense greatness in my family."
58795,Marge,what a lovely home!
66988,Marge,here we sit enjoying the shade.
66989,Marge,drink the drink that i have made.
66990,Marge,he's here at last my one and only. good-bye friends and don't be lonely.
58796,Marge,"oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! if anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home!"
58803,Marge,"well, pretty much. except weekends."
66999,Marge,"look, napkins."
58811,Marge,this is about investment opportunities in yemen.
67006,Marge,"...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents."
67010,Marge,i don't know...
58820,Marge,"i do too. but it was sweet. women really like that sort of thing, homie."
67013,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
58822,Marge,"homer, i've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
58828,Marge,"just when i think i have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses."
67021,Marge,"uh-uh, homer. lisa's making these for her teacher."
58830,Marge,"oh, i'm gonna snuggle your brains out."
67023,Marge,homer!
58833,Marge,"i don't know... i, i hate to change lanes once i get going... that's really for race car drivers."
67026,Marge,a bully?!
67027,Marge,"well, bart, i hope you're going straight to the principal about this."
58834,Marge,what in blazes?
67031,Marge,huh huh. and i'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
58841,Marge,m-a-r-g-e.
67038,Marge,homer?
58847,Marge,"oh, i don't know... it doesn't seem right."
58849,Marge,let's do it.
58852,Marge,"that's nice, dear!"
67046,Marge,"come on, come on. we were worried about you. nothing personal. i just fear the unfamiliar."
58854,Marge,"oh, i'll come watch you do nothing after i try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights."
67048,Marge,i'm upset about lisa.
58857,Marge,s.u.v. coming through. open up for marge. thank you! whoaaa! daylight! c'mon. c'mon.
58864,Marge,"well, somebody go first."
67061,Marge,"boys, i'd like your attention, please."
67065,Marge,homer.
67067,Marge,"i don't think we can afford this, homer."
67069,Marge,"used, isn't it?"
58879,Marge,stone philips again!
67075,Marge,"oh, homer. what are we going to do?"
67076,Marge,it is?
67079,Marge,"oh, i'm sure they're just fine. after all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done."
67080,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
67081,Marge,there is?
58887,Marge,she didn't say it yet!
67086,Marge,"cheer up, homer. at least they let you go."
67089,Marge,"very nice, maggie. and lisa you look lovely. bart, assume the position."
67090,Marge,"oh, bart. now where's your father?"
67094,Marge,"c'mon everybody, we're late. bart, i want you to promise me you'll pay attention in sunday school. bart? bart? bart!!"
67095,Marge,what's this? a personal stereo? were you going to listen to rock music in sunday school?
58902,Marge,"ooh, talk to me, baby."
58908,Marge,"ooh, i heard about that place on ""the red grocer."""
58909,Marge,"well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. they might enjoy being the center of attention."
67105,Marge,"um mmm. i know what those movies are like. killing innocent people, eating human flesh. you just get a lot of bad ideas."
58913,Marge,how clever! the kids' menu's on the beak.
67108,Marge,it's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town.
67109,Marge,"go on, lisa. we've all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear."
58918,Marge,"oh no. oh, no..."
58931,Marge,"uhp. it's not a toy, lisa. we'll just have to wait until someone comes."
67125,Marge,"oh, perfume."
67126,Marge,"whoa... hmmm. thank you, bart."
58933,Marge,"if your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band."
58934,Marge,yess!!
58937,Marge,"this is it, honey. we did it."
58938,Marge,dammit!
67131,Marge,the holes were drilled for your fingers.
67133,Marge,you can't take it back. you had your name engraved on it.
67135,Marge,hmmm. i'll just use my ball.
67138,Marge,thank you.
58949,Marge,"uh, aren't you hurt?"
58951,Marge,"speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?"
58958,Marge,"well, it is a sin to waste food..."
58959,Marge,this could really spice up those pies i've been making...
58961,Marge,"adam, say something."
58963,Marge,"well, it's a little late for apologies now."
58968,Marge,"oh, how embarrassing. oh, we slept right through church."
67164,Marge,twenty-five dollars!
67169,Marge,smooth.
58977,Marge,"homie, someone's at the door. they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident."
58981,Marge,no i'm not. i just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash.
58982,Marge,"homie, i'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?"
58984,Marge,"here he is. this is where the... ""magic"" happens."
58985,Marge,i'm happy for you. now g'night.
58986,Marge,"no, homer, being an artist was my dream. but now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life."
67181,Marge,what's brunch?
58989,Marge,"well, i guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy."
58992,Marge,it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
67188,Marge,"goodbye, bart. my special little guy."
59000,Marge,"homer, what have you done?"
59006,Marge,that's us.
59008,Marge,"and it's all because of your letter, lisa."
67202,Marge,like two fragile bowling pins...
67203,Marge,until inevitably...
67209,Marge,does this girl like him?
67211,Marge,"you are not a blimp, homer. you're my big cuddly teddy bear."
67212,Marge,"don't strain yourself, dear."
59021,Marge,i want these springs out of our house today.
59024,Marge,"oh, come on, let's go for a walk! this family's getting so lazy."
67217,Marge,bart.
67219,Marge,"stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the rusty barnacle."
59027,Marge,forget it. nobody's riding any...
67221,Marge,bart!
59028,Marge,"oh, look! there's the store where i buy my yarn. but you don't want to buy your buttons there."
59034,Marge,all this commotion just for a store?
67227,Marge,princess who?
59036,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, but... oh, it really is."
67234,Marge,homer! you don't even know why you're apologizing.
59043,Marge,"lisa, would you like a penny to throw at your brother?"
59044,Marge,"young lady, this may be the high point of bart's life. cut him some slack."
59046,Marge,"hm. well, no one's forcing you to stay."
67241,Marge,homer! what happened?
67242,Marge,"bart, if you had cleaned up your room when i asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. so you pick up this mess right now."
59051,Marge,"wooh, wooh. look at those silk pillows. it's like the set of some high-class porno film!"
59052,Marge,"hold on, wha-- that's our basement?"
59053,Marge,it looks so elegant. and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. you've got to show me exactly what you did.
67248,Marge,"oh, dear."
59059,Marge,we were saving that money for our family vacation. now we're gonna have to start all over again.
67254,Marge,"yes, bart."
67255,Marge,"mmm-hmm. well, bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea."
59065,Marge,"homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom."
59066,Marge,there is for a mega-savings vacation. chuck garabedian says you can fly mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
59071,Marge,homer!
67264,Marge,homer!
67268,Marge,"well, okay, i will. if you admit you love bart."
59081,Marge,every truck-load of fish we gut brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home.
67275,Marge,"oh, my."
59086,Marge,"mmm, i don't think that bridge can support much weight."
67281,Marge,patty and selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the yucatan.
59092,Marge,"hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is."
67287,Marge,"oh, homer."
59096,Marge,who cares? mel gibson!
67300,Marge,leave pedro?
59109,Marge,"hollywood, here we are!"
59118,Marge,put it away. put it away!
59122,Marge,that's amazing! ...and darling.
59123,Marge,how will we get bart to take these?
67321,Marge,"oh, there it... went."
67326,Marge,maybe i'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
59135,Marge,can you believe it? and he's even tutoring a little navajo boy.
67330,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's no answer at home."
67332,Marge,how come all the lights are on?
67333,Marge,i can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
59146,Marge,oh.
67340,Marge,"bart, honey... you're going to miss your bus!"
59150,Marge,"... and i'm really worried, chief. there's no telling what he might do."
59152,Marge,i don't think he has diarrhea.
67347,Marge,"bart, it's past your bedtime."
59155,Marge,thank you for stopping the tank.
59156,Marge,"oh. so, bart..."
59160,Marge,"well, i'm not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. from now on it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned ritalin!"
59162,Marge,"this is so exciting, homie. your first restaurant review."
59165,Marge,you like shake and bake. you used to put it in your coffee.
67359,Marge,"oh, homer."
67360,Marge,"i love you, homer."
67362,Marge,"homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
67364,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so sorry."
59172,Marge,"oh, no!"
59173,Marge,"oh my god, we killed ned flanders!"
59174,Marge,"oh, it was an accident! an accident!"
59176,Marge,stop winking.
67376,Marge,homer! what's this thing in the corner?
59188,Marge,i don't want you looting!
59192,Marge,love ya lots!
67385,Marge,"let's go, children."
59194,Marge,my hero!
59195,Marge,"thanks, homer."
59201,Marge,"hello, my husband will be right with you. we're just taking this old christmas tree to the dump."
59202,Marge,"no, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse."
59204,Marge,looks like you were saved by a christmas tree.
59205,Marge,look! it's jimmy carter!
67398,Marge,will we be invited?
67403,Marge,"homer, i am not sleeping with the lights on. they're just children's stories. they can't hurt you."
59211,Marge,"more tumbleweed, lisa?"
67405,Marge,"you're late for work, homer."
67409,Marge,homer... i'm a bailey booster.
59219,Marge,"oh, honey, give it up."
59220,Marge,"homer, no!"
59222,Marge,"that's odd. the outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown."
67418,Marge,"i'm sorry, dear. it will all be over soon."
59230,Marge,i've never been so glad to be home.
67426,Marge,"here you go, bart."
59234,Marge,homer!
59235,Marge,hello? homer? where are you? you promised you were going to have a tea party with maggie.
67431,Marge,a simpson on a t-shirt. i never thought i'd see the day.
67433,Marge,"let's do it, homer!"
67434,Marge,"well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to capital city."
59246,Marge,"doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown man from drowning?"
67443,Marge,would you like some fruit juice?
59251,Marge,"how about this ""p√∂pli""?"
67445,Marge,"now, now, homer. bart's busy working on his science project."
67446,Marge,"homie, quit tossing."
59252,Marge,how ingenious. the forks are made out of lego.
59256,Marge,"i enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as ""sideshow marge."""
67457,Marge,hmmm. i was going to wash my hair.
59266,Marge,maybe you two should get a nanny.
67459,Marge,"homer, i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind."
67461,Marge,"well, i'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
59274,Marge,wooo!
67467,Marge,"ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?"
59275,Marge,"wow, a fifties nostalgia cafe!"
59280,Marge,"okay, meathook, i think he learned his lesson."
67474,Marge,"no, no, no, the other shelf."
67475,Marge,open the can.
67476,Marge,it's in the second drawer from the right.
59286,Marge,could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me?
67480,Marge,just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. bart. bart?
67488,Marge,"yes, you do! i hope you're happy, bart! you've ruined thanksgiving!"
67489,Marge,"oh, why don't i go talk to her?"
67495,Marge,"oh, no! my sweet little bart!"
59310,Marge,"sorry, how long will he take to recover?"
59314,Marge,"why don't you kick some books, lisa?"
67507,Marge,"sit down, homer."
67508,Marge,"homer, drive defensively."
59317,Marge,"okay, here goes..."
59324,Marge,this chair lift sure goes high...
59329,Marge,you mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
59334,Marge,i can't be in the hospital! tomorrow is laundry day. and i've gotta de-meat lisa's baloney.
59335,Marge,"sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge around the house, but don't be a hero. just make sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp. but not the good tarp. i want you to get married on that some day!"
67532,Marge,because.
67536,Marge,what kind of warped human being would find that funny?
59344,Marge,i think so too. bye!
59347,Marge,lost them? what do you mean?
59352,Marge,"well, then let's get out of here."
59354,Marge,"there's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party..."
67551,Marge,but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four.
59360,Marge,where are we?
67553,Marge,have fun.
67554,Marge,and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these?
59365,Marge,"i don't know, there's a lot of buzz around lenny."
67561,Marge,what do we want?
67562,Marge,when do we want it?
59369,Marge,uh-huh. the fire department.
59370,Marge,don't worry about a thing. we'll take good care of your house!
59373,Marge,this all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
67567,Marge,krusty
67571,Marge,so much needless brutality. i don't know if i'm having any impact at all.
67573,Marge,"what is it? what? ""smartline?"" yes, i've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. well, i'd love to."
59381,Marge,"homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. you're not a billionaire."
59388,Marge,"honey, we want mr. burns to find this place exactly the way he left it."
59394,Marge,"never, but it's my number one concern!"
67588,Marge,aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
59397,Marge,"yeah, right, that's what i meant, lisa. state un-fair."
59398,Marge,i didn't say they couldn't. i said you shouldn't.
67593,Marge,what in the world?
59401,Marge,"oh, my. ooh-hoo. it's going to cost us $500 a week to keep duncan!"
67596,Marge,i'm not. i think everyone in springfield should see it.
59408,Marge,furious d?
67601,Marge,"oh, homie. here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other."
67608,Marge,hmmm.
59419,Marge,that's right.
59422,Marge,"you're darn right you are! and you've got lots of other great qualities, too."
67615,Marge,i don't know. maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
59427,Marge,"they don't show police chases, do they?"
59431,Marge,homer? homer?
59438,Marge,guess who i saw at the supermarket today!
59443,Marge,you set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
67637,Marge,my woman's intuition is telling me something... i wonder what... oh my god.
67639,Marge,"homer, i'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
59448,Marge,"kids, would you like a balloon?"
67643,Marge,"homer, look at me."
67644,Marge,i love you too!
67650,Marge,what would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
67651,Marge,i'll have one of those.
67658,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
67661,Marge,"oh, where can he be?"
67663,Marge,"i wrote a poem for you this afternoon, homer. it's called, ""to a husband."""
67664,Marge,"ahem. ""the blackened clouds are forming ..."""
59474,Marge,"yes, go! just go!"
67668,Marge,"his drool! it's warm! he's alive! homer, homer, wake up, you're alive!"
67673,Marge,"no, it's true, bart. we used to shoot pool... and go dancing..."
67683,Marge,"... and in another article, i found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!"
67686,Marge,"well, no i don't. actually, i never really..."
59495,Marge,not now.
59496,Marge,"i trust you, honey."
59499,Marge,"oh, thank goodness. where were you?"
59500,Marge,"i hope he didn't cause too much trouble, sheriff."
59503,Marge,"you seemed so understanding before. what happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
67697,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but i really don't have the time."
67698,Marge,and the city forensics championship is coming up.
67699,Marge,"oh, and i-i tutor part time."
67703,Marge,"well, not me. shut it off and let's get down to business."
59512,Marge,"you mean, when they marry other people."
67705,Marge,bien.
67707,Marge,"homer, you're amazing. before you couldn't say bon jour. but now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""allouette""."
67710,Marge,"merci, i guess."
67712,Marge,oui.
67713,Marge,maybe i'll wear my hair... up.
59530,Marge,"well, looks like we got everything for bart's camping trip: blair witch repellent, antler saw and deep woods scrabble."
67723,Marge,why are you doing this? why can't you accept that i'm here with someone else?
67724,Marge,"i don't know, but it is."
67725,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
67726,Marge,"artie, please!"
67727,Marge,"oh, artie!"
67728,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
67729,Marge,"take me home, artie."
59539,Marge,okay.
59540,Marge,why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
67735,Marge,why so glum?
67737,Marge,are you sure this is legal?
59548,Marge,where's lisa?
59550,Marge,"lisa's gone berserk! do something, homer! do something!"
67743,Marge,"bart, you're no longer in sunday school. don't swear."
67744,Marge,what's gotten into lisa?
59557,Marge,"you should have asked first, bart. weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars."
59558,Marge,"all right, otto can get married here. but homer, you have to get rid of that elephant."
67752,Marge,no.
67753,Marge,"oh, homer."
59562,Marge,mm-hmm?
59563,Marge,"oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. make it part of the background noise of your relationship. that's how i polished homer into the perfect... homer! no, that's ice!"
59567,Marge,"becky, i know you must feel awful. but at least this didn't happen after you were married."
59572,Marge,thanks to our own spice girl: becky.
67768,Marge,...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire.
59576,Marge,"well, no kicking. it's too dangerous."
59580,Marge,it's red!
67776,Marge,he's here.
67777,Marge,"well, selma hated egypt, too. a camel spit on her."
59587,Marge,it is?
67783,Marge,it's the hospital.
59593,Marge,"look, i know i don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me!"
67791,Marge,"would you like to hold the baby, herb?"
67792,Marge,"homer, please."
59605,Marge,i'm not insane!
59606,Marge,"now, let's find out who this becky really is."
59610,Marge,why you little...!
67803,Marge,"ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. i think you have the mumps. i'm calling doctor hibbert."
59611,Marge,shot? wha?
67809,Marge,oh dear.
67815,Marge,you just need to develop a callous. see?
67816,Marge,"you see. now that's a sewing finger, honey."
59623,Marge,"fortunately, i had a network connection. the man who cut my hair was also president of fox."
59632,Marge,"you don't have the guts, little man!"
59641,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
59642,Marge,i don't like you ogling her.
67836,Marge,"hmmm, what are you doing, dear?"
59647,Marge,but i thought broccoli was--
67840,Marge,"homer, that's terrible. we should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. you know, we'll be old someday."
59649,Marge,"homer, it's you!! i thought i'd never see you again."
67842,Marge,"well, i always enjoy the glass blower at old springfield towne."
67843,Marge,"dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
59651,Marge,"well, i've got a whole list of chores: clean the garage, paint the house, grout the tu--"
67849,Marge,"no, maggie! stay in the shallow end."
67852,Marge,"now, homer. we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you."
67855,Marge,well...
67856,Marge,but mr. schindler...
67858,Marge,i never got any. and i never painted again.
59667,Marge,"ooh, why didn't you say so? hey, is there a bathroom here?"
67860,Marge,no.
59673,Marge,"to be honest, it's a little chilly."
59681,Marge,"so, mr. king, what tale of horror and the macabre are you working on now?"
59686,Marge,"homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip."
67880,Marge,"oh, my."
59694,Marge,"bart, it's so sweet of you to take the family out to krustyburger."
59695,Marge,"oh, how cute! kids, look who's on the roof!"
59696,Marge,i can't believe how young he is. he'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
67891,Marge,from the desk of ringo starr!
67892,Marge,"okay, homer. if you think i can."
67899,Marge,"hmmm, lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and i think you should take her."
59708,Marge,when did this happen? when did we become the bottom rung of society?
67903,Marge,well... i'll tell you what. why don't we invite mr. bergstrom to dinner?
67904,Marge,sure.
59711,Marge,really? like what?
67907,Marge,yes.
67909,Marge,yes.
67911,Marge,yes.
67914,Marge,"yes, she is. and who are you?"
59722,Marge,homie!
59723,Marge,you're not my husband.
59732,Marge,mmm. i'd like to visit that long island place. if only it were real...
59734,Marge,marge.
67932,Marge,maybe i should run this by my husband first.
67933,Marge,"then ""yes"" -- hither me forth on mine arduous quest!"
67935,Marge,all i see is that rock.
59747,Marge,should i just back out of the room?
59748,Marge,there you are. how was the magic act?
67942,Marge,"if they think less of you because of me, then they're not really your minions."
67943,Marge,"great, i'll come with you. shouldn't you bundle up? here, let me enchant your pants."
59753,Marge,you were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
59754,Marge,"oh, dear. we don't want that."
67947,Marge,i thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so i redecorated using the hello kitty expansion pack.
59757,Marge,"after we got maggie to a safe house, of course."
59761,Marge,"he's doing ""dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
59778,Marge,really?
59793,Marge,"how's your back, homie?"
59811,Marge,"that's charming, sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke."
59821,Marge,not till you finish your sundae.
59824,Marge,"honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
59830,Marge,i know just where you can get one.
59831,Marge,i read in the daily fourth gradian that you need someone to paint a mural.
59832,Marge,"well, jack here will do great work for you."
59833,Marge,it's a small liberal arts college. very law-abiding. no convicts at all.
59852,Marge,i'd better put on the silencer.
59872,Marge,"i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
59879,Marge,"oh, hello, homer."
59880,Marge,"uh, there's something i should tell you."
59883,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie. we'll talk about it later, okay?"
59884,Marge,"i was thinking mantle, too! talk about being on the same wavelength."
59891,Marge,"now lisa, you know that's not true."
59892,Marge,"oh, you little-- come on, bart."
59895,Marge,"once again, i'm outraged by this last-minute switch."
59898,Marge,oopsie!
59905,Marge,why do you want bart? he's not much of a singer.
59911,Marge,my bart?
59912,Marge,but...
59915,Marge,"none of those girls has had three kids, i can tell you that."
59916,Marge,are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
59918,Marge,"well, i'd like to go. how about you, maggie?"
59921,Marge,"lisa, how's your eiffel tower kit?"
59922,Marge,what kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
59923,Marge,i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
59928,Marge,"oh, homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. you eat while you brush your teeth. you're eating a huge sausage right now."
59936,Marge,"homer, you're still here? you should've left for work an hour ago!"
59938,Marge,it's only two blocks away!
59939,Marge,you can spit on the bus.
59947,Marge,"yep. it's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?"
59952,Marge,"homer! don't be... wow, that is huge."
59955,Marge,"okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file. what if you two bond over your malibu stacey dolls?"
59956,Marge,she's not afraid of bunnies.
59957,Marge,"no, no, no. oh, homie!"
59958,Marge,i'm the one who told you that.
59962,Marge,i'm a horrible mother.
59967,Marge,"oh, honey, we're so proud of you."
59999,Marge,"hm, quite a promotion."
60000,Marge,what happened to president muntu?
60007,Marge,stop it!
60010,Marge,"calm down! if we hurry, they can reattach your thumb."
60011,Marge,we've just gotta get your thumb to the--
60012,Marge,where did it go?
60020,Marge,isn't there anything you can do?
60026,Marge,not right now. your father's in there and --
60028,Marge,"oh, no. we're out of gas. i couldn't figure out this stupid italian gas gauge."
60031,Marge,"well, i've already borrowed one car. let's go!"
60035,Marge,you leave those boys alone!
60041,Marge,"oh, don't you worry. we'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to."
60042,Marge,poor ned. he can't look anywhere without being reminded of maude.
60052,Marge,"oh, homer won't be able to play for a long time."
60057,Marge,"homer, this man is from the ""good guy"" awards."
60059,Marge,the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
60066,Marge,ohhh!
60080,Marge,i'm not a cop.
60096,Marge,"ooo, that really covers the cat crap!"
60103,Marge,"oh, pierce. the water's perfect."
60104,Marge,"oh, you don't have to do..."
60112,Marge,kids it's eight o'clock! you're gonna miss the bus to wizard school!
60116,Marge,it's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
60117,Marge,uh-oh.
60119,Marge,"well, maybe it'll be fun. you'll get to spend more time together. make sure your father takes his mood medication."
60131,Marge,"homer, no! we're not bad parents."
60140,Marge,ahh!!
60153,Marge,"all right, we got lucky that time, but i want everyone in this family to raise your hand and promise not to break the law for one full year."
60155,Marge,"what are you reading, homie?"
60158,Marge,"bart, this is dr. kaufman. he's a special kind of ""talking doctor."""
60159,Marge,running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
60163,Marge,bart!
60171,Marge,that was amazing. i hope the kids didn't hear us.
60176,Marge,i'll just take them right back to the store and-- whoa.
60194,Marge,oh my god!
60196,Marge,"congratulations, i feel ridiculous."
60199,Marge,we'd better get him home.
60210,Marge,maybe we should come back in the daytime.
60214,Marge,but whose body is it?
60216,Marge,"lisa, don't sulk. you're on the jumbotron."
60226,Marge,let's just write to david bowie again.
60232,Marge,you should be very upset.
60239,Marge,good. i'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
60244,Marge,just do it. do it. do it now!
60246,Marge,hm. it's a pity.
60249,Marge,"ah. well, you do have a present under the tree. i guess no one told santa you were a buddhist."
60261,Marge,"happy, happy new year!"
60263,Marge,oh. we'd better stay inside. at least until the squirrels stop melting.
60270,Marge,"sir, we know you're not an angel. my husband sees too many movies."
60277,Marge,"if i had known there were loose women in las vegas, i would never have let you go."
60279,Marge,"get out, homer."
60280,Marge,"homer, i don't know if i can ever forgive you. please go away."
60281,Marge,"oh, no. she's making him a sandwich."
60282,Marge,why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
60284,Marge,you insensitive jerk! maybe this family would be better off without you!
60286,Marge,our plan worked perfectly.
60294,Marge,i can't believe it. everyone's celebrating their obesity!
60296,Marge,"you kids do eat a lot of sugar. but at least homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
60297,Marge,look at all the empty calories.
60311,Marge,"oh yeah, like erin brockovich."
60319,Marge,why didn't you just turn off the oven?
60324,Marge,dessert's on. i steamed some limes!
60332,Marge,"oh honey, think pink. look, a salute to safe sex!"
60335,Marge,"homer, you're going to get in trouble."
60336,Marge,so your life is ruined.
60337,Marge,"oh dear, you can't eat solid foods. those are his favorites."
60338,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
60344,Marge,"pardon my french, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
60345,Marge,"you know, tomorrow is the annual springfield formal event. we weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
60359,Marge,"well, so much for new homer."
60366,Marge,the demolition derby? that'll scratch my itch.
60378,Marge,i'll get it!
60379,Marge,nooky in new york?
60391,Marge,"anti-trust suit... anti-trust suit... a note from marge simpson? well, isn't that a coincidence? i was just thinking about her..."
60398,Marge,"homer, don't talk with your mouth full. i've told you before, it's rude."
60405,Marge,are you snoring while you're awake?
60413,Marge,i knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. keep your money. i'm going home.
60414,Marge,send the bill to baron von kiss-a-lot.
60419,Marge,this campus is so lush and verdant.
60425,Marge,climb up!
60432,Marge,"ohhh, is that where boozer drank the pee?"
60436,Marge,that car's as big as all outdoors.
60448,Marge,"thanks for coming, mr. mccoy. we cooked your favorites: rattlejailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey."
60464,Marge,"homer, your father's dead!"
60472,Marge,"grampa, i gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie."
60487,Marge,"oh, i can't stay mad at you."
60488,Marge,"brave odysseus, it has been twenty long years. regale me with tales of your adventures."
60491,Marge,"bartrand, where is your sister joan? morning bells are ringing. morning bells are ringing!"
60495,Marge,"of course they didn't, honey."
60503,Marge,no way i'm cleaning up this mess.
60504,Marge,our phone bill is four hundred dollars! they charged us for a call to brazil.
60508,Marge,"we've met you many times, ms. naegle. why do you keep changing jobs?"
60510,Marge,we've been charged for calls to brazil that we didn't make.
60511,Marge,homer!
60524,Marge,it says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
60525,Marge,"bart, what are you watching?"
60526,Marge,bert and ernie left it to your imagination.
60527,Marge,what a charming neighborhood.
60540,Marge,go away! go away!
60553,Marge,hello?
60574,Marge,homer? what's going on?
60576,Marge,you mean i shouldn't punish bart at all?
60584,Marge,"no, no, no, let's just keep playing. what's the score?"
60588,Marge,tell that woman it's over between you and her.
60592,Marge,"i just wish there was something we could do... oh. oh, homer, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
60596,Marge,even better.
60599,Marge,they miss their father. are you sure you don't want to take him back?
60602,Marge,at the golden banana?
60606,Marge,"what's wrong with him, doctor? it can't be mange, i just had him dipped."
60607,Marge,i knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream.
60612,Marge,"oh, and this kitchen isn't?"
60619,Marge,"that woman is taking advantage of you, and we need you to do things around here. the oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium."
60620,Marge,fine. i'll go talk to her.
60622,Marge,"well, let me sew that up for you."
60624,Marge,"freshen your drinks, ladies?"
60632,Marge,"wait, wait! that's a suggestion, not a threat!"
60636,Marge,i can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
60637,Marge,but we're innocent! it was the man with the braces.
60647,Marge,i'm back here.
60654,Marge,"oh, forget it. they couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing."
60664,Marge,"fat tony, how can you do this?"
60673,Marge,"maude flanders, we the living beseech you to appear."
60676,Marge,those were for the church breakfast.
60680,Marge,"kids, your father made us breakfast."
60684,Marge,"thank you, general. that's a big relief."
60685,Marge,"the horde is almost dead! there's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning."
60687,Marge,no bellybutton?! you're a clone! then the real homer...
60690,Marge,"i very much doubt that, homer. these are horrible ghouls from the past."
60693,Marge,"dr. hibbert, this is a top-notch resort. can you recommend some activities?"
60710,Marge,rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!
60721,Marge,"get back, honky cat! those systems are too expensive."
60729,Marge,what?
60734,Marge,"that's good satire -- it doesn't hurt anyone. what do you think, maggie?"
60745,Marge,"doctor, before we begin, i have a couple questions."
60750,Marge,you had no right to make my bosom this ample!
60760,Marge,"they do make my neck look thinner... oh, all right, let's do it."
60761,Marge,"now wait, homer."
60768,Marge,"it's for my back spasms. if guys didn't keep pinching my tush, i'd never stand up straight."
60773,Marge,i've heard about you vendors!
60778,Marge,"anyway, you're the only man i want ogling me."
60787,Marge,why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
60789,Marge,don't you have any rooms? we can't live in our house for six months.
60792,Marge,we are not staying at moe's. maggie's already drunk on the fumes. and she's a mean drunk.
60793,Marge,"hey, if tv can give mike o'malley a home, it can give us one."
60800,Marge,i'll just take these tampons.
60811,Marge,"oh no, everything's ruined. our good bellows... our stereopticon... squiggy! homer, your strop! your strop!"
60813,Marge,"no, homer, no! that's our only way home!"
60833,Marge,"well, just a little one."
60845,Marge,"and he's good around the potty, too."
60852,Marge,hello?
60853,Marge,"uh, ""a."" and i'd like to add that proposition ""hug lisa for me"" has my full support."
60865,Marge,oh no! i pepper sprayed ralph!
60871,Marge,"oh, my god. isn't there anything i can do?"
60872,Marge,what if i can't feel comfortable outside again?
60874,Marge,"all right, just to the mailbox and back."
60885,Marge,goodbye kids.
60886,Marge,"what to do now. too crazy to go outside, not crazy enough to have imaginary friends."
60892,Marge,i'm stronger than i've ever been! i don't have to go back inside. i'm not afraid!
60894,Marge,"ned, i'm not afraid!"
60896,Marge,you!
60897,Marge,not any more!
60898,Marge,you've just been marge-inalized!
60901,Marge,i don't have those kind of muscles.
60904,Marge,but aren't there side effects?
60911,Marge,"hey, hot stuff. i've got a competition tomorrow. i could use a good-luck snuggle."
60920,Marge,club soda will get that blood out.
60921,Marge,"you know, i really do miss being a lady."
60922,Marge,"oh, homie."
60936,Marge,"homer, that was not very christian of you."
60945,Marge,"come on, everyone's helping."
60950,Marge,"your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a..."
60953,Marge,"bart, stop that!"
60954,Marge,"bart, the larynx is not a plaything."
60955,Marge,"i heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
60957,Marge,i wanted a sewing room. but not like this. not like this!
60972,Marge,"i'm just happy you're excited about something besides saving the whales. face it, they're doomed!"
60973,Marge,"oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!"
60977,Marge,"really? hmm. well what about in the sentence ""jim nabors is way cool""?"
60979,Marge,it's so exciting! it's like living in a dictionary.
60986,Marge,"lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing."
60991,Marge,poor ned. this is his first jellyfish festival alone.
60994,Marge,"and ned, i haven't seen you this happy in years."
61001,Marge,what?
61002,Marge,why is that jet flying so close to our house?
61006,Marge,"look, can you please just tell us why you've changed the flight paths?"
61009,Marge,"homer, we haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, the dog has eaten all its hair...and the fixtures won't stay in one place."
61014,Marge,"...the shaking's so bad, all my omelets have become frittatas."
61022,Marge,election night is so exciting. i'm on pins and needles.
61023,Marge,"there he is. krusty, we came to see how many campaign promises you've kept."
61032,Marge,"oh, that's so sweet. i was tired of putting my keys in that bowl, like a cave man."
61036,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
61038,Marge,"bart, you can hear us?"
61042,Marge,live from new york it's saturday night!
61043,Marge,"this is even better than our screensaver. and i love our screensaver. nicely done, lisa."
61056,Marge,"oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?"
61059,Marge,"homer, i'm sorry you saw that, but i was very upset that night."
61063,Marge,looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
61065,Marge,"well, there are a lot of beer cans around here."
61072,Marge,just go. and take your stupid lhasa apso with you.
61076,Marge,"homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
61077,Marge,"goodbye, homer! i try to save our marriage, and you just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends!"
61083,Marge,"another cover? my god, let it die."
61087,Marge,"watch it, mr. byrne! you'll slip on the simonize!"
61095,Marge,"lisa, you don't know what you'll want in the future. i didn't marry the first boy i... well, i did. but you shouldn't!"
61097,Marge,"homie, i'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up."
61101,Marge,"lisa, welcome to love. it's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. but then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts."
61106,Marge,family head-count!
61113,Marge,that guy exploits his pets worse than bob guccione.
61118,Marge,he woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
61123,Marge,my husband has our card...
61125,Marge,is my husband there?
61133,Marge,"i'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, i'm a full-time family chauffeur!"
61148,Marge,"that's ridiculous. i don't like you. i mean hate you, hate you, hate you! i hate you!"
61161,Marge,"oh, don't be a wuss."
61167,Marge,"you are so right, ned. there won't be a single minute where bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... homer, get over here!"
61176,Marge,all right. everyone inside. let's go.
61182,Marge,"well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations."
61183,Marge,then i guess this means war.
61189,Marge,"no, there were twelve."
61194,Marge,"oh, lord. why do they keep changing his medication?"
61200,Marge,"wow, she really likes you. maybe the next time i need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
61201,Marge,"well, i have so much free time now that moe's our babysitter."
61205,Marge,"no, it's your turn."
61224,Marge,"ooh baby! did i find something to throw out today! if you like space in the attic, are you gonna be happy!"
61225,Marge,"lisa, that's a filthy habit."
61247,Marge,"you're like geraldine ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
61252,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing? this is the kind of troublemaking i expect from your brother."
61255,Marge,"oh no, they heard me."
61264,Marge,england is so classy. every cab has its own butler.
61268,Marge,"oh, look at all these classy british plays."
61273,Marge,what difference could it make? he hit the friggin' queen!
61276,Marge,"it's partly my fault. i've been nagging you so much on this trip, you couldn't know which nags to focus on."
61278,Marge,"that was very sweet of the queen, letting you go in exchange for taking madonna back to america."
61283,Marge,"homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. all that candy is rotting your brain."
61289,Marge,"you're not going, and that's final."
61291,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about this. let's check the suit closet.
61299,Marge,how did you get her out?
61301,Marge,we did -- homer took him. didn't you?
61311,Marge,that's the rich people's mall. let's shop till we droop!
61318,Marge,"homer, is there something you're not telling us?"
61323,Marge,"no. i'm gonna parcel my anger out over the next few days and weeks, jabbing at you just when you seem the most content."
61327,Marge,"oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. and tears are the sweetest sauce."
61331,Marge,"ou-ay ow-knay, i-ay as-way oung-yay unce-way oo-tay."
61333,Marge,backed up by solar power.
61334,Marge,"aw, look how happy she is."
61335,Marge,it makes her happy.
61345,Marge,and i love baseball!
61352,Marge,"then, i guess this means war. with the most powerful weapon at my disposal: a voter-sponsored initiative."
61354,Marge,"no, the march primary."
61369,Marge,awww...
61373,Marge,"it says ""yes on two thirty-two"". we want no on two thirty-two, yes on two forty-two."
61377,Marge,"looks like everything's back the way it was, which is the only way it should ever be."
61382,Marge,"oh, lisa. honey, it's okay. you're a buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
61383,Marge,"coltrane? lisa, i'm glad you're ready to love again. but a kitty needs a proper name, like whiskers. or paws scaggs."
61386,Marge,it's the only way to talk to bullies.
61389,Marge,"well, i could use a muffin."
61390,Marge,"esme delacroix! she wrote ""to kiss a scoundrel!"""
61393,Marge,then i'll do it!
61395,Marge,tonight? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel.
61396,Marge,"homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
61403,Marge,scene from moby-dick.
61407,Marge,"ooh, i just finished my first paragraph. spell check!"
61410,Marge,"oh homie, i've had the most exciting day..."
61412,Marge,temperance had to face the unhappy truth...
61414,Marge,"this story is as dark as those new milky way bars. ooh, that's a good analogy. i'll work it in somewhere. but now i need some romance, pronto!"
61423,Marge,"homie, i finished my novel."
61433,Marge,dr. marvin monroe?! i haven't seen you in years.
61435,Marge,you told me you liked it! you didn't read it at all! you lied to me!
61437,Marge,it was only my imagination.
61443,Marge,"there, there, i can help you kids."
61460,Marge,why are your clothes so dirty? and why do you smell like liquor? have you been clubbing?
61471,Marge,dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
61479,Marge,you're panhandling! i should have known from that panhandling sign! plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
61488,Marge,my baby has no future!
61489,Marge,grocers don't make that much.
61490,Marge,"and even then, he could only speak german!"
61493,Marge,"look at these courses you'll be taking. ""advanced peek-a-boo""."
61495,Marge,"look lisa, there's something in here for you!"
61503,Marge,lisa's gone! you have to find her!
61516,Marge,"homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you."
61521,Marge,good. can you play with him for half an hour?
61524,Marge,no you didn't.
61532,Marge,no. your problem is you never think of anyone besides yourself.
61534,Marge,"oh, what do you think?"
61535,Marge,"okay kids, this book should help you deal with your feelings."
61539,Marge,bart!
61556,Marge,"no, it'll have to do."
61557,Marge,"the best part is, i don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because i was there!"
61560,Marge,maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
61563,Marge,"well, i don't want to be a ""gloom-hilda."" i guess one beer won't hurt."
61568,Marge,oh no! i'm gonna be incarce... incarce... incarce... i'm going to jail.
61586,Marge,"thanks for everything, kyle."
61589,Marge,it's important for me to see you take at least one step. then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
61602,Marge,"oh bart, my troubled little lamb. you'll be in jail for so long. but i'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty."
61603,Marge,"we're having ""make your own taco"" night."
61611,Marge,every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
61619,Marge,sure there are downsides. but a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
61630,Marge,our marriage is just an illusion. he doesn't care how i feel at all. he doesn't know how to love.
61636,Marge,"stop it! no one was planned! now, we have to pack for great-uncle tyrone's birthday tomorrow. in dayton!"
61642,Marge,"what i want is a really good ""weeper."""
61644,Marge,bart!
61647,Marge,"oh, homie."
61650,Marge,"homie, you know i'm usually good for a triple-x throw down, but between those kids and going to uncle tyrone's, we can't be alone."
61668,Marge,the kids tracked us down! our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
61685,Marge,how about a bite of the world's biggest brussels sprout?
61688,Marge,you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
61689,Marge,"ooh, i'll bet he's ned flanders."
61700,Marge,"no, it was clearly you in that suit. you'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start."
61707,Marge,"yes... and then your father broke my heart. and if i'd known he was you, i never would have married you!"
61710,Marge,i used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. they heard it in shelbyville!
61718,Marge,"so we arranged to meet again at ""second date rock."""
61727,Marge,"oh, homie! you did care."
61735,Marge,bart! that hobo skeleton is not a toy!
61746,Marge,uh oh. poonam and uma are fighting!
61762,Marge,you don't sell roadside corn.
61764,Marge,why don't you publish your poem?
61765,Marge,"look at you go. type-ity type, type, type!"
61767,Marge,hello? octopuses? i'm done.
61774,Marge,where'd you get that rib?
61776,Marge,stop that! we're guests in mr. burns!
61779,Marge,"although i must admit, they know where to stop."
61791,Marge,don't demolish along the way!
61798,Marge,i never stopped telling you.
61799,Marge,i'm calling a contractor.
61821,Marge,why can't everyone just play fair and... did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl?
61825,Marge,these other dishes look so pretty. and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners. i'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine. yes... medicine.
61826,Marge,baby ear medicine.
61828,Marge,"don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! now who's laughing? huh? huh? me! i'm laughing!"
61836,Marge,i look up to you...
61839,Marge,i don't deserve to win. i sabotaged all the other entries!
61840,Marge,"thanks, honey, for saving me from myself."
61843,Marge,"homer, the capital of kentucky is frankfort."
61845,Marge,he sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!
61847,Marge,plus your school-yard chums: martin and ralph!
61854,Marge,"lisa, wait..."
61862,Marge,those tadpoles are your lunch?
61879,Marge,"go home to your son, mrs. muntz. and try not to have intercourse on the way!"
61881,Marge,she's still your mother. come inside.
61882,Marge,can i get you a glass of milk?
61886,Marge,"nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?"
61887,Marge,i don't like the sound of that. tomorrow i'm taking you to doctor shapiro.
61891,Marge,perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
61895,Marge,she's from springfield! i knew her in high school.
61896,Marge,chloe sure turned out successful.
61897,Marge,"chloe, hi!"
61901,Marge,homer.
61910,Marge,that's ridiculous. no one's bowl smells... it's like christmas in aspen.
61919,Marge,chloe has such an amazing life. i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism.
61920,Marge,"yeah, i guess."
61922,Marge,how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility?
61923,Marge,"for your information, our electric dishwasher is on the fritz."
61938,Marge,shut up!
61943,Marge,nooooo!
61945,Marge,"oh, bart, honey i'm so sorry."
61952,Marge,what a delightful sprite.
61953,Marge,"homer, use your inside voice."
61955,Marge,i can't believe mr. burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party.
61958,Marge,"homer, that was apollo twelve!"
61963,Marge,"stow it, you two!"
61968,Marge,you gave the money to moe? how's he gonna pay us back?
61970,Marge,i would like it. you never come to my mother's.
61973,Marge,quit playing dumb.
61979,Marge,here's my new idea to sell both beer and grub / we will turn this filthy dive into a proper old-time british pub!
61980,Marge,"well, i was thinking more like drapes and a paint job, but your idea's good too."
61983,Marge,"get lost, rummy!"
62000,Marge,homer! how'd you get in here?
62007,Marge,you showed me you could be a really sweet guy. you can make a woman very happy some day.
62020,Marge,bart! how do you know these things?
62021,Marge,"lisa, could you pass the salad?"
62023,Marge,oh my. ned's next movie seems even bloodier than the last one.
62026,Marge,"well, i don't like this movie. and i'm going to boycott your financier... mr. burns."
62031,Marge,"time for homer's half-time show. get ready, frank."
62033,Marge,dissin'? do rappers still say that?
62034,Marge,baggy britches? loose-laced gym shoes? are you going to a rap performance?
62041,Marge,we have kidnapped your son. follow instructions and bart will not be harmed.
62047,Marge,"oh bart, i'm so glad you're okay."
62054,Marge,don't you push them! they've gotta work that out for themselves.
62055,Marge,straight.
62065,Marge,actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky... woman.
62066,Marge,"so veronica, what do you do?"
62070,Marge,of course. everyone should do whatever they want. take a bear to church! read a book with your feet! change your name to gooble-glop!
62078,Marge,"grampa, you're a greet grater! i mean a great greeter! now look who's senile!"
62082,Marge,"please lift this restraining order, judge harm. it's poking our family apart."
62087,Marge,"well, let's count that anyway."
62088,Marge,it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
62093,Marge,"homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform selma's life."
62098,Marge,"mind your manners, lisa."
62100,Marge,"homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest."
62101,Marge,"okay, one quick snuggle."
62105,Marge,is there anything more fun than a nice sunday drive?
62107,Marge,always nice to see him.
62113,Marge,"homie, if you die, i'm gonna have three kids to take care of. i want you to buy some life insurance. please?"
62119,Marge,go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
62121,Marge,we saved fifty cents on that purchase!
62128,Marge,"oh honey, i know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
62138,Marge,i'll let you sass me!
62141,Marge,what are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
62147,Marge,"well, you're not perfect either!"
62153,Marge,"""dear mom and dad: we don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the rv back to the dealer."" we've got to stop them."
62169,Marge,those shelbyvillians are maligning us all. i've never heard such mean-spirited hate-hoots.
62174,Marge,i wrote that letter.
62181,Marge,the prison snitch is killed! and that could be you! because you're the prison snitch!
62188,Marge,"kids, come down for your prom photo!"
62198,Marge,the one what?
62201,Marge,"homer, do something about this leak!"
62205,Marge,homer! i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
62209,Marge,"well, he better high-five our roof!"
62214,Marge,"oh, he must smell leftovers."
62219,Marge,it's after six -- he's not coming back. he's a lousy roofer and a flake!
62220,Marge,i don't want to hear any more about ray. tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
62226,Marge,geez louise...
62232,Marge,ray's not coming!
62233,Marge,"homer, i know where ray is."
62246,Marge,"oh, so i've been replaced by a machine?"
62249,Marge,his liver looks healthy.
62251,Marge,i talked to dr. hibbert today. he gave me a list of heart-smart foods.
62255,Marge,it's graffiti you can eatie!
62256,Marge,"they're not kidnappers! they're professionally trained child-snatchers, who are taking you to a maximum-security fat camp."
62257,Marge,forty-seven?
62258,Marge,"don't you mean ""tough love?"""
62263,Marge,but... you're still fat!
62266,Marge,i was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock hold-up. i don't know what to do for dinner now.
62276,Marge,"hey, kids! i scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
62280,Marge,"oh. i see. well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause i'm not driving you."
62291,Marge,the stars are falling to the earth!
62293,Marge,lisa's going! we're all going!
62295,Marge,homie... i'd better start dinner.
62297,Marge,you couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! now good night!
62301,Marge,a tv shark is not a babysitter!
62303,Marge,"honey, you can be anything you want to be."
62306,Marge,"ned, let me give you a little something for babysitting."
62316,Marge,"bart, i love you. but sometimes i don't love your choices. now we have to find another school for you."
62326,Marge,"forget it! and you know, i went to a catholic wedding once. the incense ruined my pantsuit!"
62331,Marge,i wish my family was with me.
62338,Marge,i just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.
62348,Marge,and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
62352,Marge,homer!
62354,Marge,"how could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!"
62378,Marge,i've bonded with him!
62379,Marge,where is he taking me?
62389,Marge,"i'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband."
62390,Marge,and i always will.
62405,Marge,isn't this lenny's house?
62408,Marge,"i don't care what apu was in a past life. in this life, he's a blabbermouth!"
62411,Marge,"homer, we're not really playing."
62418,Marge,four thousand dollars?!
62419,Marge,"don't worry, we're not evil spirits."
62426,Marge,something's wrong with maggie. we should get her to dr. hibbert. but i don't see him anywhere.
62430,Marge,"sweetie, i know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching!"
62439,Marge,"look, why don't you both stay and have one of my marge-aritas?"
62442,Marge,"you sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! homer!"
62451,Marge,"why did i marry that selfish jerk? i've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!"
62458,Marge,"young man, you go work on your spelling... or i'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!"
62459,Marge,"so, i got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
62460,Marge,where's my apology?
62466,Marge,"bart, wake up. i got that bike you wanted!"
62468,Marge,i thought he was in a coma!
62469,Marge,you already said that!
62473,Marge,david and bart just aren't working out. we have to do something.
62479,Marge,i should've known something was wrong when we got this week's tv guide.
62485,Marge,"lisa, do you think you could check on your father?"
62488,Marge,"homie, no! it's not street legal!"
62489,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
62497,Marge,"maggie, would you like to ride with me?"
62498,Marge,i'd love to! i'll be right... wait... are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
62500,Marge,puddle!
62503,Marge,"he was a singer in the sixties, like the archies and the banana splits."
62504,Marge,"i'm a little worried. this part of the county is unincorporated. just to be safe i'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone."
62508,Marge,no.
62511,Marge,no.
62512,Marge,yes.
62516,Marge,"you know, honey, i've really started to look forward to our little bike rides."
62517,Marge,"ooh, such respect! you could grow up to be a doorman!"
62518,Marge,uh... she died.
62524,Marge,just kidding. today's mom knows to seal 'em in mylar so you can never read them again. never ever again.
62534,Marge,"hello, bart. just so you know, i sold our bike."
62537,Marge,i'm singing a song with bart tonight.
62538,Marge,"well, now i'm not so sure about the bells on the painter's pants."
62563,Marge,i'm going out for some air.
62564,Marge,i guess i'm not meant to have friends.
62569,Marge,"for your information, i am now a junior member of the cheery red tomatoes."
62570,Marge,"oh, you guys make everything fun."
62572,Marge,how cute. he tried to stay up but he just couldn't make it.
62575,Marge,i feel a happiness i've never felt. i not only have friends... i have a hat to prove it.
62578,Marge,"i'm sorry, i can't steal. not even from mr. burns."
62580,Marge,"okay, okay, okay, i'm in!"
62581,Marge,oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
62583,Marge,i thought you liked my hair.
62587,Marge,"wow, this is special."
62588,Marge,"ooh, marriage!"
62589,Marge,"gee, i wish we could explore a little more of italy."
62592,Marge,excuse me... mister mayor... they say you speak english?
62594,Marge,"bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?"
62597,Marge,uh... well...
62601,Marge,he deserves to be hailed at this wing ding.
62612,Marge,i've still gotta bake my christmas pie!
62615,Marge,"come on, we're going to that store! before the next commercial makes me do something else."
62622,Marge,"i'm trapped -- like the ""l"" in a b.l.t.!"
62624,Marge,hoo boy.
62632,Marge,"homer, look what this is doing to grampa. we have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
62633,Marge,oh god.
62635,Marge,"well, then you think of something!"
62640,Marge,"you know, your father saved every book report he ever wrote. and every one was stuart little!"
62648,Marge,bag or keister?
62657,Marge,"well, tell your regular bully. he won't like it one bit."
62659,Marge,"aw, homie."
62673,Marge,"well, we better start looking."
62675,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, there's one thing i don't understand here."
62677,Marge,huh? / you knew about the coins? / the coins are down here? / etc.
62678,Marge,"homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?"
62680,Marge,how can you take it? we haven't found it.
62684,Marge,"mr. burns, isn't it more important that you got a child to smile at you?"
62689,Marge,how can you be sure?
62705,Marge,homer! we're not in high school.
62713,Marge,i could never think something that horrible.
62720,Marge,"excuse me, mrs. toot, i need to talk to you mother to mother."
62725,Marge,maybe he's getting married!
62728,Marge,"homie, i've been thinking. we have been using this tv for a long time. so i entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen tv."
62729,Marge,now i really hope we win that contest.
62731,Marge,"well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
62737,Marge,how was that?
62751,Marge,"well, i liked the genie part. that was fun."
62754,Marge,i sure would! let me just get us some iced tea.
62759,Marge,what an odd thing for a man who's not interested in me to do.
62762,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i love homer."
62767,Marge,lisa! what are you doing in the nutmeg state?
62769,Marge,me too.
62771,Marge,"yeah, whatever."
62775,Marge,homer do great!
54591,Marge,"homer, i really don't want to feed you."
54592,Marge,video games and too much beer. you sure know how to show a girl a good time.
62789,Marge,"homie, stop! you're not a god!"
54598,Marge,this place is just like the brochure... autumn leaves...bull sessions...
54599,Marge,"homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways! did you know that every u.s. president has been a straight white man?"
62793,Marge,red lobster?
62794,Marge,"hurry, my little puritans -- we must flee england and its insufficiently puritanical ways."
62795,Marge,do you have your shipboard entertainments?
54604,Marge,professor august says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.
54606,Marge,are the lasers supposed to burn you?
54612,Marge,i sure am! i want your knowledge inside me!
62804,Marge,it's really more of an amiable concordance.
62810,Marge,look!
54619,Marge,he loves me so much... after what i did to him!
62817,Marge,what a fascinating cross-section of humanity! you've got the lonely but loveable loser...
54627,Marge,"no, i'm going to be an astronaut."
54628,Marge,why not?
62821,Marge,"oh, homie, you did it!"
54631,Marge,"i don't want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. i have my own dreams and i can't live them with you."
62824,Marge,all this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. women are as smart as men.
54633,Marge,fraternity pledges in their beanies...
54634,Marge,i think i'm gonna like it here.
62825,Marge,"why, a woman invented liquid paper."
54638,Marge,"thank you, professor august."
62837,Marge,"homer, this says i've won homemaker magazine's ""clean for a day"" contest!"
62839,Marge,cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.
54651,Marge,no you don't!
54653,Marge,my husband... and my best friend!
62845,Marge,"et tu, zud?"
62851,Marge,but you're so much more... ravaged than i am.
54661,Marge,"excuse me, is this room one-oh-six?"
62855,Marge,you strangle your child?
54664,Marge,you're an idiot.
54665,Marge,you are the first person who ever said that!
62857,Marge,why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
62859,Marge,i know that sound!
54673,Marge,won't the other homer be a problem?
62865,Marge,"nope. i'm sorry, admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
54677,Marge,let's not fight anymore. let's just make him decide between us.
62869,Marge,what's snuggling?
62875,Marge,mr. simpson?
62878,Marge,no! i'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
54691,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
62885,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
54694,Marge,duffman?
54695,Marge,diamonds! i still can't believe he gave me diamonds!
54696,Marge,"freeze him out. it's cold in marge's doghouse, baby."
62888,Marge,"you've been drinking today, haven't you?"
62889,Marge,i think he's a male gay.
54703,Marge,"ooh, you'd better be careful. the purpose of this game is to make friends. you don't make friends by winning."
62897,Marge,"i may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. and that means a lot to a woman."
62915,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
62916,Marge,"well, i think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing. maybe they could learn from each other."
54726,Marge,"homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
54729,Marge,oh! they're here! how does everything look?
62922,Marge,"lisa, i think i have a way to help you at the trial today."
62923,Marge,"honey, i appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
62926,Marge,"thank you, honey, for opening my eyes."
62928,Marge,that was two seasons ago!
62930,Marge,she's married to buck mitchell! i bet that's why she's here tonight honoring america!
54746,Marge,hello. i'm mrs. simpson.
54752,Marge,"all right. all right. goodbye, children. and behave yourselves."
54754,Marge,"hello, reverend. we're glad we could come. oh, hello helen."
54757,Marge,"he forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
54759,Marge,"... he drinks out of the carton. he never changes the baby. when he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. i guess that's it. oh no. wait. he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. that's all i can think of right now. i guess you're all tired and i want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
62954,Marge,"listen, bub. we are out of the marriage counseling business. and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. but not me, 'cause i think they're disgusting."
54763,Marge,sure.
62955,Marge,then i guess you'll do it without me.
62963,Marge,cut that out!
62964,Marge,weren't you just tied up in the blimp?
62970,Marge,"okay, just one more kid to pick up."
62973,Marge,"we'd love to! you know, i've never met your wife."
62976,Marge,must have cost a fortune.
62980,Marge,"homer, where did you get that truck?"
54790,Marge,"lisa, we did the best we could... what's a zebu?"
62983,Marge,someone poisoned these meatballs. homer...?
54794,Marge,"sixteen permanent, eight baby."
62989,Marge,"homie, look -- he's enjoying it."
62990,Marge,why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
54802,Marge,the meaning of what?
54810,Marge,"homer, i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
63003,Marge,"empathy means you're looking at lisa, and feeling what she feels. your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. and now..."
54813,Marge,"oh, my! it's mr. burns."
63009,Marge,"well, i like the idea of you as a handyman... and i love the idea of you reading!"
54819,Marge,but it certainly was a memorable few days!
63011,Marge,someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy.
54822,Marge,"bart, i asked you to watch your sister!"
63016,Marge,"oh, the floorboard broke my nightstand."
54828,Marge,oh my god! mother was right.
54829,Marge,i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
54831,Marge,crazy house!
54834,Marge,"oh, homie."
63026,Marge,"a dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more!"
54836,Marge,"no, it is not the truth, homer. it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
63028,Marge,i help more than you might think.
63029,Marge,"this is shirley. yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. goodbye!"
63030,Marge,"homie... i think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. i mean, look at your t-shirt!"
54843,Marge,"bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
54844,Marge,"how's it going, honey?"
63036,Marge,darn these counter-sunk molly clamps!
63038,Marge,perfect.
54850,Marge,"wow, the president's bathroom!"
54852,Marge,"i know, honey, but just sit still."
54854,Marge,imprisoned congressman becomes born-again christian.
63046,Marge,how could you eat that goo? you don't know what galaxy it's from!
63050,Marge,the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
54862,Marge,don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
54871,Marge,homer? homer!
54877,Marge,"oh, bart. why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
54886,Marge,"hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
63079,Marge,that's so wasteful.
54888,Marge,i think that game is too old for her. why don't you go play with milhouse?
54889,Marge,you mean you still haven't made up with him?
63083,Marge,my lega-she!
63084,Marge,i'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
54893,Marge,"well, i knew his mother would come to her senses.."
54894,Marge,what makes you think i did it?
54898,Marge,"oh, dear. this is the fifth time he's cancelled. how can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
54899,Marge,"well, thank you for calling. good-bye."
54900,Marge,"sweetie, i'm sorry, but krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
54901,Marge,"bart, wipe your feet."
63090,Marge,really? you think people would be kent-rested in me?
63091,Marge,"why did cavemen paint on walls? why do you scratch your name on tupperware? so when you die, something's left behind that says, ""i was here. i mattered. that's my tupperware."""
63094,Marge,well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
54912,Marge,"ugghh, homer. where did you get that ugly thing?"
54915,Marge,"ooh, a new pacifier."
63107,Marge,"homie, i realized that my most enduring creation is the life i've sculpted with you."
54917,Marge,"oh homer, this is awful."
63108,Marge,now i know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
63111,Marge,you're the worst husband in the world!
63115,Marge,"dear lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy."
63117,Marge,i'll whack you with the whole salad set if you don't start thinking about others! you are going to that party.
54926,Marge,he's been gone for two days.
54927,Marge,"did you have a nightmare, homie?"
54933,Marge,"don't worry, he'll be here."
63126,Marge,why don't you have dinner with us tonight?
63134,Marge,"listen, uh, gil... i sort of thought... ya know, you'd be on your way by now."
63136,Marge,i guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
54946,Marge,those aren't even words!
63138,Marge,yes. one. involving you.
54952,Marge,then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
63144,Marge,"and that's why i have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even gil!"
63145,Marge,uh... hm...
63151,Marge,that photoshopping freak!
63160,Marge,i'll tell you what. we're going to scottsdale!
54969,Marge,who's using the power tools?
63165,Marge,"listen, bub. i have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
54975,Marge,"question one: ""name one of your child's friends..."""
63167,Marge,no!!!
63169,Marge,we're not gonna make it!
54979,Marge,"that's your hero. ""name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
54983,Marge,"now, don't pout."
63176,Marge,"homer, that's too much sugar!"
54988,Marge,"honey, what's wrong?"
63181,Marge,homer! you made an effort!
54993,Marge,"bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
54996,Marge,bart! bart! turn to the financial channel! aunt patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
54997,Marge,your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
63191,Marge,homer!
55004,Marge,look at all those worried faces -- except for lenny. he looks great.
63196,Marge,"well, let me tell you a story about a time revenge brought only unhappiness and misery. it happened many years ago in paris--"
55010,Marge,"hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
55015,Marge,"okay, let's see... ""ahoy maties! if the water turns blue, a baby for you. if purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
55018,Marge,"well, i have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix i did with the other kids."
63212,Marge,hoo-boy.
55023,Marge,"homer, do you ever think about the future?"
55024,Marge,"no, i mean how you plan to earn a living. i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
55028,Marge,our song.
63220,Marge,i did!
55031,Marge,"homer, maybe it's the champale talking, but i think you're pretty sexy."
63223,Marge,then that must be it.
55033,Marge,"i need you to drive me to the doctor, homer."
63224,Marge,stop the wedding!
55037,Marge,what card?
63229,Marge,"oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
63232,Marge,we let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
63235,Marge,now you can cut!
63237,Marge,"oh, homie! you make each eight-year interval better than the last!"
55046,Marge,marcus?
55048,Marge,there certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
55051,Marge,marge.
55053,Marge,what a perfect day.
55056,Marge,did you get the job?
55057,Marge,"oh, homie. hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking."
55058,Marge,"""fourth notice""... ""90 days overdue""... ""we break thumbs""... homer, what are we going to do?"
63250,Marge,nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. it'll be like new!
55061,Marge,homer ?!
63258,Marge,nothing solves everything forever like a wedding.
55067,Marge,any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
63259,Marge,"oh, i don't know, he might come home any minute."
63260,Marge,i don't think we're doing this right.
55071,Marge,"no, because i love you."
55072,Marge,come home soon.
63268,Marge,our new photos are back!
55078,Marge,how could he? he's only ten minutes old.
63270,Marge,bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
63274,Marge,"well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
63278,Marge,sideshow mel is in a custody battle? and it's turning bitter?
55089,Marge,"oh, bart."
55093,Marge,"well, why don't you get it?"
63285,Marge,sunny?
63287,Marge,"paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! kids, get in the car! we're going to pennsylvania!"
55099,Marge,"actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums--"
63293,Marge,"i sent everyone i know an e-card for st. patrick's day... but not one person wrote me back! maybe if i hit ""refresh""..."
63296,Marge,"for amusement only... ""credit card information may be sold to korean gangsters""..."
63297,Marge,let's see -- what kind of goofy goobly should i be?
63299,Marge,who designed this character? probably a man...
63300,Marge,"i can make her look any way i want -- let's see... hair: blue, shoes: sensible, body type: olive oyl."
55109,Marge,hmm...
63301,Marge,face: other.
63305,Marge,what are you kids doing up so late?
55117,Marge,"oh bart, you could use some new underwear too."
55119,Marge,"well, we had fun too. right now, bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
55123,Marge,"ooh, perfume. meryl streep's ""versatility."""
55124,Marge,"homer, those are very thoughtful presents. but you have to tell me where you got the money from."
55125,Marge,"i promise i will get mad, because i always do when you make me promise i won't."
55126,Marge,homer!
55127,Marge,i did not! i promised i would get mad! she's an eight-year-old girl.
55130,Marge,you're a very selfish man.
63329,Marge,"well, maybe if you go..."
55144,Marge,ahhh!!
55146,Marge,homer? is that you?
55160,Marge,whenever she needs it.
55161,Marge,don't.
63355,Marge,"maggie. honey, this is for your own good. growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy."
55165,Marge,uh-huh.
63361,Marge,"last night, someone ate all the food in the fridge."
55171,Marge,i missed you too.
63363,Marge,it was you.
63366,Marge,"just come back alive, okay?"
55178,Marge,i am not!
63370,Marge,"well, i guess every boy should see his father as a hero."
55181,Marge,of course i saved them.
63373,Marge,"you should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. kids, get in here and show your father the faces!"
63374,Marge,you make them stop -- by doing the right thing.
63375,Marge,"that's it, buster -- you just bought yourself ten minutes watching that man make a wagon wheel."
63376,Marge,this winning cornucopia is magnificent.
63380,Marge,maybe we should split up.
63382,Marge,i was talking about--
63384,Marge,now there must be a way out!
63385,Marge,eat some corn!
63395,Marge,the school's having a bake sale today! at three o'clock!
55209,Marge,like snuggling...
63401,Marge,"now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
55211,Marge,"oh, dear."
63404,Marge,my cake!
63406,Marge,"raisin cake! who wants raisin cake? don't worry, it's not too moist!"
55224,Marge,"oh... oh... unng... oh, bart."
63417,Marge,"""school bus..."" ""bart and lisa?"" bart and lisa are almost home from school! and we have a dentist's appointment at three o'clock! thanks, maggie!"
63418,Marge,it won't start!
55229,Marge,bart's grades are up a little this term. but lisa's are way down.
55231,Marge,"no, maggie!"
55232,Marge,but we never ever...
63423,Marge,my quads! every stride is a nightmare!
63424,Marge,oops.
55235,Marge,you can still win some money if you have five out of six.
55237,Marge,"oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
63430,Marge,don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
55241,Marge,"oh, honey. seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. we really can't afford this operation."
55242,Marge,i know you're upset --
63434,Marge,shake it! shake it!
63436,Marge,"i invited him to stay with us for a few days. his career is ruined, and i was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide."
55246,Marge,i've found a way we can pay for the operation.
55247,Marge,"no. i'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
63439,Marge,"homer, you smell like chicago. did you fly there on a commercial airline?"
63442,Marge,this is colby krause. i hired him to help you improve your life. he'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
63446,Marge,hello?
55255,Marge,what's that?
55256,Marge,"oh no! those are my numbers! if it wasn't for that dog, i would've won!"
63450,Marge,"sweetheart, what do you mean?"
55259,Marge,the dog will get out!
63451,Marge,what was that?
55261,Marge,not one that i want the public to see.
55266,Marge,"so, what are we going to see?"
63460,Marge,griddler on the roof? thank god it's fried eggs? luftwaffle's?
63465,Marge,and you can cut your own meat!
55279,Marge,"i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
55280,Marge,homer! where did you get that suit?
55281,Marge,was it lurleen?
63477,Marge,homie... i miss our alone time. i miss you.
55287,Marge,your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. and you did it at the county fair last year. remember?
63480,Marge,"sir, thank you for saving us. do you want to come in for coffee?"
63482,Marge,"that's a great idea! to celebrate, i'll go whip us up some chex mix pie."
63484,Marge,that's nice!
55295,Marge,"just so you know, while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, maggie cut her first tooth."
55297,Marge,"kids, will you come in here?"
55299,Marge,i'll love you for the rest of my life.
63491,Marge,oh but wednesday's not good for me.
63494,Marge,"goodnight, maggie."
63496,Marge,"all right, i'll make you another bottle."
55305,Marge,i'm just not.
63497,Marge,"maggie's so clingy! homer, hold her while i pour the milk!"
63499,Marge,"if you're so smart, you do it!"
55309,Marge,"now, about your wedding dress. i'm not sure how to put this..."
55317,Marge,i guess you're just too young to understand.
63513,Marge,"well, no one's disputing that."
63516,Marge,"homer, you do know what tomorrow is."
55325,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking about what bart said. if he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should buy him a guitar."
63517,Marge,bart?
55330,Marge,what conversation?
63524,Marge,are you sure? hugs are dru--
63528,Marge,point zero eight sober.
63530,Marge,deal.
55340,Marge,"but homer, we're the only family he's got..."
63535,Marge,"goodbye, my love!"
55346,Marge,better give me the weight loss tape.
55347,Marge,"homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
55349,Marge,milhouse?
63546,Marge,"oh my, it's five o'clock! i missed visiting hours."
55355,Marge,oh.
63547,Marge,perfect!
63548,Marge,"look, lisa. i put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
55359,Marge,"this chair is $2,000. we could buy a whole living room set for that."
63554,Marge,"don't give up hope, johnny!"
55363,Marge,"homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
55365,Marge,maybe we should play another game.
55366,Marge,that was your idea.
63559,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
55374,Marge,"don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. he is your brother."
63569,Marge,"you see, the problem is, we've grown apart."
55380,Marge,"oh, i'm going to miss this."
63572,Marge,and you have fun at your ridiculous event.
63574,Marge,you just can't get russian gangster blood out. must be something they eat.
63586,Marge,i'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
63590,Marge,we can't have a space creature living in our house.
55406,Marge,i don't think so.
63604,Marge,"and until they do, you can stay here."
55413,Marge,"oh, well. be a good girl, maggie."
55416,Marge,"homer, can you run some lines with me?"
55418,Marge,"i'm sorry, llewellyn. i just... i just don't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley's face. couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
63610,Marge,"i'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
63611,Marge,"oh homie, i'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me."
63615,Marge,never compare yourself to a standee.
55424,Marge,the play's tomorrow night. ah've got to stay in character.
55426,Marge,"that reahlly doesn't help, baht."
63620,Marge,i wish there was a gym for us regular ladies.
63621,Marge,"""rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
55433,Marge,why can't you be a little more supportive?
63627,Marge,that's okay. i don't care that you don't care. go watch your thing.
63628,Marge,i sure am!
55439,Marge,"come here. i want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your mouth."
55441,Marge,now here's a tip from blanche you won't regret...
55444,Marge,blanche.
63636,Marge,let me get a good look at you!
63637,Marge,what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate?
63639,Marge,and i'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
63643,Marge,the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. and i said no. but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love.
55452,Marge,come on. we're going to be late.
55454,Marge,what!? what would help!?
63649,Marge,"oh tivo remote, you've changed my life."
55458,Marge,"lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. please show him the error of his ways."
63656,Marge,impossible! their commercial featured a talking frog.
55469,Marge,"yes, the lesson is..."
55471,Marge,we have one at home. you never use it.
55475,Marge,"homer, lisa's already sensitive about her looks. this is the last thing she needs."
55479,Marge,"oh, i don't know that she's as attractive as jack nicklaus..."
55483,Marge,who's watching the kwik-e-mart?
63678,Marge,i'm just really worried about your weight. bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
63680,Marge,this election is on every channel.
55489,Marge,oh my god.
55490,Marge,"your doll is trying to kill my husband!... yes, i'll hold."
55493,Marge,am i going too?
55496,Marge,"you keep your hands to yourself, mister."
63690,Marge,but our happiness was about to unravel just like kevin costner's career: because of the postman.
55499,Marge,"you know, you look a little flushed. maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people."
55500,Marge,he's not dead.
55501,Marge,"don't worry, homie. i'll take care of you."
63692,Marge,"homer's perfect for me! just look at this note: ""i miss you."" aww..."
55503,Marge,"now kids, instead of candy, i thought i'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits."
63696,Marge,"homer, stop!"
55512,Marge,is it 37?
55515,Marge,"well, i'm sorry... i'm sure bart doesn't really mean to be bad."
55517,Marge,i really don't see how this helps bart.
55524,Marge,now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about. our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
55526,Marge,"no, no, no."
55531,Marge,why are you letting him do this?
55532,Marge,well punish him!
55533,Marge,how could you let this happen?
55536,Marge,earl warren wasn't a stripper.
55539,Marge,"homer, we'd like to talk to you."
63735,Marge,"there were so many things i wanted to do in life that i never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. but the thing i really wanted to be, ever since i was little, was a ballerina!"
55544,Marge,did you notice how slanted he looked?
55546,Marge,we have to do something...
55548,Marge,"hmm, i think you have to keep your job too."
55552,Marge,"well, lisa, i finished my resume."
63745,Marge,teach?
63748,Marge,"well, the important thing is, someday i'll be watching my little marge dancing at lincoln center."
63750,Marge,"oh homie, i've been so happy lately. i'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! now what did you want to say to me?"
55559,Marge,what?
55563,Marge,i'll just be a minute. i have to finish this paperwork.
55564,Marge,"but, where does it go?"
55572,Marge,"well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
55574,Marge,here's your money.
55577,Marge,my husband will be so excited.
63770,Marge,i made that hug happen!
63774,Marge,and major marge!
63775,Marge,"lurleen, you're giving your dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself. stop getting your self-esteem from the men in your life."
55585,Marge,gimme that.
55587,Marge,"oh, you speak so politely to adults."
63780,Marge,"well, you're very welcome, lurleen. of all the women who've hit on homer over the years, you're my favorite."
55589,Marge,"... and finally, moe's tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""welcome to springfield."""
55592,Marge,"hm, what about the bread? does that have much fish in it?"
63785,Marge,"honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars."
55601,Marge,are you sure...?
63793,Marge,roger that.
55613,Marge,"i was wrong about you buying that truck. i'm very proud of you, mr. plow. ."
63805,Marge,we never get more than one move into this game.
55618,Marge,"maggie, can you say ba-ba? can you say ma-ma?"
55619,Marge,bart!
63810,Marge,no more simpsons movies! one was plenty!
63812,Marge,"we listened to music radio in the car... and, since you kids behaved, we'll pick one fun thing to do here."
63813,Marge,"for once, we'll do what maggie wants."
55626,Marge,"well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: ms. pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young joe piscopo taught us how to laugh. before lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the lower east side of springfield."
55628,Marge,then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
55630,Marge,dennis... brad... mavis... brad...
55632,Marge,no.
63825,Marge,"maggie, that's the same garry that filmed your birthday party. remember, he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight."
55634,Marge,"hear that, bart? you're going to have a little brother or sister to play with!"
55635,Marge,who did this?
63828,Marge,"my purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
55640,Marge,"that afternoon, we left bart with my sisters and went househunting."
55645,Marge,just imagine what we can do with this place.
55646,Marge,"anyway, bart had just entered the ""terrible twos."""
55650,Marge,homie... i think the baby's coming.
63843,Marge,cakes!
63846,Marge,"well, um, thanks, but i've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
55655,Marge,here she is!
55656,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart, you're too little."
55657,Marge,homer!
55659,Marge,"well, i'm not surprised. lisa's crazy about you. she thinks you hung the moon."
55660,Marge,bart! don't write on the rug!
63852,Marge,"oh, homie. i got you something too."
63854,Marge,how dare you?!
55665,Marge,here you go.
63861,Marge,"sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. as it is, i'm buying frozen peas on installments."
63867,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. leary. sometimes it's hard to be a parent."
55676,Marge,how?
63872,Marge,"well, sweetie... i know i said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, i think it's important that we're in touch."
55685,Marge,"well, i think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
63877,Marge,bartholomew j. simpson!
63880,Marge,it shows you care.
55689,Marge,well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in.
55691,Marge,and those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
55693,Marge,i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street.
55695,Marge,"your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
55697,Marge,it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
63889,Marge,those walls do look safe.
55699,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
63891,Marge,so i can't always be there for bart. he's got to learn to take care of himself.
63899,Marge,bart simpson! did you just spray water on me?!
63901,Marge,why can't our son just behave?
55712,Marge,"no, he's a scientist."
63906,Marge,"okay, then videogames."
55717,Marge,the funeral's in little neck falls. looks like we'll have to go to duff gardens another time.
63910,Marge,maybe he's going through... certain changes.
63912,Marge,"bart, honey, i saw you didn't like your dinner, so i thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off."
55723,Marge,what are you kids playing?
63916,Marge,"now, we tuck in the tummy, the tushy and the tootsies."
63917,Marge,"homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers. they don't look like the stabby kind."
63919,Marge,aw... young love.
55728,Marge,"a hundred and one frozen pops. a nobel prize winner... an nba all-star... ooh, one of the ""sweathogs!"""
63921,Marge,i don't know...
63922,Marge,"well, we thought we'd wait a little while."
55731,Marge,have you been eating that sandwich again?
63923,Marge,"um, how long have you two been married?"
63924,Marge,"homer simpson, i would be delighted not to marry you."
55743,Marge,"you know, i rented another tape... in case you felt better."
55744,Marge,with norman fell as zeus!
55745,Marge,i can't. the beans'll burn.
63938,Marge,pumps are shoes! that explains a lot.
63944,Marge,"we sure did. rekindle, rekindle... okay, let's go."
63945,Marge,fine. but i don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
63948,Marge,homie?
55762,Marge,"honey, honey, i'd tell this boy that you're very flattered, but you're just not ready for this kind of thing."
63958,Marge,"homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! it's in us! now take my hand!"
55767,Marge,what's so funny?
55770,Marge,"have a good day at work, honey."
63963,Marge,"another religion? you know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when you go to college and get a jewish boyfriend."
55774,Marge,do you ever hide beer around the house?
55779,Marge,"please, homie, i know you can do this."
55781,Marge,"bart, could you go get the cupcakes?"
55783,Marge,you've never looked better.
55784,Marge,"i'm proud of you, homie."
63978,Marge,you're teaching bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
63980,Marge,"homer, i'm sure you didn't see anything. go to sleep."
55789,Marge,la la la la la la... la...
63983,Marge,never being a grandmother?
63986,Marge,now take it off before they sting you!
55795,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55796,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55798,Marge,lisa needs braces.
63995,Marge,"okay, you two. lights out."
63996,Marge,lisa? do you want to be best friends?
55810,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
64009,Marge,"bart simpson, age three."
55831,Marge,and you're a nuclear technician?
64025,Marge,i see a hair.
64029,Marge,only if it lasts forever.
55839,Marge,shhhh.
64031,Marge,you used protection. we never had any!
55841,Marge,"that's wonderful, homie!"
64033,Marge,"homie, please come inside."
55844,Marge,bart. get dressed for school. i expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.
55847,Marge,i'm your new teacher. my name is mrs. simpson.
55849,Marge,oooh!
55850,Marge,oooh! oooooh! oooooooh!
55851,Marge,"bart, i'd like you to read this copy of ""johnny tremain."" it's a book i read as a girl."
55855,Marge,slow... then fast.
55856,Marge,ninety-eight point six. you're fine.
64047,Marge,oh my god! oh my god! we're totally liable!
64051,Marge,"homie, do you know anything about this?"
55862,Marge,"uh... no, i-i guess i didn't."
64055,Marge,i worked so hard to make this house into a home. and now somebody else is just going to take it.
55865,Marge,is that bad?
64057,Marge,"i know i shouldn't get too attached to a building, but... that's where lisa took her first step... the kids' height...homer's weight..."
55869,Marge,now you kids be good while mother's in prison.
64061,Marge,"homie, the faucet won't stop leaking."
55875,Marge,well... once.
55876,Marge,"homer, i don't think this fish is quite dead yet."
64068,Marge,"no, no. i'm just happy i can finally serve this cake."
55882,Marge,i hope you find somebody.
55884,Marge,"uh, it's beautiful."
64076,Marge,there'll be another one in north yemen in 2027.
64078,Marge,it's beautiful!
55888,Marge,"homer, you're going to be famous!"
55890,Marge,with your father on the road all the time i tried to compensate for his absence...
55892,Marge,"you got a letter too, bart."
55893,Marge,hmm. this one's done in different handwriting.
64084,Marge,hm. you're not usually this greedy.
64091,Marge,a mother knows!
64092,Marge,"maggie, you're coming home with me!"
64097,Marge,"i'm sorry for fibbing. tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home."
64098,Marge,"ooh, look! a welcome mat that tells you your weight!"
55910,Marge,"homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
55911,Marge,"you don't know, do you?"
55916,Marge,"oh, for the love of..."
64109,Marge,"the giant's causeway is the result of a volcanic eruption. well kids, isn't that an informational fact? kids?"
55921,Marge,"and i learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
55923,Marge,what's wrong?
64115,Marge,"so homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."
64118,Marge,who are you calling an old lady?
64120,Marge,this isn't the most romantic place to get married.
64122,Marge,"whatever you say, ""lance."""
55937,Marge,"it's an ending, that's enough."
64129,Marge,we'll take lemon.
55940,Marge,homer?! did you eat that donut?
64135,Marge,i can't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates! 'cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
64136,Marge,because their r.s.v.p. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
64138,Marge,"okay, okay, everyone back off! i want to see myself."
55952,Marge,"homer, we gotta do something! today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!"
64147,Marge,i can't believe homer left me at the altar.
55957,Marge,marge simpson.
64151,Marge,i'm just happy you're back. now let's get that chain off you.
64152,Marge,"oh, i've missed your nonsense."
64154,Marge,just what i always wanted.
64156,Marge,you're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
55970,Marge,thank you. why?
64165,Marge,you've been spending so much time with her.
55975,Marge,"homer, please. you know it's hard for me to make friends."
64167,Marge,i wasn't talking to you.
64178,Marge,almost there...
55992,Marge,"phht, it's only midnight. come on, i know a place."
64185,Marge,"no it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!"
64187,Marge,try these beets. i boiled all the red out.
64190,Marge,am i?
64191,Marge,blabby's gonna build an abbey. groovy.
64192,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
56003,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
56008,Marge,my god! that must be every policeman in springfield!
56009,Marge,"ruth, that's a lot of hooey. it's not over until it's over."
64205,Marge,that's an awfully crowded classroom.
64206,Marge,the only person getting an education here today was me! in how bad it is!
64207,Marge,i want my kids in a decent school!
56019,Marge,"homer, this is terrible!"
64212,Marge,it's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
56021,Marge,that's not true.
56025,Marge,no. i'm fine. i'm going to my sisters' now.
56026,Marge,i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
64218,Marge,let's go.
56037,Marge,his name is bart.
64229,Marge,without me? how'd you get there?
56040,Marge,that's not fair. the lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
64233,Marge,hurry! get out the kids' stuff!
64234,Marge,yeah. a house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
56044,Marge,"i know you think the junior campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
64236,Marge,my daughter's here for her first mani-pedi.
64240,Marge,four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run.
56050,Marge,oh that's sweet. guess what. there's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. i got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
64245,Marge,that's nice.
56054,Marge,"actually, i think it might really help our economy."
64249,Marge,"out, damn'd spot! out, i say!"
64250,Marge,i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
56061,Marge,i was for the casino!
56070,Marge,what?!
64273,Marge,he would not let maggie's creativity flower:
56085,Marge,homer! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom.
56087,Marge,you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar... cute.
64282,Marge,"there's less of you to love, but i love you even more."
64287,Marge,"i'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute, but i'm worried about mrs. krabappel."
56098,Marge,"i don't know, bart. you're only ten."
56102,Marge,the best performance of your life?
56104,Marge,"yes, he's raking leaves."
64299,Marge,uh-huh...
56108,Marge,"apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard."
64304,Marge,"call me a killjoy, but i think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should be able to enjoy it."
64310,Marge,"at least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. but in this sport they don't put anything in anything. and if they did, i wouldn't want to see it!"
56120,Marge,"i understand, honey. when i was your age there was a..."
64313,Marge,that flattens my soda pop! you're on!
64314,Marge,"thank you, homie."
56125,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
64320,Marge,"""eat, pray, love."""
56130,Marge,"homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut. you didn't even know how to use a touchtone. but i still respected you, and i always will, no matter what."
56131,Marge,"homer, you already dialed."
64330,Marge,"i'd just like to say one thing. i only agreed to this fight because i wanted to stop the violence. and sure i got into great shape and met some fun people, but i ended up discovering my own dark side. so from now on, the only thing i'm fighting is this cold i'm coming down with."
64331,Marge,"well, i wish somebody would've stuck around to hear it."
64332,Marge,where did they all go?
64334,Marge,bart ate a tainted burger!
56143,Marge,"homer, that's our wedding photo."
56148,Marge,"but, why would the advisory board give us bad advice?"
64341,Marge,"homie, where have you been?"
64343,Marge,let us in. we have the chosen one!
56155,Marge,fine.
64352,Marge,i'm still hoping homie will come back.
56161,Marge,there! isn't that a lot better? now you can do whatever you want. but don't mess up the house.
64355,Marge,"oh my god, i've never felt so... uncreeped-out by you!"
64356,Marge,i guess it is time to move on...
56169,Marge,oh my lord!
64363,Marge,"i am! the female tiger woods of the nineteen-thirties, babe didrikson zaharias."
64364,Marge,fine. i'll take off one glove.
56182,Marge,"no. you know, bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
64374,Marge,how 'bout a little marge madness?
64376,Marge,"tomorrow, my love."
56189,Marge,what about peter fonda?
64386,Marge,last night was the making it up to me! the most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
56195,Marge,"i'm not sure if i'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. how would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
56196,Marge,why don't you bring this potato? it's pretty big.
64387,Marge,i can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
64388,Marge,"ned, to make up for what happened, i want to invite you and the boys over to dinner tomorrow night."
64391,Marge,i guess it'll just be dinner for four.
64402,Marge,"boy, that was worth the wait."
56211,Marge,everybody get ready! here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
64403,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, kids. we lost the batteries for that."
64404,Marge,"oh, darn, the batteries are dead."
56219,Marge,"you know, mom, you and abe have a lot in common. umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam."
56220,Marge,"well, i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
64412,Marge,oh what a lovely evening.
64413,Marge,maybe we could do both.
64415,Marge,"homer simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our dvd player."
56224,Marge,"uh... i love ya, mom!"
56225,Marge,i love ya! i love ya! i love ya!
56226,Marge,"i love ya! i love ya! i love ya! i love ya, mom! gotta go!"
56238,Marge,whatever do you mean? i don't dye my hair...
64432,Marge,what a nice note!
56241,Marge,"homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class."
56246,Marge,"oh, well that will be..."
56250,Marge,all right. okay. everybody out!
64442,Marge,potato!
64444,Marge,let's call the whole thing off...icially onnnnn!
56253,Marge,get out!
64445,Marge,and toast... valerie and daaaaave!
64448,Marge,you like potato... you like tomato...
56258,Marge,"oh my. i'm very flattered, but i'm not really interested."
64457,Marge,oh thank god you're okay!
56267,Marge,"homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. although i must say, it's certainly refreshing."
56269,Marge,is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in?
56272,Marge,"oh, look. there's bart. wave to him."
56273,Marge,"hmm, maybe we should spend more time with bart. he's becoming isolated and weird."
56276,Marge,"my, these seas are certainly heaving."
64468,Marge,so we're right back where we used to be.
56282,Marge,lisa! i am nice.
64475,Marge,really? how romantic?
56285,Marge,"well, you'll always be number one to me..."
56286,Marge,"uh... i meant, my number one girl."
64478,Marge,it's not the same.
56288,Marge,"honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. no matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. i always thought i had the tallest hair. but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes."
64484,Marge,"so we'd just thrown a biter, and homer said to kick harder off the hack. so i did... and i almost fouled the hog line!"
56307,Marge,i mean romance not love.
56310,Marge,all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
56311,Marge,"no, no, no. no, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
64507,Marge,see. all good.
64509,Marge,"read a little more, honey."
56318,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
56319,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
56326,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
56327,Marge,oh!
56331,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
64524,Marge,"i'm french, not you."
64527,Marge,"bart, pants."
64528,Marge,yup. one-oh-three on the dot. you're stayin' home.
64532,Marge,"it's okay, bart. just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies."
64536,Marge,there's no such thing as prayer blocks!
56345,Marge,of course. remember when... your aunt selma got married?
64538,Marge,don't contradict me in front of our son!
64540,Marge,the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
56351,Marge,"but in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed."
64544,Marge,you're wrong! and whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
56355,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
56365,Marge,why so glum?
64557,Marge,we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
64564,Marge,thank you.
64566,Marge,"that's not bart, it's principal skinner. bart's sitting right next to you."
56378,Marge,we'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
56381,Marge,"oh, please. it was just a figure of speech."
64581,Marge,"thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now."
64582,Marge,no thanks.
56392,Marge,"ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
56398,Marge,i'm so embarrassed. i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die.
56399,Marge,"stay away from me, homer!"
64593,Marge,"shopping. every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. you stay here."
64594,Marge,play with lisa.
56403,Marge,i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.
64595,Marge,"you remember dylan. you were in ""toddle tots"" together."
64597,Marge,fish theme! that tells me nothing!
64599,Marge,see? dylan is clearly a girrr--
56408,Marge,"i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny, but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you."
64600,Marge,what kind of a party has two activities? they're just trying to confuse me.
64606,Marge,"bart simpson, are you a drug-o?"
56415,Marge,"homer, i'm impressed. you're taking this quite well."
64607,Marge,"well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with milhouse?"
56419,Marge,"feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
56421,Marge,go crazy?
56427,Marge,it's bliiiiisssss.
56428,Marge,donut? what's a donut?
64623,Marge,"oooh, he sounds just like paddington bear!"
56432,Marge,"listen, kids. you're eight and ten years old now. i can't be fighting all your battles for you."
56433,Marge,"no buts. you march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
56434,Marge,"relax, honey. you were just having a crazy nightmare. you're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out."
64632,Marge,"ever hear of the expression ""not in my backyard?"" well, that!"
56442,Marge,that's not what i meant.
56444,Marge,thirty cents off shake 'n bake. homer!
64636,Marge,that's something you've been putting off.
64644,Marge,every time i plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.
56453,Marge,"well, i think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. look at milhouse's teeth."
56459,Marge,"hey, watch out for the shaq-attack!"
56461,Marge,"lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug."
64654,Marge,"and where there's exotic fish, there's gotta be a..."
64657,Marge,"a lot of people sound like sideshow bob, like frasier on ""cheers."""
64663,Marge,i can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all.
64665,Marge,we better go.
56479,Marge,oooh... how'd they get there?
56480,Marge,i'm sure it'll turn up. take the baby-sitter home now. she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
56481,Marge,"well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
56483,Marge,they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
56484,Marge,homer! wake up! wake up!
64679,Marge,"lisa, too humble."
56489,Marge,"yes, yes, yes. that's fine. good, good."
64681,Marge,"moe's is closed, huh?"
56496,Marge,"you know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
56497,Marge,"groundskeeper willie saved you, homer."
56499,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
64695,Marge,at least in hell the heat still works.
56507,Marge,"oh, i'm just reading up on, artillery."
64705,Marge,"aw, you think i forgot you? babies shouldn't jump to conclusions!"
64706,Marge,your week's up! time to go home!
56515,Marge,"oh, homey, what's--"
64709,Marge,"you didn't see a boy lose his swim trunks, did you?"
64714,Marge,is it your laundry?
64722,Marge,"ooo, i wonder how much that one is. gotta look without looking like i'm looking."
56531,Marge,"well, everybody's got a fear of something."
64730,Marge,"don't worry, homer -- i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
56539,Marge,"mm, no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine. and it's too expensive."
64733,Marge,i suppose i should get something to eat.
56542,Marge,"i'm sorry, doctor. he's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him."
56545,Marge,the kids at school were even worse.
64739,Marge,"homie, you know what happens when you push your luck..."
64740,Marge,"well, i learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than i could afford."
56550,Marge,"i keep having the same dream. i'm the mother from ""lost in space."""
64745,Marge,cut it out! you're upsetting the gravy boat!
64753,Marge,lisa? she wants to talk to you.
64760,Marge,"whew, sure is hot out here..."
56570,Marge,lowenstein.
64762,Marge,this poor man must've been out there for days!
56572,Marge,oh dear.
56575,Marge,everyone likes you. you're a wonderful person.
64769,Marge,why did you do that?
56580,Marge,"you're not a god, homer."
64772,Marge,"please! homer, i am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
56582,Marge,"homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys. somebody's gonna get parasites."
64776,Marge,now!
56588,Marge,"all right, family time begins now."
56589,Marge,homer!
56592,Marge,homer! tell the story right.
56594,Marge,homer...
64787,Marge,dinner is served. i tried to make what homer said you liked.
56599,Marge,what?
56600,Marge,so in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
56602,Marge,"hey, i'm just hangin'."
56603,Marge,"homie, i--"
56605,Marge,oh yes.
56607,Marge,"baby shower?! you know i haven't told homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
56608,Marge,"actually, when i was about to have bart..."
64799,Marge,there are no books in the car.
64801,Marge,my whole childhood is in this box! my scrunchies! i never really had the hair for these.
56614,Marge,and your bottom was a little bigger.
56619,Marge,"homie, i think someone is saying hello."
56622,Marge,boy discovers comet.
64814,Marge,"we'd love to send you here, sweetie. we just can't afford it."
64815,Marge,"homer, lisa, could you please step outside? i have a few choice words for this gentleman."
64817,Marge,awww.
56626,Marge,turn it off.
56627,Marge,homer!
56628,Marge,"get in the shelter, homer."
64820,Marge,are you sure? he's having a growth spurt.
64824,Marge,"i don't know, compliment his glasses."
56633,Marge,i think i'll have some wine.
56639,Marge,"bart, did you trick an australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?"
56640,Marge,undersecretary for international protocol. brat and punk division.
64835,Marge,this isn't the line for a movie. why are you wearing that costume?
64836,Marge,"bart, who are you talking to?"
56645,Marge,"""australia was originally founded as a settlement for british convicts."" lisa, watch your camera."
64838,Marge,"hm... well, okay."
56649,Marge,c... o...
56650,Marge,we'll meet you boys back here for dinner. good luck honey.
56651,Marge,that seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. why don't you get this nice cap?
56656,Marge,"our countries may have their differences, but as human beings i think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent."
56658,Marge,"no deal! this is my son we're talking about. sure he's not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?"
64862,Marge,"bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?"
56674,Marge,what's that paper?
56676,Marge,"homer, homer why didn't you tell me?"
56681,Marge,that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
56683,Marge,"no, homer."
64878,Marge,but i...
64879,Marge,auf wiedersehen.
56693,Marge,"just a minute, homer! oh, look what you made me write! anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. sincerely, marge simpson."""
64886,Marge,you have a magic wand?
56695,Marge,"hello, i'm marge simpson and this is my husband, homer."
56697,Marge,"oh, i invited my sisters over."
56701,Marge,no reason.
56705,Marge,fine. you're on the jury.
64898,Marge,i was afraid this day would come.
56708,Marge,second.
64900,Marge,you were friends with three other boys and i became close with their moms.
56710,Marge,i knew this would happen. i put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
64902,Marge,"the moms and i had a falling out, which was a shame. we had been such good friends."
56716,Marge,"lisa!! hello! how're you doing in england? remember, an elevator is called a ""lift,"" a mile is called a ""kilometer,"" and botulism is called ""steak and kidney pie."""
56720,Marge,"homer, don't take this personally, but i've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding."
64914,Marge,thanks for the ride!
64915,Marge,shh!!!
56727,Marge,"oh, milhouse doesn't count."
64919,Marge,but i don't want a beach house. sand makes me sad. because it used to be big rocks. but not anymore. not anymore...
64920,Marge,what are you boys doing?
56730,Marge,"well, i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
64924,Marge,"i love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, i need something for myself!"
56737,Marge,"""she's the fastest..."" homer, i don't think that means necessarily..."
56740,Marge,but she's not our dog.
64934,Marge,"what do you mean, wig?"
56745,Marge,"well, i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. it feels like a mistake to me."
64937,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
56748,Marge,"oh, my. i've never seen anything like this."
64944,Marge,"well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old tv show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy."
56754,Marge,"all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. on a completely unrelated topic, i'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight."
64949,Marge,really?
64954,Marge,"so, what do you think?"
64955,Marge,"well, what do you kids think of the real me?"
64957,Marge,"need some coolin' down, hot stuff?"
56767,Marge,that's it. we have to get them back to school.
64959,Marge,"well, thank you."
56770,Marge,thank you.
64963,Marge,"a.a.a.? no, i'm not in triple-a. i don't like their ""westways"" magazine. they'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet."
64964,Marge,p?! the a.a.r.p.?! well that tears it. i don't want this milk and i'm not gonna take it back.
64965,Marge,"i thought you'd be more supportive. i mean, you went gray yourselves."
56774,Marge,and i'm gonna keep teaching your class. like it or lump it.
64966,Marge,"he loves it! he calls me his ""silver belle!"""
64968,Marge,"sorry, but i'm fighting for my man!"
64970,Marge,"look out, chicks! the silver fox is coming to the hen house!"
56779,Marge,ok. who was george washington carver?
64973,Marge,shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo!
64976,Marge,get your hands off my husband!
56786,Marge,"homer, this is a cemetery."
56794,Marge,he looks and acts just like the dealer. i think they're related or at least in cahoots.
64987,Marge,"okay, we're gonna take turns having grampa as a roommate. who wants to go first?"
65001,Marge,time to finally return your father's overdue movies.
65005,Marge,i hate to say this about the cat lady... but i think she's crazy. she's a hoarder!
65006,Marge,we can. it'll be great. like a reality show without the cameras.
65009,Marge,wait! wait! wait! wait!
65010,Marge,a perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. i can't count the number of times homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather.
56820,Marge,"hello, mr. hutz."
65013,Marge,/ ooo!
56823,Marge,"apu, no."
65019,Marge,they even have a day spa staffed by former all-pro linemen.
56830,Marge,it's for your own safety.
65025,Marge,"homer! just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
65030,Marge,that's great. then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
56839,Marge,"hello, lisa. help me bite crime. ruff, ruff."
65032,Marge,"you'll be fine, you always are."
65035,Marge,dr. zander? kareem abdul jabbar? anyone?
65039,Marge,uh... twenty-three dollars... and there's a can of beans in my car.
65040,Marge,"so whatever you did to my husband, it was too effective!"
56849,Marge,you're breaking the law.
56851,Marge,you have the right to remain silent...
56852,Marge,"i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer. but what i did was right. someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
65044,Marge,"""broken-leg beauty,"" ""sorry, silver,"" ""no more mint juleps..."" and the fourth one has a title so sad i can't even say it."
56854,Marge,"no, it's officer simpson - of the police!"
65045,Marge,"oh, i always forget about this part."
65049,Marge,"ooh, couples! that way i can enjoy my massage, and make sure you don't enjoy yours too much."
56860,Marge,that the pants would rip?...
56863,Marge,"bart, you've graffito-tagged public property."
56864,Marge,"i can't believe you vandalized your own home town, bart. what would jebediah springfield say?"
65057,Marge,"hm, there must be some mistake."
56866,Marge,"well, i am just shocked by this whole family. whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?"
56867,Marge,now just a darned minute! this town is a part of who you are.
65058,Marge,i'm her sister. and you?
56869,Marge,"bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. this town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
65063,Marge,i still can't believe it. i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings.
56873,Marge,it's almost lunch time. do you know where your brother is tutoring?
56874,Marge,"well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
65065,Marge,i will!
65066,Marge,can you read by it?
56878,Marge,i'm happy for the school. it sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
65070,Marge,which is our room again...
56881,Marge,holy christmas.
56883,Marge,strained carrots for maggie... strained carrots for grampa.
65076,Marge,enough!
65079,Marge,"homer, thanks to your unlicensed barbery, patty and selma have been getting compliments all day at the dmv."
65081,Marge,"i'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. but i never knew you were so good with hair."
56892,Marge,i think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
56894,Marge,i was just asking if you'd seen it. there's no need to be a prickly pear.
56896,Marge,"the police have such a strong case against homer. mr. burns said he did it, they have homer's d.n.a..."
56898,Marge,no. we can't start thinking that way about our own family members. suspicion could tear us apart.
65090,Marge,maggie!
56902,Marge,"growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, bart."
65096,Marge,"excuse me, has anyone seen my toy?"
56907,Marge,no they didn't.
56909,Marge,"now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. that way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry! eh? eh?"
56911,Marge,you did the right thing by telling me.
65104,Marge,that wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
56913,Marge,"""good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa."" mineral bath, facial, massage... how did you afford these?"
65107,Marge,no! you should never raise your hand to a child. just leave the crust on their sandwiches. they'll get the message.
56917,Marge,"well, all right, but i'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
65112,Marge,that was a traffic signal.
56921,Marge,squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... dogs mating on dining room table?
65114,Marge,so we're going to let the internet decide. should ned and edna stay together? visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
65115,Marge,we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
56927,Marge,that's it. we're going downtown to get our kids back. right now!
56928,Marge,"we've always tried to be good parents. please, i'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
65124,Marge,"well, if anyone saves my homie's life, they get a free meal. which actually comes up about once a week."
65126,Marge,"and when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got lou gehrig's disease."
65127,Marge,"kids, can i talk to wayne alone a minute?"
56936,Marge,there's bart's ring!
65130,Marge,we'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets!
65131,Marge,how are you going to find him?
56948,Marge,an alligator with sunglasses? now i've seen everything!
56949,Marge,street signs? indoors?! whatever.
56950,Marge,oooh. these look good. guilt-free steakfish filets.
56951,Marge,"ooo, tres bien."
65142,Marge,"okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
56957,Marge,oh my.
65150,Marge,but you're god. couldn't you make everything the way it was?
65151,Marge,knitting one sweater for someone costs twenty-seven americans their jobs.
65152,Marge,don't touch the scab!
56964,Marge,i didn't mean to take sides. i just got caught up in the rhythm.
56965,Marge,"bart, no!"
65157,Marge,i know! i know!
65159,Marge,the jars are full -- so you've earned your... saturday surprise dad day!
56969,Marge,"homer, you're not not talking to me. and secondly, i heard what you said."
65162,Marge,"how come they never call me ""fun mom?"""
56973,Marge,sometimes.
65165,Marge,i've got it!
56975,Marge,"homer, stop looking!"
56976,Marge,i don't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie.
65166,Marge,your saturday surprise mom day is... the x-games!
65167,Marge,"come on kids, fun comes from inside -- it isn't about what we actually do."
56984,Marge,no.
56989,Marge,"oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. when's your next coffee break?"
56992,Marge,"oh please, i would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
65188,Marge,"relax, homie. have some leftover galalalalalalalalah."
65189,Marge,"""three?"" you mean, one, two... me?"
56998,Marge,con: you're endangering your health.
57002,Marge,there's no cake.
57005,Marge,i'm so proud. that's my husband wedged in that hatch.
57006,Marge,bart!
65197,Marge,"ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!"
57011,Marge,"get out of here, you ghouls!"
65204,Marge,"oh, i doubt it. you sit at communal tables, full of hipsters."
57014,Marge,homer?
57015,Marge,"when i asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" you go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
57020,Marge,"oh, homie. c'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. i'm sure you were a wonderful son."
65217,Marge,my dessert!
57032,Marge,yay.
65227,Marge,to the victor go the spoils.
65229,Marge,hel-lo.
65233,Marge,i'm your wife.
65238,Marge,"well, you certainly won't be bending me-- wait, how did i end up in your bedroom?"
57047,Marge,fresh chocolate chip cookies.
65239,Marge,"look, i came to talk about my husband, and... how did we get in here?"
57057,Marge,but we did win!
65252,Marge,"kids, that's enough tv. maggie's eye is starting to wander."
57061,Marge,tuck-in time!
65254,Marge,we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday when it closes forever.
57065,Marge,-- you never know what --
65257,Marge,"so, what was everyone's favorite moment at the museum?"
65258,Marge,this is the part where i get the kids out of the room.
57068,Marge,"homer, didn't you get any milk? all i see is egg nog."
57069,Marge,"bart, get your suit on."
57070,Marge,we're getting our christmas picture taken.
57078,Marge,"sure. we're gonna have a great day. ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right bart? bart?"
57079,Marge,"what's wrong, honey?"
57086,Marge,i know you are...
65280,Marge,"cousin kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
65281,Marge,i told you not to pack them!
65285,Marge,this is the last airline that would take us.
57094,Marge,i think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
57096,Marge,we're almost finished. there's just a little bit of green left.
57097,Marge,there you are! you can help me spray the cookies...
65291,Marge,"speaking for lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore."
57100,Marge,"you can't hide from me in this house, bart! i spend 23 hours a day here!"
57103,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this is the best present a mother could get."
57106,Marge,"lisa, you have to wait."
57107,Marge,"now, i know you love video games, and i asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
65298,Marge,"bart, it's okay to say that at home, but not in court! take it back!"
57116,Marge,who knocked down the pins?
57117,Marge,good for him!
65309,Marge,"i think it just froze. oh no. no, that bird just moved."
57120,Marge,bart! where do you pick up words like that?
57121,Marge,homer! watch your mouth!
65312,Marge,"yeah, look!"
57125,Marge,you'd get some fresh air and exercise.
65318,Marge,"well, that's not true! everyone in this family is your friend."
65319,Marge,it's a beautiful afternoon. no tv.
65320,Marge,no tv on the computer!
57130,Marge,"well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
57131,Marge,no.
57138,Marge,we can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. we just need a tv. we're going to go to the outlet mall in ogdenville.
65330,Marge,lisa?
65331,Marge,"well. i usually take lisa, but i can just go with bart."
65333,Marge,now there's three of you?
57142,Marge,90 dollars?!
65339,Marge,"oh, my. i don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before."
65340,Marge,i'll get a couple glasses.
65341,Marge,"you're going with me! but lisa, after this, i don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. if you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me."
57150,Marge,i did marry homer.
65342,Marge,lisa!
57152,Marge,"we ran with different crowds. you had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and i had my home shoe repair course."
57154,Marge,"if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
57158,Marge,"ohhh. i've always dreamed of coming here. everybody keep smiling, and i know we're going fit right in."
57159,Marge,pleased to meet you. you look like such a happy bunch... of people.
65350,Marge,what's going on? why is there a picture of us? this isn't good.
57161,Marge,"i get food through the mail, but in a different way. every month good housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
65353,Marge,homer! that is not banishment-hearing behavior!
57167,Marge,"why thank you, roberta."
65359,Marge,i don't think this place is so great.
65360,Marge,"i'm trying to make the best of things, but i'm worried maggie is falling in with a bad crowd."
65363,Marge,"he's no ned flanders. and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. god help me, i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies."
65364,Marge,"homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
57184,Marge,a dollar. let's go.
65377,Marge,"homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
65378,Marge,"well, at least you remembered i like her."
65381,Marge,he won't leave the car.
57191,Marge,"oh, homie, i like your in-your-face humanity. i like the way lisa speaks her mind. i like bart's... i like bart. and i like my old green dress. i didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
65383,Marge,"wait, wait, wait. he's just a boy! do you have to put him in jail?"
57193,Marge,"c'mon, let's go. i wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
57197,Marge,tacos! public broadcasting! i won't have you kids throwing your money away like that. you're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
57198,Marge,no.
57200,Marge,a professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
57214,Marge,"homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""little rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
65407,Marge,"spin the top. if it falls over, we're in reality. if it spins forever, we're still in a dream."
57218,Marge,"sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
65414,Marge,"homie, what are you drinking?"
57223,Marge,"bart, lisa! it's 11 o'clock at night. where do you think you're going?"
57225,Marge,"well, if it's just for one more night."
65423,Marge,barney?
57233,Marge,you kids must be so happy. your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
57234,Marge,"that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
57235,Marge,what are you talking about?
65431,Marge,on the tv!
57246,Marge,"oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
65438,Marge,now you be careful with bart's undies.
65442,Marge,"homie, come in the bedroom."
57251,Marge,"with bart gone, and now you and your father, i'm not going to have anyone to--"
57252,Marge,i can't take this anymore!
65449,Marge,"no. we saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. and we made just enough for an economy cabin!"
57258,Marge,"homer, are you laughing at me?"
65451,Marge,"yeah... actually, my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for. it took her years to get the whole set."
65454,Marge,"no, honey. you just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!"
57265,Marge,it's grampa. and it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
57269,Marge,it's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
57271,Marge,uh-huh.
57272,Marge,"what you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating u.s. law."
65467,Marge,whoa. /
57278,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
57287,Marge,there might be one in this cooler.
57296,Marge,"we have each other! when i was a lonely little girl, i always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend."
65489,Marge,"congratulations, you two! we're so, so happy for you!"
65493,Marge,"ned, edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room..."
65494,Marge,"well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor."
57303,Marge,"well, duh! with what, ned?"
57304,Marge,"isn't this fun, honey?"
65497,Marge,"well, you're all invited, so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres."
65498,Marge,thank you! everyone's having a great time.
57307,Marge,"oh, okay."
57308,Marge,"ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. it has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
65503,Marge,why does that make him right?
57312,Marge,"because it was the only one in the house. come on, homer, open the door for your mystery date!"
65504,Marge,no video... party over... caaaake!
65505,Marge,"ned, how did you sleep?"
65508,Marge,that is totally irresponsible parenting!
57317,Marge,"oh, you haven't said that in four years. let lisa have it."
65510,Marge,why would you believe him?
65511,Marge,"ned, i realized long ago, there are some things homer and i will never completely agree on."
57323,Marge,"homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
65516,Marge,"whoever this ""truth teller"" is, i'm a fan. it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously."
65518,Marge,i'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
57327,Marge,"i'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, bart. you see... you have a brother."
57328,Marge,i think i'll bottle-feed that one.
65520,Marge,"i wish i was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me."
65522,Marge,lisa snuck out.
65523,Marge,what are you gonna say?
65525,Marge,"all right, who took the microwave?"
57340,Marge,homer! you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
65534,Marge,"well at least it didn't end as bad as ""romeo and juliet."""
