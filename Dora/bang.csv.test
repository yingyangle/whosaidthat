4100,Bernadette,my god! i thought you were my friend. 
6150,Bernadette,the only thing i hate more than you right now is that book.
4104,Bernadette,no. come here. i’m still really mad at you.
6154,Bernadette,hello?
4107,Bernadette,"yeah, the wedding’s still on. "
4120,Bernadette,"oh, god, i’m so nervous. i don’t think i can watch."
4121,Bernadette,give me those damn pringles.
4122,Bernadette,"come on, howard. i’m not falling for that again."
4124,Bernadette,"oh, my god."
4127,Bernadette,i want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
4132,Bernadette,seriously? you’re going to wear that thing to city hall?
4133,Bernadette,why wasn’t it a real proposal?
4139,Bernadette,there’s got to be some place special we could do it.
4141,Bernadette,"great, well, who’s it going to be?"
4142,Bernadette,no.
4144,Bernadette,"here you go? what am i, a football?"
4145,Bernadette,"they all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer."
4147,Bernadette,"howard joel wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. i love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever."
4152,Bernadette,it was. until i found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. let’s talk about that for a minute.
4154,Bernadette,how clear is the image of me on that screen?
4166,Bernadette,but do you think you’ll ever get married?
4169,Bernadette,are you gonna break up with him?
4177,Bernadette,why don’t you stand up to them?
4181,Bernadette,"don’t worry. you’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary."
4182,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
4183,Bernadette,"nope, this is my proud face."
4185,Bernadette,"well, hang in there. you just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home."
4187,Bernadette,what do you want me to do?
4198,Bernadette,"howie, stop that. nasa’s watching this! put your pants back on!"
4207,Bernadette,"took some benadryl. i’ll be fine. so, did you miss me?"
4208,Bernadette,"yes, we do. you left right after we got married. this is like our honeymoon. now, hold on to your hat. oh. uh-oh."
4209,Bernadette,a little dizzy. must be the benadryl. switch places with me.
4216,Bernadette,you could start by taking an interest in his work.
4221,Bernadette,tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
4222,Bernadette,"i’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it."
4223,Bernadette,of course you can. but maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
4232,Bernadette,and albert einstein?
4235,Bernadette,me? what did i do?
4240,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
4258,Bernadette,because we don’t live here.
4262,Bernadette,kitchen slammed again?
4271,Bernadette,she’s lucky you were there.
4273,Bernadette,grab a box. we’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
4283,Bernadette,hang on. none of sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. my husband actually went to outer space.
4292,Bernadette,"didn’t see that one coming, did ya?"
4296,Bernadette,"amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?"
4297,Bernadette,you hit her! what did i do?
4300,Bernadette,"okay, let’s go."
4305,Bernadette,you could die.
4323,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re a real catch. i know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life."
4324,Bernadette,"we’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you."
4330,Bernadette,why would you say that?
4340,Bernadette,"when he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out."
4356,Bernadette,leonard and sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. why don’t we go look at those?
4359,Bernadette,what?
4371,Bernadette,"if you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.  "
4381,Bernadette,"you know, compared to them, i’m feeling pretty good about us."
4394,Bernadette,"so, what do you say? this friday we ditch work and go to disneyland?"
4399,Bernadette,"okay, so, you pick your princess, sleeping beauty, snow white, cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works."
4405,Bernadette,"yes, and i have a surprise for you."
4410,Bernadette,"well, you don’t know that. what if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?"
4411,Bernadette,fine. but after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
4416,Bernadette,you stopped and got him takeout?
4417,Bernadette,"sheldon, i’ve been cooking all day."
4421,Bernadette,"howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?"
4425,Bernadette,you must be curious.
4434,Bernadette,wait. there’s something i have to tell you.
4454,Bernadette,"well, there’s no reason you can’t."
4458,Bernadette,"you know, there were a few moments today when i almost felt like we were a little family."
4465,Bernadette,"you know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of raj’s accent."
4466,Bernadette,thanks.
4468,Bernadette,can’t believe we lost her. what was i thinking? i’d be a terrible mom.
4475,Bernadette,"burbank airport, please."
4483,Bernadette,"this may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
4484,Bernadette,"ooh! come on, back me up here."
4486,Bernadette,"you know, one of the things that helped me get through howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
4494,Bernadette,to the advancement of science.
4499,Bernadette,"yes, it’s all cool. although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
4508,Bernadette,"so, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
4513,Bernadette,"we are. stop it. and for the last time, you’re not fat."
4520,Bernadette,it’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
4528,Bernadette,because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? i’m sure she finds it charming.
4531,Bernadette,"go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! how am i faster than you? i’m in heels and i stopped to take a phone call."
4534,Bernadette,"congratulations, you got it last. "
4537,Bernadette,no. quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
4547,Bernadette,"because you were about to quit like a big, sheldon, cover your ears."
4551,Bernadette,then where’s the coin?
4556,Bernadette,"aw, poor howie. we good? i’m gonna take a bath."
4560,Bernadette,"so, amy, what are you gonna be working on at caltech?"
4568,Bernadette,is it my voice? am i too bossy? what?
4571,Bernadette,find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
4577,Bernadette,i’m not apologizing to howard. he can come beg me on his knees.
4583,Bernadette,what’s all this?
4585,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
4588,Bernadette,"me, too."
4592,Bernadette,"he’s kidding. if that were true, it’d be so much bigger."
4610,Bernadette,you can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
4612,Bernadette,"if you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy."
4617,Bernadette,"okay, he cares about you a lot."
4620,Bernadette,"i don’t know. he’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome. "
4624,Bernadette,what do you mean?
4632,Bernadette,the rest of the week? you said it was just gonna be a night or two.
4634,Bernadette,"i love raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest."
4637,Bernadette,"aw, that’s so sweet."
4638,Bernadette,"thank you, raj."
4642,Bernadette,"because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
4644,Bernadette,what presentation do i have today?
4653,Bernadette,i back you up all the time.
4664,Bernadette,"hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
4665,Bernadette,"aw, so i guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?"
4666,Bernadette,how is this any different?
4667,Bernadette,"hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?"
4670,Bernadette,"well, stuart’s cute in his own way."
4671,Bernadette,or maybe just stop talking.
4676,Bernadette,"if you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
4677,Bernadette,"no, of course not."
4678,Bernadette,i don’t think you would.
4681,Bernadette,hey stuart.
4683,Bernadette,"well, i need a little help. i accidentally destroyed one of howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping i could replace it."
4689,Bernadette,"oh, that’s great."
4707,Bernadette,i could go for a drink.
4712,Bernadette,i’m gonna fix this right now.
4717,Bernadette,"so, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. most of them are. i mean, look at this guy. you think he came like this? when i met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. now, he’s been to space. that’s all me."
4720,Bernadette,sorry.
4722,Bernadette,let’s go.
4726,Bernadette,fine. can i at least shower first?
4730,Bernadette,really? ‘cause i kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
4741,Bernadette,don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
4743,Bernadette,now i feel bad.
4744,Bernadette,"no, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups."
4760,Bernadette,"well, i told howie if i wasn’t busy, i’d spend the night at his mom’s. so for god’s sake, think of something."
4767,Bernadette,"hey, what about this? it looks like a receipt."
4772,Bernadette,what the hell?
4776,Bernadette,aw.
4779,Bernadette,"well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign."
4782,Bernadette,“lol.” smiley face.
4786,Bernadette,i’m so sorry.
4791,Bernadette,no.
4806,Bernadette,we moved on.
4813,Bernadette,"oh, we know you don’t lie to her."
4817,Bernadette,this is pretty cool. you don’t see too many spherical cakes.
4820,Bernadette,"yeah, i thought it was working for a while, but then i found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. how about you?"
4821,Bernadette,girl sprouts?
4827,Bernadette,we set it up in howie’s old room.
4828,Bernadette,maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
4829,Bernadette,howie.
4837,Bernadette,"i’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work."
4842,Bernadette,queen? i’ve been killing myself here.
4847,Bernadette,"she’s just so impossible, they keep quitting."
4854,Bernadette,"sorry i’m late. the leaf blower broke, so i had to hand-dry my mother-in-law."
4860,Bernadette,i could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
4867,Bernadette,you’ll be fine. just be yourself.
4869,Bernadette,it’s too late to cancel. you’re going.
4875,Bernadette,"hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him."
4876,Bernadette,did you get a chance to look over the materials i gave you?
4882,Bernadette,not tonight. i’m a little frustrated with her.
4886,Bernadette,exactly. does she not realize it or does she not care?
4889,Bernadette,"i was probably being too hard on her. we talked, we’re good."
4891,Bernadette,"okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
4892,Bernadette,yes.
4893,Bernadette,want to stop here?
4904,Bernadette,that’s sixty feet.
4905,Bernadette,i’m looking at it.
4915,Bernadette,why is it going so slow?
4917,Bernadette,"long story short, they have seven hbos."
4920,Bernadette,did she say she didn’t like you?
4927,Bernadette,"oh, i know. why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?"
4930,Bernadette,nope.
4935,Bernadette,it just seems like a risky investment.
4940,Bernadette,i’ll check hotels.
4955,Bernadette,guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
4963,Bernadette,i like your suit.
4968,Bernadette,"sure, sometimes. i mean, it can be a little awkward since i make so much more money than howie."
4969,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy i felt that i should."
4971,Bernadette,without asking me?
4973,Bernadette,how much?
4975,Bernadette,"well, maybe i would have paid it if i wasn’t also doing everything else around here."
4976,Bernadette,that was a pity star. putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
4979,Bernadette,money’s a sensitive subject for howie because of the difference in our income.
4982,Bernadette,i’m so sorry i made you feel bad about the money stuff.
4984,Bernadette,"now, let’s talk about your birthday party."
4996,Bernadette,"because no one wants to see neil degrasse tyson in a wet t-shirt, bent over the hood of a porsche."
5001,Bernadette,"oh, good, you’re here. amy, i am so sorry."
5002,Bernadette,what?
5009,Bernadette,easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
5011,Bernadette,"ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
5016,Bernadette,that’s a neat tattoo.
5018,Bernadette,i like cinderella.
5019,Bernadette,i like bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
5026,Bernadette,"well, what are some of the things they like?"
5030,Bernadette,"oh, muffin much."
5031,Bernadette,he’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. tough crowd.
5034,Bernadette,"sorry, raj. do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?"
5036,Bernadette,can i tell you something? this whole thing with raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.
5039,Bernadette,"well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?"
5047,Bernadette,"oh, that’s so sweet. i want to do that."
5055,Bernadette,"oh, yeah. i remember him from the picnic. he was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
5056,Bernadette,"just builds character. like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and democrats.”"
5057,Bernadette,what’s his problem?
5058,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore."
5071,Bernadette,no problem. when does that start?
5076,Bernadette,you’re kidding.
5084,Bernadette,i think a victorian christmas sounds nice.
5092,Bernadette,then you’re both sad?
5094,Bernadette,what about that sweater?
5096,Bernadette,"wow, you really do love her."
5097,Bernadette,you feeling okay? you hardly touched your goose.
5099,Bernadette,i told you not to wax down there. it’s itchy when it grows back.
5104,Bernadette,"well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. they’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. it’s like comparing apples to oranges."
5105,Bernadette,emily’s feelings?
5114,Bernadette,"ho-ho, it really didn’t."
5117,Bernadette,‘cause it’s embarrassing.
5121,Bernadette,please?
5124,Bernadette,here we go.
5129,Bernadette,but they didn’t even kiss.
5132,Bernadette,she’s just being nice.
5141,Bernadette,this is why i had to rewrite our wedding vows.
5144,Bernadette,what?
5147,Bernadette,just drop it.
5150,Bernadette,"sure you don’t want to go home? when the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us."
5153,Bernadette,there’s no way you could’ve known. be right back. excuse me?
5154,Bernadette,"you better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman."
5155,Bernadette,"okay, thank you so much."
5165,Bernadette,"howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. who cares?"
5172,Bernadette,what should we do?
5182,Bernadette,"no, we got it. you guys make yourselves comfortable."
5186,Bernadette,"so, i put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. we just need help taking it all out to the driveway."
5192,Bernadette,you can’t just decide. how about i arm-wrestle you?
5199,Bernadette,"oh, come on, like you even care."
5201,Bernadette,"come on, get in her head. be intimidating."
5203,Bernadette,"don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
5204,Bernadette,one-five. two-five. three-five. four-five. five-five.
5206,Bernadette,"you know, amy, i, uh, can’t help but wonder how sheldon would react if the tardis was at your place."
5208,Bernadette,"hey, raj."
5209,Bernadette,"oh, that’s a lot of girl scout cookies."
5210,Bernadette,"you know, i’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures."
5218,Bernadette,he did it with a robot.
5219,Bernadette,what’s going on in here?
5220,Bernadette,oh. how do you drink it?
5224,Bernadette,"howard, you’re grown men. you guys don’t have to do everything together."
5227,Bernadette,i’m sorry. what do we know?
5237,Bernadette,"well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
5243,Bernadette,ready to call tech support?
5247,Bernadette,"guys. in the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, i got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
5267,Bernadette,"well, you’ve been living here a while now."
5271,Bernadette,howard.
5283,Bernadette,what will pay for itself?
5286,Bernadette,i guess that’s true.
5287,Bernadette,"i don’t know what to think. but then again, i just found out about it."
5289,Bernadette,"you know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. i mean, sure, more women might notice him, but i think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice."
5291,Bernadette,"come on, leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. you sure we can’t take you to a strip club?"
5298,Bernadette,your sweater?
5300,Bernadette,you really never had that done?
5329,Bernadette,was it?
5330,Bernadette,that really happened?
5340,Bernadette,howie?
5351,Bernadette,"we put amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there."
5352,Bernadette,"ew, check out his tiny teeth. he looks like a man-dolphin."
5355,Bernadette,what?
5367,Bernadette,how ’bout this one?
5368,Bernadette,then how ’bout the bathroom?
5370,Bernadette,great. i’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
5375,Bernadette,so i should probably explain why i kind of fibbed.
5378,Bernadette,"oh, please. mom did everything. all you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. how is that raising kids?"
5379,Bernadette,why?
5395,Bernadette,"he’s cute, right?"
5396,Bernadette,"yeah, i should’ve brought my parabolic microphone."
5402,Bernadette,"hey, hey, they’re leaving."
5413,Bernadette,"oh, great. we’d love to help."
5418,Bernadette,"so, you’re really going out with dave again?"
5424,Bernadette,‘cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
5426,Bernadette,fan of what?
5430,Bernadette,"what happens if i say, come in?"
5433,Bernadette,sure.
5436,Bernadette,wild thang.
5437,Bernadette,"yeah, are you ready for this?"
5441,Bernadette,"well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…"
5445,Bernadette,it was. i just wish stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
5448,Bernadette,oh. okay. sorry to see you go?
5449,Bernadette,you’re very welcome.
5452,Bernadette,i guess so.
5453,Bernadette,ignore him. he’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
5455,Bernadette,our pleasure.
5457,Bernadette,"boy, when was the last time stuart cleaned this place?"
5463,Bernadette,have you heard from him since he left?
5466,Bernadette,"and he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple."
5467,Bernadette,"yeah. ew, we are missing him!"
5469,Bernadette,we could do a double feature with the leonardo di caprio romeo and juliet.
5473,Bernadette,and he made it all better.
5474,Bernadette,you know what that means.
5487,Bernadette,you still have a girlfriend.
5490,Bernadette,"look at that, you shaved it all."
5494,Bernadette,"i’m gonna put this down your robe. it’s not moving, but i think it’s still alive."
5512,Bernadette,yeah.
5517,Bernadette,"calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
5521,Bernadette,"i am. of-of course i am. i’m, i’m sure it’s just the hormones. but it’s weird, howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and i was all excited to tell him because i thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and i’m gonna get fat."
3483,Bernadette,no.
5536,Bernadette,you guys can go in if you want.
3489,Bernadette,are you going to answer it?
5539,Bernadette,sure.
5545,Bernadette,doing great.
3499,Bernadette,"okay, but only if you come to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke."
3502,Bernadette,where do you think this is going?
3503,Bernadette,you’re so funny. you’re like a stand-up comedian.
3504,Bernadette,"actually, i think a lot of them are jewish."
5551,Bernadette,"you don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?"
5554,Bernadette,i wonder how much she spent on this.
3507,Bernadette,but i need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
3509,Bernadette,call me when you figure it out.
5557,Bernadette,"well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here."
5567,Bernadette,i’m not worried about you. i’m worried about me. i don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
5572,Bernadette,we heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
5575,Bernadette,i’m kind of getting into the groove here.
5576,Bernadette,it is crazy. it’s also crazy that i’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
5579,Bernadette,i feel bad. should we have asked him to stay?
5582,Bernadette,"yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves."
3537,Bernadette,he doesn’t mean salt mines. he means where he works.
3538,Bernadette,"so, how’s your experiment going?"
3539,Bernadette,"boy, i’d love to see that."
5585,Bernadette,"oh. well, thank you for being honest."
5588,Bernadette,"come on, raj, give me a bag."
5590,Bernadette,yes and yes.
3544,Bernadette,howard?
3547,Bernadette,"you know, that one i got. howard, did you say something to leonard about me?"
5595,Bernadette,"oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat."
5596,Bernadette,"actually, raj ordered it. he made me promise to wait till he was here."
3552,Bernadette,what are you doing here?
3553,Bernadette,"no, you didn’t. you said leonard’s experiment was stupid."
5600,Bernadette,"no, not really."
5606,Bernadette,yeah.
3559,Bernadette,"oh, we’re way past second base. right, howard?"
3563,Bernadette,"no, thank you."
3570,Bernadette,"okay, sheldon. what happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough rem sleep?"
3575,Bernadette,"thanks, sheldon."
5627,Bernadette,i guess we could give it a try.
5628,Bernadette,i brought sparkling cider.
3581,Bernadette,"sorry, i had to clock out."
3582,Bernadette,"okay. you know, busy, school, work. you?"
3583,Bernadette,too bad.
3604,Bernadette,"we never did. that would be a terrible, terrible thing."
5654,Bernadette,"so, beverly, did you know penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?"
5657,Bernadette,"well, let’s get back to penny. hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?"
5664,Bernadette,"well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for leonard’s mother."
3618,Bernadette,you know what i really love about howard? his chest hair.
3619,Bernadette,"no, just the one. but it’s really long."
3620,Bernadette,truth.
5671,Bernadette,"it’s probably just a coincidence. speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
5672,Bernadette,do not pull over. i’m not raising this baby alone.
5673,Bernadette,because you were driving like a lunatic.
3629,Bernadette,where exactly on the internet have you been looking?
3630,Bernadette,i might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
5677,Bernadette,"okay, i think we’re ready."
3633,Bernadette,"so we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?"
3639,Bernadette,which is still so funny.
3643,Bernadette,that sounds great.
3644,Bernadette,"he’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?"
5691,Bernadette,"‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else."
3646,Bernadette,you just have to look.
5698,Bernadette,oh. how was it?
3652,Bernadette,couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to npr?
5701,Bernadette,"no. i confronted barbara chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what i was talking about."
3655,Bernadette,i hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
5703,Bernadette,what kind of revenge is that? this woman screwed with my job. she’s got to pay.
3658,Bernadette,"well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?"
3662,Bernadette,"oh, my god, glenn!"
3663,Bernadette,are you here for the conference?
5712,Bernadette,"well, you brought me french fries. that’s a start."
3665,Bernadette,i’ll try to catch it.
3666,Bernadette,bye.
3668,Bernadette,no. he was one of my professors in college.
5718,Bernadette,"well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so i gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and i’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury."
3672,Bernadette,is something bothering you?
3673,Bernadette,what?
5721,Bernadette,"you believe me? oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, i’ll have the jury eating out of my hand."
3682,Bernadette,thanks. i’ll sleep on the floor.
5733,Bernadette,my dad built it for me.
5735,Bernadette,"they did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox."
3689,Bernadette,don’t you listen to them. you’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
5737,Bernadette,sorry i flipped out on you. i think it’s just hormones.
5738,Bernadette,does it really need one?
5741,Bernadette,i don’t care what colour the room is.
5742,Bernadette,"well, you’re not, so just drop it.  i’m clearly upset. why aren’t you following me?"
3698,Bernadette,"okay, raj, i know you’ve been avoiding me and howard, and i’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours."
5746,Bernadette,"i keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. what if it never happens?"
3704,Bernadette,"please, i think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself."
3706,Bernadette,stay.
3708,Bernadette,"howard, have you ever considered us living together?"
3709,Bernadette,"no, i mean just you and me. you can move in here, or we can find a place."
5756,Bernadette,"hmm. the doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter."
5758,Bernadette,"god, raj."
5761,Bernadette,i was disappointed to see the man i was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
3716,Bernadette,i’m listening.
3717,Bernadette,agh!
3718,Bernadette,really?
5765,Bernadette,yes.
5768,Bernadette,but it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
3722,Bernadette,wow.
5770,Bernadette,you just heard me throwing up.
5771,Bernadette,you’re so weird.
5775,Bernadette,"uh, i left my phone downstairs."
5779,Bernadette,who would use our hot tub?
5787,Bernadette,you said you got it back.
5788,Bernadette,why wouldn’t he tell us? are we bad friends?
5791,Bernadette,what are you doing?
5792,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, that’s where i put it."
5795,Bernadette,the next person kicking you will be me. good night.
3748,Bernadette,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i’m never speaking to priya again."
3750,Bernadette,count your blessings you’re not a tanzanian chimp.
5808,Bernadette,"fine, we’ll go to the e.r. just stop selling me on the van."
3763,Bernadette,whee-ee-ee!
3765,Bernadette,not if they’re doing it for a long time.
3769,Bernadette,"muy caliente, sheldon!"
3777,Bernadette,it doesn’t matter. i’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
3781,Bernadette,that’s what i hear.
3784,Bernadette,i don’t know. the regular way people meet astronauts.
3785,Bernadette,"obviously, this one doesn’t."
5833,Bernadette,i thought it was brave. does that count as liking it?
5839,Bernadette,"thank you, but i’m not really sure."
3795,Bernadette,i don’t know. i was too busy covering my heinie on amy’s stupid astronaut story!
3796,Bernadette,you texted me penny’s dating an astronaut.
5844,Bernadette,"stuart, you cooked?"
3798,Bernadette,i don’t want to do this anymore!
5847,Bernadette,"yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that."
3800,Bernadette,this trip to india sounds fun.
5850,Bernadette,"great, go with the giraffes."
3804,Bernadette,yes. are you writing a book?
3805,Bernadette,i’m not upset. maybe you’re upset.
5854,Bernadette,please just go to the store.
5855,Bernadette,take raj. stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
5857,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
5858,Bernadette,here comes another contraction.
3811,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5860,Bernadette,not that old school. he knows.
3816,Bernadette,"you’re a real hero, howard."
3817,Bernadette,so it’s probably genetic.
3824,Bernadette,me? why me?
5872,Bernadette,she did always have candy in her pocket.
3829,Bernadette,shut up! she said i’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
5877,Bernadette,sorry we’re late.
3832,Bernadette,thank you.
3834,Bernadette,"well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but i volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. i mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. oh, i almost forgot. i got you a little present."
5882,Bernadette,"it’s been wonderful, sheldon, thanks for asking."
5883,Bernadette,"oh, please stop crying, i’m begging you. i don’t know what else to do. my boobs are empty. do you want lasagna? shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. shh. what have we done?"
3837,Bernadette,you jerk face! what did you tell howard? did you say there was something going on between us? because he thinks there is. he’s completely freaking out!
5886,Bernadette,"yeah, he has a gift."
5887,Bernadette,"nothing, these are happy tears."
3840,Bernadette,"damn right, you’re sorry. and you tell howard there’s never been anything between us."
5890,Bernadette,everyone’s a better mom than me.
3843,Bernadette,it’s okay if he wants to come.
5895,Bernadette,shh. she’s asleep.
3848,Bernadette,hang on. you seriously think i’m going to live with your mother?
3850,Bernadette,"raj, take me home."
5900,Bernadette,"yeah, go ahead."
3853,Bernadette,and your mom would be okay with that?
5902,Bernadette,"we love you, too."
3855,Bernadette,"i’m okay, mrs. wolowitz."
5903,Bernadette,"i could take a bath in the sink. i don’t, but i can."
3859,Bernadette,"no, it’s not. i’m not going in there."
5910,Bernadette,you actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark. 
5911,Bernadette,"so, normal."
3864,Bernadette,it’s butter-flavoured syrup.
3865,Bernadette,he wants butter!
5921,Bernadette,"for howie’s occupation, should i include that he was an astronaut?"
3876,Bernadette,i just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
5925,Bernadette,"oh, thank you."
5927,Bernadette,"we will. got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. let’s party."
5930,Bernadette,"not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
3887,Bernadette,howard?
5944,Bernadette,and there they go.
5945,Bernadette,"oh, it’s okay. it’s good to get out of the house."
5947,Bernadette,"oh, i’m sure that’s not true."
5949,Bernadette,is it really that high?
3902,Bernadette,i know.
3906,Bernadette,"hi, sheldon."
3908,Bernadette,howard has a heart condition! you know that!
5956,Bernadette,making lasagna.
5962,Bernadette,"you said tickets don’t go on sale till friday, right?"
3920,Bernadette,"she keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
3923,Bernadette,"oh, you know, just pillow talk. you guys have nothing to worry about."
5971,Bernadette,he’s such a sweetie. 
5986,Bernadette,"not for you, box of towels."
3943,Bernadette,i still think he looks like someone’s pet. maybe we should put up posters.
5994,Bernadette,"well, have you talked to them about it?"
3950,Bernadette,"looks like it’s just us playing.  penny, we’re out of wine!"
5998,Bernadette,"let’s see, the magic store, the doctor who convention, the national belt buckle collector’s meet and greet."
6003,Bernadette,okay.
6009,Bernadette,"plus, i, i think i’m setting a good example for halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. sure, she won’t know where i went or if i’m ever coming back. that’ll just make the ten minutes between when i get home and her bedtime even more special."
3968,Bernadette,"oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
3971,Bernadette,"listen, howie, maybe i’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant."
6020,Bernadette,"love you, too."
3977,Bernadette,do you know how to pipe down?
3981,Bernadette,i told you i’m not good with kids.
3984,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. i know it makes me sound like a bad person, but i just don’t like children."
3986,Bernadette,here’s your vest back.
3991,Bernadette,"yeah. you know, you’ll watch barney and pull cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and i’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
3992,Bernadette,"yay, so we’re good."
6040,Bernadette,"well, guess i’m ready to go."
6042,Bernadette,"okay. okay, sweetie, mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
6044,Bernadette,"she’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care."
3997,Bernadette,"mm, uh… how’s it going in there, penny?"
6045,Bernadette,"i see a wall, floor, some asian baby, there she is."
3999,Bernadette,when did you and leonard break up?
4003,Bernadette,"you can make-believe, though. sometimes howard and i pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and i’m a sexy cardiologist. and the naughty part is i’m not in his hmo network."
4005,Bernadette,"sure, we’d love that. change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
6053,Bernadette,"yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. do not touch that phone."
6057,Bernadette,really? i have no trouble believing that at all.
6060,Bernadette,i wouldn’t trust her. he’s thin and sexy like a jewish greyhound.
6067,Bernadette,"first of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from south carolina."
4023,Bernadette,if i ever actually ever get married.
4025,Bernadette,yeah. howie’s gonna freak out.
4027,Bernadette,"i don’t know, i don’t want to manipulate him with sex."
6077,Bernadette,you’re kidding. why would they do that?
6079,Bernadette,want me to put on some neil diamond? that always makes you feel better.
4035,Bernadette,in may you’re gonna be on the international space station.
6083,Bernadette,"you’re still gonna go, right?"
6085,Bernadette,"no, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage."
4038,Bernadette,"i don’t know. you can’t take it down. you’ll break her heart. look at that face. that enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
4039,Bernadette,that depends. do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
6093,Bernadette,"just listen. i don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
6094,Bernadette,a little clingy.
6096,Bernadette,i signed us up for ballroom dance class.
4050,Bernadette,that sounds mean.
6099,Bernadette,"that’s nothing, howie said she touched his hand."
6101,Bernadette,should we call amy?
6102,Bernadette,i guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
6103,Bernadette,ugh. how can you think that? why would you even put those words together?
4060,Bernadette,surprise.
6109,Bernadette,"yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot raj down."
4066,Bernadette,"sorry, i just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple."
6117,Bernadette,like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
4070,Bernadette,"no, i’ll…"
4072,Bernadette,the nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. they used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
4077,Bernadette,not necessarily. i think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. 
6135,Bernadette,howard?
6138,Bernadette,your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
6140,Bernadette,"yeah, honey, i’m still stuck at work. really? penny said that? okay, it’s true. i’m sorry. i’ll see you at home. yeah, yeah, i’ll put it on."
4094,Bernadette,don’t you try and blame this on him.
4095,Bernadette,"zip it, pervert!"
1,Amy,"that’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?"
2049,Amy,thank you. acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
4,Amy,excuse me. i’m amy farrah fowler. you’re sheldon cooper.
2058,Amy,of course not.
2071,Amy,sure. unless something better comes along.
24,Amy,defend.
27,Amy,isn’t it obvious?
2080,Amy,"oh, let me see."
33,Amy,hello.
35,Amy,"actually, i’m not. in order to avoid surprises, i wear them all the time."
2083,Amy,poor leonard.
2085,Amy,think about it. how would you feel if you were referred to as part of leonard’s team?
39,Amy,"like everybody else’s. subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. thank you for asking. why is she not taking our order?"
2090,Amy,remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
2097,Amy,do you need any help in the kitchen?
2103,Amy,sheldon.
2106,Amy,who cares? did they mention leonard?
2110,Amy,"i had a table, too, but i didn’t have any friends, so all i did was serve."
2111,Amy,"and if i had a friend, they might have told me that."
2112,Amy,have you made a decision about the tardis? i think i can sell it if we call it big british porta-potty.
2117,Amy,"uh, it, it’s been a long time. i don’t know. i’m probably pretty rusty."
70,Amy,all right. 
2121,Amy,really should have thought this through.
2122,Amy,can you please pass the salt?
2124,Amy,"no, sheldon."
78,Amy,"good night, sheldon."
2126,Amy,"well, it applies to you, too."
2128,Amy,being left out is a terrible feeling. no one understands that better than i do.
81,Amy,"actually, as the newest member of your social group, i believe i’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
82,Amy,"leonard, you’re right. we should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all."
2129,Amy,"when there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but i just got attacked by bees."
86,Amy,no need. penny and i are very close.
2140,Amy,"come on, i’ll help you take this down."
93,Amy,shame. ‘cause i have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
2141,Amy,"well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
2142,Amy,it’s a big fort.
2145,Amy,would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
98,Amy,"well, there was the time i had my tonsils out, and i shared a room with a little vietnamese girl. she didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun."
2150,Amy,"and you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
2152,Amy,i think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with penny.
2157,Amy,do you think the moms will get along?
2158,Amy,can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
2165,Amy,"i’ve been thinking about them, too, sheldon. being your girlfriend is so challenging. emotionally, physically. i’ve been incredibly patient for years."
121,Amy,interesting. and was it not satisfactory?
122,Amy,hoo.
129,Amy,"oh, that sounds like fun."
130,Amy,"elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing."
131,Amy,ears and genitalia.
2181,Amy,thank you for doing this.
135,Amy,zack.
2185,Amy,"they didn’t invite everybody but you.bernadette invited me, and stuart lives here."
140,Amy,where would i have picked up an alien parasite?
143,Amy,"i think we need to face the cold, hard truth, i was sexually aroused by penny’s friend zack."
2192,Amy,like you’re doing right now?
149,Amy,is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
150,Amy,and?
152,Amy,"that’s not your lunch, sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
157,Amy,"excuse me? zack? i am amy farrah fowler. we met the other night. i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. until i met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. and yet here i stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs."
158,Amy,"on the other hand, as i look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar. good-bye, zack."
166,Amy,please don’t touch my breasts.
170,Amy,"yes! he had you in the other car, but i got you upgraded."
172,Amy,"don’t worry, penny. you’re my plus-one. you’ll bunk with me. and fyi, travel makes me constipated, so i’m the ideal hotel roommate."
2222,Amy,piercing my ears.
2231,Amy,"that wasn’t so bad. nice. boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet."
2234,Amy,"uh, well, actually, to be honest, i haven’t told her yet."
188,Amy,because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
2238,Amy,"okay. okay. fine. hi, mom."
2239,Amy,"you saw that, huh? hi, mom. how are you doing? oh, good. how’s work? that’s nice. i’m fine. hey, listen, i’ve been meaning to ask, how come aunt doe and aunt florence never got along?"
2240,Amy,i’m sure you’ll find somebody else.
2243,Amy,there you go.
204,Amy,"to comfort you, of course. sheldon told me about leonard dating rajesh’s sister. so i high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart."
206,Amy,"in situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. rawr."
208,Amy,"well, granted, penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. but priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows."
2256,Amy,"i don’t know. i guess i assumed that i would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
214,Amy,i just wanted to check in on you.
2266,Amy,i didn’t know you were interested in dating.
219,Amy,"sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset."
2267,Amy,"oh. okay. anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. you look good."
2269,Amy,"uh, excuse me, can i have my phone back?"
226,Amy,i’m not saying that you’re not fun. you’re the most fun person i know.
232,Amy,"she used to be much more fun, until leonard punched her in the heart."
2284,Amy,just a little peck on the lips.
2287,Amy,i’m gonna go look for other shoes.
2288,Amy,"well, i’m having a good time, too. if you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
242,Amy,"saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?"
2295,Amy,"sure, why not?"
2296,Amy,um about an hour and half.
251,Amy,because i do that now.
2299,Amy,really? you-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
2303,Amy,"no, you’re not."
2305,Amy,what are you guys doing here?
263,Amy,it’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. are you familiar with meme theory?
265,Amy,i should think so. that’s gold.
266,Amy,do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
2313,Amy,no one can go with you?
268,Amy,"then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology."
2317,Amy,see you then.
2320,Amy,if that makes you more comfortable.
275,Amy,pun intended?
2330,Amy,go ahead.
284,Amy,"and that opens her up to justifiable ridicule for wearing them. good one, bernadette. see? ker-razy."
2333,Amy,just one. are you doing okay?
287,Amy,i’m available for experimentation.
2336,Amy,"well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby."
289,Amy,really?
2342,Amy,"thank you. okay, your turn. hmm. seal, hagfish, spongebob squarepants."
2343,Amy,but you can pal around with a hagfish?
297,Amy,i’m giving him emphysema. the least i can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
2347,Amy,"hi, sheldon. i’m just driving home from my mother’s."
2351,Amy,okay. i understand.
2353,Amy,"hi, dave. uh, it’s amy."
308,Amy,it most assuredly is not.
2356,Amy,"well, i was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime."
310,Amy,sheldon?
2358,Amy,how ’bout saturday?
312,Amy,terrific. thank you.  they were out of menthols! get off my back! not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
2359,Amy,why not? he’s actually a very nice guy.
315,Amy,of course i have. but they were strangers and seemed off-put when i engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
316,Amy,"you okay in there, bestie?"
2363,Amy,"you know what? good. i tried to get back together with sheldon, he shot me down. dave likes me. maybe intimate is what i need."
320,Amy,"no, it’s not. it’s a strategic manoeuvre. leonard’s new girlfriend is testing bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. that bitch is crafty."
2369,Amy,"yeah. anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, i pretty much had to take him everywhere."
322,Amy,your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. you wouldn’t last a minute on the serengeti.
325,Amy,"by accepting the invitation, bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. she could ferret out priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights."
327,Amy,how do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
329,Amy,"oh, my metatarsal are barking."
2382,Amy,okay.
336,Amy,i don’t understand. is this a way to break in new shoes?
337,Amy,good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
341,Amy,"she thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what."
342,Amy,how do you want to handle it?
2392,Amy,"i, i can’t believe it. i, i don’t know what to say."
345,Amy,"good golly, penny, your whimsy is boundless.  what do you got for me, wildebeest?"
2398,Amy,i can change it back.
2400,Amy,"um, that sounds nice, but i’m not really hungry right now. i thought maybe we could do presents first."
353,Amy,"i’ll make it simple for you. i study the brain, the organ responsible for beethoven’s fifth symphony. bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for michelob lite. is there something wrong with your neck?"
358,Amy,you should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
2406,Amy,"so, um, should i get under the covers with you?"
2410,Amy,okay.
365,Amy,"she ruled russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
367,Amy,"you can’t blame yourself. when your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. we neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
2418,Amy,"uh, please tell me what to say next."
2422,Amy,are you feeling any better?
2424,Amy,"ooh. gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky."
2427,Amy,"ooh, i just heard something. might be hail, might be gunfire. either way, i’m gonna go take pictures. bye."
380,Amy,"five, six, seven, eight. tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
2430,Amy,"everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them."
2433,Amy,maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. it’s called empathy. it’s something you could work on.
386,Amy,"best friends, besties, bffs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. go on."
2434,Amy,great. now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
2436,Amy,"i feel so, so bad."
2437,Amy,hi. nice to meet you.
396,Amy,aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
2445,Amy,"oh, well, you know, now, now that i’m hearing it, it does sound familiar."
2446,Amy,"well, now i know."
2451,Amy,"well, maybe i don’t like you either."
404,Amy,i can’t imagine that would disturb me. carry on.
2452,Amy,i think i should leave.
2456,Amy,"penny, did you know about this?"
2465,Amy,"oh, sheldon, thank you."
421,Amy,"doesn’t matter. you’re out, he’s in. no date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. hmm, how times change."
2471,Amy,oh. that is so sweet.
2472,Amy,catchy.
2473,Amy,"okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, i already pushed the button. never mind, we’re live."
427,Amy,would you like to dance?
430,Amy,"leonard, you may not have noticed, but i am being a delight here. and you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
2478,Amy,rajesh?
433,Amy,really? are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? i am.
434,Amy,"we just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if i can sweat through these dress shields."
435,Amy,"don’t worry, i’ll lead. "
436,Amy,howard?
446,Amy,"the inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while i was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of madonna and whore."
447,Amy,"no, but it’s only a matter of time. how could i have not seen this coming? now i’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
449,Amy,"no. i’ll let him have tonight. then in the morning, i’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. i mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does."
450,Amy,"now, i assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions."
452,Amy,"homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. you’re the whole package, aren’t you?"
453,Amy,i don’t understand. what differences does it make if leonard goes to wil wheaton’s party?
454,Amy,mortal enemy?
455,Amy,"sheldon, i know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
2505,Amy,think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
460,Amy,he’s great.
2512,Amy,i do know what that’s like. i really do.
2514,Amy,"oh, no. sheldon’s drunk texting me."
467,Amy,"twelve years ago, my cousin irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
2515,Amy,would you like to sing karaoke with us.
2519,Amy,"well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and i was hoping maybe this year we could."
2525,Amy,i’m sorry.
478,Amy,just the two of them?
2537,Amy,"well, he’s seen me without pants on."
491,Amy,we cuddle. final offer.
2544,Amy,"she’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound."
2545,Amy,what a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
502,Amy,"well, i came here to get a bottle of wine like penny taught me to do when you’re sad."
2552,Amy,i hope everything’s okay.
2553,Amy,and his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
507,Amy,what do you want? do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
509,Amy,"what? wait, is this some kind of practical joke? like in norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
2558,Amy,"deaw aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
2562,Amy,get a new computer.
519,Amy,you think they don’t have mirrors in there? i know how i look.
2572,Amy,yes.
2573,Amy,knock it off or i’ll start making w-h sounds for words that just have a w.
527,Amy,"yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
528,Amy,"sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. just like you did with the mailman."
529,Amy,guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
2575,Amy,i thought you might like it.
2577,Amy,"well, you know, as long as you’re happy."
534,Amy,i had half a glass.
2583,Amy,okay.
2586,Amy,will you please tell me where we’re going?
540,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
2588,Amy,so where are we going?
548,Amy,"um, good night, stuart."
551,Amy,it’s so romantic.
553,Amy,"penny, i said right hand red."
554,Amy,"bernadette, left foot yellow."
561,Amy,did kathy geiger laugh?
562,Amy,who would have thought fuzzy fingers fowler is best friends with a bully?
563,Amy,shh. that’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
567,Amy,"there’s habitat for humanity, building houses for the poor."
2623,Amy,"sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car."
2625,Amy,"wow, it’s really coming down."
581,Amy,what’s he doing here?
584,Amy,"jewellery? seriously? sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person i have ever met. do you really think another transparently manip..oh! it’s a tiara! a tiara! i have a tiara! put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
585,Amy,"of course i do, i’m a princess, and this is my tiara!"
2633,Amy,"okay. my turn. um, never have i ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed."
588,Amy,ooh!
2636,Amy,never have i ever honked if i liked anything.
2637,Amy,never have i ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
593,Amy,"too bad. if he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
595,Amy,"if he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
2645,Amy,do you guys want to watch with us?
598,Amy,with a dead man.
2646,Amy,"you know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
604,Amy,penny?
605,Amy,penny?
2672,Amy,hello.
2673,Amy,mike degrasse tyson?
2674,Amy,it’s true. even einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
2675,Amy,how do you know that?
631,Amy,"sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. if it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
635,Amy,how’s it going?
2686,Amy,thank you.
643,Amy,"oh, are we nervous, dr. cooper?"
644,Amy,no. but your thumb does.
647,Amy,do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
650,Amy,no.
651,Amy,no.
652,Amy,sheldon.
654,Amy,i got you a little something.
2703,Amy,"oh, well, the usual gang. penny’s family is coming tomorrow."
656,Amy,"no, no, before i met you, i was a mousy wallflower. but look at me now. i’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. with a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. open it. open it."
2710,Amy,do you realize what’s happening here?
2711,Amy,what took you guys so long?
672,Amy,"i’m so humiliated. i sat there the whole time that we were watching grease, thinking you liked the painting."
2720,Amy,you’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
2724,Amy,what’s wrong?
2725,Amy,"you did already know, right?"
2729,Amy,what?
683,Amy,"oh, screw her. she’s just lucky we let her hang out with us."
2733,Amy,"hi. howard told me you were working late, so i brought dinner."
687,Amy,"originally we were painted nude. but i had him add clothes, ’cause i thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
693,Amy,"well, i don’t know. i think you might look sexy with long hair. the kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. i’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
694,Amy,he showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. i foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
695,Amy,that was kind of uncalled for.
2749,Amy,okay. i feel so bad about leaving him here.
711,Amy,the pretend boyfriend i invented to get my family off my back. it unravelled quickly when i couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
2761,Amy,they didn’t say.
715,Amy,"he’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
2764,Amy,"so, technically, i’d be moving in with my boyfriend?"
2768,Amy,"so, is that a yes?"
2772,Amy,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever. do you have any advice?
725,Amy,"no, he loves that."
2776,Amy,"well, i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. "
2779,Amy,good call. seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running.
2780,Amy,thank you.
2781,Amy,shall we?
734,Amy,what about the science center?
2782,Amy,"come on, sheldon."
741,Amy,right. and that was…
742,Amy,i don’t think that was helpful.
2792,Amy,great.
746,Amy,this is kind of hot.
2796,Amy,"oh, oh, oh."
749,Amy,"tempting choices, but i have something special planned for tonight."
751,Amy,"i had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why i’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
757,Amy,may i offer you something to drink?
2805,Amy,"i’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
2809,Amy,"well, for science, maybe i will."
764,Amy,"the uterus quivers, does it not?"
2815,Amy,"sheldon, i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
2818,Amy,we sleep together once a year. you want other partners?
775,Amy,can’t come in. bad luck to see the bride.
2824,Amy,you’re not making me feel better.
2830,Amy,me. it was mittens.
785,Amy,"well, when you see him, tell him i say thank you."
2833,Amy,"and if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here."
2838,Amy,"you know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over."
791,Amy,"sheldon, how could you do this? it’s our second anniversary."
797,Amy,i’m leaving.
2845,Amy,you never went into that haunted house.
2849,Amy,been 15 minutes. just sayin’.
2850,Amy,how old was it
2867,Amy,"well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
821,Amy,you slept with him?
2870,Amy,"good stuff. so, uh, what about dinner?"
825,Amy,"oh, i don’t know. looks like something used by tinkerbell’s gynecologist."
832,Amy,sheldon told me he had a new assistant named alex. he didn’t mention that alex was a girl.
2882,Amy,why are you speaking klingon?
2885,Amy,you stop that.
2886,Amy,penny was just covering for me. my place has been ready for two weeks.
839,Amy,"really? because just before you became my best friend, i did this all over your apartment."
840,Amy,"look at you, putting on a brave face."
2887,Amy,everybody stop it with that.
848,Amy,yes.
2897,Amy,it’s kind of exciting. i mean we could do whatever we want.
2901,Amy,can it be more of an internal struggle?
856,Amy,"oh, there he is, i got him."
860,Amy,"on the count of three. one, two…"
2912,Amy,it’s just a tiny skin sample. you saw me do it to myself.
2916,Amy,just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
871,Amy,really? i find that inconsistent with everything i know about you.
2919,Amy,"okay, fine, one."
2921,Amy,"those are your eyelashes, move. well, sheldon, i see astrocytes. our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
2924,Amy,"sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. i mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do."
880,Amy,"not to mention, your acting career is going south like sherman. read about it in your book."
2931,Amy,aren’t you glad you participated in this?
885,Amy,"you know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
2934,Amy,"sheldon, i’m not ready to have a baby."
2941,Amy,hello.
2943,Amy,"sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
2944,Amy,i thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
898,Amy,"it’s called fun with flags. they’re not at half-mast, nobody died. let’s try and keep it upbeat."
903,Amy,he was overacting on purpose.
2954,Amy,"sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit."
2957,Amy,"you know, sheldon, instead of fixating on what bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. you’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head."
2958,Amy,anybody else want to try? i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
913,Amy,star trek dvds? why would i want this?
2964,Amy,"ever since i met penny, i’ve been envious of her looks."
917,Amy,sure.
2965,Amy,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off.
919,Amy,"i guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. at some point, they’re bound to lock horns."
920,Amy,"i know, sheldon should just let howard have his little moment in the sun."
2970,Amy,"great, what’d you have in mind?"
2976,Amy,"well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
935,Amy,you?
936,Amy,"oh, yeah? well, you’re not gonna see this coming. "
937,Amy,"oh, my god,"
938,Amy,"just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change i’ve been meaning to take to the bank."
2987,Amy,"sheldon. okay, you can have this back in the morning."
940,Amy,"i do. penny, bernadette and i are sorry."
946,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
2994,Amy,just don’t smoke.
948,Amy,"sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?"
2997,Amy,"oh, uh, i don’t know. sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
2999,Amy,well.
953,Amy,"i have to say, i’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking."
3002,Amy,"well, shall we start over?"
959,Amy,that was great. rub my chest again.  
960,Amy,i don’t have a bath thermometer.
3007,Amy,no.
966,Amy,"oh, sheldon, am i glad you’re back. taking a turn for the worst. i think i’m going to need another bath."
968,Amy,"all right, all right. but i really was sick at the beginning. it’s just been so nice having you take care of me."
969,Amy,i feel terrible i did this.
3018,Amy,you have got to be kidding me.
971,Amy,i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie.
973,Amy,that’s true. i’ve been a very bad girl.
974,Amy,one second. i want to put on some music.
3021,Amy,sheldon and i are living together.
3022,Amy,bernadette got her doctorate.
3028,Amy,"well, that was quite a day."
3029,Amy,i was afraid you’d be too tired.
3030,Amy,hi.
985,Amy,thanks.
3033,Amy,"so, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together."
3036,Amy,"thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
992,Amy,forget it. i don’t expect you guys to understand.
995,Amy,"it is, isn’t it?"
3044,Amy,"sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
1000,Amy,sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. he can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
3052,Amy,she was gonna find out eventually.
1011,Amy,so stupid.
1013,Amy,"no, no, no, it doesn’t. thor is a god. the hammer is his, only he can use it. it’s like sheldon and his toothbrush. or his thin, beckoning lips."
3062,Amy,really? you’re never gonna touch their baby?
1015,Amy,maybe we missed something.
1026,Amy,"no. hulk picked up thor, thor picked up the hammer."
3074,Amy,bye.
1029,Amy,"all right, well, how was work today? did you exchange your research with kripke?"
3078,Amy,"sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
3079,Amy,"i don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
3085,Amy,it’s in our agreement. i have to laugh.
1043,Amy,see? you can’t. i’m gonna go see if leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
1044,Amy,"oh, there you are. when do i get a key to our apartment?"
3091,Amy,what do you think?
3092,Amy,it’s amazing a machine can do that.
3093,Amy,"all right. now, i’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
3095,Amy,yes. i’m looking at puppi
1051,Amy,and this is amy.
3099,Amy,what’s that? are you working on your resume?
1054,Amy,what? why? is it the message? i only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
3102,Amy,i think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.
1056,Amy,"then what the hell, sheldon? we have been going out for over two years, and i have been nothing but patient with you. i watch your dopey space movies. i signed your ridiculous contract. i even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. i am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. you give me one good reason why i can’t live here."
1057,Amy,what?
3108,Amy,"no, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. and i’m proud of you, for reasons i’m sure have something to do with my father. and if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. because i love you exactly the way you are."
1062,Amy,hello.
3110,Amy,"well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?"
3112,Amy,"oh. all this week, the early music society of pasadena is doing a joint concert with the san gabriel renaissance choir."
3114,Amy,"hey, you’re home early."
1067,Amy,"well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?"
1069,Amy,"i’m your girlfriend. that’s my job. and i know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return."
3117,Amy,i give up.
3118,Amy,no. i really give up.
1075,Amy,"hello? another medical emergency? what’s wrong with him now? i seriously doubt he was bitten by a chinese bird spider. how exactly does a bump feel asian? just put him on the phone. sheldon, i am not driving over there again. because i drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. yes, i still want to be your emergency contact. yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. i’m on my way. brain tumour would explain a lot."
3125,Amy,you sure? they’re open till dos.
1079,Amy,did you tell penny how helpful she was?
3128,Amy,what feelings?
1082,Amy,why? what happened?
1086,Amy,"typical bureaucratic nonsense. you can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional."
3138,Amy,"oh, an euler’s disk, fun."
1091,Amy,hooky? i’ve never played hooky in my life. my mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
3140,Amy,the food here’s supposed to be great. don’t fill up on chips.
1093,Amy,"hmm. we doing just disney or california adventure, too?"
3141,Amy,"oh, look. it’s bert, at the bar. we should go say hi."
1097,Amy,"ooh, that sounds like fun."
1104,Amy,"oh, it’s okay, i’m used to it. the other day at whole foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle."
1107,Amy,"boy, i’m really curious what was in that letter."
3157,Amy,were you aware of this?
1112,Amy,absolutely.
3160,Amy,that’s why they’re doing it.
3161,Amy,i’m going to bed.
1118,Amy,"no, it’s not."
3167,Amy,are you really worried about revealing secrets to stephen hawking?
3172,Amy,why? are they naughty?
1126,Amy,is that a problem?
3177,Amy,"well, that’s sweet. i bet you’ll have fun."
1132,Amy,"professor tupperman is dead, and that makes us?"
3180,Amy,"well, i’m not going, but i do think it’s nice you want to."
1134,Amy,giving mrs. davis the box set of roots was?
3184,Amy,he is an indoor cat.
1137,Amy,she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause.
1139,Amy,sheldon!
1140,Amy,"well, you’ll always be an academic success, but i seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends."
1142,Amy,"i’m sorry you’re upset. you know, sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this."
3190,Amy,because it’s between them. 
3191,Amy,hi. 
3192,Amy,shh.
3194,Amy,because you don’t want her to go to comic-con.
1150,Amy,exactly. how does that make you feel?
3202,Amy,"no, sheldon. we are not getting a life-size spider-man statue."
3203,Amy,"for the last time, no hulk, no batman, no life-size statues."
1158,Amy,"no rules? we’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the blue man group, are we?"
3206,Amy,don’t listen to them. what’s weird is that penny almost got a science fact right.
1167,Amy,"nineteen. yes, this is turning out to be even better than vegas."
1168,Amy,here we go. fifteen?
1170,Amy,i don’t like this.
1173,Amy,i’ll tell you what they think. they think our relationship is a joke.
3221,Amy,that’s not true.
1175,Amy,and now?
3224,Amy,what’s wrong?
1177,Amy,wow. talk dirty to me.
1180,Amy,okay.
1181,Amy,oh.
1185,Amy,go away! sheldon is nibbling on my  14! yes!
1192,Amy,ignore him. he’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think i understand the severity of your social anxiety.
1193,Amy,"excuse me, but i’m a neurobiologist. i think i’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!"
3241,Amy,that’s a ridiculous rule.
1197,Amy,"because i looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
3245,Amy,terrific. do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
3246,Amy,"number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition."
1201,Amy,"which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation."
1203,Amy,"you be cool. guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to penny."
3256,Amy,"fine. fine. you want me to blow my nose? here, i’ll blow it. better?"
1213,Amy,mm-hmm. it was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
3266,Amy,"revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
3267,Amy,"revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
1222,Amy,what?
3272,Amy,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
1229,Amy,let me listen. sounds like leonard.
3280,Amy,"sheldon, are you okay?"
1233,Amy,driving sheldon to work.
3281,Amy,"it’s okay, i’m sure we’ll find it."
1235,Amy,"sheldon, your fight’s with leonard. penny’s got nothing to do…"
1237,Amy,you want to take the bus to work?
3285,Amy,phones can do that?
1239,Amy,"we’re sorry, rajesh. "
3286,Amy,you’re welcome. how is it?
3289,Amy,"weiches kätzchen, warmes kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. liebes kätzchen, müdes kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt."
3292,Amy,"now, i’m sure many of you are wondering how fun with flags began. "
3293,Amy,could have played that on my harp.
1246,Amy,no.
3295,Amy,"and don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. just keep trying.  oh, thank god, welcome to fun with flags."
1248,Amy,"well, off the top of my head, i’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. plus, when we first met, penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you."
3296,Amy,and what does that have to do with flags?
1256,Amy,to the neil mobile.
1260,Amy,ain’t no big surprise.
3311,Amy,"oh. hello, you’re on fun with flags."
1268,Amy,"all right. indiana jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. if he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
3316,Amy,is this part of your super-aging?
1272,Amy,really?
1274,Amy,of course i’m in.
3330,Amy,i’m sorry i called you a quitter.
1283,Amy,"sheldon, i have some exciting news to tell you."
1284,Amy,i’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. isn’t that great? we could have lunch together. we could carpool. 
3335,Amy,"okay, fine, let’s say you never win a nobel prize. let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?"
3336,Amy,so many warnings.
1291,Amy,"wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?"
1292,Amy,i don’t mind. i’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
3341,Amy,"thanks, but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that."
3343,Amy,"sheldon, i’m so sorry."
1299,Amy,gentlemen.
3349,Amy,are you feeling okay?
1302,Amy,sheldon.
3350,Amy,"oh, i’m sorry to hear that."
1304,Amy,"what do you want, sheldon?"
3356,Amy,"oh, i don’t know, i mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. i mean, what will we have really accomplished? you know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks."
3366,Amy,of course. i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…
3372,Amy,thank you.
1328,Amy,that americans can’t handle the metric system?
1333,Amy,i’m not.
1334,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. you don’t deserve any credit. all you did was misread some numbers on a table. a very easy table, too. honestly, i’m embarrassed for you."
3384,Amy,uh-huh.
3385,Amy,"i don’t know what they look like, but sure."
1340,Amy,sorry.
3388,Amy,good thinking.
1344,Amy,"yes, and i’ve heard so much about you. hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. i can’t believe i dress like a celebrity."
3392,Amy,i miss you.
1346,Amy,is it really worth getting upset about?
3393,Amy,"it’s so strange, earlier today i ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
1349,Amy,"maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
1352,Amy,sheldon.
1360,Amy,hello.
1361,Amy,"so, what tools did you bring?"
3408,Amy,you don’t get it. i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.
1369,Amy,you told lucy he was a pathetic mess.
1373,Amy,seriously?
1374,Amy,"i think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
1377,Amy,are you honestly comparing thanksgiving dinner at wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
1381,Amy,it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. were you unable to consummate the marriage?
1382,Amy,"is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"
3429,Amy,"guys, something happened."
3430,Amy,"you know, can i borrow that movie? those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
1385,Amy,sheldon.
1392,Amy,i know how you feel. sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that roomba vacuum. i kick it when he’s not looking.
3445,Amy,"okay, sheldon, thanks for checking in. talk to you tomorrow? oh, okay, bye."
1399,Amy,"sheldon, can i come in?"
3449,Amy,you guys doing okay down there?
3450,Amy,"boy, i just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. can you do it?"
1405,Amy,"sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. why don’t you and i go for a nice walk together?"
1406,Amy,"thank you, rajesh."
1407,Amy,you should probably go.
3454,Amy,"sheldon, i don’t think you understand how being broken up works. the only way i can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. every time i see you, it re-traumatizes me. i go through the pain all over again."
3457,Amy,"i’m not gonna be your roommate, sheldon."
1411,Amy,right now? why?
1412,Amy,how come you never said she was pregnant?
3460,Amy,"sheldon, what’s wrong?"
3462,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s up?"
1415,Amy,that’s wonderful. so you’re at the hospital?
3463,Amy,i miss you.
3465,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s new?"
3469,Amy,i really had to go home for this?
1423,Amy,where’d you go?
1428,Amy,"happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. "
1429,Amy,yay.
1434,Amy,i don’t understand.
1437,Amy,"that’s fine, she’s dead."
1438,Amy,just really glad you’re back.
1456,Amy,i don’t think i want to go out with you anymore.
1458,Amy,hello.
1461,Amy,"hello, mr. rat brain. not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
1466,Amy,"oh, you forgot your quartz."
1481,Amy,"no, that’s not true. my boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. like, way worse than you."
1488,Amy,"okay, i don’t have time for this. i’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
1493,Amy,oh. you mean like a museum?
1496,Amy,"well, last time i got dressed up and had tea was when i was five. just me, my teddy bear, raggedy ann and my hamster. "
1497,Amy,it was. till my hamster ate all her babies. it got less cute really fast.
1500,Amy,gosh.
1502,Amy,i told you it was penny.
1508,Amy,i propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in napa valley.
1511,Amy,i got you your own room. 
1512,Amy,it doesn’t. i know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
1516,Amy,i’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. work with me.
1523,Amy,why? because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
1525,Amy,"okay. i need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now."
1531,Amy,"fine, it’s true. i deserve romance, and i didn’t know how else to make it happen."
1532,Amy,sheldon.
1534,Amy,"okay, have fun."
1535,Amy,really? i do.
1537,Amy,yeah. you actually do have room for one up there.
1538,Amy,"i’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. i’m a little surprised you didn’t get applecare. anyway, enjoy your life. where do i sign?"
1540,Amy,of course not. this is just leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. he’s manipulating you like he always does.
1547,Amy,which is stronger than ever.
1548,Amy,you don’t need to explain yourself to him.
1555,Amy,really?
1561,Amy,that’s true. do whatever you want.
1562,Amy,oh. let me guess. there’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
1564,Amy,"great, so what do you need me for?"
1565,Amy,all right.
1572,Amy,i have.
1582,Amy,"oh, hi."
1594,Amy,"what does your card say, bernadette?"
1595,Amy,"dun, dun, dun. he started it."
1600,Amy,yeah.
1610,Amy,then get the other one. pass the butter.
1613,Amy,"well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat."
1615,Amy,why would they still be using ddr3? are they nuts?
1620,Amy,you’re welcome.
1628,Amy,what’s a zune?
1629,Amy,"no, what are you doing? no, no, pick that back up. you know it’s good. you did the research."
1634,Amy,what is it?
1636,Amy,i can’t feel my legs.
1652,Amy,"i know, it’s weird, right?"
1659,Amy,"don’t get me wrong, i’m glad they’re friends. i just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already."
1660,Amy,really? what did you do?
1671,Amy,did you ever watch professor proton when you were a kid?
1677,Amy,"hey, guys."
1680,Amy,"sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. she got hurt."
1683,Amy,atomic magnets?
1684,Amy,"so, what are the living arrangements gonna be?"
1687,Amy,"here, i made you some strawberry quik."
1689,Amy,you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
1691,Amy,"and if it turns out you don’t, you and i could live together."
1696,Amy,he was really angry that you suggested he move out.
1698,Amy,"you’re probably right. so, what are you guys doing?"
1707,Amy,fine. whisper it.
1711,Amy,can i stop now?
1718,Amy,i wonder if stalin considered any other animals.
1725,Amy,"okay, so no bernadette."
1727,Amy,"i understand. you know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends."
1732,Amy,because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
1736,Amy,i don’t know. the important thing is i am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
1737,Amy,"so, after drinks with bernadette, i get home, and penny calls to complain about her. and then while i’m talking to penny, i get a text from bernadette."
1745,Amy,"oh. well, good luck getting her to do that. she’s probably off getting another manicure. you remember when she did that? you remember?"
1748,Amy,"no, and neither did our waiter."
1758,Amy,of course. can i have a bite of your burger?
1760,Amy,sheldon and i got an eight-point-two out of ten.
1763,Amy,it would make me so happy if you said things like that.
1764,Amy,"sheldon, what did you expect?"
1766,Amy,does it matter?
1775,Amy,"i’m gonna go with penny on this one. then again, why wouldn’t i? i mean, we go way back."
1780,Amy,then i think it’s a terrific idea.
1785,Amy,but they’re called fairly manilow.
1786,Amy,great.
1791,Amy,"so, um, now that penny’s not coming…"
1794,Amy,"look at us out, while penny’s in the room studying."
1795,Amy,it is. but enough about penny. let’s talk about us. we’re looking good.
1797,Amy,"don’t amy me. we’re always talking about how hot penny is. come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those hadron colliders?"
1804,Amy,can you believe this nerd?
1819,Amy,i’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
1833,Amy,you have a nice night.
1842,Amy,that has to wait. this weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
1843,Amy,"dr. lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?"
1846,Amy,what’s with the clothes?
1853,Amy,"oh, that would be so much fun. we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos."
1869,Amy,this is an easy one. you love this guy.
1871,Amy,"it’s not you. now think, there’s a car named after him."
1873,Amy,hello.
1874,Amy,did they figure out what’s wrong?
1878,Amy,it’s nice they’re getting exercise.
1882,Amy,twenty eight.
1887,Amy,"he wore me down. and i was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
1892,Amy,and i’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
1893,Amy,"sheldon, you can’t go back there."
1917,Amy,i don’t hate you. i love you.
1922,Amy,thank you. and it’s figs.
1931,Amy,okay. the next game is called hot boiled beans.
1932,Amy,"one person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
1935,Amy,"oh, my favourite, george lucas can talk all the way through star wars, i say one word and i’m banished to the kitchen."
1936,Amy,sheldon?
1939,Amy,i actually can’t go ice-skating. i have unnaturally brittle ankles.
1942,Amy,what do you say? sounds kind of perfect.
1946,Amy,"yeah, but it’s okay."
1947,Amy,"i promised myself, if i ever got friends, i’d do whatever they said. really, i’m lucky you found me before a cult did."
1959,Amy,"sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. just be patient, i’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for."
1961,Amy,"look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
1962,Amy,because you’re happy they’re elevated.
1966,Amy,"you’ve been working so much lately, i’m glad you didn’t forget about date night."
1971,Amy,"sheldon, i want you to take that cap off."
1973,Amy,"sheldon, stop it, i’m not kidding. take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
1974,Amy,you don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
1975,Amy,that’s not true.
1978,Amy,"it’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. now, i’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off."
1984,Amy,what is it?
1985,Amy,what?
1997,Amy,in the 1800s that was considered flirting.
2002,Amy,"“what about the future?” asked amelia. he looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “there is no future without you.” he pulled her in close. she began to tremble all over. she felt his warm breath…"
2015,Amy,"oh, hey."
2017,Amy,"so what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
2022,Amy,one of us would have taken you in.
2026,Amy,"other than the fact that i had it, that was a magical night."
2028,Amy,forget it.
2030,Amy,why?
2032,Amy,the two of us could do it.
2039,Amy,"so, how do we start?"
2043,Amy,"so, that’s the key to the door? that’s it?"
2047,Amy,let’s say it together.
16388,Leonard,"well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up."
16393,Leonard,perfect.
16395,Leonard,an arrow.
16402,Leonard,"boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games."
16415,Leonard,what? you’re kidding!
16419,Leonard,not too bad. did you hear about howard and bernadette?
16422,Leonard,i didn’t say raj. who said raj?
16429,Leonard,"whatever it is, we’re here for you. you can tell us anything."
16444,Leonard,that’s great.
16451,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not alone in here."
16455,Leonard,"top of her class, cambridge university. licensed to practice law in three countries. and your face."
16461,Leonard,i got you the lamb kabob.
16464,Leonard,"uh, captain kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
16465,Leonard,"what are you gonna do, sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
16472,Leonard,this is ridiculous. 
16474,Leonard,"okay, i’ll sign it!"
16475,Leonard,"okay, see you later."
16478,Leonard,"okay, now i have to ask. what do they do?"
16482,Leonard,and what?
16483,Leonard,"excuse me, but einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
16485,Leonard,you okay?
16490,Leonard,yeah. how did you know?
16492,Leonard,really? in front of your sister?
16494,Leonard,wonder why she didn’t tell me.
16502,Leonard,"gals? who are you, fred flintstone?"
16511,Leonard,what did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
16518,Leonard,"i don’t know, i just got a text. come on, hurry."
16519,Leonard,"sheldon, let’s go!"
16521,Leonard,"so, how is she?"
16531,Leonard,i’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
16534,Leonard,"no, she wouldn’t."
16535,Leonard,you really are a mean little man.
16543,Leonard,"well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled macy’s day balloon."
16547,Leonard,"so, what’s your news, bernadette?"
16552,Leonard,in my bed?
16553,Leonard,"oh, you heard?"
16555,Leonard,"oh, yeah. mouth-to-mouth mona. you know, she used to date howard?"
16557,Leonard,"okay, well, how about this. until priya gets her own place, you stay here and i’ll stay at your apartment."
16562,Leonard,until you have kids.
16564,Leonard,"bring a ball or a frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
16579,Leonard,priya’s going back to india.
16595,Leonard,you called my mother?
16599,Leonard,got any advice?
16600,Leonard,"excuse me. you’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
16604,Leonard,"sorry, sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
16608,Leonard,"i’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, captain sheldon cooper."
16613,Leonard,"oh, uh, priya’s calling in a few minutes on skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
16618,Leonard,"yes, i’ve always admired that about you."
16621,Leonard,"you know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. they’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
16622,Leonard,you video-chat with amy all the time. how is this different?
16626,Leonard,"oh, i miss you, too."
16629,Leonard,"not easy, but we’re making it work."
16630,Leonard,what?
16635,Leonard,"sheldon, you do this all the time. you fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
16643,Leonard,"yeah, yeah. uh, okay. you’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. ugh!"
16656,Leonard,i don’t think so.
16657,Leonard,"oh, hey, babe, i think i figured this thing out."
16671,Leonard,"it was good, good. just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
16677,Leonard,"ah, sure. that’d be nice."
16683,Leonard,"that sounds like a late night, and i have work in the morning, so…"
16685,Leonard,i’m not moody. i’m fun.
16689,Leonard,"i just can’t figure out what happened. i put my left leg in, i took my left leg out, i put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
16696,Leonard,not bad. i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would.
16699,Leonard,"hey, how go the wedding plans, howard?"
16700,Leonard,"see, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. i can spend my nights doing whatever i want."
16706,Leonard,do you really want that?
16709,Leonard,you think she’s taking advantage of him?
16714,Leonard,"yeah, real big of you."
16718,Leonard,"well, they don’t have an excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
16723,Leonard,hang on. can you do any better?
16728,Leonard,two ten and you throw in the iron man helmet.
16733,Leonard,thank you.
16740,Leonard,"i’d like to propose a toast. the dream to go up into space is one we all share, and howard’s making that a reality. we’re all very proud of you."
16742,Leonard,"pretty cool about howard, huh?"
16744,Leonard,"you never stop talking, do you?"
16759,Leonard,ten.
16763,Leonard,what’s gunning with god? i’m afraid to ask.
16765,Leonard,"all right, that settles it, we’re going out. do you like sushi? there’s a great little place down the street."
16769,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, that, too."
16770,Leonard,"it’s kind of like the loch ness monster. maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. we’ll probably never know. but sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
16774,Leonard,your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on burbank.
16777,Leonard,you want some oreos?
16778,Leonard,"no, regular."
16789,Leonard,hang on. looks like everyone’s a winner.
16795,Leonard,leonard.
16801,Leonard,how many times are you gonna tell me? what’s with you?
16804,Leonard,"will you relax? i’ll get it in a minute. hey, how was work?"
16805,Leonard,"excuse me.  a couple of circulars, nothing important."
16827,Leonard,"well, i was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
16840,Leonard,"well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and i’m pretty sure alice is the stuff i want to do."
16844,Leonard,no.
16850,Leonard,"oh, no, no, you have it wrong. no. i, i was going to be a jackass, but i stopped myself. i stayed a good guy, so, i’m gonna pass on the sex. but you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. that’s kind of my superpower. i’m, like, captain good guy."
16852,Leonard,"hey, priya."
16865,Leonard,"leonard’s coming down the home stretch! come on, horsey, you can do this! damn. come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! yes! first place. i would have been a great jockey if i weren’t too tall. and scared of horses. sheldon, you’re up."
16876,Leonard,why do i have to talk to penny? she’s not my girlfriend.
16877,Leonard,moo-shu is penny.
16898,Leonard,sounds like most of my dates.
16910,Leonard,"oh, yeah, sure. there’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in south america."
16919,Leonard,"see? now, that’s the great thing. we’re out as friends. this is not a date. sex is off the table. so, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. sorry. spoiler alert."
16921,Leonard,"come on, you enjoyed the movie. i saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
16932,Leonard,i wear dorky t-shirts and glasses.
16936,Leonard,"um, let’s see. hiking. karaoke in koreatown. any jennifer aniston movie."
16937,Leonard,"no, it’s fine. you can ditch away."
16939,Leonard,"interesting. so now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
16942,Leonard,that’s kind of between me and…
16945,Leonard,"when you were telling kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as waitress in a local production of the cheesecake factory?"
16950,Leonard,"just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
16951,Leonard,maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
16955,Leonard,i am such an asthmatic dumbass. i had a weird night.
16959,Leonard,sure. i guess.
16980,Leonard,"sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
16985,Leonard,what are you talking about?
16988,Leonard,"just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
16993,Leonard,"no, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
16997,Leonard,sure. you want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
17005,Leonard,you bet. i am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
17009,Leonard,"yeah. you, too. uh, jimmy, this is sheldon and raj and howard."
17022,Leonard,it wasn’t fun for me.
17023,Leonard,"come on, guys."
17029,Leonard,what are you doing here?
17030,Leonard,laxative.
17034,Leonard,are you okay to drive?
17041,Leonard,yeah.
17043,Leonard,"morning, jimmy."
17047,Leonard,i might kill him right now.
17049,Leonard,"no, you’re done. i want you out of my apartment right now."
17054,Leonard,"sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. i really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the green lantern movie."
17057,Leonard,how come you’re not doing a mission? you’re just wandering around.
17058,Leonard,some people go outside and do that.
17065,Leonard,i don’t know what to tell you. buy her something.
17069,Leonard,what are you gonna do?
17070,Leonard,"you know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them."
17071,Leonard,it’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
17072,Leonard,"look, howard, i’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but i watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. do not throw her back."
17076,Leonard,"excuse me, amy. penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
17078,Leonard,"not like a date, a date."
17081,Leonard,"i didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship."
17086,Leonard,"so, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
17087,Leonard,"yeah, that sounds right."
17091,Leonard,"uh, let’s see. uh, i am an experimental physicist at cal-tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, i’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
17099,Leonard,you said always. you’ll always have feelings for me.
17100,Leonard,"so, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. this isn’t working out, but i’ll always have feelings for you. i’m sorry i slept with your best friend, but i’ll always have feelings for you. here’s the thing, lisa, i’m into dudes now, but i’ll always have feelings for you."
17101,Leonard,i have feelings for you.
17102,Leonard,"no, it’s not. always made it worse."
17103,Leonard,"no, i’m not."
17106,Leonard,"wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question."
17107,Leonard,you’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
17115,Leonard,"well, i’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
17117,Leonard,what if i dump you?
17124,Leonard,"well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
17135,Leonard,i don’t want beef jerky.
17138,Leonard,"well, hey, we’re grown-ups. we can still be friends."
17143,Leonard,well…
17160,Leonard,"how about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
17173,Leonard,"so, have a good night."
17184,Leonard,right. sorry.
17194,Leonard,fine.
17197,Leonard,aah!
17199,Leonard,uh-huh.
17200,Leonard,"you know what, i’m so tired i can’t even think straight. i’m going home. will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
17202,Leonard,"whatever, sheldon. i’m exhausted. i’m not taking you to the dentist."
17205,Leonard,"i don’t know what that is, but if it means i can go home and sleep, then yes."
17209,Leonard,‘sup?
17215,Leonard,absolutely. if you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
17218,Leonard,"it’s just a blackout, i’m sure the power will be back on soon."
17225,Leonard,"no, thanks. i’m good."
17227,Leonard,"no, he’s crazy. sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
17239,Leonard,"really. who do you think did that, sheldon?"
17242,Leonard,it’s not funny. that mistake got published.
17247,Leonard,what are you doing hiding back there?
17254,Leonard,hey.
17255,Leonard,"is that your laundry? you only have, like, six things in there."
17260,Leonard,good luck catching a man with that attitude.
17272,Leonard,what’s he doing here?
17273,Leonard,"h-h-h-hang on, howard. barry, how good of a shot are you?"
17275,Leonard,"all right, this is one-on-one. first person to five wins the office. any questions? yes, sheldon?"
17277,Leonard,you know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
17282,Leonard,"uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. the highest bounce wins the office."
17287,Leonard,"sheldon, relax."
17291,Leonard,hang in there. i’ll be right back. 
17295,Leonard,there’s no such thing as haircut records.
17299,Leonard,sure. what are you doing?
17302,Leonard,"sheldon, be nice."
17308,Leonard,"i don’t know. between you playing chess like bobby fischer and sheldon being okay with you in his spot, i’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
17309,Leonard,"oh, uh, he’s crazy."
17312,Leonard,great. what are you going to do first?
17327,Leonard,"good point, i’m in."
17345,Leonard,"well, we’re always the good guys. in d&d, we’re lawful good, in city of heroes, we’re the heroes, in grand theft auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
17346,Leonard,"uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, i think raj beat you to it."
17347,Leonard,"uh, it is, but i think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny.  i was wrong, it’s still funny."
17355,Leonard,prove it.
17359,Leonard,you went to the comic-book store by yourself?
17360,Leonard,"wow. no, it’s great. also, uh, mint in box."
17363,Leonard,they’re collectables.
17372,Leonard,"well, you should talk to stuart."
17378,Leonard,"that’s amazing. you’ll be like his pit crew. a word of caution, i would not do your stephen hawking impression in front of him."
17387,Leonard,you do realize you own his ass right now.
17389,Leonard,it’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. i’d take it and run.
17392,Leonard,"also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body."
17394,Leonard,"no, he didn’t."
17395,Leonard,"good for you, howard. i’m proud of you. and still, you’re the first one of us to get married. we have to do something special."
17398,Leonard,"well, i don’t know. it’s a bachelor party. there could be strippers. wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?"
17402,Leonard,"you know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their s.a.t.’s."
17406,Leonard,"oh, hey, wil. nice of you to make it out tonight for howard."
17420,Leonard,"come on, please."
17426,Leonard,"come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the russians."
17444,Leonard,"okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. why don’t we just start doing that now?"
17453,Leonard,shame on her.
17456,Leonard,"well, if you had a physical relationship, i’d say propose during sex. turns out that’s a real mood killer."
17458,Leonard,pretty much.
17464,Leonard,is it still weird ’cause i proposed?
17473,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
17479,Leonard,"oh, wow."
17480,Leonard,i doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
17481,Leonard,"come on, raj, we’re ready to start."
17482,Leonard,hmm.
17493,Leonard,where do you stand on it? 
17494,Leonard,"then i believe that god created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me."
17495,Leonard,hey.
17499,Leonard,"no occasion. you know, things have been a little weird between us, so i wanted to throw together a fun night just for you."
17513,Leonard,that’s great. get out.
17516,Leonard,okay.
17518,Leonard,"so, is it everything you hoped it would be?"
17524,Leonard,maybe your tongue is shrinking.
17531,Leonard,"okay, i think i understand."
17535,Leonard,gelatinous sphere.
17538,Leonard,"yes, you walked around for a week saying, sheldon unhappy with casting choice."
17539,Leonard,what’s your point?
17541,Leonard,"so, i had to take sheldon to the dentist this morning."
17547,Leonard,mm-hmm.
17553,Leonard,not gonna happen.
17557,Leonard,"sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?"
17564,Leonard,given her what?
17566,Leonard,"oh, sure. please join us."
17573,Leonard,thank you.
17584,Leonard,"batman. batman and robin. uh, wonder twins plus the monkey. wonder twins plus the monkey and batman."
17589,Leonard,how could you miss that?
17592,Leonard,"a solar system. uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? i don’t…"
17609,Leonard,"yeah, maybe. open it first."
17613,Leonard,"oh, what a nice surprise. i don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before."
17614,Leonard,no. although howard was making some real strides in that area until he met bernadette.
17628,Leonard,what? here? now?
17632,Leonard,nothing.
17634,Leonard,"yeah. oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?"
17636,Leonard,sometimes i like to turn this on and pretend i’m the super villain magneto.
17637,Leonard,but what i really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
17639,Leonard,"ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light."
17647,Leonard,"oh. that’s great. great, great, great. why wait so long to tell me?"
17658,Leonard,i did a bad thing.
17669,Leonard,empathetic.
17671,Leonard,what?
17677,Leonard,"no, i assumed it would be good. then i read it."
17688,Leonard,i thought you had plans with amy.
17693,Leonard,"because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him."
17696,Leonard,"they’d say, why does he touch himself so much?"
17703,Leonard,"oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg."
17709,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what was that? i had a little stroke after oral."
17713,Leonard,"say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. england sucks, you suck, usa number one."
17724,Leonard,what do you mean?
17729,Leonard,what?
17730,Leonard,now you’re just being ridiculous.
17732,Leonard,"you, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?"
17734,Leonard,"i, well, i see her around. i like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude."
17740,Leonard,"hey, alex, let me ask you something. my girlfriend knows this guy at school. he’s got an english accent."
17742,Leonard,"right. because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two star trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. i got to get me some of that."
17746,Leonard,hi.
17753,Leonard,we’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
17754,Leonard,"you’re right, you should go."
17756,Leonard,your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. you’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
17762,Leonard,maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
17766,Leonard,because i can never understand your side.
17774,Leonard,"why would it trouble you? it’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
17782,Leonard,"yeah, come on, howard. hook that worm."
17785,Leonard,"you know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
17791,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little christmas gift i got you."
17792,Leonard,would you just look inside?
17804,Leonard,great. what do you do?
17807,Leonard,walls are getting closer.
17819,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. you know all the christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. just admit it. you’re getting a little yuletide spirit."
17821,Leonard,"i grew up in a house full of crazy academics. instead of leaving santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. and in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded."
17823,Leonard,the drawbridge is lowering.
17825,Leonard,"uh, okay."
17827,Leonard,"okay. so wolowitz and stuart are paralyzed, santa’s dead, and i picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
17829,Leonard,what recordings?
17831,Leonard,"well, most of saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. how about you?"
17834,Leonard,"well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff."
17837,Leonard,sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
17839,Leonard,she knows i have a girlfriend. it’s so weird.
17853,Leonard,i’m missing something.  did you say something to penny about alex?
17870,Leonard,how is this my fault?
17878,Leonard,"to my bedroom, so i can take everything off but those glasses. and maybe the boots."
17898,Leonard,what kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
17903,Leonard,"oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. that’s so much worse than having your car stolen."
17907,Leonard,"uh, we’re going to the comic-con in bakersfield. they have a big costume contest. it’s cooler than it sounds."
17909,Leonard,"thanks, but we’ve got it covered."
17939,Leonard,is my coitus whimsically inventive?
17941,Leonard,we don’t ask sheldon things like that.
17947,Leonard,that was a huge spoiler.
17952,Leonard,"that’s it. i don’t, i don’t have to put up with this."
17965,Leonard,harry and ginny get together?
17971,Leonard,"oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? i take a lot of medicine."
17980,Leonard,‘kay.
17987,Leonard,you could be a little more into it.
17990,Leonard,what you looking at?
17994,Leonard,"oh, wow."
17996,Leonard,want to come to dinner with us?
18003,Leonard,oh.
18005,Leonard,"i know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night."
18010,Leonard,"isn’t it kind of nice? i mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person."
18013,Leonard,"um, it did end happy for you. you’re here with me."
18016,Leonard,"this one does, and you’re the reason why."
18025,Leonard,and i’m cool with surprises. but nothing on a jumbotron. i don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
18030,Leonard,"come on, buddy, open up."
18032,Leonard,"nope, just, just, whoa."
18033,Leonard,"raj, what’s going on?"
18036,Leonard,the surf and turf sounds good. see if they have corn on the cob.
18038,Leonard,"so, amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?"
18039,Leonard,why? what happened?
18044,Leonard,"she’s pretty good, huh?"
18050,Leonard,you don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
18052,Leonard,"yes, i know, you’re too smart for this."
18054,Leonard,"guys, please don’t make this a school project where i’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch."
18062,Leonard,"okay, who’s ready for some science? me, too. okay, i am dr. leonard hofstadter. i am here with my friends dr. cooper and real-life astronaut howard wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. how cool, you ask? well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. did i just learn something new and have fun doing it? what? all right. so now let’s bring out theoretical physicist dr. sheldon cooper."
18068,Leonard,"sheldon, come on. it’s getting late. time to go."
18083,Leonard,"hey, uh, listen, everybody. before howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father."
18091,Leonard,"okay, my turn. your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did."
18094,Leonard,"well, one of them is."
18096,Leonard,"yeah, i think so."
18106,Leonard,i’m not gonna schmooze anybody. i’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
18111,Leonard,not that you need it. i bet you look great in a swimsuit.
18115,Leonard,"well, i’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, i just wanted to say hi and let you know that i’ll be throwing my hat in the ring."
18120,Leonard,that’s enough cardio for me. i’m just gonna stretch out before i hit the weights.
18123,Leonard,nurse’s office.
18124,Leonard,"asthma, heart, some kind of attack. i’m fine, though."
18130,Leonard,"oh, yeah. no. thanks, that would be great help. you realize you might kill some of them."
18134,Leonard,"okay, okay. guys, what are we doing here?"
18135,Leonard,"oh, you do what you want, but i don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. friends are forever."
18136,Leonard,i’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
18144,Leonard,"oh, please, don’t do that."
18145,Leonard,"ah, don’t. if they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel."
18146,Leonard,"with all the tv sheldon was talking about, i had the greatest idea ever. it even blows away my idea for a star wars themed coffee shop called brewbacca’s. you need to watch buffy the vampire slayer. it is the perfect show for the two of us. it’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. i cannot oversell this. what do you say?"
18148,Leonard,"so, did you love it? of course you loved it. how could you not love it? tell me how much you loved it."
18156,Leonard,"all right, cool. i think you’ll like the next one better. all the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
18159,Leonard,those things can still happen.
18160,Leonard,that’s a big deal.
18162,Leonard,"the interface is pretty simple. you put your horizontal x coordinate here, vertical y coordinate here. when you’re happy with those, you press this button."
18166,Leonard,it was pretty cool.
18173,Leonard,great.
18174,Leonard,"well, i can, so shut up."
18175,Leonard,"sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. and a sleepy sheldon is a cranky sheldon. and a cranky sheldon is actually no different than a regular sheldon. good night."
18179,Leonard,what?
18181,Leonard,"mr. jeffries, i am so sorry. we should’ve told you about the broken elevator."
18183,Leonard,"mr. jeffries, i’m, i’m leonard. this is my girlfriend, penny."
18187,Leonard,then what is it?
18188,Leonard,"i bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. in a way, their discoveries are your discoveries."
18199,Leonard,i push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
18200,Leonard,"hey, i always did sound effects. a-a swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. "
18205,Leonard,i draw my broadsword.
18209,Leonard,"ooh! sorry, i thought you were gonna do that."
18212,Leonard,"so, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
18215,Leonard,"well, do you really think i have a shot?"
18216,Leonard,"he knows, wow."
18221,Leonard,"look, i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. if i get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me."
18225,Leonard,"well, it is. just, you know, i’d be gone for a while."
18229,Leonard,"uh, he’s not gonna be there. he’s just sending a team to research his theory."
18231,Leonard,okay. i’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
18234,Leonard,"well, flush sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
18239,Leonard,yeah.
18242,Leonard,"thank you, sheldon. that must’ve been very hard for you to say."
18248,Leonard,calm down. i’m getting out. i have something i want to give you.
18255,Leonard,"okay, i’m hanging up now. you know there’s no such thing as a k… "
18261,Leonard,keep your voice down.
18264,Leonard,"uh, sure, that’s why i did it."
18281,Leonard,"i didn’t make it back. the ship sank, i’m in hell."
18291,Leonard,"i thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
18294,Leonard,"oh, yeah. we were meaning to do that."
18297,Leonard,"we did them at princeton, too."
18298,Leonard,"oh, these are a little different. there’s a tradition at elite universities…"
18300,Leonard,i think it sounds fun.
18301,Leonard,what’s all this?
18304,Leonard,ha-ha.
18307,Leonard,"all right, let’s, let’s do couples. i want to."
18308,Leonard,stop yelling at me.
18312,Leonard,i have asthma. back off.
18322,Leonard,what does she think i am?
18323,Leonard,i can’t believe she would say that about me.
18329,Leonard,the clue must be in the bag.
18332,Leonard,you know exactly what i’m talking about.
18336,Leonard,wasn’t the answer sheldon’s spot?
18338,Leonard,hey.
18340,Leonard,you bought my mom’s book?
18347,Leonard,no.
18350,Leonard,"okay, fine. do you want to know why i dressed like the hulk? because i was always mad at my mom and i wanted to smash my way out of that house."
18354,Leonard,whatcha doin’?
18363,Leonard,"well, you’re, you’re right. let’s just go."
18366,Leonard,except this is totally about my mom.
18368,Leonard,"or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the blu-ray extended version of the hobbit movie with commentary track. on account of how sad i am about my mom."
18369,Leonard,one sec. hey. sorry.
18377,Leonard,"oh, oh, i have. so bad."
18381,Leonard,"oh, please, mommy. no, mommy."
18392,Leonard,hey.
18394,Leonard,smart. take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding raj’s hair.
18403,Leonard,aw.
18407,Leonard,sex doesn’t count.
18409,Leonard,it’s fine. and also not true.
18413,Leonard,"nope, it was better before."
18414,Leonard,"holy crap, sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
18424,Leonard,invite them to live with us.
18425,Leonard,yeah. it must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
18427,Leonard,"hey, i get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. we’re really proud of you."
18429,Leonard,"oh, no."
18440,Leonard,come here.
18441,Leonard,is that a pregnancy test?
18444,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
18448,Leonard,"no, she’s not."
18455,Leonard,"i’m sorry, dr. jeffries, i’m just excited. this nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting."
18461,Leonard,sheldon just sent me a picture of him and bill nye getting smoothies.
18467,Leonard,"you know what, sheldon is the smartest person i have ever met. and he’s a little broken and he needs me. i guess i need him, too."
18478,Leonard,"why? because i got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? no, i was her favorite."
18479,Leonard,"hmm, i think i got them all. nope, they’re not in there."
18483,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i’ll, i’ll take care of it."
18485,Leonard,and you’re going to stay calm?
18494,Leonard,no.
18504,Leonard,"no, it’s, it’s almost done. i just, i have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the dvd and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so i can get a skin graft."
18505,Leonard,what is that? what is that for?
18508,Leonard,"listen to me, sheldon. i am not going to lebanon to return super mario brothers the movie."
18518,Leonard,you did?
18520,Leonard,why? 
18524,Leonard,i can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
18527,Leonard,"oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to zack."
18530,Leonard,what?
18534,Leonard,sure.
18537,Leonard,i just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
18539,Leonard,sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
18542,Leonard,you married him instead of me? good call. sign the papers.
18543,Leonard,that is not true.
18544,Leonard,you’re the one who invited him here.
18545,Leonard,"yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long."
18558,Leonard,will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
18559,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? if i don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does."
18562,Leonard,"these things happen all the time, sheldon."
18569,Leonard,well…
18574,Leonard,"oh, i hope it’s just a sprain. i cannot walk into that e.r. with another video game injury."
18578,Leonard,"all right, here’s the deal. sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
18583,Leonard,and last night.
18596,Leonard,"come on, i would not have peed my pants."
18603,Leonard,disagree.
18609,Leonard,"why can’t you be fat, too?"
18610,Leonard,"well, good for you, buddy. we’ll let you get back in there."
18613,Leonard,he made you his screensaver.
18615,Leonard,"oh, madame curie."
18616,Leonard,absolutely.
18629,Leonard,i’m so proud of you.
18631,Leonard,what’s wrong?
18632,Leonard,"oh, penny, i’m, i’m sorry. "
18633,Leonard,how you doing?
18637,Leonard,"i don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things."
18639,Leonard,right.
18642,Leonard,i don’t.
18646,Leonard,should’ve let sheldon come.
18649,Leonard,"and to show you how much i believe in you, i kind of got you an audition."
18650,Leonard,the new star wars movie.
18653,Leonard,"look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. luke skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the death star. he had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of the force, he… wow, i can feel you hating me right now."
18654,Leonard,"yeah, i’ll call you back."
18662,Leonard,"look, you know i love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost."
18663,Leonard,that is not what i said.
18664,Leonard,really not a good time.
18675,Leonard,did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
18678,Leonard,"oh, my god, they’re just making you use your vacation days."
18689,Leonard,"wow. that, that’s a big step."
18702,Leonard,you bought that? great. i got to call her before i forget how i said it. hey.
18710,Leonard,"yes. i thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. if i’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in."
18721,Leonard,not yet. 
18724,Leonard,…thousand two hundred and eleven.
18730,Leonard,the same way i know that the people in the tv set can’t see me.
18738,Leonard,"yes. he, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940."
18748,Leonard,good. this is exciting.
18749,Leonard,"yeah. what if we do get caught, who cares? so we get banned from comic-con."
18758,Leonard,"in fact, if you want, we can do it right here on sheldon’s spot."
18765,Leonard,"well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. "
18766,Leonard,no. maybe to her.
18767,Leonard,really? do you know how much those lakers tickets were?
18776,Leonard,yeah.
18777,Leonard,"yes, thank you for all your help."
18779,Leonard,great. what did you do?
18786,Leonard,moo-stache.
18791,Leonard,"hey, penny and i are gonna go shop for a dining room table. you want to come with us?"
18809,Leonard,oh. this is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
18813,Leonard,"you’re too close to it, but amy has had a huge impact on you."
18814,Leonard,"mm, sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked."
18819,Leonard,so why are you trying to ruin it?
18824,Leonard,"hey. i mean, it’s been a little tough, but penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing."
18830,Leonard,are we playing individual or teams?
18834,Leonard,"at least they talked about you on letterman. come on, i can drive you wherever you need to go."
18835,Leonard,you sure you want to do this?
18836,Leonard,"let’s get this over with. am i driving you to the cheesecake factory, or are we having sex? i’m just, i’m trying to lighten the mood."
18855,Leonard,"oh, does the gazelle know that according to harlan ellison, it was not ripped off from demon with a glass hand, but was ripped off from another outer limits script he wrote called the soldier?"
18859,Leonard,"well, you don’t go into science for the money."
18863,Leonard,aw.
18870,Leonard,why not?
18872,Leonard,why did i pee before i decided to move in here?
18877,Leonard,"well, for starters, i wouldn’t eat the bananas."
18898,Leonard,"what do you think about it, sheldon?"
18900,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started."
18902,Leonard,"hey, how’s dating two women going?"
18909,Leonard,"it actually looks good, sheldon."
18911,Leonard,"hey, i’ve got a good job. i could buy salmon. you don’t know."
18918,Leonard,"after she put you to bed, she went home."
18924,Leonard,thank you.
18929,Leonard,what can we do that’s different?
18935,Leonard,what ails her?
18936,Leonard,"hey, how about that asian fusion place?"
18938,Leonard,he’d probably give you homework.
18939,Leonard,thankfully penny and i have a relationship based on honesty. what? i don’t lie to her.
18942,Leonard," ah, it’s penny."
18949,Leonard,something terrible in a former life? i don’t know.
18959,Leonard,okay. yet he cried when they changed the raisin bran box.
18980,Leonard,"i proposed twice, you proposed once. two to one."
18986,Leonard,"ooh, interesting. did you just propose to me again?"
18992,Leonard,"sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night."
18993,Leonard,at least they toned him down in the second one.
18995,Leonard,"hey, how were things on the set?"
18999,Leonard,i’m her boyfriend.
19007,Leonard,come on. how can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
19016,Leonard,"no, no. no, it’s too late. i’m your bran muffin. probably fat-free and good for your colon."
19017,Leonard,"you know i want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself."
19025,Leonard,"i’ve had it for a couple years, not important. penny, will you marry me?"
19027,Leonard,how’s your mom holding up?
19036,Leonard,i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
19041,Leonard,what you working on?
19050,Leonard,"look, i, i know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary."
19052,Leonard,"no, i did not."
19053,Leonard,no.
19073,Leonard,sheldon.
19077,Leonard,so a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
19081,Leonard,what? why?
19090,Leonard,he’s okay?
19094,Leonard,"hey, buddy. good to hear your voice."
19099,Leonard,okay.
19103,Leonard,feel like driving to arizona with me?
19106,Leonard,"come on, you didn’t even try."
19116,Leonard,"well, yeah, it’s true. you, you are a god to me."
19120,Leonard,butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from arizona.
19125,Leonard,the kids are gonna love him.
19131,Leonard,"yeah, why would you do that?"
19132,Leonard,hmm. you’re up late.
19134,Leonard,"no, i mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than wolowitz?"
19137,Leonard,yeah.
19140,Leonard,"okay, next question, for the butterfinger. how long is a galactic yea"
19151,Leonard,nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
19154,Leonard,that’s the part you have a problem with?
19160,Leonard,some perfect couple. he won’t even share his food with her.
19163,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion."
19172,Leonard,what are you worried about?
19177,Leonard,i killed his chewbacca slippers.
19178,Leonard,"no, no, no, i don’t want to."
19181,Leonard,"this is fun, huh? we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game."
19182,Leonard,"on our quidditch team, he…"
19183,Leonard,have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken dna to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
19184,Leonard,yeah. i’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
19190,Leonard,"okay, him i believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. but you’re just upset about stuart and your mom and all their hbos."
19195,Leonard,"oh, kids buy comic books. it would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store."
19196,Leonard,"hold on. so, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?"
19200,Leonard,"well, do you think when she and i had that conversation, she left people off her list?"
19203,Leonard,that’s true.
19223,Leonard,"guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch tv."
19224,Leonard,"i, i think i still have it."
19225,Leonard,"ah, here it is. whoa. i haven’t looked at these in years. robot girlfriend."
19234,Leonard,wait. is brought right?
19241,Leonard,some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
19246,Leonard,"we didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. now come on. back to work. if we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… aah! why?"
19270,Leonard,"well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
19277,Leonard,"well, i think i came up with a pretty good solution."
19278,Leonard,"why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? it’ll be our first money together. we can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever."
19281,Leonard,what?
19282,Leonard,hmm. maybe. or maybe i tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
19283,Leonard,maybe.
19284,Leonard,"well, i can’t believe you’d say that. you know how insecure i am about my insecurities."
19289,Leonard,she made him a chore chart.
19300,Leonard,"no, but you can have mine."
19304,Leonard,"okay, um, look, i’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you."
19309,Leonard,he tried to score with penny.
19314,Leonard,can we please change the subject?
19316,Leonard,can we talk in private?
19319,Leonard,why?
19323,Leonard,why am i the one that has to get rid of him?
19326,Leonard,"oh, my god."
19337,Leonard,just hang on.
19339,Leonard,"i know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with stuart."
19347,Leonard,bruce wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
19348,Leonard,"there, perfect."
19376,Leonard,i think you could give a better clue.
19379,Leonard,what’s your problem?
19387,Leonard,for the same reason i don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
19388,Leonard,"i don’t have epilepsy, either."
19389,Leonard,"sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
19395,Leonard,"he was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it."
19416,Leonard,hi. we’re from the university. we’re trying to get some information about professor abbott.
19441,Leonard,"okay, so if i remain calm, i’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?"
19463,Leonard,"no, we’re both to blame. you know, let me take the heat on this one."
19477,Leonard,"you got it, you girls are in charge."
19478,Leonard,thank you.
19486,Leonard,this isn’t so bad.
19493,Leonard,"i, i’m sorry? you make compromises for me?"
19499,Leonard,"sheldon, do you realize i don’t live with the woman i love because of you? no other reason. just you."
19500,Leonard,"yes, it’s true. the last time i brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away."
19506,Leonard,i’m not leaving your world. i’m just talking about living across the hall.
19510,Leonard,okay.
19513,Leonard,"yeah, it looks great."
19525,Leonard,"ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
19536,Leonard,"well, at least listen to it through headphones. i’m trying to sleep. good night."
19543,Leonard,"you know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when i see him lying here asleep like this, i just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face."
19553,Leonard,what? is it wrong? have you seen it somewhere else?
19554,Leonard,"i know this isn’t my area, and i could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
19557,Leonard,you do? you’re not messing with me?
19561,Leonard,you’re still awake?
19571,Leonard,"well, we did it."
19574,Leonard,no.
19578,Leonard,"okay, okay. uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. i wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."
19579,Leonard,"it’s anonymous, and user name general relativity."
19591,Leonard,what does that mean?
19593,Leonard,"oh, really?"
19600,Leonard,"are you kidding? no, no."
19601,Leonard,"yeah, okay, i’m good."
19607,Leonard,"hi, we’re here to pick up an order for comic center."
19612,Leonard,he was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
19618,Leonard,"that’s it, that’s the line."
19623,Leonard,so you guys were testing us both? what is the matter with you?
19626,Leonard,i’m so sorry.
19633,Leonard,"i’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. right?"
19634,Leonard,"i’ve been listening to sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. tag, you’re it."
19644,Leonard,yup.
19650,Leonard,i bet the key’s behind it.
19651,Leonard,we spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
19652,Leonard,"i was unstoppable. i mean, i was, i was on fire. it was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone."
19657,Leonard,okay.
19658,Leonard,"well, we’re, we’re very happy for you."
19662,Leonard,"no, i got you something for valentine’s day, and i was too embarrassed to give it to you."
19671,Leonard,"i thought it’d be a little more, just more."
19679,Leonard,"i mean, i was on fire. i, i was in the zone, like an athlete."
19683,Leonard,"god, i love you. i love you so much."
19691,Leonard,really?
19695,Leonard,that’s not helping.
19721,Leonard,you’re being ridiculous.
19723,Leonard,so i’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
19733,Leonard,"no, listen, we wrote a paper together. now we get to go to a university and talk about it? that’s pretty cool."
19735,Leonard,i’m surprised you know that reference.
19736,Leonard,yes.
19740,Leonard,making great time. gonna be there pretty early.
19743,Leonard,"oh, that’s true. it’s not like we can get in there."
19745,Leonard,"we do have time. i mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
19752,Leonard,right.
19753,Leonard,"um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. i mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for star wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in."
19754,Leonard,and that’s how it’s done.
19757,Leonard,"well, what’s your plan?"
19758,Leonard,"uh, i’m just gonna tell you the truth."
19763,Leonard,"oh, shut up."
19764,Leonard,"uh-huh, i’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
19768,Leonard,"fine, then tell me how i should be looking at it."
19772,Leonard,i know.
19775,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, i’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist."
19778,Leonard,"well, you picked a good one to start. wil’s had lots of great guests. jonathan frakes, brent spiner, michael dorn, gates mcfadden."
19782,Leonard,"i, i didn’t want to interrupt."
19783,Leonard,really?
19794,Leonard,i’m just trying to protect you. how many times did i see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
19796,Leonard,"wait, twice?"
19799,Leonard,"wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?"
19805,Leonard,"great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature."
19810,Leonard,"okay. well, you kids have fun. i’m gonna go to sleep."
19818,Leonard,yeah.
19819,Leonard,"oh. when i encountered alien life, i discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."
19821,Leonard,are you kidding? yes. what did you have in mind?
19826,Leonard,"mmm, they’re alpha males."
19841,Leonard,the most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
19849,Leonard,"building on that, i’d like to remind you, i’m lactose intolerant."
19854,Leonard,you let a guy sit on me.
19858,Leonard,"okay, we should leave in about an hour. you all packed?"
19861,Leonard,i’ll take my chances.
19866,Leonard,"no, it’s like that. well, i’m excited to show you around."
19872,Leonard,"oh, thank you, but i’m okay."
19874,Leonard,"hey, where’d you go?"
19879,Leonard,"short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse."
19907,Leonard,we did not. that’s not true. can i speak to you alone for a second?
19909,Leonard,keep walking.
19918,Leonard,i don’t really feel i deserve it.
19919,Leonard,"okay, mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else."
19923,Leonard,that was really intense.
19930,Leonard,we’re gonna set a date.
19932,Leonard,and we’ve been busy with our paper.
19936,Leonard,"you still want to get married, right?"
19939,Leonard,is your dad paying for it?
19943,Leonard,great.
19947,Leonard,"look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
19949,Leonard,are you saying you want to get married?
19953,Leonard,i’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
19957,Leonard,"uh, well, there, there’s one thing i feel i should tell you."
19966,Leonard,hmm?
19968,Leonard,would you rather i didn’t tell you?
19969,Leonard,"see, now i’m confused. i mean, what, what am i supposed to do?"
19972,Leonard,right.
19977,Leonard,"mm, this one comes with music and flowers. oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the internet."
19978,Leonard,"‘cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. let’s give them hope."
19981,Leonard,no. why?
19986,Leonard,no.
19988,Leonard,"sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad."
20005,Leonard,yes.
20011,Leonard,"no, no, no. hang on. i believe i’m supposed to carry you across the threshold."
20017,Leonard,"oh, no. no, come on. i have a friend in you. you said so."
20023,Leonard,"i wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking"
20025,Leonard,i asked you over and over if you were okay. why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
20026,Leonard,"okay, listen, i may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
20028,Leonard,"sure, let’s make it an even hundred."
20029,Leonard,i wouldn’t.
20030,Leonard,"well, i may be a man, but i think i’m the one that screwed up on this one."
20034,Leonard,hey.
20035,Leonard,of course not.
20054,Leonard,"fine, you want to meet her?"
20059,Leonard,are we done?
20064,Leonard,"so, um, i’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."
20068,Leonard,"never gets old. no, no, to a girl. anyway, i told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work."
20071,Leonard,"no, i don’t think so. although, penny did say exactly that."
20076,Leonard,"okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
20079,Leonard,you do?
20081,Leonard,"well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?"
20092,Leonard,when do we leave?
20093,Leonard,this was feynman’s van? that’s so cool.
20094,Leonard,"so, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?"
20100,Leonard,"sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? it’s like the batmobile. if batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool."
20107,Leonard,there’s gotta be something else we could try.
20110,Leonard,it’s a bachelor party. lighten up.
20111,Leonard,"well, let’s start small. we can always add more."
20119,Leonard,it’s harder than i thought.
20121,Leonard,"well, it’s thai food night."
20131,Leonard,"i know what you’re doing. you’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening."
20132,Leonard,will you knock it off? we’re across the hall.
20154,Leonard,"oh, buddy, i get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you."
20158,Leonard,and now the crazy version of what i just said.
20160,Leonard,"i’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, sheldon."
20164,Leonard,you’re just sweaty from exercise.
20168,Leonard,what’s going on?
20174,Leonard,let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
20182,Leonard,"oh, hey. i just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
20191,Leonard,"a little, but if i may quote einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
20195,Leonard,hey.
20198,Leonard,"what ya doing, skippy?"
12008,Leonard,"yes. um, is this the high iq sperm bank?"
12012,Leonard,i’m sure she’ll still love him.
12016,Leonard,okay.
12020,Leonard,i don’t care. two millimetres? that doesn’t seem right.
12025,Leonard,hi.
20221,Leonard,thank you.
12032,Leonard,"great. well, bye."
12035,Leonard,we already watched the season two dvds.
20227,Leonard,"me neither, but what other choice do we have?"
12037,Leonard,"well, then that was wrong of us. we need to widen our circle."
20230,Leonard,did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
20231,Leonard,"you tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
20233,Leonard,i’m the one who thought of spockumentary.
12045,Leonard,great.
20241,Leonard,will wil want it?
12051,Leonard,in what universe?
12052,Leonard,here we go.
12053,Leonard,just sit somewhere else.
20245,Leonard,just like you.
20249,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
12058,Leonard,i’m sorry.
20250,Leonard,no.
20252,Leonard,he didn’t meant that.
20253,Leonard,"well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."
20259,Leonard,"hey, i made french toast sticks."
12068,Leonard,don’t.
12072,Leonard,no.
20264,Leonard,so you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
12074,Leonard,it’s right down the hall.
20269,Leonard,"i know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."
20270,Leonard,"yeah, okay, i see him. it looks like they’re having a nice time. i wish i could hear what they’re saying."
12079,Leonard,well i’m not trying to have sex with her.
12081,Leonard,"i’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, i’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
12083,Leonard,it’s darth vader shampoo.  luke skywalker’s the conditioner.
12084,Leonard,see what?
12087,Leonard,it’s just not a good time.
20279,Leonard,"yeah, poor us."
12090,Leonard,i’m not anticipating coitus.
20284,Leonard,"let me see. yeah, there. what number were you putting in?"
12094,Leonard,"you’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, i’ll…."
20288,Leonard,you don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
20290,Leonard,"next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, i believe, was also the name of your childhood dog."
20291,Leonard,baby.
20292,Leonard,justin.
20293,Leonard,nice try. nsync forever.
12102,Leonard,that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
12104,Leonard,"wuh, i, i broke up with joyce kim."
20298,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
12107,Leonard,"hi, i’m leonard, this is sheldon."
12110,Leonard,"excuse me, if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
20304,Leonard,"fine. mmm, penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”"
12114,Leonard,"i’m leonard, this is sheldon."
20309,Leonard,"don’t want people to see what, huh? a little bit of this?"
12119,Leonard,"and you were right about my motives, i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have some day led to sex."
12120,Leonard,"anyway, i’ve learned my lesson. she’s out of my league, i’m done with her, i’ve got my work, one day i’ll win the nobel prize and then i’ll die alone."
20312,Leonard,since when do you hum songs?
12123,Leonard,"well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
12127,Leonard,is thai food okay with you penny?
20321,Leonard,put on some headphones.
12130,Leonard,here we go.
12132,Leonard,"oh, hi penny."
12133,Leonard,no.
12138,Leonard,"yeah, no problem."
20340,Leonard,"yeah, me, too."
12149,Leonard,"what? oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
20344,Leonard,hey. we’re going to the comic book store. you want to come?
12153,Leonard,you okay?
20345,Leonard,"you got it. well, penny might want to join us."
12155,Leonard,"did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
20351,Leonard,we’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
12161,Leonard,what were you doing in his closet?
12164,Leonard,no.
20362,Leonard,"well, did you try wearing the shirt i said was inappropriate for work?"
12173,Leonard,"no, no. you gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
20367,Leonard,"fine, i’ll do it. but not because of them, because i love you."
20370,Leonard,"well, then you know her better than i do."
12182,Leonard,"you know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
20378,Leonard,"okay, now, what i’m hearing is that you feel that i sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish i’d be more succinct."
20379,Leonard,"all right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, i told her about you and your drug. she said she’d be happy to meet you."
12188,Leonard,"yes, but, only to clean."
20381,Leonard,"oh, i actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
12190,Leonard,"oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
20388,Leonard,what is happening?
20392,Leonard,"all right, here you go."
12202,Leonard,"no, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering. "
20396,Leonard,"well, you know, penny and i have been talking about taking a weekend in vegas. maybe we should all go."
20397,Leonard,that sounds really fun.
12206,Leonard,"also inefficient, and might be loud."
20400,Leonard,"so, the guys and i were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to vegas."
12209,Leonard,meet back here in an hour?
20403,Leonard,"well, vegas, but…"
20407,Leonard,nope.
20409,Leonard,"ah, so like every other m. night shyamalan movie i’ve seen, you spoil it in advance."
12218,Leonard,the bastard teleported. 
20412,Leonard,you’re still not coming.
20416,Leonard,you think they’ll still go on the trip?
12226,Leonard,"no problem. bye. oh, and, bye, bro! ."
20421,Leonard,"what do we do, kick them off?"
20425,Leonard,fun. like your comic-con spock ears and your around the house spock ears.
12235,Leonard,"look, howard, if i were to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner, i’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
20427,Leonard,really? the old asian man is not your meemaw?
20428,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice. most people her age don’t embrace technology."
20429,Leonard,same as when we lost you at the zoo.
12241,Leonard,"there is a generally accepted pattern in this area, i would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock. "
20434,Leonard,maybe we should give them some privacy.
12249,Leonard,none at all?
20444,Leonard,i stopped counting at four.
12253,Leonard,"maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat."
12254,Leonard,"it doesn’t matter. the woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me. "
20446,Leonard,"well, you were right, tears."
20448,Leonard,i know.
20449,Leonard,"thanks, sorry to bother you. but i said it like a badass."
20450,Leonard,really? i’ve never done that before. does it work?
12260,Leonard,really? great!
20456,Leonard,i don’t know if i’m comfortable with that.
20457,Leonard,see if you can get a table by the window.
20458,Leonard,what? why?
20463,Leonard,"mm, you watched the bachelor a lot."
20469,Leonard,are you actually gonna dance?
12284,Leonard,i don’t know. tell her i’m sick.
12293,Leonard,"well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
20496,Leonard,doesn’t matter. he’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
12305,Leonard,i’m not okay.
20498,Leonard,wow. i’ve never thought about that.
12311,Leonard,"this? no. no, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
20506,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
20509,Leonard,"me, too. so, you ever think about it?"
12321,Leonard,"well then we’ll avoid finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. "
20515,Leonard,"and we live here, so we have no choice."
12327,Leonard,morning
20522,Leonard,don’t say that to anyone.
12332,Leonard,okay. i’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
20529,Leonard,batman finally came to your party.
12341,Leonard,thank you for coming on such short notice.
20534,Leonard,hey.
20535,Leonard,leslie. i can’t remember the last time we talked. so much has changed.
20536,Leonard,"yeah, uh, um, penny and i got married."
12349,Leonard,sheldon? your mum made dinner.
20543,Leonard,"well, he’s a patent attorney. maybe his tie is pending."
12352,Leonard,a death ray?
20546,Leonard,"if we do, i am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy."
20556,Leonard,once i found a stash of contracts under his bed. it was weird.
20557,Leonard,"i want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
20560,Leonard,good one.
12372,Leonard,thank you sheldon.
12377,Leonard,thank you.
12379,Leonard,"uh, sure, why not. "
12380,Leonard,really?
20572,Leonard,good. slow.
20579,Leonard,"well, we got to make a run to the hardware store."
12389,Leonard,"yeah, yeah it is good. did you want to start now?"
12390,Leonard,oh. okay. a little musical foreplay. terrific. 
20581,Leonard,okay. we’ll be back as soon as we can.
20582,Leonard,penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
20585,Leonard,what about the girls?
12394,Leonard,"thank you, i’ll see you at work. "
20588,Leonard,i mean without lying.
20594,Leonard,he’ll never make it in time.
12403,Leonard,you don’t believe in luck.
20596,Leonard,hey.
12408,Leonard,so anyway  hello.
12414,Leonard,you want to make plans for new years.
12417,Leonard,"well, how did you know about it?"
20612,Leonard,so nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
20613,Leonard,and there goes our hike.
12425,Leonard,"okay then. you know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. . "
20618,Leonard,i could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
12427,Leonard,"i think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent jews. "
20620,Leonard,a scientist made that.
12438,Leonard,"we all have other costumes, we can change."
20631,Leonard,"okay, you have every right to be mad. and what you said is true. you do make more money than me. so i had no right to do what i did. and i’m so sorry. i hope you can forgive me."
20632,Leonard,"a couple years, but i just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies."
12441,Leonard,you went with thor?
12448,Leonard,"actually, penny, he’s rob…"
20641,Leonard,"oh, yes."
20643,Leonard,i love you.
12457,Leonard,then what happens?
12462,Leonard,hi.
12471,Leonard,"look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
12472,Leonard,"yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, sheldon, you and i are the alpha males. we shouldn’t have to back down. "
20666,Leonard,not funny.
12476,Leonard,"uh, a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth, whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior. "
12481,Leonard,a homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
12482,Leonard,i think i’ve made my point.
12487,Leonard,good night sheldon.
12488,Leonard,hi penny.
20682,Leonard,sorry?
12491,Leonard,so why was he at your party?
12492,Leonard,there there. 
20685,Leonard,"i try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out."
12501,Leonard,"that’s right, you saw what you saw. that’s how we roll in the shire. "
12502,Leonard,"here, let me try. call mcflono mcfloonyloo. heh-heh. "
20698,Leonard,hey.
12507,Leonard,"okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back. "
20699,Leonard,let’s get out of here.
12509,Leonard,great idea.
12512,Leonard,"well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. "
20708,Leonard,does this mean emily’s not in the picture anymore?
20710,Leonard,who’s frank and alicia?
12520,Leonard,"no, take the couch, or my bed, i just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. "
12521,Leonard,"let me guess, you have a problem with this."
12522,Leonard,"it’s up to you, crazy person’s choice. "
20717,Leonard,since my preschool got a bunny.
12528,Leonard,here you go.
12529,Leonard,sorry about that.
12532,Leonard,"funny expression, sleep tight. it refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight. "
12534,Leonard,penny’s still sleeping.
20726,Leonard,but we won’t bore you with the details.
12537,Leonard,"oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning."
12540,Leonard,for one thing you live with your mother.
20732,Leonard,would you like a glass of wine?
12544,Leonard,i see a problem. 
12546,Leonard,"can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
12548,Leonard,"fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four. "
20744,Leonard,does it bother you?
12554,Leonard,"well, with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christie, "
12556,Leonard,"sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
12557,Leonard,maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. 
20750,Leonard,thanks.
20751,Leonard,"hey, penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do i need to go?"
20754,Leonard,"i don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever."
20755,Leonard,seriously?
12565,Leonard,well then start throwing grenades.
12568,Leonard,i thought i heard something. 
20760,Leonard,"it’s not a big deal. go shopping with amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you."
20765,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go?"
12575,Leonard,"yeah, we’re not like haroun and tanweer!"
20768,Leonard,still get in.
12578,Leonard,"i’m not a big fan of musicals, but i love that show. "
12580,Leonard,"well, maybe we are like haroun and tanweer. "
20772,Leonard,"boy, i wish i could say no."
20774,Leonard,"buddy, let it go."
20776,Leonard,"now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. that’s all anyone could ask."
20777,Leonard,hey.
12586,Leonard,"oh, hey. "
20779,Leonard,how’d it go with my mother?
20782,Leonard,"wait, we’re gonna get married again?"
20785,Leonard,"i just said why, we don’t like her."
20786,Leonard,is your brother out of prison?
20788,Leonard,"oh, he’s like a different man. he stopped twitching, and i think he grew an inch and a half."
12600,Leonard,"doctor and mrs koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely raj’s fault. "
12601,Leonard,"no, i’m leonard. "
12602,Leonard,you left with his date. friends don’t do that to each other. 
12604,Leonard,hold on. what happened with you and lalita?
12605,Leonard,so you’re not going to see her again?
20796,Leonard,"thanks, dad."
12608,Leonard,you didn’t?
20800,Leonard,"and his girlfriend, amy."
12615,Leonard,"sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? "
20814,Leonard,"sure, dad."
20818,Leonard,what?
12627,Leonard,"oh, you admit that it’s our work."
20824,Leonard,"well, why? what’s wrong?"
20825,Leonard,"not helping, buddy. mother, penny and i really want you to be part of this. please stay."
20826,Leonard,"here you are, mother."
12635,Leonard,it’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
20828,Leonard,"yeah, special, like that.  that’s them. please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
12637,Leonard,here?
12638,Leonard,"no, i’m not shy."
20833,Leonard,are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
20834,Leonard,this is ridiculous. i’m going across the hall.
20835,Leonard,"fine, then you go."
20838,Leonard,"oh, you, too. hey, everyone, this is my mother, beverley."
20841,Leonard,thank you.
12650,Leonard,"okay, i’m leaving for the conference. "
12652,Leonard,"i don’t know, i wasn’t choosing my…"
20846,Leonard,what’s up?
20847,Leonard,really?
12656,Leonard,"you’re right, this side does look better. "
20852,Leonard,that’s not a bad idea.
12662,Leonard,"so, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  are there any questions?"
20857,Leonard,"someday, when i’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
20858,Leonard,"‘cause when you talk, it enrages people."
12668,Leonard,"really, so why did you come?"
20865,Leonard,i don’t know how i feel about this.
20866,Leonard,that’s a lot less big.
12675,Leonard,"stop, stop it, quit it. "
12676,Leonard,you’re lucky i didn’t run you over. 
12677,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m the problem, i’m the one that needs help. "
20868,Leonard,"oh, thanks, man. "
20872,Leonard,i’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
12684,Leonard,what the hell is that? 
20876,Leonard,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
20883,Leonard,"oh, that is so nice."
12701,Leonard,"sheldon, what is it? "
12703,Leonard,that would have hurt her feelings. 
20895,Leonard,thank you.
12712,Leonard,"you told her i lied, why would you tell her i lied?"
20907,Leonard,it’ll be fine. you’ll see. sheldon? buddy? 
20910,Leonard,sir.
20911,Leonard,"i understand that we’re under contract, and i don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
12721,Leonard,we’re going to long beach?
20913,Leonard,that stinks. how long are you out of the apartment?
12723,Leonard,so he goes back into rehab?
12724,Leonard,you still told her i lied.
12726,Leonard,"so she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach? "
12727,Leonard,"oh, well, thankyou."
20926,Leonard,"he startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
12736,Leonard,"no, we’re not going to long beach."
20928,Leonard,you guys have fun.
12738,Leonard,"wait, are we really going to long beach? "
20933,Leonard,i know exactly what we are gonna do.
12743,Leonard,i’ve got a solution.
12747,Leonard,sheldon?
20939,Leonard,i feel like i pulled something. why didn’t you tell me to stop?
12751,Leonard,there were only two people there?
20946,Leonard,don’t.
12760,Leonard,"yeah, right here. how was nebraska?"
20952,Leonard,"no, that’s actually what we did with him when howard came back from space."
12763,Leonard,"sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, i’m sure she’s not contagious."
12764,Leonard,"penny, you’ll have to excuse sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe. "
12765,Leonard,you’d better go before he starts spraying you with lysol. 
20955,Leonard,don’t beat yourself up. you’ve never lived with anyone before.
20956,Leonard,"and you’re starting out with sheldon cooper. that’s like getting your first pet and having it be, i don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
20960,Leonard,"exactly. learn from my mistakes. no matter where i am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
12771,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting? "
12772,Leonard,i’m going back to bed. 
20963,Leonard,and who got him to try a turkey dog?
20964,Leonard,how can you stop now? that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
20966,Leonard,oh. he can try. he’d just need a good locksmith.
20967,Leonard,what do you think?
12780,Leonard,they texted me. 
20972,Leonard,‭yeah. it’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad d-list celebrities to appear. why?
20974,Leonard,when is it?
12783,Leonard,drink whatever you want.
12784,Leonard,then make soup. 
20976,Leonard,"yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where i draw the line. come on, we’ll have fun."
20977,Leonard,"you’ll have nerds fawning all over you. if you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
20979,Leonard,"oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
20980,Leonard,are you kidding? i once paid twenty dollars for theo sassler’s signature.
12791,Leonard,i tried to stop you. 
12793,Leonard,"five movies, two hours apiece. it’s a start. "
12794,Leonard,"oh, hi penny!"
12795,Leonard,i’m… uh… at work.
12796,Leonard,i’m… uh… in a… i’m in a radiation suit. what’s up?
20987,Leonard,would you like an autograph?
20990,Leonard,"okay, let’s keep it moving."
12803,Leonard,"what do you see, what do you see."
20995,Leonard,i’m her husband.
12811,Leonard,then just say go straight. 
21006,Leonard,what do you mean?
21007,Leonard,"so, she’s just been lying to him?"
12817,Leonard,hi!
21010,Leonard,"you’re awful quiet, everything okay?"
21012,Leonard,"buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago."
21015,Leonard,"sheldon, this is not a big deal. it’s a little white lie, everyone does it."
12827,Leonard,would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon? 
12828,Leonard,that is a problem. 
21019,Leonard,are you kidding me?
12830,Leonard,advantage kim. 
21021,Leonard,"i’d say damn it in klingon, but that wasn’t until next month."
21024,Leonard,"eventually, i guess. although, i am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
12833,Leonard,"no kidding, you speak english really well."
21025,Leonard,"oh, my god, i’m going blind."
21026,Leonard,yeah?
21027,Leonard,jisovbe’ 
12841,Leonard,something you’d like to share? a tale of woe perhaps.
12842,Leonard,"just eat, sheldon, you’ll feel better. "
12845,Leonard,hey.
21038,Leonard,you guys might want to start eating. but you won’t be living here.
21041,Leonard,"i’m kidding, i want you to feel at home here. decorate it any way that makes you happy."
21048,Leonard,wow.
12861,Leonard,"howard, he’s fifteen."
12863,Leonard,it’s take your daughter to work day. 
12867,Leonard,"no, we can’t. "
21060,Leonard,"well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two."
12871,Leonard,"i can’t just go up and talk to her. howard, you talk to her. "
21068,Leonard,"i know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip i’ve ever heard."
12877,Leonard,"i don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, i have a rocket in my pants.”"
21069,Leonard,"ignore him, he’s just cranky because bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
12879,Leonard,"still, i’d like to know the details. his mother was human, his father was vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive."
21072,Leonard,what are you doing?
12881,Leonard,i’ll take a look at it. 
21077,Leonard,"i couldn’t just take the compliment. i had to ask why. you know, i do understand what you’re feeling. my brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head."
21086,Leonard,does it spin around and do tricks?
21088,Leonard,"oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
21089,Leonard,i think he might be learning on his own.
21091,Leonard,"it’s not hard. just picture the three stooges, and then take away two stooges."
12901,Leonard,why do they say aa? 
21094,Leonard,"oh, i don’t mind. if you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like i’m walking with my grandma."
12905,Leonard,"howard, raj and i just had a team meeting. "
12906,Leonard,"yes we did, i just came from it."
21097,Leonard,"oh, it was a good one. he played poker with sir isaac, you don’t care."
21099,Leonard,"hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool."
12909,Leonard,"okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. "
12910,Leonard,thanks for the heads up. 
12912,Leonard,"he won’t say. he just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. "
12916,Leonard,"raj, we’re not getting tv’s blossom to join our physics bowl team. "
21108,Leonard,"well, now they’re yours."
12920,Leonard,"leslie, i have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that i…"
12925,Leonard,"oh, yeah. you know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing. "
12927,Leonard,"so, is that your team."
12929,Leonard,"no, it stands for perpetual motion squad. "
12932,Leonard,what the hell is that.
12933,Leonard,"come on, think, leslie."
12934,Leonard,"you’re never going to let that go, are you? "
21127,Leonard,"unbelievable. okay, uh, i don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
21128,Leonard,"sheldon, what do you think you’re doing? "
12937,Leonard,"hang on. sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. "
21129,Leonard,and just leave him here alone?
21131,Leonard,this is ridiculous.
21136,Leonard,"yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
21140,Leonard,you promise?
21141,Leonard,good?
21143,Leonard,"damn, i need my inhaler."
21144,Leonard,"no, i went down the stairs too fast."
21148,Leonard,"if we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
21149,Leonard,"found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?"
21151,Leonard,"come on, everyone to the hospital."
21154,Leonard,"it’s not just howard and bernadette. i mean, look how far we’ve all come."
12965,Leonard,yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years. 
21159,Leonard,"oh, like halley’s comet."
12968,Leonard,"it’s… you know, time machine. "
21162,Leonard,"well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. that’s a win."
21164,Leonard,"and before our next drive to comic-con, i need the name of that juice."
21165,Leonard,hold on. how did you get him in the car?
12974,Leonard,that sounds fair.
21171,Leonard,"on purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
21172,Leonard,it might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
21179,Leonard,"look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
12989,Leonard,"yeah, good for you. "
12995,Leonard,"oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine. "
12997,Leonard,some things are more important than toys. 
21190,Leonard,"well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice."
13001,Leonard,"terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
13002,Leonard,because i don’t want it any more. 
21195,Leonard,"well, you know, it’s easy to take each other for granted and i never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. it’s peaceful and deep. your soul is, it’s like a secret that i could never keep."
13005,Leonard,i paid two hundred dollars for my share.
13010,Leonard,"forget it guys, if i sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
21204,Leonard,"oh, no. good game."
13016,Leonard,yeah.
13019,Leonard,"it is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
21212,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. i’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. please tell me what more i could do?"
13026,Leonard,"oh, hey buddy. "
13029,Leonard,"so, how do you two know each other."
13030,Leonard,excuse me?
21221,Leonard,honey?
21228,Leonard,i don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
13038,Leonard,i wasn’t staring! 
13039,Leonard,"oh. huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect. "
21235,Leonard,"listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple."
21238,Leonard,does it really need to say that?
21240,Leonard,"me, too."
21241,Leonard,what’s going on with that woman you’re dating?
21247,Leonard,that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
21249,Leonard,i don’t like trains. you like trains.
13058,Leonard,"exactly. and, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring. "
13060,Leonard,say what?
21252,Leonard,"hey, great news. the tv i want will fit in the gaming room, and if i leave the curtains open, i can watch it from work."
21254,Leonard,"huh. is that a good idea? i mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
13063,Leonard,i agree. sheldon’s sister is hiding at penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time. 
21256,Leonard,hmm. who knows? that’s exciting. i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.
21258,Leonard,remember that when the new tv falls off the wall and crushes us both.
21260,Leonard,how’s it working out?
13069,Leonard,"hi penny, how’s it going. listen, that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
21262,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
13071,Leonard,"well, since you’re leaving tomorrow i was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
21263,Leonard,no.
13076,Leonard,"oh, i don’t think so."
21268,Leonard,because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk.
21269,Leonard,"if you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!"
21272,Leonard,stay out of this. you and your stupid machine started this fight.
13081,Leonard,"uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.  "
21273,Leonard,we owe you an apology.
13083,Leonard,"howard, every thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. they see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
21276,Leonard,"mm, penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for randall to visit."
13085,Leonard,fine. 
21280,Leonard,we can’t. he was already fixed when i found him at the shelter.
13089,Leonard,not if you believe his doctors. 
21282,Leonard,"good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
21283,Leonard,"that’s great, but the air force approved the specs. we’re good to go."
21285,Leonard,"fine, go for a little walk."
21291,Leonard,"hey, uh, buddy, i got you a little present."
13100,Leonard,"excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
21292,Leonard,"yeah. go ahead, open it."
21295,Leonard,"four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
13107,Leonard,alright. here we go. my first birthday party. 
21301,Leonard,"oh, boo-hoo. i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. what is that?"
21303,Leonard,"sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. just help us out."
13113,Leonard,what’s going on?
13118,Leonard,"you know what, i’m going to go back and try talking to her again."
21316,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. you can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff."
21318,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
13127,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what were the choices again? "
21323,Leonard,"dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants."
13133,Leonard,doesn’t that violate the health code?
13136,Leonard,"no. no, no, that, that would be underreacting. he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
21329,Leonard,but all you did was complain when he did that.
13143,Leonard,just roll the dice. 
13144,Leonard,"she was mad at him. she was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and i walked over there and i fixed it!"
13145,Leonard,just eat your tangerine chicken. 
21338,Leonard,"oh, you brought your own lunch. good for you."
21339,Leonard,what brought that on?
13148,Leonard,"already, that was quick."
13158,Leonard,yeah. that’s the spirit. 
21353,Leonard,"yeah. it can get chilly, but raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. here’s the hotel room we all share. "
13167,Leonard,you’re not helping. 
13169,Leonard,"wow, that’s brilliant."
13172,Leonard,i made an eight o’clock reservation.
21369,Leonard,i honestly don’t.
13181,Leonard,there was a draft.
21373,Leonard,"well, i just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time."
21375,Leonard,"o-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and i don’t need to bring you, is everything good?"
21376,Leonard,"all right, problem solved."
13185,Leonard,that might work too. 
21377,Leonard,now you can come with us.
13188,Leonard,"what are you talking about, the date went fine. "
21381,Leonard,"aw, man, did you see this post from raj?"
13191,Leonard,"well, we sort of decided to wing it. "
21384,Leonard,am i still a good friend if i wait and hope that howard offers him a place to live first?
13198,Leonard,hey.
21391,Leonard,and i think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication amy’s clearly giving you.
21392,Leonard,just when i thought you couldn’t get any hotter.
21393,Leonard,do not adjust the dosage. you nailed it.
13207,Leonard,"what do you mean, you’re moving out? why? "
13208,Leonard,"yeah, there kind of does."
13209,Leonard,i’m still confused.
21401,Leonard,"well, now that you point it out…"
13211,Leonard,no.
21402,Leonard,we do seem to keep finding room mates.
21407,Leonard,"well, great."
13218,Leonard,i’m coming! 
21411,Leonard,it’s cute that you think that. don’t worry about it.
13221,Leonard,why not.
13225,Leonard,"dammit, sheldon! you said penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
21417,Leonard,who’s paul?
13228,Leonard,"penny thinks i’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous. "
13231,Leonard,"yes, but it’s okay. now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.  "
21423,Leonard,that would be great. thank you.
13233,Leonard,"well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college. "
13236,Leonard,"please let it go, sheldon."
13238,Leonard,hi.
21431,Leonard,"i know, but he was my friend first. it’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
13253,Leonard,"look, i like leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
21445,Leonard,we’ve had this planned for a week.
13256,Leonard,"uh, sure."
21448,Leonard,it’s getting harder to pretend.
13260,Leonard,"really, what changed?"
13261,Leonard,"yeah, i can see how that would… a bunch of people?"
21457,Leonard,"well, it’s not across the hall."
21460,Leonard,ask him.
13271,Leonard,"you know what i mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
21465,Leonard,hey. want to join us?
13275,Leonard,"yeah, it’s from changs."
21467,Leonard,"hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. why don’t the two of you join us?"
13278,Leonard,a little.
13280,Leonard,"okay, now my uncles are bald, but my aunt edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. so… sweet lady. it always tickles when she hugs me.  what now?"
21474,Leonard,"mm, just down there."
13283,Leonard,"no problem, i’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. so i guess i’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening."
13285,Leonard,hello.
13286,Leonard,"okay, well, goodnight. "
21479,Leonard,"wow, that’s a big step."
13290,Leonard,"you’re right, it is simple. "
21484,Leonard,"it’s totally different. bert’s money might run out, but i can beg until the end of time."
13294,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful."
21486,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
13296,Leonard,"truth, what truth? we’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal."
21487,Leonard,aw.
13304,Leonard,i only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
21502,Leonard,"oh, i know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny."
21503,Leonard,"she’s doing amazing. she can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
13315,Leonard,"yeah, i see that. shouldn’t you be at work?"
13323,Leonard,"sheldon, wake up."
21518,Leonard,"yeah, sorry."
21522,Leonard,"yeah, see, now i feel terrible, like i’m being selfish and holding you back. what? say something. yeah, that is pretty annoying."
13332,Leonard,this is bad.
13334,Leonard,they never do.
13341,Leonard,"well, we’re going to go apologise to raj and invite him out to dinner."
21533,Leonard,i can’t believe the air force would treat us like that.
21537,Leonard,"yeah, what’s going on with you guys?"
21538,Leonard,"oh, no. when?"
13348,Leonard,smile. 
13349,Leonard,"we’re here to see koothrappali, not kill batman."
21545,Leonard,"instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend."
13354,Leonard,sheldon.
21547,Leonard,thank you.
21548,Leonard,should we give them their privacy?
21551,Leonard,"oh, that would be great."
13370,Leonard,pass.
13374,Leonard,yes.
13380,Leonard,"alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?"
13383,Leonard,do the shrimpers feature in your story?
13387,Leonard,you want to breed a new friend?
13390,Leonard,"yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be iron man."
21583,Leonard,"hey penny, come on in."
13392,Leonard,i’m not going to work.
21584,Leonard,you have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?
21585,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t…."
13398,Leonard,take the bus.
21594,Leonard,"a bad feeling i have about this, mmm-hmmm. "
13403,Leonard,"howard, help me out here."
21595,Leonard,my turn on the time machine. 
21601,Leonard,"hey, listen, i know you said that you didn’t want to talk…"
13412,Leonard,no.
13413,Leonard,"okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
21607,Leonard,"sheldon, you want to catch me up again?"
21610,Leonard,science?
13422,Leonard,"aw, the pet store?"
21616,Leonard,"hello. hey, howard. what’s wrong? okay. okay, we’ll be right there."
21622,Leonard,someone’s in the kitchen with dinah…
13432,Leonard,hey.
21624,Leonard,thanks.
13434,Leonard,"well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until i’m finished with my experiment."
13435,Leonard,yep
21625,Leonard,"dude, check it out. that’s laundry for a month!"
13438,Leonard,"if you don’t do this, i won’t take you to the comic book store."
21630,Leonard,"fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
21632,Leonard,seriously? you’re getting career advice from a psychic?
21635,Leonard,"what! what, what, what?"
21641,Leonard,"it’s just two degrees, sheldon. i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
13451,Leonard,"honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
13452,Leonard,"on the other hand, i think sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
21647,Leonard,"you’re insane, you know that?!"
13456,Leonard,don’t.
21648,Leonard,"hey, howard, what’s up?"
21654,Leonard,"yeah, hi. listen, i just got a text from raj. he wanted me to tell you that when howard says nap, he means sex."
21662,Leonard,"relax, he’s got headphones on. and we’re ten miles above earth in a starship."
21666,Leonard,excuse me.
13475,Leonard,what are you talking about?
21668,Leonard,"you call that a glow stick? that is a glow stick. come on, let’s go."
13477,Leonard,good night.
13478,Leonard,the bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
21671,Leonard,you’re a mean one mr. grinch.
13481,Leonard,"sheldon? sheldon, are you okay?"
21673,Leonard,"okay, i got to get back to work. thanks for listening."
13484,Leonard,potl.
21678,Leonard,"disneyland. go on, i’m listening."
13489,Leonard,they’re gorgeous.
21683,Leonard,"don’t worry about it, buddy. okay, bye. that was wil, he’s feeling a lot better. apparently, he’s 12-down in the tv guide crossword puzzle."
13494,Leonard,why?
13495,Leonard,yes.
21687,Leonard,you mean this weirdly suspicious one?
13499,Leonard,i asked.
13500,Leonard,no.
13501,Leonard,yes.
13502,Leonard,no.
21692,Leonard,"hi. i’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. really? um, okay. is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘cause we’re just talking hours here."
13509,Leonard,don’t worry. they only stay on your record for a year.
13514,Leonard,to do what?
13518,Leonard,"look, here’s the thing, um, i talked to sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line."
13521,Leonard,we’re not encouraging. it’s more like knuckling under.
13523,Leonard,you can recognize people on google earth?
21720,Leonard,yeah.
13532,Leonard,"oh, not junior rodeo. what did you do?"
21724,Leonard,what?
21727,Leonard,"oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. um, well, uh, original series over next generation, but picard over kirk."
21730,Leonard,okay.
13539,Leonard,your mother.
21732,Leonard,can you do that?
13543,Leonard,"ahoy, matey."
13546,Leonard,"well, i want to watch it now."
13547,Leonard,watch whatever you want.
13549,Leonard,what?
21741,Leonard,"oh, good. i passed the barriers."
13551,Leonard,can we just forget i said defcon and go?
13555,Leonard,no one’s a scientist like howard.
21748,Leonard,"if people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… you are people, aren’t you? making a joke."
13557,Leonard,"yeah, i am loyal. you know, if you look at the big picture. just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
13565,Leonard,"i can’t tell you that, either."
21757,Leonard,"but, joyce, come on."
13573,Leonard,i’m going out for a while.
21765,Leonard,"ooh, it’s time for babylon 5!"
21774,Leonard,"the trick is to mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
21780,Leonard,oh. right.
13591,Leonard,"doctor doctor. surgical resident. smart, pretty. let me ask you something. if your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
13602,Leonard,"yeah, but i don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…"
13620,Leonard,"no, just sit here."
13625,Leonard,"okay, i’m going to make this very simple for you. you are not in this relationship, i am. ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie."
13626,Leonard,"general order 104, section a does not apply in this situation."
13628,Leonard,"all i’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?"
13633,Leonard,huh? would it work if i just punched you in the face?
13641,Leonard,she stuck a needle into my hand!
13658,Leonard,do you understand that stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
13661,Leonard,thank you.
13664,Leonard,"wait, i only initialed it because i never thought it would happen! i initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case i get superpowers."
13666,Leonard,"no, absolutely not."
13667,Leonard,"i don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
13671,Leonard,"look, i’m just saying, um, penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. in fact, some mornings i’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with mrs. vartabedian."
13675,Leonard,we’re not living together.
13681,Leonard,"uh, the big dog is goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , i have no idea. we’re not living together!"
13683,Leonard,"i did. it was right here. she must’ve… oh, my god, we’re living together."
13684,Leonard,"yeah, stephanie got them for me."
13688,Leonard,"so, go hit on her."
13689,Leonard,"i don’t care what you guys think, stephanie and i are very happy living together. i will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
13697,Leonard,no that doesn’t sound right either.
13702,Leonard,sheldon.  what’s going on?
13703,Leonard,"careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse."
13713,Leonard,"oh, okay. i just hope i don’t get cramps."
13717,Leonard,"well, um, on one level, really, really well."
13740,Leonard,did not.
13759,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s all such a blur.
13761,Leonard,i’m not indoorsy. i just wear the appropriate sun block because i don’t take melanoma lightly.
13764,Leonard,since when?
13766,Leonard,"yeah, if you like that type."
13767,Leonard,"no, just neighbours."
13781,Leonard,"sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry! never mind, we’re cool."
13788,Leonard,"come on, it’s christmas, just give me this one."
13797,Leonard,how about the toaster oven?
13800,Leonard,uh-huh?
13809,Leonard,"come on, is that really necessary?"
13812,Leonard,i need you to apologize to how…
13814,Leonard,the robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
13825,Leonard,"oh, my god. that’s kripke’s robot?"
13828,Leonard,you want to prepare him? install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
13835,Leonard,"go, go, go, go!"
13843,Leonard,good luck getting time on it. the only people he lets use it are his friends.
13854,Leonard,"come on! there’s over 200 questions. and look at some of these things. sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
13864,Leonard,why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
13867,Leonard,"no you’re not, let’s go."
13873,Leonard,it’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
13883,Leonard,"why? they’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
13888,Leonard,do i have to?
13893,Leonard,weird.
13894,Leonard,did you guys have an argument?
13897,Leonard,"here you go, penny. shrimp with lobster sauce."
13901,Leonard,"it was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
13902,Leonard,"oh, wait, you lent her money?"
13918,Leonard,what?
13924,Leonard,"well, moving is a big deal. you have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?"
13925,Leonard,"well, i’m sure the guy living with sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you."
13927,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on?"
13931,Leonard,really? you’re just gonna let me go by myself?
13936,Leonard,"excuse me. when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor, didn’t samwise, pippin and merry go with him?"
13937,Leonard,well?
13949,Leonard,"no, the problem isn’t solved. he just blew us off."
13952,Leonard,i don’t need backup. i have right on my side. and i’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
13955,Leonard,it’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
13957,Leonard,really? did he say why?
13962,Leonard,can’t we just postpone it till the spring? maybe next summer?
13963,Leonard,"no, i didn’t realize it had been so long. sure, i guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
13966,Leonard,"good to see you, mother."
13972,Leonard,yes.
13974,Leonard,yes.
13981,Leonard,"oh, my god. what happened?"
13984,Leonard,"sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. she’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
13990,Leonard,howard lives with his mother and raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. go.
13996,Leonard,you got alcohol?
13997,Leonard,yep.
14005,Leonard,"hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. you know what i used to do when i was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
14016,Leonard,"ummm, i’m gonna go with “no.”"
14017,Leonard,"come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and i’m okay with that."
14023,Leonard,there’s no way we can get to the ridge. the chemistry department has us completely cut off.
14028,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
14032,Leonard,"what about it, howard?"
14036,Leonard,calm down. we’ll figure it out.
14037,Leonard,here we go.
14038,Leonard,don’t sit in his spot.
14040,Leonard,that’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
14041,Leonard,yeah. you ought to come out with us sometime.
14042,Leonard,there’s a chance.
14043,Leonard,"we? no, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
14047,Leonard,"mm, butt print. there’s no discernible butt print."
14048,Leonard,it’s too small and too perfect.
14050,Leonard,sheldon! how was the comic book store?
14051,Leonard,"great, great. did you walk the whole way? it’s a little chilly."
14052,Leonard,isn’t that terrific? he is such a good friend. you know what the best thing about friends is?
14054,Leonard,"don’t you dare, missy."
14057,Leonard,why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
14059,Leonard,"if it were your head, it would be."
14065,Leonard,why are you crouching there?
14077,Leonard,"okay, first of all, penny, thank you for coming."
14084,Leonard,"okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. we’ll just erase the first season of battlestar."
14097,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. just tell us where to sit and shut up."
14101,Leonard,maybe john connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil terminator.
14102,Leonard,thank you.
14110,Leonard,what’s the matter?
14114,Leonard,so you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
14115,Leonard,right. of course.
14116,Leonard,"well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
14118,Leonard,i’ve got a better idea.
14121,Leonard,so?
14127,Leonard,look at it. non-alcoholic beer.
14132,Leonard,"hey, penny. leonard again."
14143,Leonard,hello?
14149,Leonard,are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
14156,Leonard,you want to fire me?
14164,Leonard,what are you doing?
14169,Leonard,i can’t believe we actually did it.
14170,Leonard,i’ll print out the shipping label. uh-oh.
14180,Leonard,"slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. you don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
14185,Leonard,"stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. what are you doing?"
14188,Leonard,hello.
14193,Leonard,thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
14196,Leonard,i think you look fantastic.
14197,Leonard,"hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
14204,Leonard,"gee, penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
14213,Leonard,"yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday of every month would be anything can happen thursday."
14215,Leonard,"way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, sheldon."
14219,Leonard,or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
14221,Leonard,sure. what does he like?
14231,Leonard,"uh, cut it in half?"
14235,Leonard,no.
14238,Leonard,"gee, thanks a lot."
14243,Leonard,"hey, howard?"
14245,Leonard,yeah.
14248,Leonard,that’s your system?
14264,Leonard,yes
14265,Leonard,yes
14266,Leonard,you got it.
14268,Leonard,"alright, back to the game."
14275,Leonard,"why not? people do things right now all the time. why can’t we be right now people too. go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. i have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now."
14278,Leonard,"howard, could i borrow some after shave?"
14285,Leonard,"yeah, i really need to talk to you."
14287,Leonard,"okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
14292,Leonard,we’re not going to get wolowitz a hooker.
14296,Leonard,i think she knows what i meant.
14297,Leonard,"okay, terrific. um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…"
14301,Leonard,yes.
14302,Leonard,yes.
14310,Leonard,nobody wants that.
14318,Leonard,sure.
14323,Leonard,about stuart? love to.
14326,Leonard,oh. it’s stuart.
14336,Leonard,good one.
14337,Leonard,hey stuart.
14339,Leonard,"yeah, it’s a regular manhattan project. what’s up?"
14347,Leonard,i feel terrible.
14350,Leonard,nothing. we just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. i’m gonna make a coffee run. do you want any?
14356,Leonard,"thanks for understanding, howard."
14366,Leonard,"yeah, how about that? see you soon."
14370,Leonard,what was it doing on the ceiling?
14374,Leonard,why?
14377,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning."
14381,Leonard,hardly a day goes by when i don’t think about it.
14382,Leonard,wait a minute. he offered to send you to the north pole?
14387,Leonard,"well, then don’t go."
14392,Leonard,it’s not gonna be the same without you.
14400,Leonard,"actually, it would help."
14402,Leonard,did she seem upset to you?
14415,Leonard,"sheldon, sheldon?"
14417,Leonard,"listen, i don’t know if i can go on the expedition."
14420,Leonard,"terrific, it’s just that i don’t think penny wants me to go."
14422,Leonard,it’s a blanket with sleeves.
14428,Leonard,what did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
14429,Leonard,"all right, fine. what about that really long hug? what did that mean?"
14433,Leonard,thank you. bye.
14434,Leonard,damn it.
14435,Leonard,we’re out of ice.
14451,Leonard,"no, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. look, we kept the original data. you can still publish the actual results."
14458,Leonard,"well, tell your genitals what i do with penny is none of their business."
14461,Leonard,so much for our friendship with sheldon.
14466,Leonard,"man, i can not catch a break."
14468,Leonard,"of course i’m going to do something. uh, howard, you check the comic book store. raj, go to the thai restaurant. i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment.  oh, damn it. it’s sheldon’s mother. a break cannot be caught. hi, mrs. cooper. he is? sheldon went home to texas. yeah, no, i know he resigned. yes, i guess it kind of is our fault. no, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. don’t worry, i’ll take care of it. yeah. all right. new plan. howard, you and raj go to texas. i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment."
14469,Leonard,"well, you know, i gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… oh, come on, i don’t want to go to texas!"
14473,Leonard,maybe you can.
14484,Leonard,"no, this is my home now. thanks to you, my career is over and i will spend the rest of my life here in texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
14488,Leonard,"i mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. we’re whatever this is. but why label it, right? i mean, it is what it is and…"
14491,Leonard,"hey, guys."
14495,Leonard,it’s not a matter of opportunity. we’re getting to know each other. there’s a learning curve.
14496,Leonard,"nothing like that happened, all right? the sex was just fine."
14499,Leonard,"all i know is, it wasn’t the way i dreamed it would be."
14503,Leonard,"trust me, this will be just fine."
14509,Leonard,"nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
14510,Leonard,"yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. you put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
14514,Leonard,so much.
14523,Leonard,i bet i could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
14527,Leonard,interesting.
14529,Leonard,little bit. 
14533,Leonard,"it would, wouldn’t it?"
14540,Leonard,don’t do that.
14548,Leonard,"it does. but in my experience, you don’t."
14555,Leonard,"okay, i know what you’re doing."
14562,Leonard,what could she possibly be talking about for so long?
14565,Leonard,forget it.
14571,Leonard,"really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
14576,Leonard,what’s he on trial for?
14579,Leonard,"what do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
14581,Leonard,"so, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
14584,Leonard,yeah.
14585,Leonard,"wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? because we should file a complaint."
14591,Leonard,"hi, howard."
14597,Leonard,what are you doing here?
14600,Leonard,"thank you. there’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, i was warming them up."
14604,Leonard,okay. howard come back.
14610,Leonard,sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
14614,Leonard,"yeah, i don’t remember that."
14615,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
14618,Leonard,"oh, damn it. can i have a napkin?"
14621,Leonard,"because i’ve been busy, because i haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and i can’t stress how key this is, because i don’t want to."
14622,Leonard,"it’s not that simple. what am i supposed to say? penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
14627,Leonard,"not really. i googled how to do that. so, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
14635,Leonard,will you at least think about it? just as a favour to me?
14651,Leonard,"well, this sucks."
14653,Leonard,"maybe koothrappali’s right, maybe i embarrass her."
14656,Leonard,"oh, how kind of her."
14664,Leonard,i wouldn’t be bored. why would i be bored?
14667,Leonard,another football game?
14668,Leonard,did not know that.
14670,Leonard,great.
14674,Leonard,"sacks, sacks…"
14675,Leonard,huh… scrimmage…
14679,Leonard,unbelievable.
14681,Leonard,football. i’m going to penny’s on saturday to watch a game with her friends and i don’t want to look like an idiot. i want to blend in.
14685,Leonard,i really appreciate this.
14692,Leonard,"yeah, okay, like you said."
14695,Leonard,go! go! go! go-go-go-go! yes! are you people watching this? is this amazing or what?
14696,Leonard,oh. did not know that.
14699,Leonard,"that completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. i can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
14700,Leonard,"penny, you know i’m lactose intolerant."
14712,Leonard,because of the reasons that penny will now tell you. penny?
14715,Leonard,who is this justin?
14717,Leonard,hang on. some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
14718,Leonard,"so by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
14722,Leonard,i’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! i’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
14723,Leonard,"you know what? it is your life. if you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite the black eyed peas?"
14725,Leonard,the two aren’t mutually exclusive!
14750,Leonard,what?
14756,Leonard,"well, i can’t read your mind, penny!"
14757,Leonard,what are you doing? he’s not a lost dog.
14765,Leonard,why should i let it go? why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
14768,Leonard,so what did justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
14770,Leonard,"uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
14777,Leonard,"stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
14781,Leonard,i hate my name. it has nerd in it. len nerd.
14789,Leonard,will you shut up? we’re all hungry.
14791,Leonard,"all right, everyone grab flashlights."
14794,Leonard,he struck out.
14796,Leonard,"no, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
14800,Leonard,"very cool, congratulations."
14804,Leonard,"excuse me, i’m sitting here."
14805,Leonard,"again, i’m right here."
14808,Leonard,"come on, it wasn’t that bad."
14809,Leonard,"okay, so kripke played a joke on you."
14821,Leonard,"let me guess, motion sensors?"
14825,Leonard,at least they don’t know it was you.
14827,Leonard,it upsets sheldon when you play with the sheldon.
14838,Leonard,"ah, terrific. we’re getting the electron accelerator set up. we should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
14839,Leonard,you’re welcome to come.
14840,Leonard,excuse me?
14845,Leonard,i believe you.
14856,Leonard,he had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
14859,Leonard,"tushy face, that is going on twitter right now."
14865,Leonard,here we go.
14866,Leonard,"merry newton-mas, everyone."
14876,Leonard,um…
14880,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait. you had surgery?"
14885,Leonard,"no. sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
14888,Leonard,i don’t know what you’re talking about.
14905,Leonard,"you’re right, i do feel better."
14907,Leonard,what the hell is going on?
14909,Leonard,how come you didn’t tell me that you and father were getting a divorce? how come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? how come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
14918,Leonard,"what are you trying to tell me, howard?"
14921,Leonard,"uh, sorry, raj. howard and i are going out to dinner with penny and bernadette."
14939,Leonard,it’s not just cylons. superman’s next.
14946,Leonard,"hey. cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. i could never be mad at you."
14950,Leonard,"well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
14963,Leonard,would i be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
14970,Leonard,mm-hmm.
14971,Leonard,"yes, we are. and we’re about to go to bed."
14975,Leonard,did we win? can we go to bed?
14980,Leonard,who is it?
14986,Leonard,it was us. we knocked over a lamp.
14998,Leonard,"mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after peter pan cut it off."
15004,Leonard,"yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
15006,Leonard,"here, you want my peas?"
15012,Leonard,don’t tell koothrappali. after you.
15018,Leonard,"it’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. the joker from batman."
15025,Leonard,"sure, sure. how did you get into this place?"
15026,Leonard,"no, i don’t think so. we need to go home now."
15030,Leonard,and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
15031,Leonard,because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
15032,Leonard,really? you figured out the graphene problem?
15040,Leonard,"hang on. black beans, not pinto beans?"
15048,Leonard,"yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
15050,Leonard,"well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
15068,Leonard,just a minute. this tray contains clues as to what you and i are going to be doing on valentine’s day.
15085,Leonard,you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas?
15086,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
15088,Leonard,you seen sheldon?
15089,Leonard,"yeah. he thinks i betrayed him. i mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
15097,Leonard,"okay, great. still not taking you to switzerland."
15103,Leonard,i don’t need to see your presentation. this discussion is over!
15106,Leonard,i’m sorry you feel that way.
15107,Leonard,why don’t you enlighten me?
15113,Leonard,penny? you okay?
15114,Leonard,what’s going on?
15116,Leonard,"hey, sheldon? listen, penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to switzerland. so if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. "
15117,Leonard,"yeah, i forgot about all this."
15121,Leonard,"i can’t decide whether i want stan lee to autograph my journey into mystery 83, first appearance of thor or my fantastic four number five, first appearance of dr. doom. "
15131,Leonard,it’s not that big a deal. you just go down to the court on thursday and you pay the fine.
15138,Leonard,so tell him to apologize.
15139,Leonard,"oh, no, that’s terrible. ooh, the line’s moving. got to go. bye."
15144,Leonard,except for raj.
15148,Leonard,"don’t panic, this is better."
15152,Leonard,"no. but there is an original final draft ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  oh, you’re right, it’s ghostbusters 2. never mind."
15156,Leonard,what?
15158,Leonard,and in the darkness bind them.
15164,Leonard,"we are not blackmailing peter j… all right, where’s the ring?"
15171,Leonard,"it’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
15173,Leonard,what was that?
15174,Leonard,that’s my girl.
15175,Leonard,no.
15185,Leonard,you want to talk about endless patience? penny made me watch all five seasons of sex and the city.
15192,Leonard,peter jackson’s office in new zealand. it wasn’t ours.
15197,Leonard,"oh, i’m so glad you asked it like that. you."
15210,Leonard,"so, sheldon, how you doing?"
15216,Leonard,"but it could be part of your problem. let me give you an example. when i was eight, i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “do lima beans grow better to classical music.” but my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “do lima beans grow worse to rock ‘n’ roll.” i felt so guilty, i gave the ribbon back."
15221,Leonard,"wait, that’s it? i thought we had a whole hour!"
15222,Leonard,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. my name is dr. leonard hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science and my good friend, dr. sheldon cooper. but before i do, i’d like to share with you a letter from sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. isn’t that nice? his mother sent him a letter. she’s proud of him. i wonder what that feels like. dear shelly. that’s what she calls him. shelly, it’s a pet name. you know what my mother’s pet name for me is? leonard. but i digress. dear shelly. i am so proud of… "
15228,Leonard,did you just quote star wars?
15231,Leonard,good. glad is good.
15235,Leonard,good night.
15236,Leonard,seriously? you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
15244,Leonard,no.
15246,Leonard,"oh, hey."
15252,Leonard,"okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. so, what do you want to say?"
15257,Leonard,"all right, maybe i overreacted. so we’re in two different places emotionally. so what? and maybe i’m a little ahead of you. that’s fine. you know. in fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, i’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
15266,Leonard,"penny, you’re up."
15268,Leonard,so just take your time and concentrate.
15280,Leonard,"so, you guys want to do something tonight?"
15282,Leonard,i never stopped hanging out with you.
15290,Leonard,very much.
15304,Leonard,i’m in bed!
15317,Leonard,i was going to do that.
15318,Leonard,"no, i don’t want to do it. you can do it."
15331,Leonard,aren’t you going to thank penny for taking you to disneyland?
15345,Leonard,i can’t believe he’s friends with elizabeth plimpton.
15350,Leonard,"look, it’s you."
15357,Leonard,"me neither. oh, look what i’m reading. it’s you."
15359,Leonard,"oh, good. wasn’t sure it was coming across."
15362,Leonard,"really? uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
15369,Leonard,"okay, well, i guess i should get dressed so i can take everyone to work. you and sheldon and sheldon’s friend, dr. plimpton, who you just met. it’ll be fun. like a clown car."
15370,Leonard,hmm? yeah? what? huh?
15373,Leonard,"well, now…"
15374,Leonard,well…
15405,Leonard,can i sleep on your couch tonight?
15412,Leonard,"sure, it makes sense now. . anyway, i went upstairs and knocked on the door."
15419,Leonard,"well, i was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. it’s kind of secret."
15423,Leonard,i’m getting to it. 
15427,Leonard,"yeah, we’re really close. uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. "
15430,Leonard,hey.
15433,Leonard,"okay, i’m sorry."
15436,Leonard,"okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
15438,Leonard,"howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility."
15439,Leonard,"relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
15446,Leonard,it’s pretty cool. we’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. i thought you might want to see it.
15449,Leonard,your company?
15453,Leonard,"uh, that’s a great question, zack."
15456,Leonard,"right. uh yeah, funny. uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. raj, get them some glasses."
15462,Leonard,i’ll help you.
15467,Leonard,"okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
15470,Leonard,"why? i mean, okay."
15475,Leonard,"oh, hey."
15479,Leonard,"when you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
15481,Leonard,"so, that’s it? wham, bam, thank you, leonard?"
15499,Leonard,alright.
15507,Leonard,yeah?
15508,Leonard,what?
15510,Leonard,"okay, let’s see."
15517,Leonard,"excuse me, could you help us out?"
15518,Leonard,"uh, it’s what controls the arm."
15524,Leonard,interesting. cause of death for uncle carl was kbb. what’s kbb?
15534,Leonard,wait a minute. you hate dogs.
15535,Leonard,it came to $28.17. let’s say six bucks apiece.
15537,Leonard,never mind. i got it.
15542,Leonard,"sheldon, six bucks."
15547,Leonard,have you had your appendix out?
15558,Leonard,"sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
15573,Leonard,right.
15576,Leonard,"i was wrong, this is exactly like knight rider."
15579,Leonard,whoa!
15580,Leonard,i almost died!
15601,Leonard,"ah, ah."
15603,Leonard,"okay, that’s all i got. howard, you’re up."
15609,Leonard,so we already have you for all that.
15610,Leonard,"no, no, of course not. just have your relationship someplace else."
15611,Leonard,suffered in silence?
15617,Leonard,"i tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
15635,Leonard,"cats, sheldon. you’re clearly upset about amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
15638,Leonard,terrific. my-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
15643,Leonard,he’s in his bedroom.
15644,Leonard,"no, she’s real."
15650,Leonard,"yeah, it’s like if alien and predator decided to go partners in a jamba juice."
15653,Leonard,"no, i can’t eat melon."
15654,Leonard,when was the last time you saw her?
15655,Leonard,hey.
15656,Leonard,"you know, you never told me what happened between you and bernadette."
15665,Leonard,yeah?
15667,Leonard,"oh, congratulations. have you broken it to the troll yet?"
15668,Leonard,no. steve patterson told me.
15675,Leonard,what are you doing in there?
15677,Leonard,isn’t that flammable?
15679,Leonard,thank you.
15687,Leonard,probably. what’s your point?
15689,Leonard,"um, shut up."
15690,Leonard,that sounds lovely.
15695,Leonard,you have a girlfriend? how could you have a girlfriend? you can’t even speak to women.
15697,Leonard,"great. you have a girlfriend, howard’s got a girlfriend, sheldon’s got a girl…"
15698,Leonard,…who’s a friend.
15703,Leonard,because i don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. i’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
15706,Leonard,no.
15708,Leonard,thank you.
15721,Leonard,"okay, good luck."
15729,Leonard,"i want to invoke the girlfriend pact, howard."
15742,Leonard,"thanks again for doing this, bernadette."
15748,Leonard,"should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound."
15752,Leonard,"i guess the difference is, i have some self-respect."
15755,Leonard,you’re asking me out?
15760,Leonard,"i’m going too, i’ll show you where it is."
15765,Leonard,i guess he just hates fun.
15766,Leonard,"so, uh, priya, what are your plans while you’re here."
15767,Leonard,"it’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?"
15770,Leonard,"yeah, well,  sheldon’s still up."
15773,Leonard,drop axe.
15779,Leonard,"oh, uh, building manager. they have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
15780,Leonard,"no, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
15782,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, no. you just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. come on, i’ll help you. so, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
15783,Leonard,"you’re right, you’re lost, good luck."
15788,Leonard,"well, i’m just saying, i don’t have any real ties here, so if i were to move to new delhi we could, you know, go out."
15791,Leonard,i’m not that white. my great-great grandmother was half cherokee. i know that’s not the right kind of indian but it is something.
15795,Leonard,"uh, rash, that’s a bad rash."
15796,Leonard,"uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
15799,Leonard,without.
15800,Leonard,fine. with.
15802,Leonard,sounds great.
15808,Leonard,priya and i are both adults. we didn’t betray raj.
15813,Leonard,"okay fine, i’m, i’m a horrible human being, i’m the darth vader of pasadena."
15814,Leonard,"my point is, priya’s gone. and it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
15815,Leonard,yes.
15823,Leonard,"oh, i’m so sure i’m going to regret this, but, who was i with?"
15833,Leonard,"to, uh, lucky baldwin’s."
15835,Leonard,as a matter of fact i.. i… i can’t… i can’t… i can’t do it.
15838,Leonard,"look, i admit it, i may have crossed a line here, but come on, raj, your sister is a grown woman. to her, i’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
15847,Leonard,"these are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
15855,Leonard,congratulations howard.
15878,Leonard,because you feel guilty?
15884,Leonard,i can’t believe you’ve never seen raiders of the lost ark.
15889,Leonard,"relax, it’s five o’clock. the movie doesn’t start till midnight."
15892,Leonard,excellent.
15899,Leonard,so i guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
15903,Leonard,"it’s fine, it’s fine. go back to sleep."
15906,Leonard,"had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?"
15909,Leonard,short round?
15910,Leonard,"yeah, i know who it is, but why is it me?"
15913,Leonard,"sheldon, this is crazy."
15916,Leonard,he’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing?
15921,Leonard,"oh, good. context."
15931,Leonard,why do i bother talking to you people?
15939,Leonard,"i’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened."
15957,Leonard,don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
15968,Leonard,"gee, i don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir."
15975,Leonard,really? you waited months for time with that telescope. what happened?
15995,Leonard,that’s an atom.
15996,Leonard,"so, you and zack again, huh?"
16007,Leonard,"come on, that’s what we do. we give each other a hard time. hey, sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
16010,Leonard,don’t.
16014,Leonard,you can’t replace me with zack.
16029,Leonard,not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on new year’s eve.
16031,Leonard,there’s a big difference. arrow. lantern.
16037,Leonard,"i had a great idea. you know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing fourier analysis, or using the schrodinger equation?"
16042,Leonard,yeah.
16049,Leonard,that is ridiculous.
16058,Leonard,"sheldon, i think this will work. let’s just try it my way."
16071,Leonard,but i fired you.
16072,Leonard,"no, you are now nothing. you have no connection to this project whatsoever."
16074,Leonard,what the hell are bus pants?
16088,Leonard,we’re not playing. this is real work.
16091,Leonard,"thank you. so as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on facebook right from the app."
16092,Leonard,thanks.
16107,Leonard,"yeah, it is a little like getting into dracula’s coffin."
16110,Leonard,"star trek. you know, the neutral zone between the federation and the romulan empire."
16118,Leonard,i’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
16134,Leonard,"in a word, triumphant."
16141,Leonard,"hang on. hang on. uh-huh. okay, thank you. howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. he’s in critical condition."
16145,Leonard,"i guess it depends on the zombies, raj. are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? like, in 28 days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
16147,Leonard,are you sure this is right?
16149,Leonard,really? what do we tell siebert?
16151,Leonard,more than this?
16152,Leonard,he’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of god.
16157,Leonard,"mrs. latham, the first machine i turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up."
16158,Leonard,you’re kidding. that was good for you? ‘cause i was sweating through my t-shirt.
16160,Leonard,"hello, mrs. latham. yes, i live with him. i don’t, i, i really don’t know why. tonight? sure, that’d be great. okay, i’ll, i’ll see you then. bye. she wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
16165,Leonard,the only time i eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
16179,Leonard,"well, n-no, hold on a second, i’m not going to sleep with her."
16195,Leonard,"no, it’s true."
16203,Leonard,"no, i didn’t do it for the money."
16204,Leonard,"no, i mean, i, i, i got the money first."
16208,Leonard,"uh, sure. why?"
16213,Leonard,priya’s in town?
16216,Leonard,it’s leonard.
16218,Leonard,what are you doing here?
16220,Leonard,i know. last time i came on too strong. can we talk in private?
16234,Leonard,just come with me to raj’s.
16237,Leonard,"i don’t know what to tell you, sheldon. i’m going to see priya. everyone’s over there. you coming or not?"
16243,Leonard,so don’t watch tv. read a book.
16244,Leonard,ugh!
16256,Leonard,okay.
16262,Leonard,i hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from texas.
16263,Leonard,"did you know that, per our roommate agreement, i have to wash my feet before i get in the shower? and not in the sink. we each have special buckets."
16293,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i’m, never mind."
16294,Leonard,"oh, hi."
16302,Leonard,"okay, uh, how do i put this? um, are you familiar with darwin’s observation of the finches in the galapagos islands?"
16309,Leonard,"oh, yes. indeed, i did."
16313,Leonard,what?
16321,Leonard,"sheldon, that computer is used for national defence. hacking into it is a federal crime."
16322,Leonard,"okay, i’m leaving before the black helicopters get here."
16326,Leonard,does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
16340,Leonard,"i don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. the building’s plumbing."
16343,Leonard,"penny, wait.  damned contacts."
16345,Leonard,"yeah, leonard hofstadter. what happened?"
16352,Leonard,"i’m really sorry, sheldon."
16360,Leonard,"why don’t we play this smart? try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
16362,Leonard,"oh, wait. hang on. are you upset?"
16365,Leonard,"come on, help me out. am i in trouble?"
16373,Leonard,"aw, screw it. i’m in."
16379,Leonard,"sheldon, let’s go."
16380,Leonard,"okay, let’s get clear on something. we’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. no one’s bat’lething anybody."
16383,Leonard,"you’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a fedex box. "
30722,Raj,"hey, leonard, will you please tell howard my sister’s never been attracted to him."
32772,Raj,"ugh, i feel like i’m gonna have a heart attack."
30726,Raj,what? you slept with my sister?
30727,Raj,"excuse me, i think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!"
32781,Raj,i meant a hindu temple.
32785,Raj,"religion is a very personal thing. i do go to temple, i just, i don’t talk about it."
32786,Raj,so?
30737,Raj,yes.
30739,Raj,where are we going?
30743,Raj,nobody cares. do you know how long it’s been since i got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
30748,Raj,"no, just me. oh, there it is. here comes a cavity search."
32798,Raj,"go ahead, make fun. you can’t embarrass me, i’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater."
32805,Raj,come on.
32808,Raj,"wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. it’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe."
30760,Raj,i haven’t cried like this since toy story 3.
30761,Raj,eight for 28.
30768,Raj,you’re right. it should be a cuddly asian boy. like me.
32818,Raj,"come on, sheldon!"
32820,Raj,"you know what? at least you guys did something. you know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. all guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work."
30772,Raj,we’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. there are no stupid questions.
32823,Raj,"yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
30776,Raj,"ooh, ooh! do our babies will be smart and beautiful. that one always makes me laugh."
32826,Raj,"and he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like i do. i always did feel a connection with him. oh, i have got an idea."
32827,Raj,"no, if we got captain reynolds from firefly to do a signing at stuart’s store, that would be amazing."
30778,Raj,not if it has a hole in the middle.
32834,Raj,"are you sure you’re not him? uh, you can tell us. we’re scientists, not crazy fanboys."
30787,Raj,no. i got them all cut.
30789,Raj,"he’s right. let’s make fun of his mother. howard, come rub my feet! my corns are killing me!"
32841,Raj,that’s what i said when we moved it.
30794,Raj,"oh, what’s the point of everything?"
32844,Raj,he’s hanging in there.
30801,Raj,nothing happened. can we please just change the subject?
32850,Raj,"you guys are really being calm about penny and sheldon doing this thing. if it were me i’d, i’d be a little nervous."
32851,Raj,"well, even if the study’s nonsense, i don’t believe in tempting fate. same reason i wouldn’t use a ouija board, or pick a fight with an asian guy. he probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?"
32856,Raj,"not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
32859,Raj,"uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?"
30812,Raj,"who wouldn’t? you could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. and the best part is, if i were rat-man, you could be my sidekick, mouse boy."
32861,Raj,"okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded."
30815,Raj,"yeah, leonard, who?"
30817,Raj,"i don’t know. um, nuclear war. accidentally being buried alive. any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do."
30819,Raj,what the heck is this?
32868,Raj,"okay, cool. oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while i’m here alone, right? ‘cause that’ll be awkward."
30823,Raj,"all right, i will."
32873,Raj,i can’t get emily’s night-stand to close.
30830,Raj,"what kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights."
32881,Raj,did that feel good? you feel like a big man now?
30837,Raj,just because i didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! you bloviating buffoon!
32889,Raj,yeah.
32890,Raj,you’ve never snooped around my apartment?
30841,Raj,and nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
30842,Raj,first day of cricket camp. they drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
30844,Raj,junior mints are pretty apologetic.
30847,Raj,but i’m green lantern.
32899,Raj,everything okay?
30856,Raj,you know what’s a great app? the one that makes fart noises.
32907,Raj,"mm, and not a vegetable in sight."
32909,Raj,the lead in the hunger games is a woman. marvel has made tor a female.
30863,Raj,ooh. leonard’s going all alpha nerd on sheldon’s ass.
30866,Raj,world’s greatest astrophysicist?
30868,Raj,"hey, we agreed when it was eureka time, we were all gonna say it together."
32918,Raj,so did i.
30870,Raj,"you mean, project lenwoloppali?"
32921,Raj,let’s just play.
30876,Raj,why?
30877,Raj,okay. come on in.
32926,Raj,"hey, i got you a little gift."
32927,Raj,"you know me. i’m from india. i can’t resist children begging. so, how’s it going with the title to the house?"
30878,Raj,"hey, leonard, sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key."
30879,Raj,"certainly. i’d like to raise two points. number one, i think they are talking about penises. and number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass."
30886,Raj,you really think so?
32938,Raj,"all right, i’ve got your back."
30891,Raj,what kind of needs?
32941,Raj,hey.
30896,Raj,"oh, no!"
32945,Raj,and i was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
32946,Raj,"exactly what i expected. two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. you two are out. congratulations, leonard, you’re on the team."
32951,Raj,"huh, what does that make us?"
32953,Raj,"okay, that sounds like us."
32954,Raj,i don’t know. how do you want to start?
32955,Raj,no. we can do this by ourselves.
30905,Raj,"here’s what i wonder about zombies.  what happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? they can’t starve to death, they’re already dead."
30908,Raj,or maybe he heard it’s tator tot tuesday. that’s why i’m here.
30911,Raj,"oh, boy! tator tots and a party invitation? what a great day!"
32962,Raj,"okay, let’s talk about something else."
32964,Raj,"like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers."
32971,Raj,"well, thank you for peeing in my slippers."
30923,Raj,forbaded it?
30930,Raj,"there it is, priya. we’re indian. we believe this stuff."
30934,Raj,she says it the same way i do. i’d love that. everybody in india says it that way. it’s not a big deal.
32985,Raj,"he’s right. if you think about it, we’re all in charge."
30937,Raj,"hey, you’re just in time. we made tex-mex."
30938,Raj,"okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own."
32990,Raj,"mm. hello, daddy. what’s up?"
32999,Raj,i don’t freaking believe this.
30951,Raj,beefaroni and a show? how do you turn that down?
33003,Raj,"okay. okay, you’re right. it’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. be a man.  hello, mummy."
33005,Raj,"well, i like to think i take mostly after you. anyway, speaking of daddy, i had a very strange conversation with him. he said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."
33008,Raj,"thank you, mummy, i love you. helicopters for everybody."
30962,Raj,i don’t think my character should be in a place like this. everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
33011,Raj,not cool.
33017,Raj,"well, i try to. i certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  who wants to go to vegas in a real helicopter?"
30969,Raj,what else do we know about him?
33019,Raj,we haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
33020,Raj,"hey, i don’t even live here."
30971,Raj,"i have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?"
33025,Raj,looks good.
30977,Raj,"hey, how about we stay the night and hit legoland in the morning?"
33027,Raj,"you’re kidding, right?"
30979,Raj,i took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
33029,Raj,"no, no, no. hey, you should totally get it. in fact, i’ll buy it for you."
33030,Raj,you guys ever notice that emily has a bit of a twisted side?
30985,Raj,very basic.
33036,Raj,you guys are being jerks.
30991,Raj,"don’t worry. everything i have, i share with her. including my friend leon…"
33040,Raj,"so does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are."
33044,Raj,"no, no, i’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and i’m dark on the outside."
33048,Raj,i’m sure you guys will figure something out.
31000,Raj,i know. it’ll be awful.
31001,Raj,"uh, a smile means something different in my country. you know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. india’s a goofy place."
31003,Raj,no. it’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. like when the three of us went to the movies and you and i waited outside the bathroom while howard threw up red vines and cherry coke. do you remember that?
31004,Raj,"me, too. good times."
33058,Raj,how do you know?
33061,Raj,"i don’t know, but i’d like to get lost in her bermuda triangle."
31013,Raj,"leonard, please. the man is talking. let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may."
31014,Raj,this is it.
31016,Raj,"mmm, greek food on pizza night? this is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to sheldon since we left that fake message from stephen hawking on his voice mail."
33065,Raj,"well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."
33068,Raj,and i told you he bit me.
31020,Raj,i need a hug.
33070,Raj,"yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it."
31023,Raj,"well, not so much depressed as lonely."
33072,Raj,we can drive there.
33073,Raj,what’s wrong with mexico?
33075,Raj,"dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?"
33076,Raj,"perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness."
31028,Raj,no.
33078,Raj,are you turning it the right way?
33080,Raj,it’s called lamaze breathing. it helps you push.
33084,Raj,"if you need a green hand, why not just use the hulk?"
31037,Raj,"thank you for coming with me, sheldon. you’re a good friend."
31042,Raj,"my name is dr. rajesh koothrappali, and this is my friend dr. sheldon cooper."
33093,Raj,"dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name."
31051,Raj,sorry. walking tree.
33101,Raj,"okay, and here’s the hook. thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
31057,Raj,one of them broke up with you. do you really want her telling the other one why?
31058,Raj,"good, good. then you have nothing to worry about."
31060,Raj,like what?
33110,Raj,"you can do both, like michael jackson’s billie jean. while you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?"
31063,Raj,so you’d do a striptease?
31066,Raj,your big problem is me telling her.
31075,Raj,i guess that’s okay.
33124,Raj,we can still be swashers.
31077,Raj,leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate star trek sex with my sister.
33126,Raj,"ooh, ooh, i forgot about princess bride. that’s my answer."
31079,Raj,"well, he’s in my bed. why can’t i be in his?"
31081,Raj,"good night, sheldon."
33131,Raj,"why? you never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met amy. maybe there’s someone else out there for you."
31085,Raj,"scotty, i need more power."
31086,Raj,"are you kidding? he made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in cpr. thank god he had a dummy."
31093,Raj,what the hell is this?
31095,Raj,did you sign this?
33149,Raj,"so, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
33152,Raj,you sure? it’s a pretty great wall.
31104,Raj,"well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
31106,Raj,it’s my sister. can we not talk about this any more?
33160,Raj,"hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
33161,Raj,"oh, right, uh, girlfriend. okay."
33164,Raj,i don’t know if i’d say you… oh.
33166,Raj,i’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
33167,Raj,this is exciting.
33168,Raj,"i, i hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard."
31125,Raj,"hi, amy. can i talk to penny?"
31127,Raj,"i was wondering if you’re free friday. they’re having a totally ’80s night at the greek. hall & oates, katrina and the waves and three-fifths of kajagoogoo."
33178,Raj,answer it.
33180,Raj,have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to siri without pressing any buttons?
31135,Raj,"penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
33185,Raj,"you’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of oliver!"
31137,Raj,"cool. can i say it fell apart because you were all, i want to have your babies, and i was like, i’m too rock and roll to be tied down?"
33191,Raj,"oh. did you know, at the united nations, there’s a department for outer space affairs?"
31145,Raj,"sure, whatever."
31153,Raj,like this?
33204,Raj,"yeah. he’s 24. he’s a deejay. he brews his own beer. he’s got awesome tattoos. dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too."
31157,Raj,sorry. better?
33206,Raj,that is so cool. old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
33214,Raj,"it’s okay. oh, it’s okay. he’s done."
31168,Raj,does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
31170,Raj,"ah, look at that. i have a date. i love america again."
31171,Raj,"okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows i’m cool with it, i’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. i was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? oh, no, i bet you didn’t."
33225,Raj,"oh, did you hear from wil?"
33229,Raj,and we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
31182,Raj,you’re right. everyone loves music.
33236,Raj,oh. what if leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
33238,Raj,lack of confidence.
33239,Raj,pushover.
33247,Raj,no.
31199,Raj,it’s okay. i can’t get mad at your feelings.
31205,Raj,"well, i choose love."
31210,Raj,"look, penny, you’re great, but i had a long talk with my parents, and they said if i date an indian girl, i get a maserati."
31211,Raj,"mmm. oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though i can’t have sex with you."
33260,Raj,"i learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you."
31215,Raj,sure.
33267,Raj,yay.
33268,Raj,"sheldon, stop being a baby and let emily take a look at you."
33270,Raj,i wish we could do more stuff without sheldon.
33272,Raj,"oh, ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
33274,Raj,of course i do.
31227,Raj,what is she doing in a comic book store?
33278,Raj,"fine, how about this? you’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and i wish you’d stop."
31233,Raj,"totally. what’s wrong with cap sleeves? if you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable."
31239,Raj,"still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. or a dolphin, i go back and forth."
33291,Raj,"it was a classic western set in the post-jurassic period, and it changed my life."
33294,Raj,"i’m raj, by the way. this is howard."
33300,Raj,"yeah, great."
33301,Raj,"yeah, bye."
31253,Raj,"yeah, it’s also a wand."
31255,Raj,you’re so full of it.
31260,Raj,what’s that one?
33314,Raj,"come on, i just told you i had a girlfriend. the least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
31267,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the hogwarts express with your name on it."
33318,Raj,"okay. that hurts a little, but okay."
31275,Raj,"if they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play leonard’s mother? sandra bullock."
33329,Raj,"well, you say it like it’s easy. have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"
33331,Raj,"oh, i’m gonna do a pre-cry before i go in there. really dry myself out."
31285,Raj,are you single?
31289,Raj,what are you doing right now?
33342,Raj,"rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents."
31294,Raj,i’d like you to call me sexy.
31295,Raj,okay.
31296,Raj,"thank you, darling."
31297,Raj,i’m sorry?
33348,Raj,"well, he could bring the baby here."
33349,Raj,"i read that in los angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars."
31303,Raj,"oh, an exotic little treat. i was just talking to siri about peking duck, and she said she knew about four chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. her spontaneity is contagious."
33352,Raj,"yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
31305,Raj,"oh, my god, kenny g? this woman can read me like a book. i can’t believe i bought my soul mate at glendale galleria."
33355,Raj,"uh, it’s in the corner."
31308,Raj,"dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
33359,Raj,it’s a good sign.
31311,Raj,how’d you do?
31313,Raj,maybe your nickname should be brown dynamite.
33362,Raj,"just bust a move,"
33363,Raj,"just bust a move,"
31321,Raj,maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
31323,Raj,they don’t call me brown dynamite for nothing.
31324,Raj,"ooh, sock mouth’s got him on the ropes."
33373,Raj,"hey, guys. hey, penny. i really appreciate you helping me with this. i don’t know what to do."
33376,Raj,"well, she was pretty mad. for all i know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk."
33377,Raj,"you know, on game of thrones, balon greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box."
33378,Raj,wow. it’s an antique sextant. sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
33379,Raj,"i know, she’s so thoughtful."
31332,Raj,"ooh, gossip. when i first got here, i thought you americans really gossiped around the water cooler. so i hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip i ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
31334,Raj,hmm. i’m gonna give you the same advice i yell at the tv when the bachelor’s handing out roses. follow your heart.
33386,Raj,hello?
33387,Raj,"yeah, yeah. sure. what’s up?"
33392,Raj,"well, anyway, i’ll leave you to your girls’ night."
31345,Raj,yeah.
33395,Raj,will do.
33396,Raj,"hi. i’m good. really good. well, i don’t know why i said really good. i’m just regular good. i really just wanted to sound confident. and that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
31351,Raj,"payload specialist howard wolowitz is requested to report to the nasa johnson space center, houston, texas, for astronaut training monday eight a.m."
33401,Raj,that’s exactly what she said. how do you know that?
31355,Raj,"now who’s dying of jealousy? oh, it’s you."
31356,Raj,"hey, want to spend some time playing the new star wars game this weekend?"
31361,Raj,woo-hoo!
33410,Raj,"i hear what you’re saying, but i’ve known emily a long time, and i think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."
31372,Raj,"alright, uh, fine, i’m coming and i’m bringing somebody. uh, koothrappali plus one."
31373,Raj,who are you bringing?
33422,Raj,"no, ma’am."
33423,Raj,"i love it, i’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? and then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. yeah, i get it. i wouldn’t make out with me, either."
31374,Raj,"wow, what a bunch of nosey o’donnells."
31375,Raj,i’m not telling. i’m from asia. i’m mysterious. deal with it.
31379,Raj,"‘cause i, i’m tired of trying to meet someone and, i think i’d like you to help me find uh, a wife."
33431,Raj,"please, my pleasure."
33436,Raj,"i appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. i overstepped my bounds."
33437,Raj,"well, if that’s the case, is there anything i can do to help?"
31390,Raj,"well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! lava cake."
31391,Raj,"well, let’s see. yup, three missed calls."
33443,Raj,you guys made a person.
33449,Raj,"man, i’m worn out."
31402,Raj,ready for lunch?
33451,Raj,"but, dude, you’re so lucky. getting to stay home at night with the woman you love."
33452,Raj,"you are, because dating two women, i mean, i can’t even remember the last time i slept in my own apartment. i wake up and i’m like, am i at claire’s or am i at emily’s? is there a third girl i’ve forgotten about? like, where am i?"
31404,Raj,"we hit a couple of bumps. she lives over on manhattan beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. and she’s a lesbian."
33456,Raj,"totally, guys are the worst. i mean, look at me. i let emily make me a frittata and i kept the leftovers in claire’s fridge that night. i’m such a dog."
33457,Raj,"i’m sorry, have i been complaining about it too much?"
31408,Raj,"it’s a great deal. we both get our parents off our backs. i don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once i’m married, i can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
31413,Raj,"what, you told her?"
31414,Raj,"so, while i’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, i’m supposed to just be alone."
33465,Raj,"fine, i don’t want to watch with you either. i’ll go over here."
33466,Raj,"okay, then you go there."
31422,Raj,are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
33473,Raj,"okay. oh, how about this? stuart’s dressed like a brother of the night’s watch, and they don’t have sex."
31425,Raj,"well, don’t be too mean."
31426,Raj,i wouldn’t mind a glass.
31432,Raj,"anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about howard’s bachelor party."
31434,Raj,you don’t want strippers? you’re the king of strippers. the one club in north hollywood named a pole after you.
33486,Raj,"oh, she’s meeting us here. hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. we’re just keeping it casual."
33489,Raj,"also, uh, cherries?"
33490,Raj,hey.
31442,Raj,"okay, uh, anybody else? huh? no? okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. ooh! this grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. okay, when i first came to this country, i-i didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, i was pretty lonely. but then i met howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. this man became my whole world."
31443,Raj,"i’m not done, but thank you.  i think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. i told him i’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
33496,Raj,we’re just keeping it casual.
31452,Raj,i’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from comic-con.
33501,Raj,"so, uh, what are you guys talking about?"
31455,Raj,"when you come back to earth in a soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. and the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture rocky and bullwinkle."
31458,Raj,you’re nervous? i’ve been stress-eating for four days. look at me. i’m wearing my fat pants.
31460,Raj,where did he pop the question? what did you say?
31465,Raj,"what, we’re ready when i say we’re ready. uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready."
31466,Raj,penny.  
31470,Raj,"me, too."
31475,Raj,i’m all for it.
31476,Raj,"hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, i heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. i don’t need to tell you in los angeles, sandal season is year round."
33525,Raj,i’d like to think the four on your side guy cares about me.
33529,Raj,it is funny when you think about it.
33531,Raj,howard wolowitz?
31485,Raj,"it’s your anniversary? oh, my god, i had no idea. amy, please, let me make this right. "
31490,Raj,"you know, i’m growing to like american football. "
31492,Raj,"no, thank you."
31493,Raj,"oh, i’m having the nicest time. you guys are like family to me. you know that, right?"
31495,Raj,"oh pish on your issues. you guys are fine. yes, you hit some bumps along the way. i mean, penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection."
31497,Raj,"yeah, no. but yet, here you two are, still together. and that’s even after you and i had our crazy naked night."
33546,Raj,"oh, come on. what’s the worst that could come of this meeting?"
31498,Raj,"i’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “i love you.” and that’s beautiful."
31502,Raj,"hey, stuart."
31503,Raj,"oh, i’m sorry. i’ll leave."
31509,Raj,"she’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?"
31513,Raj,i should go.
33567,Raj,"well, i don’t mind. oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
33568,Raj,"oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
33569,Raj,"oh, i know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?"
31522,Raj,focused locust.
33573,Raj,"well, in the sound of music, julie andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start."
31526,Raj,"uh, yeah, last night. he kept making me drop pencils for him. i got uncomfortable.   che-ee-ee-ese."
33576,Raj,"wow, it’s so cute."
33577,Raj,"oh, and did they have kids?"
31528,Raj,"yeah, well, i love her."
33582,Raj,"oh. mine was winnie the pooh. but anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? right? there are so many amazing ones. red, blue, green, purple."
31536,Raj,"oh, uh, come in, come in. oh, i, uh, i didn’t think i was going to get to see you until tomorrow."
33585,Raj,sorry. sorry.
31543,Raj,"oh, howard, it’s still our thing. come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket."
33592,Raj,"uh, pull over."
33594,Raj,what? no.
31548,Raj,"you know, you don’t worry about money. i’ll take care of everything."
33597,Raj,well i don’t.
31554,Raj,"so, i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the tardis from doctor who."
33605,Raj,"what? this is not a problem, okay? if you don’t want to know, i don’t have to tell you."
33608,Raj,hello?
31562,Raj,can you believe stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
31566,Raj,"you’re welcome, ladies."
33618,Raj,so how’s your apartment?
31573,Raj,"sheldon, you okay?"
31575,Raj,"all right, hotshot, let’s hear your indian."
31578,Raj,"yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him."
29534,Raj,i’ve got him leonard. tonight i spice my meat with goblin blood!
33632,Raj,"yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. i wouldn’t even call it a crib, i’d call it a fortress of solitude for babies."
29540,Raj,"also, sheldon may be a robot. "
33637,Raj,"no, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. here. give me those."
31589,Raj,"are you sure? they turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place."
33640,Raj,"howard, howard, look at the dvd screen. i put on batman: the animated series. your favourite."
33642,Raj,we don’t get paid? nothing? not even a sandwich?
33645,Raj,"not me, i’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
33647,Raj,"i’m not really a part of this, so i’m just gonna dig in."
33648,Raj,"now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
29552,Raj,"or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. "
31599,Raj,"look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars."
29555,Raj,"mmmm, by odin’s beard, this is good chex mix. "
29556,Raj,"penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume i have ever seen, and that includes halle berry’s."
29557,Raj,what is your move?
31604,Raj,when did you learn how to pick locks?
31606,Raj,"hold on, hold on."
33658,Raj,"oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip tootsie rolls in nutella. "
33662,Raj,thank you. good luck with your future endeavours.
31618,Raj,"i’m sorry. we can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. wait, in the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?"
31623,Raj,that’s good quality video.
29577,Raj,sorry papa.
29578,Raj,and over here is sheldon.
31629,Raj,"sheldon, we’re really sorry."
29583,Raj,what is it papa.
29584,Raj,the little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
31632,Raj,"they are, too."
29587,Raj,spring wedding?
29588,Raj,"if you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
31635,Raj,congratulations. does it have that new car smell?
29592,Raj,"excuse me, hello? my parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am i going to do?"
29593,Raj,what?
31643,Raj,an we change the subject? spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
33694,Raj,"so, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to america?"
29598,Raj,"if i don’t call her, i won’t hear the end of it from my parents."
33698,Raj,"no, p-please don’t."
31655,Raj,"no, screw that noise, i’m going in. hang on, santa, i’m coming for you."
29609,Raj,"haven’t you been listening to me, i cannot talk to women."
33707,Raj,over half a million dollars.
33708,Raj,"hey, congratulations bert."
31660,Raj,can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? don’t worry. it’s my treat.
33711,Raj,i laughed because the guy was leonard.
31663,Raj,stop it. you’re ruining girls’ night.
29617,Raj,of course you do. who could forget being that fat? 
31670,Raj,"why can’t i find someone? i’m smart, i’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means i can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t."
29623,Raj,you are my lady. our parents said so. we are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
31671,Raj,"no, it’s not. she was too beautiful for me."
29626,Raj,what just happened?
33723,Raj,"so, i was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant cpr class."
31674,Raj,that was before penny. i make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. i’m very old-fashioned that way.
33725,Raj,it’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
31675,Raj,"no, not really."
29631,Raj,yes mommy.
29632,Raj,"can we please stop talking about my testicles? sheldon, tell them what you did."
29633,Raj,sorry? that’s all you can say is sorry?
31679,Raj,"i understand. in seventh grade, i played spin the bottle and it landed on alina shankar. she said if i came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me."
31681,Raj,it’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
31682,Raj,but you’re not alone anymore. now you’ve got sheldon.
31686,Raj,"i did the research. tony the tiger, dig’em the frog, cap’n crunch, toucan sam, count chocula, trix the rabbit, snap, crackle and pop. not one cereal mascot is a girl. it’s a total breakfast sausage fest."
33735,Raj,at least my nose is naturally brown.
29640,Raj,i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. but that’s something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. 
31688,Raj,how could you do that to me? you know i’ve been working it with alex for weeks.
29643,Raj,why not? 
31692,Raj,"leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well i was only six to eight months away from making my move."
29645,Raj,sounds fun.
29646,Raj,shotgun.
31693,Raj,your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
31696,Raj,how else am i supposed to talk to the human resources lady?
29650,Raj,"well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston. "
29651,Raj,how about lasic? 
33749,Raj,"i, i said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
33750,Raj,"well, okay, i’m gonna sign off now. this next part may contain some adult language."
33752,Raj,you were supposed to keep that to yourself.
33756,Raj,"i know that. but to be fair, i’ve spent nine months helping bernadette get ready for this baby, and howard spent five minutes conceiving it. and i’m being generous."
31709,Raj,phasers on the borg! charlie’s angels.
31714,Raj,wool pants in the desert. i feel like i’ve got poached testicles.
33764,Raj,"i bought the first one, it didn’t fall."
29669,Raj,"okay, so not her either. how about her?"
31716,Raj,"and about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now."
33767,Raj,"you hear that, stuart? i’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
29673,Raj,"you started it, dude. "
29675,Raj,"forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
31724,Raj,"if it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party."
33776,Raj,be there bright and early.
31730,Raj,"say hello to an exact scale model of me. oh, i’m not dark chocolate. i’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel."
33779,Raj,"i know. blue shag, what were you thinking?"
33781,Raj,"hang on. no offence to her father, but he’s not an mit trained engineer. thinking and building is what you do."
29686,Raj,"he’s using psychological warfare. we must reply in kind. i say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. "
29687,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
33784,Raj,"hold on. yeah, that’s funny."
29689,Raj,"you know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played tv’s blossom. she got a phd in neuroscience or something. "
29690,Raj,how about the girl from the wonder years? 
31736,Raj,"of course you have. they’re an engineer’s dream. anything you can design, a 3-d printer can make out of plastic."
31740,Raj,"really, smart guy? where’s he supposed to park his sweet little corvette?"
32767,Raj,i’m worried about the new horizons space probe.
29694,Raj,"sheldon can suck on, the casimir effect."
31742,Raj,"ooh, i, i think it’s done. oh, it worked. we printed a whistle."
33792,Raj,i broke up with her.
29698,Raj,it’s only $800?
29701,Raj,five.
29703,Raj,three.
33801,Raj,maybe i could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
29705,Raj,one.
31753,Raj,is there a good anal leakage?
29708,Raj,did the listing actually say miniature?
31756,Raj,"dumped her? what, did he use a forklift? sorry. there’s nothing funny about morbid obesity."
33806,Raj,"don’t worry, i’m a grown man. i have a thick skin."
33808,Raj,"okay, first off, i want to thank you all so much for coming. howard is here to interpret for emily, and to take notes. "
33809,Raj,"uh, heads up, both of you are named emily, so we’ll call you red-headed emily, and you, red-headed emily, junior."
29712,Raj,in a minute. howard stepped outside to throw up. 
31764,Raj,hello?
31765,Raj,"okay, i guess."
33814,Raj,"oh. he’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
31768,Raj,"mm-hmm. how do you sleep in these things? silk pajamas on satin sheets? i slid out of the bed, like, three times."
29722,Raj,my turn! 
33823,Raj,"well, that was a waste of time. i’m such an idiot."
29727,Raj,"more importantly, you’ve a darth vader voice changer? "
33825,Raj,"dude, come on."
29728,Raj,"oh, i call dibs on the golden age flash."
29729,Raj,"too bad, i called dibs."
31776,Raj,"come on, howard, help me."
29733,Raj,none of your business. take it or leave it.
31783,Raj,"yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself."
29739,Raj,"ah yes, dr patel, good man."
31789,Raj,we’re glad you could make it.
29746,Raj,"hey, look at me, i don’t have a foreskin. "
31796,Raj,"i go to the bathroom, too. sometimes more frequently than i care to admit. oh, i’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. hmm. this is going great. mmm, can i have a refill on my chai tea? yes, i have a good feeling about this.  i should have bought condoms."
29750,Raj,everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. why not put a little mocha in the family latte. 
33847,Raj,don’t worry. everything’s fine.
33848,Raj,i don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
31799,Raj,"no. i took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."
29754,Raj,"keebler elf? i’ve got your keebler elf right here.  okay, it’s a stalemate. "
29755,Raj,dude! everybody left an hour ago! surprise! 
29756,Raj,"okay leonard, here i am at your birthday party, i don’t know where you are dude, but it’s really kick-ass. everyone is very very drunk, and uh…  oh look, there’s a girl taking her shirt off. "
31802,Raj,"you’re wasting your time. just please, leave me alone."
31806,Raj,"you’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, i’ve made my choice."
33856,Raj,she was blowing a spit bubble. it was adorable.
33857,Raj,"oh, okay, false alarm. little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
31810,Raj,"just a sec. oh, who says just a sec? i hate myself. hello."
33862,Raj,"i know you are. that’s why you just bought me a new ipad. and before you start, i am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
31815,Raj,"yeah, me neither."
33868,Raj,"yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape."
31821,Raj,thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
31823,Raj,"uh, lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. maybe we could start with something simpler."
31824,Raj,"mm, disneyland? i don’t know. with all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of india."
33875,Raj,"okay, i’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. he pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
29779,Raj,"well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, sheldon…"
31829,Raj,"no, you can’t join us. just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from."
33879,Raj,i don’t want to say because i don’t know how much it is.
31831,Raj,"these spring rolls are amazing. good job, bernadette."
33881,Raj,"well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump."
29792,Raj,i think she’s smoking hot.
31841,Raj,"if you want, we could tell you."
31846,Raj,"well, i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure."
29802,Raj,she’s so considerate.
33899,Raj,it’s intimate waxing. quit looking at that.
31852,Raj,"born in new delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, i showed early signs of genius. at the age of five i discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon."
29805,Raj,thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
29807,Raj,"sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from new delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to america to reach for the stars."
29808,Raj,it’s a lease.
31858,Raj,i have a thick accent. you don’t know what i said.
31860,Raj,yes.
29813,Raj,"it’s very nice of you, i would like that."
29814,Raj,dr gablehouser.
29818,Raj,i didn’t even know there was a president’s dining room.
33915,Raj,"stay, i’ll get her."
29819,Raj,"okay, big buddy. see you tonight guys. "
29824,Raj,"yes, but i’m finding that having a lackey suits me."
31872,Raj,"it’s not creepy. don’t listen to him. oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses."
29826,Raj,"speaking of untouchables, i’ve got great news for you guys. people magazine is having a reception this saturday, and i managed to get you invited."
31874,Raj,thanks a lot.
29831,Raj,"well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on saturday."
29832,Raj,would you like to go with me?
29834,Raj,look at that. i got a date with penny. i can’t believe it took you a whole year.
33933,Raj,but you made the garage sound so fun. 
33934,Raj,"one second. okay, i think we’re close. how do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
29838,Raj,that’s what you’re wearing.
31887,Raj,"not brian boitano, that’s for sure. how’s your burrito?"
31892,Raj,"no kidding. you didn’t make it easy to find. i spent hours digging around online. for the record, you have excellent credit scores. and your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine."
31896,Raj,no. bought this at the staples center when i went to see taylor swift.
33945,Raj,that’ll do it.
31898,Raj,why don’t you put your mother in a home?
31901,Raj,and it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
33950,Raj,"i’m sorry, guys. sheldon was upset, leonard and penny were fighting, i just wanted to go some place where i wasn’t causing problems."
29855,Raj,i have a better idea.
33952,Raj,thank you.
33953,Raj,"well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
31904,Raj,"hello? what do you mean, you found my dog? she’s with my friends. is she okay? oh, thank you. uh, just text me your address, i’m on my way. oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. but do not give her anything starchy. she’s having risotto for dinner."
33957,Raj,don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
29862,Raj,brisket party! b-to-the-r-to-the-i-s-k… to-the-e-to-the-t… ooh…
31909,Raj,"well, i, i thought about…"
31910,Raj,"sorry. i, i just…"
31912,Raj,"i got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. and i had a sensible salad for lunch, so i can eat all the pizza i want."
33962,Raj,"and just so you know, it’s only temporary. i’m not gonna get too comfortable."
33964,Raj,downward-facing dog. 
29873,Raj,are you sure?
31923,Raj,what else?
29876,Raj,i don’t want to watch saturn 3. deep space nine is better.
29877,Raj,simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
31924,Raj,"mm, yeah. those are both toughies."
31930,Raj,don’t be silly. just tell him.
29885,Raj,star trek v!
33982,Raj,"now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. well?"
31936,Raj,"yeah, well, i like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. mostly because you’re a proven flight risk."
31937,Raj,"well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than i do, and i find that very attractive in a woman. i, i don’t know. i just, i think you’re wonderful."
33986,Raj,"hang on, i’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. i just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
33988,Raj,"but when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
31941,Raj,"hey, don’t discourage him. this is a fantastic opportunity."
33990,Raj,i’m sorry. what did you want to say?
33991,Raj,"guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets sheldon."
29896,Raj,for which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light leonard.”
29897,Raj,which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
29898,Raj,"well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet."
29899,Raj,yeah.
31942,Raj,"if you look carefully at venus, you should be able to see the international space station pass by."
29901,Raj,answering the question once and for all why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
34004,Raj,"wait, hang on. did you go to a cowboy bar?"
29908,Raj,"or it turned into mustard kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue kryptonian hotdog threatening earth."
29909,Raj,booya.
29910,Raj,"“kandorian dry cl…” i give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man."
31957,Raj,"don’t call her my girlfriend. we haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? by the way, if you say no, i’ll never be happy again. not to put you on the spot."
34012,Raj,can’t believe bert has a girlfriend and i don’t.
31964,Raj,"come on. don’t make me beg. and i’m from india, so i know how to do it."
34020,Raj,i think it shows a lot of character.
31972,Raj,"no. it’s my fault. you know, i finally found someone who was right for me, and i, i drove her away."
31974,Raj,"what’s like, what is wrong with me? why, why can’t i ever have love?"
34023,Raj,i feel bad for bert.
34026,Raj,"sheldon, get over here and help."
34027,Raj,"that’s it, we’re dead."
34028,Raj,"well, i know how you feel. i tried one of those electronic japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
31980,Raj,"… but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. i know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. slowly but surely. and oh how i cried. it was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. but i’m a man, okay? so i need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. i mean, it’s not all bad, right? having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."
34030,Raj,like j-lo’s hair.
29935,Raj,"way to bust out the jedi mind tricks, dude."
31983,Raj,is that true?
34033,Raj,hey.
29939,Raj,"mmm, gentlemen, i put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."
31990,Raj,all right.
29944,Raj,fo’ shizzle.
34041,Raj,without me.
34044,Raj,really? you kept sending me apartment listings.
29948,Raj,he almost made it to the top this time.
31997,Raj,"i’d like to apologize for being insensitive. and for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
29954,Raj,"yep, i don’t see any way around it."
29955,Raj,"later, dude."
34052,Raj,"yeah, sure."
32005,Raj,who died and made you king of moments?
34056,Raj,"anyway, uh, as i was saying, i was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends"
29960,Raj,"plus, no one stole their pants."
34058,Raj,how are you doing with…
34059,Raj,"it was a tutorial. and yes, i’m happy to keep sheldon company."
34060,Raj,"oh, why does he need a ladder?"
32010,Raj,"hey, what’s your problem?"
32014,Raj,"nice. so, mmm. what’s up?"
29968,Raj,i didn’t bring it up. you did.
32016,Raj,"i’m not sure. um, wait. jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. uh, no, i, i still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? okay, uh, give me some of this."
34066,Raj,which is?
29971,Raj,"well, that’s it then, we’re doomed."
32022,Raj,"yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
21787,Raj,"oh, yeah, i saw that. that was hilarious. "
34076,Raj,i made a play for her and she shot me down.
21789,Raj,why?
34078,Raj,thank you.
29984,Raj,hang on a sec. why do you get first crack at her?
29988,Raj,"yeah-yeah, which way?"
29990,Raj,it’s loosely based on my life.
32039,Raj,"good riddle, huh?"
29992,Raj,"come on. when you were on tv in firefly, you were actually in space."
32041,Raj,oh.
29994,Raj,"actually, in india, the names of constellations are different. where you have the big dipper, we have the big curry pot."
34093,Raj,"enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7"
34094,Raj,"hey, what’s with him?"
32050,Raj,"wait, how can, how can anyone ruin raiders? it’s perfect."
34099,Raj,"all right, what’s next?"
30003,Raj,"you know, if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this, i could have stayed in india."
34101,Raj,hello there
30004,Raj,we only had four servants. and two of them were children.
30005,Raj,we have 128 assorted penny blossoms ready to ship.
30006,Raj,you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3.
30007,Raj,"i like green lantern, i’m just saying it’s pretty lame that he can be defeated by the colour yellow."
30010,Raj,we went to the comic book store last night.
34107,Raj,"sheldon, are you busy?"
30013,Raj,"well, what are we waiting for? let’s bounce, bitches."
30014,Raj,here we go. lock up your daughters! we’re going to hit it and quit it.
34111,Raj,"namaste, white people. good news! i rented us the four-hour edition of watchmen."
34117,Raj,rum cake?
34118,Raj,"was that the best 99 cents i ever spent, or what?"
30024,Raj,barkeep! alexander me.
32075,Raj,his only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
34126,Raj,"oh, just getting comfortable. so how long have you lived in los angeles?"
32080,Raj,that’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
34130,Raj,can i sleep here tonight?
30034,Raj,"what do you say, howard?"
30036,Raj,"look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. i love las vegas."
32083,Raj,thanks.
34137,Raj,"all right. crank up the ac, boys, it’s gonna get hot in here!"
32089,Raj,"yeah, i read your paper online. that technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
34141,Raj,go away!
34142,Raj,"oh, just because i’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? maybe something good happened."
30046,Raj,what? no. ..
30048,Raj,"it was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours."
34145,Raj,that’s a fitting pun-ishment. i still don’t know what you do for a living.
32093,Raj,"well, i’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. the sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. but boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
32094,Raj,"oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
30053,Raj,hello again.
30055,Raj,with sex.
30056,Raj,how can she when you beat around the bush. she’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
32105,Raj,yeah.
34154,Raj,they’re in my shirt. they’re in my shirt. they’re in my shirt.
32106,Raj,you think they came up with that? they were going to drink beer and play darts.
32107,Raj,excuse me. i happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
34157,Raj,"okay, thanks, bernadette. travel safe. okay, bye. well, they’ve booked a flight. they’re heading to the airport now."
34160,Raj,it was avenger versus archeologist.
32112,Raj,"oh, i think we’re doing just fine, thank you."
30066,Raj,he can’t figure out how to fix it.
34165,Raj,"your movie’s showing, so you’re going. could care less about the five you’re blowing. theatre gets dark just to start the show. you spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. you run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move."
30071,Raj,"be afraid of penny, nice, very crafty."
34171,Raj,yes.
34172,Raj,"oh, that’s claire. got to run."
34173,Raj,"hey, jon snow. how come your horse has a basket on it?"
30080,Raj,"wow, that’s heavy."
34177,Raj,"hello. howard and bernadette kicked me out because i told them they’re having a girl. oopsy, i did it again."
34178,Raj,hello.
32132,Raj,you had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
34181,Raj,you’ll need a good attention span.
30085,Raj,is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
30087,Raj,you still might get on a magazine.
32136,Raj,"he’s right. but in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
34185,Raj,"yeah, you keep saying how much sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him."
30089,Raj,"me, too."
30090,Raj,where are your tools?
30091,Raj,i think i swallowed some paint!
32146,Raj,"this is all your fault, i should’ve listened to mun-mun because i’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is penny. why are you so cruel? do you enjoy my pain?"
30099,Raj,it was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
32151,Raj,it’s horrible. why would you push a cow over? they’re sacred.
30106,Raj,"he just went colon, capital o."
30113,Raj,"i’m sorry, this does not look like texas. where’s the tumbleweeds? where’s the saloons?"
30115,Raj,i was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
30120,Raj,"okay, who had leonard gets a floppy disk?"
32174,Raj,he loves you.
30127,Raj,what’s that?
32176,Raj,"oh, come on, i brought you one, too."
30129,Raj,"oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
30130,Raj,chickens can’t climb trees
32177,Raj,that’s why i got you hot chocolate.
30136,Raj,be careful.
32184,Raj,"i can’t believe they’re still married. oh, no, i forgot cinnamon’s toothbrush at howard’s. i guess you’re sharing with daddy again. "
30143,Raj,ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
32194,Raj,"you didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds."
30149,Raj,"well, i finished reading the pelican brief and loved it so much, i dived right into the client. he was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
30150,Raj,"great. lost boys, children of the night. got it. can you pass the chex mix, please. thank you. we are lost boys."
32197,Raj,"oh. hang on. you got a, you got a little something. ah."
32204,Raj,"yeah, i was wrong. but i do think you and i would have had a great time."
30161,Raj,"yeah, i’ve been there as well. i like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
32209,Raj,congrats.
32211,Raj,so i read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
32212,Raj,i don’t see why not. 
30166,Raj,are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
30168,Raj,"with my luck, hepatitis"
30176,Raj,"and then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
32224,Raj,"uh, excuse me. "
32225,Raj,"uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?"
32227,Raj,"well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join."
30182,Raj,"yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
32230,Raj,"are you sure? he’s tall, pale and awkward. that sounds like your type."
32232,Raj,and does sheldon know you’re dating sheldon?
32234,Raj,"well, do you support this?"
30187,Raj,"you know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. hey, did you know netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
30188,Raj,"i don’t want to go back to india. it’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. you have no idea, they’re everywhere."
32236,Raj,"padma kapur, neha chowdury."
30194,Raj,"oh, beefaroni. i think i’ll miss you most of all."
30196,Raj,"do not tell me about my own culture, sheldon! in the mood i’m in, i’ll take you out, i swear to cow!"
30199,Raj,"you, you’re kidding. that’s fantastic!"
30200,Raj,i’m on it.
30201,Raj,"no, no, it’s a very promising area. in a perfect world i’d spend several more years on it. but i just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
32247,Raj,and i told you i get diaper rash.
32250,Raj,"oh, they only have thursday and sunday passes left."
32254,Raj,how are you gonna get james earl jones?
30208,Raj,"that’s okay. a complaint has been filed. so, that’s it. that was my last hope. i’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin sanjay. or, as you may know him, dave from at&t customer service."
30209,Raj,will you come visit me in india?
32257,Raj,"i’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. what if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
30212,Raj,you want me to work with you?
32260,Raj,do it.
30216,Raj,"yes, for you. i do, however, have a few conditions. first, at all times, i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. and third, you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture."
30217,Raj,thank you.
32265,Raj,are you impressed by that?
30219,Raj,wha… you’re kidding!
30225,Raj,"all right, let’s buckle down and work."
30226,Raj,sheldon.
30227,Raj,i need an aspirin.
30230,Raj,"no, no, no, no! that rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
30231,Raj,i’m the astrophysicist. astro means space.
30232,Raj,"okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, i’d be kicking your butt."
32283,Raj,"oh, yeah?"
30236,Raj,aha! so i am working with you.
32285,Raj,oh. thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
30238,Raj,okay. here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
32289,Raj,"ha-ha, very funny. make fun of the foreign guy. for your information, there are four times as many indians as there are americans, so the way we say it is right."
30242,Raj,come and get it.
32292,Raj,"oh, sure, i sit on the floor for years, no one cares. the pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to ikea."
32297,Raj,what’s going on? oh. wait. on. and off. what’s going on?
30252,Raj,how did you get here?
32300,Raj,"and i just want you to know, i’m happy to look in on bernadette while you’re gone."
30257,Raj,"oh, so that’s how it works? i have a teeny bladder and now i don’t get a hot girlfriend?"
32306,Raj,"that’s the dynamic, i’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill."
30260,Raj,"hey, sheldon, guess what i heard today?"
30261,Raj,why don’t i just tell you what i heard today.
30264,Raj,but this is other money.
32314,Raj,screw that! i sat on the floor for seven years. i’m staying right here.
32317,Raj,you’re only making it seem more real for me.
32319,Raj,is that a real book? i would totally read that book.
32321,Raj,"if she did, it would be amazing. that woman can do no wrong."
32322,Raj,ha-a-a. still funny.
32324,Raj,"actually, it’s for both of us. last night, i watched west side story, and i’m a little freaked out by street gangs."
32325,Raj,"i don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so i’ll put up with it."
30278,Raj,lava serpent.
32326,Raj,"no one was writing me back, so i stopped checking my profile."
30285,Raj,"leonard just realized that penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites."
30286,Raj,"oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. on the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. one, two…"
30288,Raj,"no, she didn’t."
30289,Raj,"come on, scissors, scissors!"
32337,Raj,"i don’t want you to pretend to be me. you can be like my, uh, online wingman. like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."
30292,Raj,"you’re a sucky friend, you know that? a sucky, sucky friend."
32340,Raj,but i’m always on howard’s team. we’re best friends. the kind who finish each others…
30299,Raj,"i’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?"
30300,Raj,"it’s not just the kite thing. every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them."
32349,Raj,"i’m not too shy and passive. you write her back and tell her i said that. you know, when you have a second."
30303,Raj,what do you want?
32351,Raj,what?
32353,Raj,your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
32355,Raj,"amy told me you were concerned that i might be too passive and shy. let me ask you something. would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?"
30308,Raj,and where were you?
32357,Raj,"not my best first date. yeah, but not my worst, either."
30310,Raj,"excuse me, i have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. you’re just a douche."
30312,Raj,i don’t know.
30315,Raj,i really like my saber-toothed cat. thank you.
32364,Raj,"well, it’s too late."
30317,Raj,fine. go ahead.
30318,Raj,"if you want to chase after her, chase after her."
32369,Raj,thank you.
30323,Raj,what a douche.
30327,Raj,you mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
32376,Raj,"well, unlike that, my games are much more fun."
32382,Raj,"does the smart-ass know that terminator was actually ripped off from an outer limits script called demon with a glass hand, by harlan ellison?"
32384,Raj,"fine, just try not to look too alive."
30340,Raj,big deal. every time i watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
32389,Raj,"oh, come on."
30343,Raj,"yeah, that would have been great. you and penny having sex in the tent while i sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus."
32391,Raj,you’re just saying that.
32394,Raj,"hey. emily, right?"
30354,Raj,"okay, how’s that?"
30357,Raj,i would be kind to my rabbit subjects. at first.
30364,Raj,"…and the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin."
30365,Raj,who cares? you slept with your cousin.
30367,Raj,"i was on the radio once. i called in to fever 104 fm new delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” that means: “fever 104, home of the really good current music.” it’s much catchier in hindi."
30372,Raj,"i don’t think that’s possible, dude."
30374,Raj,"that’s true. he didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. he, he broke out and poisoned gotham’s water supply."
32422,Raj,really? because i’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing i can say about myself.
32423,Raj,i know. being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
32425,Raj,"are you kidding me? this may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. how can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?"
32426,Raj,"um, kind of hit a bump. when i was honest and told emily she wasn’t the only person i was seeing, it went great. so i tried the same thing with lucy."
30381,Raj,wow. looks like the ganges on laundry day.
30383,Raj,"ha! eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
32431,Raj,it’s going to be okay.
32432,Raj,"oh, okay, great. but if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about emily."
32435,Raj,you better be. no jokes about how close i am with my dog. or the truth about how close i am with my dog.
30388,Raj,we do?
32439,Raj,"emily, these are my good friends, howard and bernadette. guys, this is emily."
32443,Raj,"wh, what happened?"
30403,Raj,thanks for coming with me.
30407,Raj,"sheldon, they don’t have ice cream."
30410,Raj,"that’s professor wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old."
32458,Raj,"on the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. why does emily like this stuff? do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?"
32460,Raj,i do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
30415,Raj,the mysterious subcontinent of india.
30425,Raj,you can’t wear the hands on the date.
30430,Raj,"no, no, no, no, i think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
32480,Raj,by staying here and watching the movie.
32481,Raj,"mm, true. i do feel guilty about him."
32482,Raj,maybe we should see how he’s doing.
30435,Raj,"but if i don’t eat my lima beans, i can’t have my cookie."
32483,Raj,but after the cantina scene.
32484,Raj,"hey, we can say it. you can’t."
30444,Raj,thank you.
30445,Raj,me.
30446,Raj,"well, if anyone’s interested, i’ll be spending this valentine’s day the same way i spend every valentine’s day. buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
32494,Raj,"uh, this is my friend, sheldon. sheldon, this is emily."
32495,Raj,are you here alone?
30454,Raj,not much. nuked a burrito. prayed to the hindu god urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
32505,Raj,"to be truthful, emily and i haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."
32506,Raj,no.
32510,Raj,eleven.
32511,Raj,eleven. wait. do i count the 200-pound sailor moon girl that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con?
32519,Raj,"thank you. not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
30473,Raj,huh? that’ll come off.
30476,Raj,"holy crap, are we nerdy."
32525,Raj,"but, uh, before i take my shirt off, i just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
32527,Raj,and i thought me having sex with emily was gonna be the big news.
32536,Raj,i’m having my windows untinted.
32538,Raj,"wow. how’s that hater-ade taste, bro? hey, this isn’t the way to work."
30492,Raj,forget the jet skis? that was our line in the sand! what happened to “tear them a new one?”
30493,Raj,you’re useless.
32546,Raj,it wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
32552,Raj,"hey, as long as the baby’s healthy."
30506,Raj,you’re right. let’s talk about your grandmother.
32555,Raj,"oh, well, her last name is sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about koothrapeeney."
32556,Raj,i don’t understand. why is it bad that you have to teach?
30515,Raj,"well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner."
30519,Raj,"well, good for him."
30527,Raj,all right. imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. where is that?
30528,Raj,"okay, you’re in sheldonopolis."
32575,Raj,why would i lose friends just because i started dating someone?
32579,Raj,"hey, guys."
30532,Raj,"yeah, whatever. just go buy a sweater."
30535,Raj,what now?
32584,Raj,"so, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?"
32586,Raj,"ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
32588,Raj,"um, well, in my defence, i tell everybody."
32592,Raj,great.
32593,Raj,"you, okay? it’s you. you’re, you’re next."
30547,Raj,"oh, that would be a good way to go."
30550,Raj,"i don’t know about you, but i feel empowered."
30556,Raj,i’ve missed you.
30557,Raj,"hey, leonard?"
32605,Raj,tricking penny into getting engaged.
32609,Raj,hey.
32612,Raj,"ooh, this is exciting. we’re innovating. i feel like we’re in the facebook movie."
32613,Raj,"oh. it’s wonderful, and i swear i’m not saying that because justin timberlake is in it."
32617,Raj,"oh, i have an idea."
30570,Raj,"dude, i’m an astrophysicist. if there were solar flares, i’d be all up in it."
30571,Raj,i don’t know. do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah?
32620,Raj,do you know if you look at austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
32627,Raj,and i really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think i’ve been cheating on her.
30582,Raj,i can’t believe they let him into canada.
30583,Raj,"relax, it’s nyquil."
32636,Raj,don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
32637,Raj,"so, i did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. for starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees."
30594,Raj,i’m not hungry.
30597,Raj,why didn’t you say anything?
32646,Raj,did you get in?
32647,Raj,this is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
32651,Raj,how hot is it?
30604,Raj,why don’t you ask her to come up?
32653,Raj,how you feeling?
30607,Raj,what?
30609,Raj,you know what would be fun? signing sheldon up for online dating.
30611,Raj,"okay, we’ll call that plan b."
32661,Raj,we should have asked her to get some funyuns.
32664,Raj,how’s that going?
30617,Raj,do you know what he’s talking about?
30623,Raj,hi.
32674,Raj,"oh, cool."
30628,Raj,"sheldon, i’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
32680,Raj,how did you get it?
30633,Raj,and it only took 28 minutes.
32681,Raj,"oh, i was hoping for a juicy tidbit about ron perlman’s testicles."
32683,Raj,you think he bites?
30642,Raj,"right now, all i can think about is cookies and hawaiian punch."
32690,Raj,hey.
32693,Raj,how come you’re not shopping with amy and bernadette?
32695,Raj,"ooh, i’ll, uh, text stuart, let him know we’re close."
30649,Raj,spoiler alert! spoiler alert.
32700,Raj,"okay. here we go, say cheese. iskip) say cheese. iskip) say cousin. iskip) say…"
32703,Raj,"they used to like going to the mumbai symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
30658,Raj,"i’m very comfortable here. penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
30659,Raj,"ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills."
32706,Raj,"uh, that was my dad on the phone. he moved out."
32707,Raj,"no, it’s fine. it’s not that big a deal. as long as they’re happy, i’m happy. and when i get to see them for the holidays, i’ll get to celebrate diwali twice, one at each house. that’s double the diwali."
32715,Raj,"pretty good. she bought the book eat, pray, love and used it to set my father’s mercedes on fire. so, what’s up with you guys?"
30675,Raj,you’re being unreasonable. why can’t i have a desk?
32725,Raj,or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
32730,Raj,"you were his colleague. how did your research turn out? great. hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel."
30683,Raj,"is that the american idiom for giant, big-ass desk?"
32734,Raj,"oh, well, that’s the best part."
32737,Raj,"amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. i gave up when no one cared about my tom hanks-giving."
30690,Raj,no.
32742,Raj,"uh, no. you had a long flight. you stay here and relax."
30696,Raj,"well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, i’d say it’s spot-on."
32747,Raj,okay.
30703,Raj,hey.
32751,Raj,come on.
30709,Raj,are you going to let me tell the story or not?
30713,Raj,i’m so not talking to you. i’m talking to him.
30718,Raj,"oh, not really, just hang out."
30719,Raj,train day?
24578,Penny,"you know, i’m sorry."
24600,Penny,i’m suggesting there might be something you could do about amy’s urges?
24612,Penny,i’m not happy.
24614,Penny,what great news?
24626,Penny,"no. wait, wait, does it?"
24629,Penny,"oh. go away, leonard."
24630,Penny,it’s open.
24640,Penny,"who, me?"
24646,Penny,hang on. let’s see where he’s going.
24647,Penny,"oh, great. you know what? i’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. i don’t need to listen to this."
24654,Penny,"hey, you don’t need leonard and his app. you can make one with me."
24656,Penny,"okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the internet to find out where you can buy them."
24661,Penny,milk.
24669,Penny,okay. wait right here.
24678,Penny,"oh, you’re welcome."
24694,Penny,"you know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat."
24700,Penny,terrific. are we there yet?
24713,Penny,"again, i’ve never given it much thought."
24718,Penny,"hey, can i stay here tonight?"
24731,Penny,"leonard, are you asleep?"
24733,Penny,i know it’s kinda weird.
24744,Penny,"that bad, huh?"
24757,Penny,what’s wrong?
24760,Penny,"well, i thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. you know, get our bodies warmed up a little."
24762,Penny,"come on, you got to work with me. we need to get connected with our bodies."
24763,Penny,"all right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up."
24766,Penny,"i’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it."
24768,Penny,"okay, it’s not a movie. it’s improv. so no one calls action."
24779,Penny,and you think it’s better than tennessee williams?
24780,Penny,where no sheldon has gone before.
24787,Penny,now just read your mother’s line.
24797,Penny,"okay, i guess we’re improvising now."
24801,Penny,"sheldon, it’s saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry."
24811,Penny,i believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
24819,Penny,"really, i am not upset about leonard and priya."
24820,Penny,"oh. well, good for him. hey, what do you mean, more suitable?"
24828,Penny,i didn’t do the audition.
24831,Penny,"i already told you, i’m okay with it. i mean, if anything, i’m quite pleased  that makes him so happy."
24848,Penny,there you go. just like recovering alcoholics drink in the caribbean.
24850,Penny,"yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?"
24855,Penny,"oh, hey."
24863,Penny,"oh, yeah, i know that place. what do you think?"
24868,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. you know, for the first time in my life, i am not in a relationship, and i’m totally okay with it."
24869,Penny,"um, no."
24873,Penny,"one, two, three, four, five. no way."
24877,Penny,i’m not going out with him. he can sleep with whoever he wants.
24880,Penny,"oh, unbelievable! know how he did it yet?"
24881,Penny,"aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how i got his nose."
24884,Penny,not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
24892,Penny,what?
24894,Penny,then no.
24902,Penny,"oh, hey, i was just on my way to work."
24903,Penny,"no, it’s all right. walk me down. so, what’s up?"
24905,Penny,what?
24906,Penny,"okay, i’m not moving anywhere. what the hell is this all about?"
24918,Penny,just say thank you.
24919,Penny,all right. see you later.
24920,Penny,"oh, hi! i was just dropping off a cheesecake to sheldon. he was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place."
24928,Penny,"no, don’t do that. no reason to be mean to her."
24931,Penny,hi. we’re just heading out for a drink.
24933,Penny,"no problem. so, leonard, i think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you."
24941,Penny,"well, then, good news. today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place.  now give him his stuff back."
24951,Penny,"okay, give. how do you know? did he tell you?"
24954,Penny,"you don’t have to worry. unlike amy and priya, i know how to keep a secret."
24956,Penny,"oh, hey, amy. what’s up?"
24967,Penny,hey. what’s up?
24971,Penny,i felt sorry for him. priya’s giving him a hard time.
24976,Penny,"hey, i know, let’s take sheldon dancing."
24987,Penny,"okay, amy, you’re being silly. i am not concerned about who hangs out with who. and i certainly don’t have a problem with leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. ooh, these are cute. of course if i buy them, i’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
24999,Penny,"what, are they getting engaged?"
25008,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe, i have no idea what you said."
25011,Penny,what are you doing at work these days?
25013,Penny,"oh, my god, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."
25014,Penny,"oh, my god! what happened?"
25023,Penny,"okay, you’re not helping."
25025,Penny,"well, he’s my friend. it’s what you do. "
25026,Penny,"it’s just so weird. howard wolowitz is my friend. you know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and i broke his nose."
25028,Penny,you mean when he was little.
25029,Penny,"you know, this stuff is horrible. you want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?"
25047,Penny,hit me.
25051,Penny,"what? oh, god, yeah. yeah. leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack."
25059,Penny,"coming. yup, that’s good. wine glasses should have handles."
25074,Penny,how did you know i was here?
25075,Penny,thanks.
25077,Penny,"oh. gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…"
25079,Penny,"come here. just listen to me. i want to go back to the way we were before. you know, friends. no sprinkles."
25084,Penny,oh!
25090,Penny,hmm.
25094,Penny,"okay. um. well, i already talked to raj, but i wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."
25096,Penny,"anyways, i wanted you guys all to know that i’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion i have to stop kidding myself. i suck at acting. it’s time for me to move back to nebraska."
25097,Penny,yeah.
25099,Penny,"shh! it’s my agent, it’s my agent. you’re kidding. oh, my gosh. i can’t believe it! really? oh, i’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. okay, bye. i got the haemorrhoid commercial! i start monday."
25106,Penny,what name?
25114,Penny,yeah. it’s cleaner than my couch. found half a hot pocket in there.
25116,Penny,why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
25119,Penny,"what’s the word, hummingbird?"
25125,Penny,and what’s that?
25126,Penny,"no, it’s completely fine. hmm. i get it. sheldon sent you. he put you up to this."
25131,Penny,what’s wrong?
25138,Penny,really? for a wedding?
25148,Penny,"yeah, my bikini region is fine."
25159,Penny,you’re kidding.
25165,Penny,"okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car."
25166,Penny,"what? he paid off her credit cards? damn it, i could’ve dated raj for a couple months. but i, i wouldn’t have, because i’m not that kind of girl. we should really talk to raj."
25169,Penny,"i can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. oh, here she comes."
25173,Penny,"okay, wait…"
25177,Penny,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
25186,Penny,"no, no, no, no, i didn’t forget. um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. although, back in nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
25190,Penny,"no, i was there that day. sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
25192,Penny,"well, that, that’s good. i’m glad you came to that. but before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."
25204,Penny,"oh, mrs. cooper, it smells so good."
25209,Penny,"yeah, sure, come on in."
25210,Penny,want some mac and cheese?
25212,Penny,"okay, well, i’d offer you halloween candy, but that’s gone. so, what’s up?"
25215,Penny,yes.
25221,Penny,"oh, look at you, you bad boy. did you tell her about priya?"
25222,Penny,that’s gross.
25227,Penny,"leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
25228,Penny,what does your gut tell you?
25233,Penny,"through no one’s fault, sheldon, we’re leaving."
25239,Penny,what do you tell him?
25241,Penny,hi.
25252,Penny,"yeah, sure, sure. vegas is fun, too."
25265,Penny,"oh, it’s not a date, leonard. it’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
25267,Penny,"really? on top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?"
25276,Penny,"no, you don’t."
25281,Penny,"all right, fine."
25282,Penny,"no, i was thinking how come they get to leave and i can’t."
25283,Penny,"uh, no, thanks."
25289,Penny,oh.
25300,Penny,good! go! there are some girls right over there. what are you waiting for?
25305,Penny,"no, no. i want to know what you told her."
25306,Penny,"oh. okay, i see. so while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two star trek uniforms?"
25310,Penny,did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
25312,Penny,"okay, i’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
25314,Penny,way off.
25322,Penny,what’s wrong?
25323,Penny,"amy, little vixen. just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
25324,Penny,"oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a sheldon. so do you like stuart?"
25328,Penny,what’s up?
25332,Penny,"all right, honey, let me tell you a story. there was a guy i liked, and i never told him how i felt. eventually, he started going out with someone else, and i always regretted it. do you see where i’m going with this?"
25333,Penny,mm.
25334,Penny,you’re not the guy.
25337,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
25349,Penny,wow. you poor thing.
25351,Penny,"no, we weren’t really like that. i mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. like, okay, this one girl, kathy geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
25353,Penny,"uh, probably. it’s hard to say. she kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
25359,Penny,i actually knew that.
25362,Penny,"oh, my god, that’s perfect. ‘cause i have so many clothes i don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and i go shopping to buy more stuff and i have no place to put it. this will totally fix that."
25367,Penny,"come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
25375,Penny,that is so hot.
25387,Penny,"ooh, are these real diamonds?"
25390,Penny,hi.
25392,Penny,"sheldon, you’re up."
25394,Penny,you look beautiful.
25396,Penny,"you mean, like a date?"
25398,Penny,just a sec.  too much?
25401,Penny,i don’t know.
25404,Penny,"yeah, okay, no."
25432,Penny,bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
25439,Penny,"well, what if we do go out and i do something stupid and dump you again?"
25445,Penny,"here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. you need menus or you know what you want?"
25456,Penny,that’s because you overthink everything.
25457,Penny,"why, you guys going somewhere?"
25458,Penny,"uh, have you thought this through?"
25461,Penny,you see me all the time. you sure you just don’t miss the sex?
25467,Penny,all right. let’s give it a shot.
25468,Penny,"okay. good night, leonard."
25476,Penny,yep.
25479,Penny,"yeah, hang on. let me just finish this chapter."
25480,Penny,"no, i can’t. reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if i read more."
25481,Penny,two weeks to rock hard abs.
25482,Penny,"all right. terrific. well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. we wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
25492,Penny,things are looking good.
25495,Penny,"sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do i know?"
25504,Penny,i think he misses his little buddy.
25505,Penny,"hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
25522,Penny,"all right, howard wolowitz, listen up. you sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. if you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. and you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
25530,Penny,so big.
25531,Penny,so ugly. what am i gonna do?
25532,Penny,is there any chance i’ll learn to love it?
25533,Penny,"all right, it’s got to go."
25539,Penny,"ah, okay. let us take you off the wall. out of sight, out of mind. i wish."
25540,Penny,"sure, sure. enjoy. i mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. it’s just going to be my gift to you. bye."
25542,Penny,i have no idea. that is weird.
25558,Penny,"well, what about bernadette?"
25560,Penny,now?
25566,Penny,"so, if i move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and i win?"
25572,Penny,"uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
25575,Penny,"if i were you, i’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
25576,Penny,why did you get bongos?
25579,Penny,"all right, sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. please come home so i can cut your hair."
25583,Penny,"well, sorry, i don’t know any dirty jokes."
25586,Penny,"okay.  okay, yep, we’re all done now. it’s just, it’s good. let me just take that away from you. okay."
25591,Penny,"whu… the entire weekend? you mean i wouldn’t see you at all? but i ju… no, no, i knew what i was getting into. you can’t put a saddle on leonard hofstadter. oh, my, is it getting hot in here? ay, papi."
25595,Penny,gummy bears? thank you.
25596,Penny,not a chance.
25600,Penny,what’s that?
25613,Penny,"whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. hold on. "
25620,Penny,"that’s why you’re lucky to have me. back in omaha, there are two different restaurants i’m not allowed into. both chili’s."
25630,Penny,"okay, you’re right, i eat your food a lot. how about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
25632,Penny,"hi, you guys got a minute?"
25652,Penny,"you know, i paid a lot for this. let’s take it over there and show him."
25656,Penny,it’s not saturday night. why are you doing your laundry?
25657,Penny,"wow, are these amy’s? kind of trashy, good for her."
25660,Penny,"i don’t understand, why doesn’t howard just introduce you to the guy?"
25666,Penny,"fine, howard is being mean to you for no reason."
25675,Penny,i don’t care. ask her things like are you going to take howard’s name? not who’s going to sit on who?
25681,Penny,"well, a little. you hear stuff."
25682,Penny,"well, i was gonna, but i didn’t think it would go past the first date. then, when it did, i thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. i mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
25686,Penny,"well, i don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
25688,Penny,"oh, my god, howard. that’s the most beautiful thing i’ve ever heard. and it came out of you."
25705,Penny,"no, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
25709,Penny,it’s not funny.
25711,Penny,yeah.
25734,Penny,"uh, i don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. we haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex."
25735,Penny,this is great. what’s the occasion?
25738,Penny,this is awesome. i love it!
25740,Penny,"ah, thank you!"
25752,Penny,"ooh, one gravy boat."
25753,Penny,"one inappropriate, yet i wish i thought of that gravy boat."
25756,Penny,"oh, well, you know, leonard is great."
25762,Penny,no. maybe. i don’t know.
25765,Penny,"oh, my god. sheldon?"
25775,Penny,worst bedtime story ever.
25781,Penny,what the hell is wrong with you? you told sheldon? do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
25785,Penny,"look, there’s something i need to tell you."
25788,Penny,"i didn’t know what else to do. he had those big, sad eyes."
25806,Penny,"who i hope for her sake is not captain hook, so… who are you calling?"
25813,Penny,can we go now?
25814,Penny,what are you doing?
25817,Penny,"okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? look, i don’t even know where my relationship is with leonard is right now."
25844,Penny,"oh, come on, what is that?"
25845,Penny,"no, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game."
25872,Penny,"what, is it secret?"
25873,Penny,oh. you might want to put a sign on it.
25890,Penny,there we go.
25895,Penny,"no, no, it’s…"
25898,Penny,"no, i’m not embarrassed. i just didn’t want anyone to know because i haven’t told leonard yet."
25901,Penny,spaghetti okay?
25906,Penny,"anyway, that’s it. i just thought you should know."
25908,Penny,"hey hey hey, this is my paper. and my perspective is that slavery is bad. oh, and my professor’s black, so i’m pretty sure that’s the right answer."
25917,Penny,what?
25937,Penny,hey. what brings you in?
25938,Penny,i had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
25944,Penny,"honey, you can’t make people like each other."
25946,Penny,"far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. look, sheldon, your problem is not wil wheaton, okay? your problem is the way you treated amy."
25947,Penny,"come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. i thought you texas guys stood up for your womenfolk."
25949,Penny,"welcome to long island, tex."
25952,Penny,"so, how was work today?"
25953,Penny,that sounds like fun.
25966,Penny,"no, he’s not. we’re just friends. look, is this gonna be a problem? because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work."
25984,Penny,"okay, howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos."
25986,Penny,ow! ow!
25990,Penny,"gee, you think?"
25995,Penny,you’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
26006,Penny,you’re so butch.
26015,Penny,"raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you."
26022,Penny,what?
26023,Penny,what is happening?
26027,Penny,i’m gonna kill her.
26040,Penny,"i don’t care about alex. fine, i care. okay, i hate that bitch. but what really hurt is that you liked it so much. i mean, do i need to be worried?"
26041,Penny,"because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said."
26042,Penny,no.
26045,Penny,"well, i do."
26053,Penny,"no, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. i mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? anyway, i decided i don’t need to be a scientist, i could just look like one. so i bought these."
26059,Penny,is that better?
26065,Penny,i know. the four of them work at a major university. they’re all super smart. how can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
26068,Penny,"that is an amazing idea. okay, how many of these have i had?"
26069,Penny,"hey, stuart."
26070,Penny,"no, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try."
26075,Penny,"yeah, well, i have street smarts."
26080,Penny,"that makes even less sense, i mean…"
26085,Penny,yes!
26086,Penny,you said it’s a magic hammer.
26087,Penny,"if harry potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t thor’s hammer?"
26091,Penny,"hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about thor?"
26098,Penny,"well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?"
26102,Penny,"yeah. sheldon, can i ask you a question?"
26108,Penny,"yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. like burt and ernie. you guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."
26118,Penny,i got nothing.
26126,Penny,"that is the worst, isn’t it?"
26129,Penny,"no, i don’t want to break his heart. i love him. this is just happening too fast."
26131,Penny,"well, you know how he is. he’s sensitive and emotional."
26133,Penny,yeah. and who knows how amy will react.
26139,Penny,um…
26158,Penny,"you know what, screw them. our night is going to be way more special than theirs."
26166,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t make this about you."
26171,Penny,"well, i am."
26178,Penny,"okay. you know what? this might be the wine talking, but i have a very important question to ask you."
26181,Penny,hello.
26182,Penny,"yeah, i can’t tell you how many times i’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and i just couldn’t join in."
26185,Penny,"yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. you know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in."
26187,Penny,"um, well, i’m from nebraska. so what can you tell me about the state flag?"
26193,Penny,"hey, my acting class is putting on a play friday night. i could put you and amy on the guest list."
26195,Penny,"hey, i don’t want you to go any more."
26196,Penny,"you should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to."
26200,Penny,are you kidding? you brought fancy wine and made fondue. i’ve slept with guys for less. it’s a joke. based on real events.
26210,Penny,"all right, whatever. how does it work?"
26216,Penny,"sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with amy?"
26217,Penny,what is your point?
26221,Penny,no.
26222,Penny,"what if i ask sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?"
26235,Penny,"we were all thinking it, really. it was kind of the elephant in the room, so…"
26238,Penny,"hey, it’s still early. why don’t we go back and have that party?"
26240,Penny,"damn, i forgot to feed him. and that i had him."
26241,Penny,party’s over! party’s over!
26242,Penny,so tenured means a job for life?
26248,Penny,"oh, good, you heard me."
26265,Penny,so you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
26267,Penny,what do you want from me?
26268,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t be like that."
26274,Penny,"i don’t know. it’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. i just don’t get that way. do you?"
26278,Penny,"so, i was thinking how excited you get about stuff like buffy or science or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy."
26285,Penny,got it.
26287,Penny,who’s professor proton?
26297,Penny,"shut up. you can do that? i mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?"
26299,Penny,"but if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
26300,Penny,"arthur, are you okay?"
26301,Penny,any chance we could plug it into the potato?
26306,Penny,"i’m sorry, why old?"
26307,Penny,guess who?
26309,Penny,"oh, don’t worry, sweetie. no one has."
26310,Penny,"okay, who wants a drink?"
26317,Penny,pretend he’s that tsa agent. come on.
26320,Penny,"okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…"
26322,Penny,"not really. my shirt was soaking wet. i got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
26323,Penny,i thought i said that to you.
26330,Penny,"oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. no. i mean, look, you have to go. it sounds like an amazing opportunity. and i’m just basing that on how much i didn’t understand what you said about it."
26332,Penny,sure.
26336,Penny,"you know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
26349,Penny,"raj, i’m so sorry."
26350,Penny,"well, here we are."
26353,Penny,did you bring enough inhalers?
26357,Penny,i love you.
26359,Penny,hey. i’m just coming back from the airport. i wanted to see how you’re doing.
26361,Penny,oh. i’m so sorry.
26364,Penny,you will.
26367,Penny,"oh, me, too."
26371,Penny,aw.
26375,Penny,why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with leonard and you miss him?
26380,Penny,why?
26381,Penny,really? why?
26383,Penny,"okay, let’s take a break. "
26386,Penny,leonard?
26393,Penny,"no. come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain."
26407,Penny,okay.
26413,Penny,thank you. how about a hug?
26415,Penny,aaaaaaah!
26423,Penny,"oh, that is so romantic."
26432,Penny,"yeah, thanks, but i kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…"
26435,Penny,well…
26438,Penny,oh. 
26449,Penny,"oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
26456,Penny,aw.
26460,Penny,"oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer."
26461,Penny,"whoa, whoa, whoa. why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me."
26465,Penny,"all right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. would you stop pouting? so, you picked my name. get over it."
26475,Penny,"hey, princeton, look at that, team community college night school is in the lead."
26476,Penny,"aha. okay, let’s see. to continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. ooh."
26478,Penny,yes.
26484,Penny,"three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here."
26487,Penny,it’s just a bunch of pants.
26495,Penny,i don’t get it.
26500,Penny,"oh, good. check it out, the disappointing child by beverly hofstadter."
26501,Penny,yeah. it’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
26504,Penny,not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
26507,Penny,i just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
26513,Penny,"yep. hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys."
26514,Penny,"oh, come on. every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. it’s like, it’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. i mean…"
26517,Penny,"‘cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go."
26518,Penny,i’m so sorry. i never should have read that book. you know what? you want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
26520,Penny,"hi. all right, sweetie. you hang in there today."
26523,Penny,"and i wanted to make you feel better, so i planned something very special for you."
26533,Penny,"okay, sheldon, what happened between you and amy?"
26534,Penny,yeah.
26537,Penny,"all right, don’t worry. i talked to leonard. he is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
26539,Penny,do you know what he’s doing?
26542,Penny,ah.
26544,Penny,i can name tons.
26548,Penny,sheldon?
26553,Penny,"okay, that’s just the plot for dirty dancing. what else would you love? other than being lifted over patrick swayze’s head."
26556,Penny,"yeah, i’m trying to be sad about that. i can’t."
26557,Penny,"boy, bernadette is gonna love this."
26558,Penny,"okay, you know what’s not romantic? rubbing it in someone’s face."
26561,Penny,"i discovered a secret ingredient. the flavour packet. that sucker is well named. all right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."
26563,Penny,yes. the most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
26565,Penny,it’s a first edition of hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy. i remember it was your favourite book growing up.
26581,Penny,"ooh, that looks like fun."
26588,Penny,"you’ve had this dart board since i’ve known you, but i’ve never seen you play."
26604,Penny,"yeah, i get that. i’ll go get you your water. when you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him."
26606,Penny,"you know what the worst part is? you’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess."
26614,Penny,sheldon’s not here. why don’t you take the sweater off?
26620,Penny,there’s a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with.
26632,Penny,we had one of those silly fake weddings.
26640,Penny,want of understanding? what does that even mean?
26649,Penny,"because you wouldn’t shut up about it. when i called him, he had nothing to do, so i just thought it would…"
26653,Penny,we don’t have any kids.
26659,Penny,"hey, i’m sorry about today. and i promise, next time i get married, it won’t be a joke. it’ll be for love. or money."
26660,Penny,"how can you not be happy? you’re tall, thin and famous. oh, my god, i’m jealous of sheldon."
26673,Penny,"oh, she’s pregnant? that’s great. you’re gone an uncle. uncle sheldon."
26679,Penny,yeah.
26685,Penny,"okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down."
26686,Penny,"hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?"
26689,Penny,really? you don’t sound so sure.
26692,Penny,"sure, why?"
26698,Penny,we do?
26702,Penny,"okay, that’s enough."
26704,Penny,"please, sheldon. i need you."
26707,Penny,i think i know how to change your mind.
26723,Penny,we haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
26724,Penny,"okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
26726,Penny,"well, the diner scene. where’s my diner scene?"
26741,Penny,"no, please. don’t stop, go on. tell me how i’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life."
26746,Penny,thank you.
26752,Penny,"look, i know you were just trying to help with your star wars thing. i didn’t mean to call it idiotic."
26759,Penny,did you seriously just say um?
26767,Penny,leonard…
26778,Penny,"oh, i have a ton of errands to run. i need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
26786,Penny,no. i’m serious.
26789,Penny,thank you. i needed to hear that. why can’t leonard understand it?
26798,Penny,"yeah, well, maybe we do."
26799,Penny,"okay, wait. what are we doing?"
26800,Penny,"look, i know you think i’m being reckless, and you might be right, but i need to take this shot."
26808,Penny,to be cool? yeah.
26814,Penny,"yes, like a museum, but anything else."
26815,Penny,"oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, i should probably put on clean underwear."
26821,Penny,"okay, so i’m an adult, and the other day i saw an old man slip and fall down, and i laughed. i mean, i laughed hard. like, like, out loud. if he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
26835,Penny,"aw, jewellery. oh, my god, lakers tickets?"
26837,Penny,should we take this little party to the bedroom?
26841,Penny,"oh, my god."
26851,Penny,"yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long."
26863,Penny,"no, no, no, stay there. i’m fine on the floor."
26865,Penny,translation?
26867,Penny,why not?
26872,Penny,really? this one?
26875,Penny,"come on, that is ridiculous."
26885,Penny,"yeah, mm-hmm. amy, it’s penny. hey. just a little heads-up. leonard bought a dining room table. yeah. sheldon’s breaking up with you."
26886,Penny,"well, i’m glad you’re still together."
26890,Penny,"forget it, leonard. it’s over."
26891,Penny,"aw, thank you."
26894,Penny,"okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. they just try to clone me from my corpse, but my dna gets mixed with the ape’s dna and i end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet."
26897,Penny,"oh, i’m sure he does it out of love. the same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices."
26902,Penny,"oh, hi."
26905,Penny,i did. i called them. the part’s gone. they gave it to someone else. now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
26907,Penny,"i’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?"
26915,Penny,i wouldn’t be so sure about that.
26917,Penny,disgusting. do not tell him.
26921,Penny,are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
26928,Penny,i’m gonna need another clue.
26933,Penny,"yeah, but if i become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money."
26940,Penny,"ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. so, why do you think that?"
26942,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t pout. i’m sorry i ruined your game."
26950,Penny,"what is this, my first day?"
26953,Penny,i’m liking my odds here.
26958,Penny,i don’t know what to do.
26965,Penny,both of us.
26970,Penny,really?
26971,Penny,"unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal."
26978,Penny,that’s what i’m afraid of.
26985,Penny,"oh, come on, try me."
26987,Penny,no.
26991,Penny,"you have to have the courage to end the relationship. you know? break it off, shake hands, walk away."
26992,Penny,"i know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow."
26993,Penny,"so, how do you want me to cut it?"
26997,Penny,"okay, what do you think?"
27003,Penny,"sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? i mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? maybe something new to study will find you."
27010,Penny,"leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?"
27014,Penny,i don’t know. what do you want to do?
27015,Penny,what can we do that’s free?
27016,Penny,are you kidding? that’s what you always do. think harder.
27018,Penny,no. bernadette’s working late.
27023,Penny,you’re not working late. why did you lie to me?
27026,Penny,"we’re gonna have anything can happen thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and i’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do."
27028,Penny,what’s wrong?
27029,Penny,it’s fusion.
27031,Penny,thank you.
27037,Penny,"uh, since you’re paying for dinner, i’ll let that slide. open yours."
27048,Penny,"sheldon, do you hear that? i mean, amy is the key to your happiness."
27059,Penny,"oh, like attack of the clones. we are leaving right now."
27061,Penny,i’ve never been to a funeral before.
27070,Penny,"well, i don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer."
27071,Penny,you think about dying?
27074,Penny,"no, i meant that as a regret."
27079,Penny,what’s two to one?
27082,Penny,"okay. leonard, will you marry me?"
27095,Penny,"life? what life? look at me, i’m a monster. and now i have blood on my hands, or paws. i don’t know."
27097,Penny,"actually, you know what? can we do one more? i think i could do it better."
27098,Penny,"well, i care. i mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?"
27106,Penny,"oh, really?"
27108,Penny,are you done?
27110,Penny,"leonard, you are really not cheering me up."
27115,Penny,i don’t know. we could get married.
27119,Penny,"what does it matter? the point is, i’m choosing you."
27123,Penny,"you, you stupid pop-tart."
27127,Penny,what’s wrong?
27130,Penny,"oh, my god, yes."
27134,Penny,i think leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
27141,Penny,"if you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?"
27144,Penny,"uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
27150,Penny,"he can take care of himself. look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
27153,Penny,it’s sweet how you look out for him. you’re a good guy.
27155,Penny,and go where?
27156,Penny,"leonard, hang on. just come here. maybe we need to let him go."
27160,Penny,"he’ll be okay. you taught him well, padawan."
27161,Penny,"seriously, let him go."
27165,Penny,hi. want to do yoga with me?
27175,Penny,they do?
27187,Penny,"yeah, kind of."
27188,Penny,"i know, but she’s kind of a bully."
27194,Penny,i cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
27196,Penny,"uh, not yet, but i will."
27198,Penny,"well, the first few weeks will be all training. they’ll tell me everything i need to know."
27202,Penny,"uh, no. actually, i didn’t invite her."
27205,Penny,"i told you, they’ll be right out."
27220,Penny,that’s so cool. congratulations. i guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
27232,Penny,a hundred.
27237,Penny,just don’t take it.
27240,Penny,"no, stop being stupid."
27246,Penny,let’s just take the test.
27251,Penny,"yeah, that’s a no."
27268,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry. did we get off on the wrong foot? because since the other night, i kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
27274,Penny,yeah.
27288,Penny,"oh, my god. i didn’t used to like you."
27298,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet. i mean, look at you, you are gorgeous."
27299,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
27304,Penny,want to go to vegas this weekend?
27307,Penny,"so, where should we go first?"
27311,Penny,no.
27325,Penny,"good morning. you want to go to the pool? come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. wow, it’s bright out. isn’t it bright? i should probably close these curtains. nah. bye."
27334,Penny,"well, you know how they gave me the company car? didn’t make sense to have two, so i sold the other one."
27336,Penny,what?
27340,Penny,"well, it’s not that sweet, i paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage."
27345,Penny,"great. thank you. can you pass the salt, please?"
27351,Penny,you two want to be alone?
27353,Penny,"well, i just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because i’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary."
27355,Penny,"or, maybe now that i’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure."
27361,Penny,"oh, don’t apologize."
27365,Penny,maybe it’s a good thing we came here. it’s like a lesson in what not to do.
27372,Penny,i think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
27373,Penny,"okay, what’s the big deal? look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, i don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. i mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the ac in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls."
27384,Penny,"okay, he just showed up at my door. don’t you think that’s a little weird?"
27395,Penny,"leonard, are you okay?"
27396,Penny,"okay, leonard, let’s go."
27407,Penny,no. i just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
27413,Penny,"well, now i can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch."
27418,Penny,"here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with amy?"
27433,Penny,thank you for wearing your heels.
27435,Penny,"i know, me, too. but it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
27449,Penny,really? you won’t even say a?
27459,Penny,aw.
27466,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss."
27469,Penny,"no. no, no, no. i think the cookie thing."
27478,Penny,"uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
27483,Penny,"hey, how are things going with your parents?"
27488,Penny,"oh, great. everything’s good."
27493,Penny,like what?
27497,Penny,"hey, you know, raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. him and his mom have a type. you, you got to laugh at that, right? no? all right."
27502,Penny,of course it is.
27506,Penny,did you say it out loud with words?
27508,Penny,"no. we’re always doing what you guys want. just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted."
27517,Penny,"you were, but somehow i held myself back."
27522,Penny,"no, you’re right, we should do what you do. have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston."
27523,Penny,bye.
27532,Penny,don’t tell amy that. we’ll be here every sunday.
27540,Penny,"i love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one."
27545,Penny,"uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?"
27554,Penny,say the quote again.
27555,Penny,"wow, this is hard. i’m gonna say cinnamon."
27566,Penny,kind of like sheldon’s ant farm.
27577,Penny,"oh, just a video of bernadette in a beauty pageant."
27581,Penny,no.
27595,Penny,"no, it is. does he stay? do they kiss? does she find out about montana?"
27620,Penny,son of a bitch.
27621,Penny,i can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
27622,Penny,why would she even do this?
27637,Penny,the answer’s in this puzzle box. let’s see if you can open it.
27644,Penny,"oh, careful. you’re poking at the whole foundation of the bachelor."
27645,Penny,what? you’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
27649,Penny,yup. be right there. i assume you don’t want wine.
27650,Penny,what heavy machinery? let’s just start.
27659,Penny,"interesting, you didn’t mention amy."
27665,Penny,you’re all alike.
27675,Penny,that is so funny. i never would have pegged you for a pisces.
27678,Penny,and begin. this is kind of creepy.
27680,Penny,do you want to stop? i know you have trouble with eye contact.
27684,Penny,just thinking about the day i met you and leonard.
27694,Penny,because i beat you.
27703,Penny,"well, get it. get it for me."
27704,Penny,yeah.
27715,Penny,we sure did.
27718,Penny,and our butts. not hanging it.
27724,Penny,i am taking you shopping.
27733,Penny,"wow, it looks really pretty in here."
27741,Penny,"guys, if i wanted to hear people be bitchy, i’d go to my real salon."
27756,Penny,"i care. oh, wait, no, i don’t. good luck, raj."
27757,Penny,whoa.
27763,Penny,"yeah, so, how many people listen?"
27770,Penny,aw.
27773,Penny,"well, maybe i can do both."
27780,Penny,yeah.
27781,Penny,"well, how much do you owe? maybe i can help you out."
27792,Penny,well.
27799,Penny,oh. you’re right. i’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. huh. you are a wise man.
27800,Penny,"oh, i guess you’re right. maybe it is the person who asks."
27804,Penny,"yeah, uh, i got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."
27805,Penny,"well, kind of. but now i get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect."
27811,Penny,"i do, and you know, i don’t think i’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it."
27822,Penny,what?
27826,Penny,oh. you could tell it to me.
27829,Penny,hi.
27834,Penny,"yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short."
27835,Penny,yeah.
27839,Penny,"yeah. you’re gonna be on skype, they’re not gonna see your legs."
27846,Penny,don’t you want to know for sure?
27847,Penny,"aw, it’s so nice. she’s gonna love it."
27855,Penny,really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. i think.
27865,Penny,"it’s okay, go ahead."
27868,Penny,"oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
27871,Penny,that’s probably it. what’d you say to her?
27872,Penny,and that made her angry?
27873,Penny,"well, sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her."
27874,Penny,yeah. i’m tapping out. leonard?
27889,Penny,"you know, i can see why amy’s mad at you."
27897,Penny,"all right, well, i want it in a church."
27899,Penny,sounds perfect.
27913,Penny,and no regrets.
27920,Penny,all right.
27925,Penny,"no, i don’t want there to be secrets between us."
27932,Penny,yes.
27934,Penny,"so, what package are you thinking?"
27937,Penny,"no. no, i want to. look, we’ve put this off long enough. let’s do it."
27950,Penny,what if they call our names?
27964,Penny,can you?
27969,Penny,"it’s just, when we were kissing, i couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl."
27990,Penny,sheldon.
27998,Penny,"okay, when i’m done with him, i’m gonna need more information."
27999,Penny,"okay, look, i might be overreacting, but how am i supposed to get past this when i know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?"
28002,Penny,"no, i just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on."
28003,Penny,"yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you."
28008,Penny,"you know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. he’s cockier now."
28012,Penny,i’m listening.
28013,Penny,"okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. but i get it."
28017,Penny,"oh. oh, my god, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me."
28031,Penny,"we are. i mean, he sleeps here. but it’s only a matter of time before sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the leonard-shaped pile of pillows."
28032,Penny,yes.
28033,Penny,yes.
28036,Penny,your shoes.
28047,Penny,there you go. you’re all done.
28049,Penny,"you’re not gonna let this go, are you?"
28050,Penny,"fine, you want me to call? i’ll call. why am i so nervous?"
28053,Penny,"fine. i’m calling home, but when i’m done, you’re calling your mother."
28057,Penny,"last week. i’m sorry, i should’ve told you. it was a spur of the moment thing. i feel terrible. please don’t be too disappointed."
28059,Penny,"aw, thank you, daddy. that means so much."
28069,Penny,no. he was a beloved member of the family.
28079,Penny,"oh, we’re glad you had fun."
28087,Penny,"hey, we’re going to dinner. you want to come?"
28094,Penny,they’re not saying that.
28096,Penny,"okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen."
28097,Penny,"okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. all right? maybe instead of leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here."
28100,Penny,"yeah, i think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?"
28102,Penny,"all right, well, what have you tried so far?"
28103,Penny,really? in a comic book store?
28106,Penny,yeah.
28111,Penny,what?
28115,Penny,"all right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
28119,Penny,"oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with stuart."
28127,Penny,"okay, okay, okay. thumbs down. next."
28128,Penny,"well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish."
28132,Penny,"amy, you’re getting a text."
28136,Penny,"well, good for you."
28139,Penny,yes. don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
28142,Penny,"yeah, you probably had it coming."
28145,Penny,"okay, enough about the napkin. what else you hiding in there?"
28150,Penny,i know. it just…
28163,Penny,what are you gonna do?
28175,Penny,"well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone."
28184,Penny,but you’re curious about aluminium cans? you’re a weird little guy.
28186,Penny,"oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars."
28191,Penny,your what?
28196,Penny,"oh, no."
28202,Penny,yep. what’s the code?
28203,Penny,it’s not working.
28208,Penny,i’m not gonna say your password out loud. that is not secure.
28216,Penny,interesting. i never told you that.
28228,Penny,i am not putting that on the internet. i don’t want people to see this. i don’t want to see it.
28231,Penny,yeah. so you have a song stuck in your head. it happens to everybody.
28235,Penny,"okay, great. what is it?"
28236,Penny,i’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
28238,Penny,nobody knows. that’s why he’s number one. can you please go talk to him?
28253,Penny,"aw, that’s nice. put that on her cake."
28262,Penny,"sheldon, that’s so beautiful."
28264,Penny,"sure, sure. or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
28270,Penny,"knowing them, they will."
28272,Penny,"well, i’m gonna stay positive. i mean, we talked, i told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself."
28273,Penny,hey.
28277,Penny,"um, a psychiatrist. why?"
28286,Penny,"really? oh, you’re the best husband ever."
28287,Penny,i guess.
28290,Penny,mm-hmm?
28294,Penny,"how can i not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with star wars toys? i mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed wookiee watching you?"
28295,Penny,"you know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. before i did pharmaceutical sales, i was an actress. you know, i was pretty good. you know, girl-next-door type, but hot. doable."
28296,Penny,"and not only am i leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named sheldon."
28300,Penny,i guess i just miss when life was simpler.
28310,Penny,"oh, sheldon, you don’t even like it there."
28312,Penny,"okay, fine, i accept your apology, now get out."
28316,Penny,is she okay?
28319,Penny,you couldn’t give us just one weekend?
28325,Penny,"ah, yeah, grandma by calvin klein. you know, the last time i got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me i parked like a blind person."
28326,Penny,i park fine.
28331,Penny,"all right, let’s go."
28334,Penny,come in.
28335,Penny,uh-oh.
28341,Penny,"all right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears."
28344,Penny,so what did you say?
28350,Penny,i’m still sleeping with you tonight.
28352,Penny,"oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, glen?"
28354,Penny,you don’t have to call me ma’am.
28359,Penny,it is freaking amazing.
28360,Penny,"i was just hungry and cranky, and i’ve never been called ma’am before."
28362,Penny,"can you believe when i met you i was 22? i mean, it’s crazy. where did all that time go?"
28364,Penny,you’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
28368,Penny,"oh, there’s a screening of moulin rouge, i heard the crowd sings along and stuff."
28372,Penny,cleaning up is not young and fun.
28381,Penny,"we can, but all right."
28386,Penny,"oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. we’ve all done it."
28387,Penny,"wait, i remember that. hang on. you did it at our place?"
28403,Penny,"oh, poor thing."
28408,Penny,"thank you so much for helping us, stuart."
28426,Penny,"raj, i got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. happy belated valentine’s day, emily."
28434,Penny,"okay, answer it. just be strong. and if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. and most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear."
28446,Penny,"yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em."
28454,Penny,"honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. that is, is not a funny story."
28459,Penny,you were home alone and had no one to play with?
28462,Penny,un-freakin’ believable.
28470,Penny,"yeah. you know, i want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype."
28472,Penny,and he’s back in the closet.
28475,Penny,that’s not what the forest smells like.
28483,Penny,"uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?"
28487,Penny,it’s so cute and rustic up here.
28488,Penny,this place is great.
28492,Penny,no.
28494,Penny,got it.
28497,Penny,"all right, it’s called never have i ever. the rules are simple. someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink."
28505,Penny,"yeah, go ahead."
28507,Penny,we’re married. we’re supposed to share everything.
28509,Penny,"well, how much you got in there?"
28513,Penny,i hate my job.
28515,Penny,because i know how important it is to you that i’m having some success.
28517,Penny,"well, it’s not what i want to do."
28522,Penny,what is the problem?
28528,Penny,"uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting."
28539,Penny,may i take your cloak?
28544,Penny,what about your weird relationship with him?
28556,Penny,are your sinuses acting up?
28561,Penny,you guys been here long?
28567,Penny,yes.
28576,Penny,yes.
28577,Penny,"oh, that’s a venn diagram, and i remember because i thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"
28578,Penny,okay.
28586,Penny,or as i know him?
28591,Penny,"uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say?"
28592,Penny,uncomfortable.
28599,Penny,"okay, you know what? this is ridiculous. i’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly i’m getting nowhere."
28600,Penny,"what i was seeking was some sort of friendship. but at this point, i’ll take you not insulting me to my face."
28610,Penny,"ugh, i should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains black history month."
28611,Penny,"uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but i think we got to a good place."
28623,Penny,i don’t see how i could.
28632,Penny,"uh, who’s hungry? we have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
28635,Penny,"oh, maybe. get closer."
28640,Penny,hey.
28643,Penny,"oh, thanks for asking until i did."
28646,Penny,‘cause they both turned their phones off.
28649,Penny,"god, i thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
28661,Penny,"all right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
28667,Penny,hey.
28669,Penny,"okay, i understand everyone’s a little tense today, so i am just gonna get to the important stuff. leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. but also how incredibly happy you make me. thank you for marrying me. hopefully for the last time."
28672,Penny,"oh, thanks, mom."
28674,Penny,"all right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. get him some anti-anxiety meds."
28681,Penny,i didn’t mean to. it just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. i…
28700,Penny,"well, if it makes you feel any better, bernadette’s mad at me, too."
28703,Penny,"well, i told people at work that she’s pregnant. she wasn’t ready for them to know."
28709,Penny,you threatened to sue?
28712,Penny,good morning.
28716,Penny,hi.
28728,Penny,leonard hofstadter.
28738,Penny,"no, not at all."
28739,Penny,i guess so. and i’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
28741,Penny,"okay, you guys had sex one whole time. nothing can put out a fire like that."
28759,Penny,"really? you’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?"
28764,Penny,"yeah, get it, girl."
28767,Penny,was that a science diss?
28769,Penny,oh.
28770,Penny,i feel like i should say damn.
28772,Penny,the new neighbours are weird.
28787,Penny,"leonard breathes on me, too. it’s not a big deal."
28788,Penny,"well, so does leonard. it’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world."
28800,Penny,all right. come on. what is really going on with you?
28804,Penny,"oh, that’s awful."
28805,Penny,"well, what happened with your dad?"
28806,Penny,you poor thing.
28809,Penny,"honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?"
28811,Penny,just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed.
28830,Penny,"hey, that guy’s looking over here. "
28853,Penny,"yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
28861,Penny,"okay, are you done? bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
28868,Penny,ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
28874,Penny,"uh, did you notice your key chain?"
28882,Penny,do you really mean that?
28883,Penny,"great, and just so you know, i’m not getting rid of all your stuff."
28896,Penny,how come you never eat broccoli?
28898,Penny,could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
28901,Penny,"so, were you turned on even a little bit?"
28912,Penny,"aw, thank you."
28913,Penny,what?
28914,Penny,"you liked my short hair, right?"
28917,Penny,i think i hate all of you nerds.
28918,Penny,i can’t believe you punched bert.
28919,Penny,"oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair."
28923,Penny,but it’s a picture of you.
28931,Penny,leonard.
28939,Penny,what do you think? should we go to a hotel?
28942,Penny,little lower to the left. a little more.
28943,Penny,"no, still hideous."
28948,Penny,"well, it doesn’t matter. we’re not going to the hospital now."
28951,Penny,we could go to a bar.
28959,Penny,howard and bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. how cool is that?
28964,Penny,"hey, i bought m&ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
28967,Penny,does the baby have a name yet?
28971,Penny,"hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
28973,Penny,hi. welcome back. how was texas?
28982,Penny,hi. there’s the little family!
28984,Penny,yeah. go ahead.
28985,Penny,"oh, it’s no problem, amy and sheldon were just telling us about their trip to texas."
28986,Penny,"stop. okay. they told mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
28990,Penny,"to be fair, we may have been on edge because of the christmas tree."
28993,Penny,"no, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go."
28998,Penny,there’s something on the windshield.
29004,Penny,you poor things you must be exhausted.
29007,Penny,our pleasure.
29010,Penny,"yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it."
29014,Penny,you did not just quote an nsync song.
29016,Penny,i hadn’t really thought about it.
29020,Penny,hey.
29024,Penny,hm. at least he took an interest. 
29027,Penny,fine. lately i kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
29030,Penny,"okay, you know what? maybe i’ll take amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
29034,Penny,when was the last time you got a massage?
29035,Penny,"leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the rose parade."
29040,Penny,i’m trying to figure it out.
29044,Penny,although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance. 
29061,Penny,"leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
29062,Penny,he’s my brother. i didn’t think i needed your permission.
29065,Penny,"well, you sound like one now. i don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
29072,Penny,"hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
29080,Penny,all right. you guys ready to get crazy?
29081,Penny,"you know, if you pump at the bar, i promise we’ll get free drinks."
29086,Penny,is everything okay?
29094,Penny,"i get that, okay? it’s just, leonard and i have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
29103,Penny,"yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
29107,Penny,"wait, leonard, he’s hurting. let him feel how he feels."
29108,Penny,"yeah. shoes, i’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, i’m an eight."
29114,Penny,"well, sometimes you can get free food and wi-fi from the neighbours. just know you might have to marry one of ’em."
29119,Penny,"well, he has a job. how bad can it be?"
29126,Penny,"it’s not that i want to go, i just think it’ll make leonard happy. and if i have to watch him squeeze into an ewok costume, so be it."
29128,Penny,"oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
29135,Penny,is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?
29136,Penny,"hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?"
29139,Penny,"okay, good, ’cause that’s what i want, too."
29144,Penny,just say you want to drive.
29145,Penny,"amy, do us a favour, please drive."
29156,Penny,what? is it another video of him and his dog lady-and-the-tramping some spaghetti?
29158,Penny,you’re an even better husband.
29167,Penny,"wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."

29189,Penny,"yeah, bye, sweetie."
29193,Penny,"oh, you met him at the office christmas party. he’s married to nancy."
29200,Penny,"don’t worry about it. hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
29202,Penny,i probably should have spit out my gum first.
29208,Penny,yeah.
29210,Penny,"hey, leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, i have to do a little reception after work."
29223,Penny,"okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?"
29224,Penny,"look, it’s got to be around here somewhere."
29229,Penny,"oh, wait. i remember."
29230,Penny,yes. please find someone who cares.

29252,Penny,what’s the matter?
29257,Penny,"oh, no, what happened?"
29262,Penny,"see, that wasn’t so bad. he even picked up the check."
29270,Penny,"what, you wouldn’t trust him?"
29271,Penny,"yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
29276,Penny,"look, we can have a reasonable conversation and i won’t get mad. i don’t like it after sex, and i don’t like it now."
29278,Penny,then what do we do?
29281,Penny,"okay, are you sure about this?"
29282,Penny,"hey, uh, so i’ve been thinking about it and i want to take the job."

29336,Penny,"okay. um, let’s try this. think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."

22156,Penny,"yeah, no, i meant plans to find some place to live. other than with me, not that i don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
22163,Penny,no.
22164,Penny,"look, why don’t i play with you guys tomorrow?"
22173,Penny,"okay, raj, what’ll it be?  "
22175,Penny,"okay, can you please order a cocktail, i need to practice mixing drinks."

22180,Penny,"okay, raj, here you go. alright, who’s next?"
22186,Penny,i’m fine.
22189,Penny,drinks do not work that way. 
22194,Penny,"hey, you do your experiments, i do mine. "
22195,Penny,it’s a little loud.
22198,Penny,"oh. you know you can just get one of those universal remotes at radio shack, they’re really cheap."
22201,Penny,"huh, well that’s handy. um, here’s a question, why? "
22202,Penny,"well, wait, wait, what’s on top of them. "
22204,Penny,"so, how’s it going with sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? "
22229,Penny,"little misunderstanding, huh. "
22231,Penny,well how do you feel?
22235,Penny,which was? 
22238,Penny,"uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words."
22240,Penny,you had a lucky hunch. 
22242,Penny,bye sheldon. 
22244,Penny,"no, no, i didn’t say better, i said less stained. "
22249,Penny,is this usually how these physics things go?
22252,Penny,"alright, remember when i auditioned for that workshop production of rent, but i didn’t get it and i couldn’t figure out why?"
22254,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. "
22260,Penny,"wait, what?"
22271,Penny,"no, look, sheldon’s cousin leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a motel 8 at long beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. leonard is driving sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man."
22273,Penny,hi. how did the intervention go.
22276,Penny,no.
22279,Penny,i’m… i’m sorry.
22284,Penny,did you get my mail.
22288,Penny,"oh, the flu i guess."
22290,Penny,i… i don’t…
22296,Penny,you can have soup delivered.
22297,Penny,"okay, what kind of soup do you want."
22299,Penny,no.
22300,Penny,"hey, where are you? "
22317,Penny,"oh, sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?"
22319,Penny,i can’t believe i’m doing this. 
22331,Penny,what?
22338,Penny,"oh, thanks raj, it’s vanilla oil."
22342,Penny,right. 
22348,Penny,"so, how do you feel? nice and loose? come to play? got your game face on?  are you ready?"
22353,Penny,"van halen. alright, madonna was married to this ridgemont high alum.  oh my god, sean penn!"
22359,Penny,what is it?
22362,Penny,"you’re joking, right?"
22370,Penny,what are you doing?
22374,Penny,"oh, leonard. "
22379,Penny,oh. wow. good for you. 
22383,Penny,"really, they have your little name label in them. "
22387,Penny,"sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?"
22412,Penny,that’s the saddest thing i’ve ever heard. 
22413,Penny,i know. i want to talk to you. 
22420,Penny,nevertheless we are….
22428,Penny,"well, sheldon, you’re his friend. friends give each other presents."
22442,Penny,"i don’t know, the man on the box looks so happy. "
22444,Penny,of course.
22446,Penny,all of them.
22447,Penny,yeah.
22456,Penny,"i’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, i’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. "
22459,Penny,keep walking.
22460,Penny,"that’s my friend carol. remind me, i’ve got to introduce her to howard. "
22465,Penny,i don’t. 
22466,Penny,wait. 
22473,Penny,"nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. oh god, i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. i just want to crawl into a hole and die."
22476,Penny,"no, at the sub shop we were only making out. "
22477,Penny,"really, do you think i overreacted?"
22478,Penny,"‘cause i do that, i do overreact. maybe i should call mike and apologise."
22483,Penny,"i’m going over to mike’s. leonard, thank you so much."
22489,Penny,"i swear to god, i am done with guys like that. you know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
22500,Penny,"well, raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. "
22505,Penny,"oh, that’s nice. anyhow, the thing i wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since leonard and i have become friends, i was just… want to sit down? "
22507,Penny,"alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. "
22509,Penny,"alright, yeah, i don’t really know who they are…"
22510,Penny,"yeah, i don’t care, i don’t care. the point is leonard isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with."
22515,Penny,not the first one i’ve made today. 
22517,Penny,schrodinger? is that the woman in 2a?
22529,Penny,"yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question."
22533,Penny,what are you doing?
22534,Penny,i didn’t feel a draft. 
22537,Penny,or we could just wing it. 
22539,Penny,"sheldon, may i ask you a question? "
22543,Penny,"so, do you think that if leonard and i keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. "
22551,Penny,yeah. 
22566,Penny,"wow, i get it, because dr leonard hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree. "
22567,Penny,"right, but i have to have some sort of degree to date you? "
22568,Penny,"so, it’s fine with you if i’m not smart. "
22572,Penny,sheldon? what are you doing?
22587,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
22592,Penny,your arch enemy?
22597,Penny,"oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. but, um, i think for now leonard and i are just going to stay friends."
22600,Penny,"you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it."
22601,Penny,"okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with."
22602,Penny,because love trumps hate.
22608,Penny,"thankyou, sheldon."
22609,Penny,"why? i’ll tell you why. because today i had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, i waited an hour for my turn, and before i could even start they told me i looked too midwest for the part. too midwest? what the hell does that even mean?"
22616,Penny,what are you doing?
22621,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. can i see them in another colour?"
22627,Penny,"yeah, okay. listen, i need to talk to sheldon."
22632,Penny,"thank you, i really appreciate this."
22647,Penny,"yeah, get to the point, i’m about to level up here."
22651,Penny,22
22654,Penny,"frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!"
22659,Penny,"ooh, awesome, okay, i totally like to initiate i’m a big old five."
22662,Penny,"whatever, i’ll figure it out myself."
22663,Penny,"oh my god, i need help.  "
22665,Penny,"creepy, howard."
22666,Penny,sit over there.
22677,Penny,"um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?"
22678,Penny,"oh, i’m ready."
22681,Penny,"uh, come on, good night leonard."
22693,Penny,"yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?"
22699,Penny,"sheldon, it’s fine."
22701,Penny,what?
22705,Penny,"well, good for leonard."
22714,Penny,okay.
22716,Penny,all right! 
22721,Penny,"come on, let’s go."
22725,Penny,"oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order.  see? sorry."
22730,Penny,sheldon cooper?
22731,Penny,i need to see this.
22732,Penny,"oh, come on, we’ll be quiet."
22733,Penny,"you know, like what’s his deal? is it girls? guys? sock puppets?"
22737,Penny,what are you guys gonna do?
22738,Penny,"yeah, i’m busy, so, goodnight."
22740,Penny,sorry.   holy crap on a cracker.
22744,Penny,get rid of her how?
22746,Penny,"okay, first of all, it is not man after man."
22757,Penny,"you sound just like the cable company. all right, so, shh, tyra banks is about to kick someone off  america’s next top model."
22759,Penny,"oh. that’s anais, none of the other girls in the house like her."
22767,Penny,it’s one onion ring.
22772,Penny,"all right, yeah, i’ll play along. what was my first strike?"
22775,Penny,"come on, i touched one onion ring."
22776,Penny,"oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?"
22779,Penny,i don’t care. i’m taking a stand. metaphorically.
22783,Penny,"shrimp caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays howard, and for our suddenly back on the hindu wagon raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. coming right up."
22788,Penny,"really? well, that’s great."
22794,Penny,"go ahead, eat it. i dare you"
22797,Penny,well?
22799,Penny,"i don’t care, i was in junior rodeo, i can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds."
22804,Penny,"another night? well, i guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always saturday night."
22822,Penny,yes?
22829,Penny,"okay, where is he going?"
22833,Penny,"so, who’s the girl?"
22837,Penny,"oh, nice. a doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?"
22848,Penny,"so, this wasn’t the awkward part?"
22850,Penny,"okay, feeling the awkward now."
22852,Penny,to you?
22854,Penny,"well, aren’t you sweet?"
22866,Penny,we never got to the bedroom.
22869,Penny,"oh, thank you."
22875,Penny,"seriously? you went first, after only two weeks? that’s bold."
22879,Penny,mm-hmm.
22881,Penny,"so, that’s stephanie, huh?"
22884,Penny,are you sure?
22886,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it.  hmm, cute dresses. i bet this looks great on you!"
22897,Penny,really?
22898,Penny,"okay, leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something."
22899,Penny,"believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers."
22900,Penny,just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
22906,Penny,"so, how did the talk with stephanie go?"
22907,Penny,"so, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
22917,Penny,okay?
22919,Penny,hiney?
22921,Penny,"okay, well, thank you for that, but i got you and leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so i’ll just put them under my tree."
22924,Penny,"now, honey, it’s okay.you don’t have to get me anything in return."
22925,Penny,"okay, you know what? forget it. i’m not giving you a present."
22929,Penny,hi. penny. so it’s your motorcycle?
22942,Penny,"hey, leonard. dave was just showing me around the university. you know, this place is unbelievable!"
22946,Penny,it’s not an experiment! you saw what happened last night.
22948,Penny,why are you yelling at me?

23012,Penny,"yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect."
23015,Penny,thanks! i mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
23024,Penny,what is this?
23030,Penny,"sheldon, are you okay?"
23034,Penny,"ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door."
23040,Penny,"yes, it occurs to me, too."
23047,Penny,are they working on that?
23050,Penny,i’m regretting this already.
23052,Penny,no.

23064,Penny,"yes, dinner’s here, and i’m having some. i’m having takeout food."
23069,Penny,"going home, where i won’t be interrogated like a criminal. i forgot my fortune cookie."
23070,Penny,hey.
23074,Penny,"yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem."
23079,Penny,that is not the definition of professional.
23088,Penny,why not?
23092,Penny,"hey, is sheldon here?"
23100,Penny,"fellas, please."
23104,Penny,i think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
23111,Penny,"right, okay. what was he like when he was young?"
23113,Penny,"yeah, leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."
23123,Penny,"oh, my god. what happened?"
23124,Penny,"geez, what a fun couple."
23127,Penny,"she was right, you know. the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."
23129,Penny,"no, they said i was too perky."
23132,Penny,"oh, that is so sad."
23135,Penny,"you’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime."
23138,Penny,why would you bring that up right now?
23141,Penny,get out!
23142,Penny,"look, i was just coming over to talk to you."
23143,Penny,gotcha.

23152,Penny,"boy, i love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle."
23153,Penny,"oh, thank you. you are a lifesaver."
23155,Penny,"oh, no, thanks. i’m from nebraska. when we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. "

23705,Penny,"come on, sheldon, let’s go home. look, we’re done fighting."

23728,Penny,"no, no, no, i can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."
23729,Penny,no one’s saying that. let’s go.
23732,Penny,"clothes, sheldon. i need clothes!"
23744,Penny,"all right, can we please go?"
23748,Penny,nothing. the engine does that sometimes.
23750,Penny,"it’s not going to explode, just keep driving. warp speed ahead, mr. spock."
23753,Penny,"it’s not soup, it’s courage."
23763,Penny,"oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
23764,Penny,ass.
23767,Penny,wait. you have to help me get into bed. sheldon has to get me into bed. bet you never thought i’d say that.
23768,Penny,"you know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie wall-e at the end. you’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
23769,Penny,sing “soft kitty” to me.
23770,Penny,injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
23771,Penny,"wait, wait. let’s sing it as a round. i’ll start. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… see that’s where you come in. i’ll start over. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… i’ve got all night, sheldon. soft kitty, warm kitty…  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
23773,Penny,what exactly does that mean?
23777,Penny,she agreed to go out with you for free. what more do you need?
23778,Penny,different how?
23785,Penny,"oh, gee, you’re too late. scarlett johansson and wonder woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
23791,Penny,you want me to throw him out?
23796,Penny,"oh, come on, it’s fine. we’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
23804,Penny,"yeah, well, i don’t think it’s very funny."
23807,Penny,"um, actually, can we do it in private?"
23816,Penny,"great! it’s a little insulting, but great. i’ll be koko."
23822,Penny,thank you.
23830,Penny,i don’t know.
23836,Penny,damn it!
23843,Penny,"really? that’s it? well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
23844,Penny,"okay, i just have one question. what exactly are sub-atomic particles?"
23856,Penny,"oh, sure, sure, yeah. very christmassy."
23870,Penny,"oh, it’s not a problem."
23871,Penny,"no, you do not."
23876,Penny,yikes. what’s so funny?
23878,Penny,"i do, i’ll teach you."
23879,Penny,"okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
23883,Penny,"hey, bev, guess what?"
23886,Penny,"oh, beverly, i can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis."
23892,Penny,"yeah, not bad, not bad."
23898,Penny,"oh, thank you, beverly."
23899,Penny,that you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
23900,Penny,"well, the last big thing i did was this production of diary of anne frank above a bowling alley. but i think things might be turning around pretty soon."
23902,Penny,"okay. well, i went to this psychic who told me that if i cut my hair, i’m going to get a national commercial."
23903,Penny,"she’s not one of those phonies, okay. she wrote a book and has her own web site."
23912,Penny,"wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included howard wolowitz?"
23914,Penny,i would not.
23916,Penny,you saying i don’t have an open mind?
23918,Penny,and astrology.
23929,Penny,"um… three little kittens? three little pigs? god, i don’t know. star wars?"
23933,Penny,"oh, my…"
23938,Penny,"come on, sheldon, you can’t move. don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
23939,Penny,is he quitting his job at the university?
23942,Penny,"sheldon, that’s so… "
23946,Penny,and you’re stuck?
23948,Penny,what is he doing now?
23956,Penny,"oh, you’ve been falling all night. you’re used to it."
23961,Penny,what happened?
23967,Penny,"sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
23969,Penny,"you just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
23971,Penny,"sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what i do. i’m a waitress, not a busboy."
23974,Penny,"sheldon, where are you going? aren’t you going to clean this up?"
23977,Penny,"okay, i’m starting to think swiss is key here."
23985,Penny,is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
23987,Penny,"it’s not over, is it?"
23988,Penny,hello.
23989,Penny,"well, i always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
23992,Penny,i’m sorry. is this supposed to be buttering me up?
23996,Penny,"yes. if it means that much to you, you should go."
23997,Penny,you’re welcome.
23999,Penny,i know! i went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
24018,Penny,of course i do. you’re an important part of my life and i pay attention to the things you are interested in.
24025,Penny,"no, it isn’t."
24026,Penny,"mmm, no, it isn’t."
24028,Penny,no! it wasn’t a betrayal. it was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. i already have to buy my insurance from this place in the cayman islands.
24037,Penny,but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. totally. a teardrop rolls down my cheek?
24039,Penny,"what do you think? for doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. he has to stay in there until he apologizes."
24040,Penny,"oh, gee, thanks, leonard. that didn’t occur to me. if he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail."
24041,Penny,we’re home.
24045,Penny,did he just somehow give me the finger?
24052,Penny,hmm. damn. all right. thank you.
24053,Penny,really? great!
24054,Penny,then why did you tell me you had it?
24062,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…"
24066,Penny,"oh, no, no, i said i’m inviting you to come with me to stan lee’s house."
24070,Penny,"oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?"
24072,Penny,who’s adam west?
24076,Penny,okay.
24077,Penny,"hey, guys. enjoying your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
24080,Penny,"okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and i don’t even get to keep it?"
24081,Penny,sheldon tried to take the ring and i punched him.
24084,Penny,"fyi, this is a bag from victoria’s secret."
24092,Penny,"yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together."
24094,Penny,did i see x-men?
24096,Penny,"okay. well, i am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. might give you more confidence."
24106,Penny,what’s the matter?
24109,Penny,"here, see if this one works."
24110,Penny,sure.
24119,Penny,"okay, good night, sweetie."
24120,Penny,hi.
24123,Penny,"it’s always nice chatting with you, sheldon."
24126,Penny,bite me!
24138,Penny,did leonard send you over here?
24145,Penny,i don’t know.
24149,Penny,"look, leonard, you have to know how much i care about you. it’s just that i’ve said the l word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well."
24155,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry, honey, but the wesley crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like wesley crusher."
24157,Penny,"hey, thanks."
24160,Penny,"yeah, that’s right."
24161,Penny,"oh, yeah, me, too."
24163,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry."
24166,Penny,no!
24168,Penny,i know.
24175,Penny,"okay. are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?"
24180,Penny,everyone.
24182,Penny,"so, how you been?"
24184,Penny,mmm. how’s leonard doing?
24195,Penny,"why did you ask if i had one, too?"
24197,Penny,have you been running?
24199,Penny,"well, maybe that’s ’cause leonard can’t cook."
24203,Penny,nope.
24205,Penny,"yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels."
24207,Penny,"okay, you can take him for shoes."
24208,Penny,"well, all i know is he says they hurt his feet."
24211,Penny,we’re going to disneyland. he’s going to eat junk food.
24214,Penny,what’s the problem with goofy?
24216,Penny,how was i supposed to know that?
24218,Penny,"no, you already threw up once. go put on your pjs and brush your teeth."
24222,Penny,"yep, okay."
24223,Penny,sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
24225,Penny,i think we can do it.
24231,Penny,"sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?"
24232,Penny,oh. what?
24239,Penny,hello.
24240,Penny,"oh, penny, this is dr. plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. dr. plimpton, penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
24242,Penny,good.
24245,Penny,not as good as you apparently.
24247,Penny,i’m not recommending it. i’m saying it already happened.
24249,Penny,"oh, no, no, it’s okay. you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
24251,Penny,i found these in the dryer. i’m assuming they belong to sheldon.
24254,Penny,"no, you don’t."
24255,Penny,"oh, i’m judging you nine ways to sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation."
24257,Penny,"okay, babydoll pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that i got my dad’s feet."
24261,Penny,"well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
24264,Penny,"well, yeah, he’d been living with sheldon."
24267,Penny,"well, i’m sorry, leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you."
24270,Penny,why not?
24272,Penny,"so, what, that’s it? you’ve stayed with sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
24274,Penny,"okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
24278,Penny,what were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
24280,Penny,"okay, so, basically, you’re the reason i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
24282,Penny,"oh, hi. what’s going on?"
24290,Penny,oh! that’s very cool.
24303,Penny,"oh, thanks, i’m not hungry."
24307,Penny,"yeah, it must have been. i just threw up in my closet."
24309,Penny,"leonard, last night was a mistake."
24310,Penny,"look, i’m sorry. i was drunk, i was lonely, i hated zack. can we just forget it ever happened?"
24324,Penny,who’s amy?
24326,Penny,how long has this been going on?
24333,Penny,"oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? you know, when your private parts started growing?"
24339,Penny,probably not.
24343,Penny,"oh, that’s great. have fun."
24353,Penny,sheldon.
24357,Penny,"okay. well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know."
24373,Penny,"so, um, amy, what about you? do you date much?"
24374,Penny,"uh, yeah, i wouldn’t say many. a few. "
24381,Penny,"okay, sheldon, you are so wrong. that is not even close to the real number. i’m gonna need a drink over here."
24382,Penny,"no! no! no. let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?"
24383,Penny,i did not have sex with 31 guys.
24386,Penny,"okay, you know what? i’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. sheldon, if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish, i’m gonna tell your mother on you."
24388,Penny,"if i’d thought of that in the first place, i could’ve saved myself this whole night."
24390,Penny,"oh, you wanted me to pay."
24394,Penny,i’m cute. i get by.
24399,Penny,"wait. cybernetics is robot stuff, right?"
24402,Penny,"wait. honey,have you ever run before?"
24408,Penny,don’t have one.
24410,Penny,"no. i just run till i’m hungry, then i stop for a bear claw."
24415,Penny,"okay, let’s go."
24417,Penny,"oh, sheldon!"
24418,Penny,thanks.
24421,Penny,what am i up to now?
24424,Penny,"so, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? only fourteen hundred bucks."
24426,Penny,i’d rather people not know i have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
24432,Penny,what do you want me to do?
24443,Penny,"god, he’s an ass when he drinks."
24452,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
24453,Penny,i hear you broke up with amy.
24459,Penny,"well, i’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but i know sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on tuesdays. and even if raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. and leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
24462,Penny,"oh, howard, heads up. your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift."
24463,Penny,not since i found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
24468,Penny,"howard, if you want my help, i’ve got to know what happened."
24476,Penny,"oh, gee, howard, i really don’t want to get in the middle of this."
24486,Penny,"it’s passion fruit, new on the menu."
24509,Penny,"what? sheldon, you can’t reprogram people."
24515,Penny,"what, 21 seconds? that’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!"
24517,Penny,"mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t."
24520,Penny,"yeah, no, no, i-i-i got that."
24526,Penny,that’s okay. y ou can just sleep here.
24529,Penny,"okay. well, i guess we’re having a slumber party. oh!"
24530,Penny,howard has a hairy chest?
24562,Penny,"oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but leonard has to work in the morning."
24564,Penny,good night.
24565,Penny,"love you, too."
40971,Sheldon,"well, i had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. now, as i was saying, based on the content…"
40989,Sheldon,my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead.
40992,Sheldon,i panicked. he looked taller than usual.
40996,Sheldon,don’t.
40998,Sheldon,i would like to change mine. the pirate’s name was peg-leg antoine. now it’s completely different from goonies.
41007,Sheldon,"excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. a guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. if we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."
41017,Sheldon,"but i suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. let’s see. oh, janine davis. oh, dear."
41031,Sheldon,"actually, i meant you could drive me. but if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too."
41045,Sheldon,um…
41056,Sheldon,"yeah, right on, sister."
41060,Sheldon,i’m deleting it.
41065,Sheldon,"oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. and after that, i’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. you know, instead of flossing, i’ll rub pudding on my gums. i’m going to get the number of the syfy channel and give them what for."
41066,Sheldon,no. they can’t just cancel a show like alphas. you know? they have to help the viewers let go. firefly did a movie to wrap things up. buffy the vampire slayer continued on as a comic book. heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
41074,Sheldon,"oh, amy. and you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. especially since i’m about to win.  b-but we didn’t finish."
41078,Sheldon,yes.
41081,Sheldon,"amy, i must say, i was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
41085,Sheldon,"i love you, too."
41086,Sheldon,"hello. uh, is this the bruce miller who wrote the season finale of alphas? oh, smashing. yeah, you already sound nicer than the last bruce miller who suggested i have sexual relations with myself. now, down to business. um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? uh-huh. mm-hmm. i see. well, that all stinks. no wonder you got cancelled. bye."
41089,Sheldon,yes.
41097,Sheldon,"as professor proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin."
41103,Sheldon,"leonard, you hear that? professor proton said i should call him arthur. that means we’re friends."
41104,Sheldon,look at me. i can get as close to you as i want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
41107,Sheldon,"yes. and if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
41110,Sheldon,it’s gonna get sucked in. it’s going to get sucked in.
41113,Sheldon,"what, well what’s wrong? is she upsetting you? because i can make her go away."
41117,Sheldon,"well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but i didn’t have any friends growing up."
41127,Sheldon,"oh, you’re not. you look awful."
41137,Sheldon,"oh, please. every time the topic of change comes up, you throw zachary quinto in my face. i’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, zachary quinto. i’m upset that daylight saving time started, zachary quinto. i’m upset daylight saving time ended, zachary quinto. i’m saying this for the last time, zachary quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. so stop using him against me."
41144,Sheldon,"well, i’ve just never played dungeons & dragons with girls before."
41145,Sheldon,i’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
41150,Sheldon,that is amazing. he made me care about the ogre.
41158,Sheldon,you see what happens when you let girls play d&d?
41162,Sheldon,"oh, my. that’s an uncomfortable topic. amy, before i met you, i never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
41170,Sheldon,i kiss you back on the  lips as well. your turn.
41172,Sheldon,"yeah, i used to be uncomfortable around people, but then i learned a trick. i pretend everyone i meet is a beloved character from star trek."
41173,Sheldon,"oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
41186,Sheldon,"this is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
41187,Sheldon,"you know, i have to say, penny, i don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging leonard to do this."
41194,Sheldon,how?
41209,Sheldon,"this isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
41213,Sheldon,"to be honest, i did."
41216,Sheldon,you’re welcome. good night.
41221,Sheldon,"well, now that i’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3d chess."
41225,Sheldon,great. i’ll go first.
41238,Sheldon,allow me to comfort you. at least you’ve got your health.
41249,Sheldon,all right. in 4d chess…
41256,Sheldon,"yes. whew, i feel ten pounds lighter."
41260,Sheldon,your apology is accepted.
41267,Sheldon,that criticism will come later in your report card.
41273,Sheldon,twelve hundred dollars. that’s my final offer.
41284,Sheldon,that’s odd.
41296,Sheldon,"amy, there were chinese food containers in the trash can."
41298,Sheldon,"no, it’s you. all right, i hear whispering and giggling. now i think i hear kissing."
41300,Sheldon,"please. why would leonard come home early and waste his time kissing penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? yeah, that’s it. i’m catching her in the act. "
41304,Sheldon,"oh, no, i should apologize. uh, i never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
41312,Sheldon,hello.
41315,Sheldon,"okay. by the way, you have something on your shirt."
41333,Sheldon,or a mutant army. it depends on how my kickstarter goes.
41345,Sheldon,"oh, everything i could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
41352,Sheldon,"it’s not hard, one in five. now you know why i’m pouting."
41353,Sheldon,what are you doing? you have to start with the edges.
41354,Sheldon,"yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. and stop wasting time."
41356,Sheldon,"you think you know the answer. but it could be a trick. what if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?"
41362,Sheldon,i thought we were the lightning sharks.
41364,Sheldon,"oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean jan arrah, a member of the legion of superheroes, known as element lad. and then the word he, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather h e, the abbreviation for helium. see where i’m going with this?"
41367,Sheldon,those are map coordinates. got ’em. let’s go.
41372,Sheldon,it’s dirty laundry. you’re up.
41375,Sheldon,"wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt."
41376,Sheldon,"hey, that’s my shirt."
41379,Sheldon,be there in a minute. i just have to pre-soak these.
41380,Sheldon,so what’d you think?
41388,Sheldon,amy has a fondness for the comic strip marmaduke.
41391,Sheldon,"ooh, i think she’s a fan of garfield as well. oh, darn it, now so am i."
41402,Sheldon,"are you sure? every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
41407,Sheldon,"oh, no, i got bored with that. i’m just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon."
41409,Sheldon,"that makes two of us. my new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. come on, one."
41411,Sheldon,"well, why wouldn’t i be?"
41416,Sheldon,why not? hairy fairy.
41422,Sheldon,"well, i was. but that was before howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
41423,Sheldon,"now, don’t be insulted. he just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. "
41426,Sheldon,really?
41435,Sheldon,"oh, we’re fine. as howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries."
41438,Sheldon,"oh, please, i’m your boyfriend. you call me sheldon. that’s right, i am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
41441,Sheldon,"well, i’m done with work, so… ugh!"
41442,Sheldon,"oh, baguettes. yes, i like baguettes. what exactly are you doing?"
41448,Sheldon,"well, now, that."
41453,Sheldon,"i was asking for directions. apparently, there was a communication problem."
41457,Sheldon,but you don’t even know…
41458,Sheldon,"but, now, but in my defence…"
41464,Sheldon,"amy, this isn’t easy to say. all relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. and frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
41469,Sheldon,"can’t listen, zone. also don’t care."
41486,Sheldon,"no. no, no, no, no."
41487,Sheldon,i’ve made a horrible mistake.
41493,Sheldon,"oh, great. now i’m worse than a fraud. i’m practically a biologist."
41495,Sheldon,"no, leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows. i’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
41503,Sheldon,you’re not?
41509,Sheldon,"she’s sick, i knew it. bye."
41523,Sheldon,goody. what’s it say?
41527,Sheldon,"yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
41530,Sheldon,"that’s kind of a stretch. look, when it comes to social skills, i’ve mastered the big three. there’s the coy smile. there’s the friendly chuckle. there’s the vocalization of sympathy. aw. that last one’s tricky, i’m still working on it."
41536,Sheldon,"well, i would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of hollywood stars."
41545,Sheldon,"hello, leonard. oh, hello, arthur. what an odd coincidence that you’re both here."
41562,Sheldon,"oh, thank you. here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
41565,Sheldon,"leonard, let me look in the box."
41590,Sheldon,"oh, not necessarily. i suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in armenia or lebanon."
41596,Sheldon,"yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it."
41603,Sheldon,yes.
41611,Sheldon,"i don’t know the first thing about women, but i would not follow her."
41612,Sheldon,they passed against a nickel defence. they should have run it off-tackle.
41613,Sheldon,my father loved football. he always made me watch it before i was allowed to do my homework.
41616,Sheldon,1993. leon lett blew the game in the final seconds and the dolphins emerged victorious. then i finally got to do my calculus.
41617,Sheldon,so was my dad. and then he did.
41618,Sheldon,no. he died when i was 14.
41620,Sheldon,"no, sir. he did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but i was 11 and my mom said no."
41643,Sheldon,"certainly. although, right now, i’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque."
41646,Sheldon,"that just happened to me. next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow is."
41649,Sheldon,"oh, great, now, i work the controls, i say all aboard. you sit quietly and watch."
41658,Sheldon,"i’m back down to nine friends. make it eight, i’m sick of wolowitz, too."
41662,Sheldon,"that’s it, i’m down to seven friends."
41668,Sheldon,can you believe this guy?
41678,Sheldon,"now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?"
41680,Sheldon,fine.
41681,Sheldon,"you’re telling it wrong. ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. a small town in east texas, where a young genius named…"
41686,Sheldon,"oh, i would, but i’m on my way out."
41699,Sheldon,"oh, boy. i picked the wrong day to wear my good robot t-shirt."
41708,Sheldon,"penny, for the thousandth time, i’m saving myself for someone special. perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. "
41710,Sheldon,i don’t know. i just got back. 
41711,Sheldon,"my mother asked me to get some towels. i took advantage of the vague request and went to bed, bath & beyond.  excuse me, i’m on the phone. so rude."
41712,Sheldon,that’s it. the baby’s here. it’s a boy.
41714,Sheldon,"oh no, no, i’m not going back in there. that baby is so irritating. he has literally been crying his entire life."
41716,Sheldon,"ugh, all right, i’ll go. but from what i’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control."
41726,Sheldon,why is that funny? that’s just unhygienic.
41727,Sheldon,"i don’t think so. i believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. for example, uh, wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. see? the twist is that people don’t usually change. well, they don’t."
41734,Sheldon,i don’t get it.
41736,Sheldon,i’ve never seen this show before and now i’m starting with episode 246? it’s unnatural.
41738,Sheldon,"well, don’t ask me. until i see the prequel, i’m lost."
41740,Sheldon,"this is interesting. apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. "
41742,Sheldon,or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
41750,Sheldon,but i used science to construct the perfect joke.
41751,Sheldon,"so, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. where are you going?"
41752,Sheldon,should i follow you?
41753,Sheldon,"leonard, wait."
41759,Sheldon,why don’t you ask her?
41764,Sheldon,"the university, they think they can do whatever they want. we just have to sit there and take it."
41765,Sheldon,"you work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
41767,Sheldon,"oh, this again? so, penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. how does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
41768,Sheldon,thank you.
41774,Sheldon,please.
41781,Sheldon,"well, have fun."
41783,Sheldon,okay. i’m inside the cern super collider.
41791,Sheldon,"the best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. when i decided i was going to be a physicist, i didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from ms. pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
41796,Sheldon,namaste.
41802,Sheldon,"he does that to me, too. why do we put up with it?"
41811,Sheldon,yay! and they say firefighters are the real heroes.
41815,Sheldon,i can’t believe we wasted all that time on our hulk costumes.
41822,Sheldon,you don’t know that. i still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
41825,Sheldon,"i don’t think that will be necessary for mr. james earl jones. you heard me. the voice of darth vader, the lion king’s dad, and fyi, the guy who says, this is cnn. which also sounds like darth vader."
41826,Sheldon,"simple. earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. i googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. that’s where he’ll be, and that’s where i’m going, and…"
41829,Sheldon,"he is, mr. earl jones, he is."
41831,Sheldon,so messed up.
41835,Sheldon,"oh, james, i could listen to your stories all night."
41836,Sheldon,"hey, los angeles. i’m on a ferris wheel with darth vader. and he’s nicer than you think."
41839,Sheldon,i don’t understand what we’re doing.
41843,Sheldon,"oh, right. well, my friends and i couldn’t get into comic-con this year, and i was trying to start my own convention, and i was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
41844,Sheldon,really?
41865,Sheldon,get out of town.
41866,Sheldon,"do another one, do another one."
41872,Sheldon,what?
41873,Sheldon,in what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? 
41878,Sheldon,"dare i say loco? oh, and, amy, guess what? the conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us."
41897,Sheldon,no one is running anywhere. we’re not getting a dining room table.
41903,Sheldon,"it’s a made-up story, leonard, i don’t even know why you’re talking about it."
41904,Sheldon,"you, how can you say that? you show me one thing in here we can live without."
41905,Sheldon,wait. is this really worth it? we’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
41908,Sheldon,my spot on the couch has a great view of a window. sometimes i can see space battles through it. it’s called a tv.
41910,Sheldon,"so, when can we get rid of it?"
41911,Sheldon,"what about the roommate agreement? it specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the furnishing committee. which only sits on alternate years. yeah, and by the way, it sits over there."
41913,Sheldon,"i have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals."
41919,Sheldon,"no. you’ve opened my eyes to the truth. amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. and that stops now."
41928,Sheldon,"okay. i’m sorry i gave you such a hard time, i just had to be sure."
41936,Sheldon,keep the table. we don’t use that space.
41939,Sheldon,how about penny’s depressing acting career?
41940,Sheldon,she does. 42 minutes in.
41950,Sheldon,really? i was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
41952,Sheldon,"that’s a great idea. and in the spirit of our new arrangement, i will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
41965,Sheldon,"oh, who’s the real astronaut?"
41976,Sheldon,"no, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. i’m not scared at all. oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
41978,Sheldon,i’m sorry for every mean thing i ever did or said to you.
41982,Sheldon,in a minute.
41983,Sheldon,thank you for my bobble head.
41984,Sheldon,it wasn’t easy. was it buzz?
41991,Sheldon,i’m not nearly drunk enough. okay. do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
41992,Sheldon,no. i wanted to surprise her. what am i supposed to say to her after something like this?
41999,Sheldon,"you, aren’t you gonna come with me?"
42008,Sheldon,or what?
42022,Sheldon,"i think what most upsets me about it, mother, is the hypocrisy. doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?"
42023,Sheldon,then why are you doing it?
42026,Sheldon,"my point is that you’re going to need to be careful. you used to be protected by your pre-enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex."
42049,Sheldon,"quick poll, ps4 or xbox one? raj?"
42055,Sheldon,"you know, i’m proud of me, too. i’ve done all my research, i conducted an informal poll, and i’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty i’ve made the right choice."
42067,Sheldon,"on the one hand, the xbox one has a better camera, but the ps4 has a removable hard drive. thoughts?"
42082,Sheldon,you mean your acting career?
42089,Sheldon,"gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"
42090,Sheldon,"i am. yeah, penny pointed out that what i’m going through is essentially a breakup. and according to cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
42098,Sheldon,"oh, i’m in your hands. do a good job and i’ll tell you cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your pms."
42108,Sheldon,"oh, please. if i wanted to take up a fad, i’d get a tramp stamp."
42109,Sheldon,"oh, duchess, look at me. my quantum gravity’s positively loopy."
42113,Sheldon,no more than penny.
42127,Sheldon,"well, now that i’ve given up string theory, i’m struggling to find my next area of focus. so, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?"
42129,Sheldon,it is just so frustrating.
42131,Sheldon,i don’t know. what do you want to do?
42136,Sheldon,all right.
42141,Sheldon,"so, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?"
42142,Sheldon,"great. you know, this is how anything can happen thursday turns into it won’t stop coming up friday."
42148,Sheldon,"okay. ‘cause if i had to pick now, i’d probably go with dark matter because…"
42151,Sheldon,not at all.
42152,Sheldon,"but to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah."
42154,Sheldon,"penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an oreo. or a nutter butter, if you’re in a pinch."
42155,Sheldon,"this is asian fusion. for all you know, there’s a tiny chihuahua in here."
42175,Sheldon,what is it?
42176,Sheldon,professor proton is dead?
42177,Sheldon,what are you doing?
42202,Sheldon,this is the swampland of dagobah. it’s where luke was trained in the ways of the jedi.
42205,Sheldon,i suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
42212,Sheldon,"that’s true. oh, it’s a good thing i had a nap."
42215,Sheldon,that’s nice.
42217,Sheldon,so?
42232,Sheldon,"oh, i’ll make english breakfast tea. they destroyed your culture. that’s close enough. you know, i’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man?"
42237,Sheldon,"an interesting question. well, good night."
42241,Sheldon,sure.
42250,Sheldon,"i’m writing an appeal to the faculty senate, so that i can move on from string theory."
42287,Sheldon,my plan is to stop at malls and buy what i need. it’s called living off the land.
42291,Sheldon,legoland is not the solution to everything. and it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
42309,Sheldon,"well, maybe you should. there’s lots of books called sherlock holmes, and there’s no books called officer hernandez."
42310,Sheldon,any word on my stolen items?
42312,Sheldon,"leonard. oh, i’m so happy to see you."
42317,Sheldon,why would i? that’s where all the cool trains are.
42322,Sheldon,"amy, may i please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
42324,Sheldon,"oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. you idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
42329,Sheldon,i wish i’d never gone on that trip. i feel no better now than when i left.
42332,Sheldon,"indeed. i was the world’s smartest caterpillar. and then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, i’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly."
42333,Sheldon,"yeah, i feel renewed. i’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way."
42335,Sheldon,would you like to see pictures from my trip?
42341,Sheldon,the answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. moving on.
42342,Sheldon,"i’m sensing awkwardness, am i right?"
42347,Sheldon,thank you. i assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
42356,Sheldon,"wrong, just because i enjoyed that one doesn’t mean i always do."
42384,Sheldon,"okay. well, then, uh, first things first. um, are you familiar with the brachistochrone problem?"
34197,Sheldon,and the home of the brave.
42389,Sheldon,what are you doing?
42390,Sheldon,will you stop it. this is a classroom. this is not american bandstand.
34200,Sheldon,"there’s no point, i just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. "
34201,Sheldon,i think this is the place.
42391,Sheldon,"now, where was i? let’s see. oh, yes. over here. you… what are you doing now?"
42394,Sheldon,can’t talk. spitball. probably gonna die.
34206,Sheldon,i want to leave.
34207,Sheldon,what’s the protocol for leaving?
34208,Sheldon,let’s try just walking out.
42398,Sheldon,i told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
34211,Sheldon,you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
34213,Sheldon,"no, it’s true, i did a series of experiments when i was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
34214,Sheldon,"no, that was the result of my work with lasers."
42408,Sheldon,"i missed a number of date nights while i was on my train trip, and i’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the relationship agreement."
34218,Sheldon,hi.
42414,Sheldon,"ignore them, amy. they’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours."
42418,Sheldon,it’s called parallel play.
34229,Sheldon,hi.
34230,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
34231,Sheldon,"well, today we tried masturbating for money."
34232,Sheldon,actually that’s my work.
34233,Sheldon,"yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. that part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the bourne-oppenheimer approximation."
42422,Sheldon,may i have one of your fries?
42423,Sheldon,absolutely not.
42424,Sheldon,it has avocado on it. she’s allergic to avocado. are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die?
42428,Sheldon,"yeah, not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory. that’s pure cooper."
34246,Sheldon,that’s not true. koothrapali and wolowitz come over all the time. 
42438,Sheldon,"no, as long as it bobbles."
34249,Sheldon,that is an antisocial implication.
42443,Sheldon,hello.
42444,Sheldon,"speaking of which, according to a recent study out of oxford university, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
34260,Sheldon,it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
34262,Sheldon,"so, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
42457,Sheldon,no. you’re crazy about me.
34266,Sheldon,"oh, of course."
34271,Sheldon,"event a. a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. event b. we drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
34272,Sheldon,"ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
34274,Sheldon,"oh, right, yes, i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian, arabic and farsi. why can’t she get her own tv."
34276,Sheldon,"you did not break up with joyce kim, she defected to north korea."
42471,Sheldon,great. wait till you hear about our van.
42472,Sheldon,"it would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace."
34281,Sheldon,"leonard, the tv is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
34284,Sheldon,what do you think their combined iq is?
34285,Sheldon,"good thinking, i’ll just be the muscle."
34286,Sheldon,from the intercom.
34288,Sheldon,leonard.
42480,Sheldon,i’m not going to a cabin in the woods. did you see the movie cabin in the woods?
34290,Sheldon,you’re going to have to call her.
34294,Sheldon,and you’re certainly not going to win a nobel prize.
34302,Sheldon,"since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
42496,Sheldon,"wait. whoa, whoa. is placed right?"
34306,Sheldon,"don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women."
42499,Sheldon,"yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!"
42503,Sheldon,"do you know that the word wiener comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna, or wien?"
42504,Sheldon,i don’t think it worked.
34315,Sheldon,"well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
42508,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?"
42515,Sheldon,i think you mean positive punishment. negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. it’s a common mistake.
34328,Sheldon,"excuse me, but i think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
42522,Sheldon,why not?
34338,Sheldon,sssshhhh! penny’s sleeping.
42532,Sheldon,very well.
34341,Sheldon,don’t be ridiculous. i have no peers.
34346,Sheldon,"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
34348,Sheldon,"i have to say, i slept splendidly. granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
34351,Sheldon,you don’t think that crosses a line?
34362,Sheldon,"i am truly sorry for what happened last night, i take full responsibility. and i hope that it won’t colour your opinion of leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, i hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  i did what i could."
34365,Sheldon,check.
42557,Sheldon,"as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature."
34372,Sheldon,good lord!
34373,Sheldon,lock and load. 
34374,Sheldon,i’ve got the sword of azeroth!
42565,Sheldon,good. because i am too hot and tired to go on about how much i hate voyager the tv show.
42567,Sheldon,"you’re not doing it for me. you’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  sheldon’s mine simulation log, entry four. my kit kat has melted. all is lost."
34381,Sheldon,please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
34383,Sheldon,the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
34384,Sheldon,"well, i don’t think you have a shot there. i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs. now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. "
42583,Sheldon,what’d you get? what’d you get?
34394,Sheldon,"leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
42588,Sheldon,"because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?"
34397,Sheldon,"no. no, now that was not my point. my point was, don’t buy a cat. "
34398,Sheldon,"oh, goody, we’re getting a cat. "
42589,Sheldon,"well, now, don’t get defensive. you’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl."
42600,Sheldon,"no. i had a date with a proper education. instead of a tuxedo, i dressed myself in good habits. instead of spiked punch, i enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. instead of dancing in a gym, i shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…"
42604,Sheldon,"we pretend we’re aliens. i’m not the best at reading facial cues, but i’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. now, in the beloved novel hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, an alien named ford prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about earth for the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy."
42605,Sheldon,"my point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism i’ve used many times. i did it the first time i went to see you in a play. you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience. oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up."
34417,Sheldon,but i thought you wanted to cancel?
34418,Sheldon,why would she be expecting me? 
42611,Sheldon,"what, are you sure? it’s my first prom, i want to do it correctly."
34422,Sheldon,"put it on the back burner. anyway, it occurs to me, if i ever did perfect a time machine, i’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
42617,Sheldon,penny implied the same thing. is this true?
34430,Sheldon,do you know there are only eight consonants in the hawaiian language.
34433,Sheldon,an actual real scientist.  how was that?
42625,Sheldon,i really did think you looked pretty.
42627,Sheldon,were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
34436,Sheldon,morning.
34437,Sheldon,"this isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment. "
42634,Sheldon,"of course there is. the mini cooper, ’cause it’s me."
34443,Sheldon,"oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
42636,Sheldon,"hey, how did it go?"
34445,Sheldon,"yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
42637,Sheldon,why would you have surgery?
42638,Sheldon,but you don’t have a life-threatening condition. why would you take the risk of surgery?
42648,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been doing some research and i’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."
34458,Sheldon,"no, thank you. and thank you, ordinary person. hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
34464,Sheldon,that was fun. maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. 
42660,Sheldon,"thank you. and while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season, i can practically guarantee your death."
34469,Sheldon,i think it’s her time of the month. i marked the calendar for future reference. 
42662,Sheldon,"well, thank you. and leonard never lets me have french toast sticks in the car. i can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."
34472,Sheldon,"i read an article about japanese scientists, who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and i thought hey, fish nightlights."
34473,Sheldon,it’s a billion dollar idea. shhhhh!
42666,Sheldon,tell me the truth.
42672,Sheldon,hello.
42673,Sheldon,"oh, stop it. i assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
42676,Sheldon,very well.
42678,Sheldon,"i suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
42679,Sheldon,"oh, this isn’t for leonard, no. amy bought it for me."
42683,Sheldon,"well, i’m not making any promises. not only did leonard take what i feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
34492,Sheldon,why not?
34494,Sheldon,dr gablehouser.
42686,Sheldon,and i’m not? it’s an earthquake. i knew it.
42692,Sheldon,"wow. i don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. well, i’m done speaking to you."
34502,Sheldon,statistically unlikely. 
34507,Sheldon,waitresses don’t yell at you at big boy. 
42706,Sheldon,like when you do a two-hour fourth of july spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
34515,Sheldon,i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
34518,Sheldon,well?
34521,Sheldon,so you’re saying leonard has a girl in there.
42713,Sheldon,"wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
42714,Sheldon,no. this is. stop looking at my legs.
42719,Sheldon,"you heard him, leonard. no, it’s not racist."
42722,Sheldon,if you didn’t press record…
42723,Sheldon,hello.
42726,Sheldon,hmm. you do get me. someone left a comment.
42730,Sheldon, levar burton?
42733,Sheldon,"you know, speaking of attorneys, if i ever needed a lawyer, i would not hire she-hulk."
42734,Sheldon,"yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. between you, me and the wall, i think she’s an affirmative action hire."
42736,Sheldon,why do you hate me?
42737,Sheldon,"well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
34549,Sheldon,"way ahead of you. i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays, and just dropping soup plantation. "
42742,Sheldon,"why should i? she knows that i don’t like christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show."
34551,Sheldon,"terrific, you’ll be happy to know that i plan to come here every tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
34558,Sheldon,"sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  you clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
34559,Sheldon,dancing?
42753,Sheldon,there’s an argument for that. but i want to make sure.
42762,Sheldon,cookies?
34572,Sheldon,"well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with lewis leakey, a great anthropologist. it had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. "
42764,Sheldon,"i can’t believe this. you’re happy, i’m happy. well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… get your hand out of that box."
42767,Sheldon,"well, then it’s settled."
42770,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of middle earth, now including the haradwaith territories."
34586,Sheldon,that’s as far as i’ve gotten.
34589,Sheldon,aren’t you afraid i’ll embarrass you?
34590,Sheldon,"alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors i’m much more suited to being the guy from the faa, analysing wreckage. "
42783,Sheldon,i don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
42784,Sheldon,they have a man there who understands my personal style.
42786,Sheldon,i’ll look them up. son of a biscuit.
42787,Sheldon,"no, it’s not fine. what kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have wi-fi? i’m going to call their corporate office. son of a biscuit."
34596,Sheldon,"yes, well, i’m the doppler effect. "
42789,Sheldon,"boy, double-sixes again. you know, if i hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, i wouldn’t believe it. i wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here."
34599,Sheldon,"oh, snap. so i guess we’ll be leaving now. "
42791,Sheldon,"i don’t know why you’re so surprised. if there’s one thing i know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise."
42795,Sheldon,"uh, well, it’s scary. and sometimes i get the pedals mixed up. but, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. i can’t take that away from you, so what do i do? oh, come on, i’m practically feeding you the answer. i compromise."
34605,Sheldon,"face to face? are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
42797,Sheldon,"i wasn’t done, but go ahead. he said, compromising."
34607,Sheldon,yet another child left behind. 
34612,Sheldon,"let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless. "
42804,Sheldon,i’m not upset. i’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
34616,Sheldon,good. there there was really all i had. 
42811,Sheldon,"there we go, compromising again. we really are the best."
42813,Sheldon,i saw that.
34623,Sheldon,"yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
34625,Sheldon,8:08
42817,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. i’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. see, i’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. uh, i have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. and then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade richard feynman."
42818,Sheldon,"oh, i will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science."
42821,Sheldon,i’m not going to work today. and would you like to know why?
34630,Sheldon,"uh, no. the wheel was a great idea. relativity was a great idea. this is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. "
34632,Sheldon,"this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
42825,Sheldon, penny?
42832,Sheldon,"yeah, i was, but after talking to penny, i realised something. i, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. and second, the reason i may not be progressing in my research is i’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself."
34642,Sheldon,"it’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. "
34643,Sheldon,"hold that thought, leonard, a moment."
42836,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
42838,Sheldon,"very well. and good luck, i’m a pretty laid-back guy."
34647,Sheldon,"so, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. "
34648,Sheldon,no-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. 
42839,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i was aiming for your heart."
42841,Sheldon,perhaps this was a waste of time.
34651,Sheldon,i suggest no liquids after 11pm. 
42848,Sheldon,yes.
42850,Sheldon,"stop fighting me on the premise. it’s scientifically valid. i’m going to advance propositions, i just want you to challenge me."
34662,Sheldon,i’m sheldon.
42856,Sheldon,ladies.
42860,Sheldon,"you talk about if werewolves can swim? see, leonard says yes, but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. what do you think?"
34674,Sheldon,"and divide it how, i’m telling you we cannot do this without wolowitz. "
34676,Sheldon,"exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
42871,Sheldon,"there you go, perfect."
42872,Sheldon,"but after months of struggling, i’m finally making progress."
34681,Sheldon,"yes. penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team. i don’t think i need to tell you what an honour this is. "
34683,Sheldon,you go dancing every wednesday.
34688,Sheldon,"it’s the chinese restaurant all over again. i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
34691,Sheldon,"no, i’m going to ask him to choose between sex and halo 3. as far as i know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. "
42883,Sheldon,"no, i don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me."
34695,Sheldon,"i can’t shoot now, i’m cloaking."
42888,Sheldon,hmm.
34697,Sheldon,we said no tanks.
34700,Sheldon,"the online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable id, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable id takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare. "
42892,Sheldon,i like it. i think you’re on to something.
42897,Sheldon,"oh, i did more than work out all the math. i wrote a paper."
42898,Sheldon,i wrote a paper on our idea.
34708,Sheldon,i suggest you go through with it.
42900,Sheldon,"well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright."
42905,Sheldon,"yes, we did, my friend."
34720,Sheldon,and now we’ll never know. 
42912,Sheldon,who wrote that?
42917,Sheldon,"you mess with the bull, you get the horns. i’m about to show this guy just how horny i can be."
42919,Sheldon,"my good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. in fact, we are experts in our fields. and while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. and later tonight, your mother."
34737,Sheldon,what?
42936,Sheldon,how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
42937,Sheldon,who cares? he stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
34746,Sheldon,"and boring, her words. "
34747,Sheldon,"okay, well, good night."
34748,Sheldon,"we ate. she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing i didn’t already know, and i came home. "
42940,Sheldon,"what do you want, barry?"
34750,Sheldon,"look at me, look at me, i’ve got goosebumps. "
42942,Sheldon,since when do you help out barry kripke?
34754,Sheldon,you may want to put on slacks. 
34755,Sheldon,"you know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. "
42948,Sheldon,i’m mad at amy.
42955,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re getting creative."
42956,Sheldon,"kripke, you know, of all the people, barry kripke. i’m so… are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?"
42957,Sheldon,"oh, give me that. just out of curiosity, if i were to let something go, how would i do that?"
34767,Sheldon,if i’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is. 
42959,Sheldon,the spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with barry kripke. that didn’t help at all.
42962,Sheldon,okay.
34771,Sheldon,oh dear god! 
42963,Sheldon,but i just got this pen. it’s got my initials on it and everything. look.
42964,Sheldon,i may have a better way that you can teach me.
42965,Sheldon,what if i told you that over the past few months amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
34775,Sheldon,oh. i hadn’t thought about it like that. i wonder if i’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. 
42966,Sheldon,are you sure?
34778,Sheldon,a powerful laxative. 
34781,Sheldon,"in what words then, exactly"
42973,Sheldon,penny?
34784,Sheldon,have fun presenting my lucky hunch. 
42979,Sheldon,"oh, i can help you with that. imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."
34789,Sheldon,"and i’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me. "
42982,Sheldon,"when i lost my own father, i didn’t have any friends to help me through it. you do."
34791,Sheldon,"oh, i see, was the apple falling on newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?"
42983,Sheldon,"i didn’t care for her yelling. but now that i’m not going to hear it again, i’m sad."
42984,Sheldon,it won’t be as good.
34794,Sheldon,"as i have explained repeatedly, unlike you, i don’t need validation from lesser minds. no offence. "
42990,Sheldon,yes.
42992,Sheldon,"just out of curiosity, penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to lake geneva, wisconsin for gary con? it’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of gary gygax, the co-creator of dungeons and dragons."
34801,Sheldon,so it was working.
34809,Sheldon,"okay, then riddle me this. assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor, why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
34811,Sheldon,", too late, i win. "
43003,Sheldon,you didn’t mention leonard.
43004,Sheldon,"i don’t think so. leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing."
34814,Sheldon,i have a conclusion based on an observation.
34815,Sheldon,i think i know.
43005,Sheldon,"uh, i wake up. uh, i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup. uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
34817,Sheldon,you just lied to penny.
43008,Sheldon,i don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
34828,Sheldon,you could have told her the truth.
43020,Sheldon,thank you.
34830,Sheldon,then i suppose you could have agreed to go. 
43021,Sheldon,you’re making it difficult to love you right now.
43025,Sheldon,we’re not supposed to talk during this part.
43028,Sheldon,"of course you are, i’m warm and soothing. i’m like a human bowl of tomato soup."
34840,Sheldon, good morning.
43034,Sheldon,"no, it wasn’t. uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. i think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and i’m not in love with you. and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."
34843,Sheldon,"yes, well, he lied."
34846,Sheldon,to help you. 
34847,Sheldon,"she was going to see through your lie eventually, so i told her that you were lying to protect me. "
43043,Sheldon,sarcasm?
34854,Sheldon,"ah, because it’s in long beach, and i don’t drive. "
43048,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. oh, dear lord."
43050,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. he kind of looks like a jerk. how about this one?"
34862,Sheldon,"okay, sure. i don’t see a problem with that. "
43054,Sheldon,would you have approved?
34866,Sheldon,"no, no, no, leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy."
34873,Sheldon,"excuse me, we just went over this. as the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
34875,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard, this is toby loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at mit."
43070,Sheldon,"amy. oh, why didn’t i give her sleepy time tea? amy, wait. getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
43071,Sheldon,do you want me to withdraw my application?
34880,Sheldon,"but we did convince him to leave the motel. come say hello. leo, this is penny, our friend and neighbour."
34886,Sheldon,checkmate.
34897,Sheldon,i’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. 
43089,Sheldon,"well, i don’t know, we’re all groot? just tell me."
43091,Sheldon,"oh, that kid. poor leonard."
43096,Sheldon,"okay, i have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it."
34908,Sheldon,at six-thirty in the morning? 
43104,Sheldon,"you know, you’re right. yeah. you know, it’s like when stan lee and steve ditko created spider-man. stan lee may get all the credit, but steve ditko knows he was just as important. even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies. and. and he’s far richer. and he’s a household name, you know? whereas, you know, you say ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes dits."
43106,Sheldon, leonard?
43109,Sheldon,he said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
34918,Sheldon,in the lab?
43112,Sheldon,"oh. that’s just as well. they had me on hold for 20 minutes and i hung up.  leonard? also, wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so i’m ready whenever you are."
34922,Sheldon,you’re a carrier. all these people here are doomed. you’re doomed! 
34924,Sheldon,"penny, i have an iq of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home i would have thought of it?"
34929,Sheldon,thanks for bringing me home. 
34934,Sheldon,"well, once. when i was fifteen, and spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany."
43127,Sheldon,"leonard, please. his mother just died."
43129,Sheldon,"leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way i did."
34938,Sheldon,"based on what happened next, i assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
43138,Sheldon,"okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physics department? i’ll have fries with that. because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences."
43139,Sheldon,"yeah, i think so. i just restocked the old prk."
34952,Sheldon,i’m very congested. 
43144,Sheldon,will you please play the game? i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
34955,Sheldon,here’s the problem with teleportation.
34960,Sheldon,"not bad, i myself started graduate school at fourteen."
34961,Sheldon,"excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
34964,Sheldon,"he’s not wrong. alright, and this is my office."
43156,Sheldon,aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
43157,Sheldon,"seems a little confrontational, but all right. you know, we won’t be very far from skywalker ranch."
34967,Sheldon,"keen observation, goodbye. "
43158,Sheldon,why not?
43159,Sheldon,"yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. hoth was in the middle of nowhere. that’s code, leonard. he wants us to drop in."
43174,Sheldon,"oh, you are killing me."
43176,Sheldon,"shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man."
43178,Sheldon,do you think they’re gonna call the police?
43179,Sheldon,"oh, i think that’s below the pay grade of an imperial officer. stormtroopers are really the ones who…"
43181,Sheldon,but why are you here?
43182,Sheldon,"excuse me. leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
34992,Sheldon,i just came by to say hello.
43187,Sheldon,"well, not only did we go to skywalker ranch, we got in. and no one we know can say that. and for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser."
43190,Sheldon,that’s amazing.
43195,Sheldon,"i guess news travels fast. it’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman, and i wasn’t included."
35006,Sheldon,"we’ll make it nice, put out a spread. "
35009,Sheldon,we could call it nuevo cherusalem. 
43205,Sheldon,"hey, look at that. even in your example, you’re all by yourself."
43207,Sheldon,it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. i hated that so much.
43211,Sheldon,"yes, oh, but enter through the side. batman is a load-bearing blanket."
43215,Sheldon,mm-hmm.
35024,Sheldon,he does. 
43218,Sheldon,"well, wait. what if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
43220,Sheldon,"very well. i will agree to a family-friendly, g-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
43222,Sheldon,do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
43225,Sheldon,"well, leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?"
35038,Sheldon,army ants. 
43230,Sheldon,"there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. j-a-m-e-s, c-l-e-r-k space m-a-x-w-e-l-l, and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o, a-m-e-s…"
35041,Sheldon,what?
43235,Sheldon,excellent.
35044,Sheldon,why?
43240,Sheldon,"how nice. here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
35049,Sheldon,"actually, i don’t need a team, i could easily defeat you single-handedly. but the rules require four, so may i introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. and what about your team? what rat have you recruited to the ss sinking ship?"
43243,Sheldon,"hmm. i know exactly what you should do. unfortunately, i cannot tell you."
43244,Sheldon,"i’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. earlier today, it was pointed out to me that i tend to force my ideas on people."
35055,Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
43249,Sheldon,"all right, then. you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
43251,Sheldon,"no, it’s the wise man. that’s why he’s called the wise man. you know how i know that? i’m the wise man."
35062,Sheldon,well it’s not what he said.
35063,Sheldon,i want a different question.
43257,Sheldon,certainly.
43261,Sheldon,"building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on colorado."
43263,Sheldon,"you’re out, and you’re out. i win. who wants pizza?"
43264,Sheldon,"yeah, i never cared for that. it’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
35078,Sheldon,turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. it’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. 
35080,Sheldon,you bid $800.
43272,Sheldon,"no, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?"
43273,Sheldon,"if your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed."
35085,Sheldon,"in a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
43277,Sheldon,and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
43279,Sheldon,all right.
43285,Sheldon,"oh. very well. re-initiating calibration sequence. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. it’s a good thing i didn’t send that letter."
43286,Sheldon,yay.
35098,Sheldon,no. 
43290,Sheldon,"you know what they all do, right?"
35101,Sheldon,"oh, i have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
35106,Sheldon,"leonard, it’s two in the morning. "
43298,Sheldon,i think metaphorically. but he was in the bathroom for a while.
35111,Sheldon,are you upset about something? 
43305,Sheldon,check.
35114,Sheldon,"oh, wait. did you want to talk about what’s bothering you? "
35115,Sheldon,"wow, i’m on fire tonight. "
35118,Sheldon,well of course they’re movies. were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? that’s absurd. 
43310,Sheldon,"initiate landing sequence. initiate landing sequence. hey, the camera’s working. oh, look, it’s me."
35121,Sheldon,well is that really necessary. if you need money you can always sell blood. and semen. 
43317,Sheldon,"oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. it describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
35127,Sheldon,"who cares, as long as you pick me. "
43319,Sheldon,"listen, leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. can you please keep the bible babble to yourself while she’s here?"
35133,Sheldon,"oh no, morlocks? eat him, eat him. aaaaargh.  leonard!!!!!!!!"
43325,Sheldon,"ooh, good question. everyone loves stories about sheldon cooper, boy genius."
43329,Sheldon,i was a handful.
35140,Sheldon,rajesh. 
35143,Sheldon,"they were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. "
43340,Sheldon,"okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. how dare you."
43341,Sheldon,it is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
35150,Sheldon,is that what that was? i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. 
43342,Sheldon,"oh, it’s all right. she’ll forgive you. she has to or she goes to hell."
35153,Sheldon,"excuse me, can i interject something. i’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? "
43347,Sheldon,i taught her that.
35156,Sheldon,"hmmm? she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. it’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. "
43348,Sheldon,i know. do you think i should start watching the flash tv show?
43352,Sheldon,excuse me. starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. i’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
43353,Sheldon,"irony’s not really my strong suit. but i have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try."
35164,Sheldon,"you’re right. if someone wants to get at missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me. "
35168,Sheldon,"now that leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. "
35169,Sheldon,how so?
35170,Sheldon,"in principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need i remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
35172,Sheldon,am i? here. eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. 
35175,Sheldon,"truthfully, i’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential."
43372,Sheldon,okay.
35182,Sheldon,"you donate eggs. we will place them in cryogenic storage. i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. "
43379,Sheldon,you still didn’t pick a date.
43380,Sheldon,i’m sorry i’ve upset you. i shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
43383,Sheldon,"so you’re never getting married? it’s his whining, isn’t it?"
35199,Sheldon,"well alright, but i don’t see this as a promising endeavour."
43404,Sheldon,"your marriage is causing her pain? yeah, great, i take it back. go ahead and do it. yay for love."
43406,Sheldon,"when last we spoke, you said you needed time."
35215,Sheldon,oh. fair enough. 
35219,Sheldon,is it the geometry that makes it fun.
43413,Sheldon,"your friends? well, i think you mean my friends. and why wasn’t i invited to this?"
43414,Sheldon,we make everyone feel awkward. that’s our thing.
43418,Sheldon,"well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
35227,Sheldon,"on my twelfth birthday i really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, i could separate radioactive isotopes. "
35229,Sheldon,what twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? 
43423,Sheldon,"well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date."
43425,Sheldon,i just wanted to let you know that you can remove amy from your nightly prayers. unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
43428,Sheldon,it’s over for me. i’m done with women. like when i swore off pop rocks. they both hurt you on purpose.
43429,Sheldon,are you going to say it’s all part of god’s plan?
35243,Sheldon,wo de ming zi shi sheldon. 
35247,Sheldon,mai du lui tsa.
43448,Sheldon,would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
35258,Sheldon,"show me your citrus peels. gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. show me your citrus peels. gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. show me your…"
43450,Sheldon,and you know why? ‘cause you’re a man. the champagne of genders.
43452,Sheldon,you know what? she was kind of an honorary man. she had a penis made of science.
35266,Sheldon,"oh, i wish it were that simple. you see, i don’t spend much time here and so i’ve never really chosen a place to sit. "
35268,Sheldon,"no, no, that’s crazy. you go ahead and talk while i figure it out. "
43460,Sheldon,"well, hello to you, too."
43461,Sheldon,"i understand we’re no longer a couple, but i would like to remind you that we made a baby together."
43462,Sheldon,a precocious little internet show known as fun with flags.
43463,Sheldon,great. see you in about half an hour.
43466,Sheldon,"you must be thinking about donny and marie, ’cause you and i are clearly talking about sonny and cher."
35278,Sheldon,"no. that’s mrs grossinger. and she doesn’t have a cat, she has a mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
43470,Sheldon,wait. don’t you want to go through it to make sure i haven’t forgotten anything?
35281,Sheldon,"just like schrodinger’s cat, your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. it is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is. "
43481,Sheldon,and we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
43482,Sheldon,yes. and that’s coming from me.
35292,Sheldon,schrodinger’s cat.
43486,Sheldon,"i don’t know why you’re so surprised. i watch movies, i see what people do."
43489,Sheldon,is there a problem?
35301,Sheldon,well i assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? because i’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
43493,Sheldon,would you pass the mustard?
43494,Sheldon,is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
35304,Sheldon,that depends.
43496,Sheldon,"well, i’d hardly call this kidnapping. where’s the blindfold? where’s the duct tape? where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and i try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before i can trace it and then i say i’m getting too old for this crud?"
35306,Sheldon,do you speak klingon? 
43498,Sheldon,"oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?"
43502,Sheldon,no.
43503,Sheldon,"yeah, and talked about physics with them."
35312,Sheldon,"well i’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that i could choose whether or not i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. you can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. "
43505,Sheldon,"uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside."
35316,Sheldon,"interesting. see, one more question, and perhaps i should have led with this, when did we become friends? "
35317,Sheldon,"i.e, i couldn’t become green lantern unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, i could be batman."
35319,Sheldon,"why are you asking me, i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me, nor do i have any method of learning such things.  "
43512,Sheldon,"i usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. however, even i must admit feeling richard feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
43517,Sheldon,"if i see one scorpion, i am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down."
43519,Sheldon,"everybody hold on. let’s take this problem one step at a time. first, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. and the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work."
43524,Sheldon,we do?
43525,Sheldon,that’s not very nice.
43528,Sheldon,"all right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite."
35338,Sheldon,don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
35339,Sheldon,"i can’t believe i didn’t bring my gieger counter. you know, i had it on my bed and i didn’t pack it. "
35343,Sheldon,i’ve never slept on an air mattress before. no lumbar support whatsoever. 
35350,Sheldon,"oh, i forgot about lee meriwether."
35351,Sheldon,"that makes halle berry my fifth favourite catwoman. there’s julie newmar, michelle pfieffer, eartha kitt, lee meriwether…"
43542,Sheldon,perhaps i could find someone better than leonard. someone i can rub in his face. chris pratt’s all the rage right now. i wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
35353,Sheldon,"but she’s not my favourite of the x-men, in order that would be wolverine, cyclops, oh wait, i forgot professor x. professor x, wolverine, cyclops, iceman, then storm, angel, the beast, oh wait, nightcrawler. professor x, nightcrawler, wolverine, cyclops, iceman, then storm, angel…."
35354,Sheldon,"hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud. "
35355,Sheldon,i’m ba-ack!
43543,Sheldon,"gandalf, but he’s a smoker."
43546,Sheldon,"no, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. all right. oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. in which case, all glory to the hive queen. all right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates."
43547,Sheldon,let me help you. l. e. o. n.
43550,Sheldon,looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
35360,Sheldon,i’m batman. shhhhh!
35361,Sheldon,"okay, i’ll tell you, but you can’t tell leonard. "
43552,Sheldon,"i was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then i realized what i want to ask you is why is there a band-aid on your forearm, but then i realized what i really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
35363,Sheldon,i drank milk that tasted funny. 
43557,Sheldon,"fine, then i was like pinocchio before that jerk geppetto went and made him a real boy."
35369,Sheldon,renaissance fair? more of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
43565,Sheldon,"how can you say that? amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too."
43567,Sheldon,but mostly here.
35376,Sheldon,"her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
43568,Sheldon,"you can. i’m happy when you come home. and i’m scared of fireworks. by the way, on july fourth, we’re all sleeping here."
35378,Sheldon,you know how i know we’re not in the matrix?
43570,Sheldon,is that the prototype drive system for the high-g rover?
35381,Sheldon,"well, if you’ll excuse me, i’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. yeah, you heard me."
35382,Sheldon,great news. my mom sent me my old nintendo 64.
35383,Sheldon,"you know what this means, don’t you? break out the red bull, it’s time to rock mario old school."
43576,Sheldon,"or worse, up."
43577,Sheldon,"and as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. it would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."
43578,Sheldon,"ah, touché."
35389,Sheldon,you want me to leave the apartment?
43584,Sheldon,"excuse me, barry?"
35393,Sheldon,playing super mario on a poorly coded nintendo 64 emulator.
35405,Sheldon,i have to make pee-pee.
43603,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous.
35413,Sheldon,"alright, let’s say i go to dinner alone. and during the meal i have to use the rest room. how do i know someone’s not touching my food?"
43612,Sheldon,and kind of delicious. i wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
35422,Sheldon,"no, that response is unacceptable to me."
35424,Sheldon,i’m sorry.
35425,Sheldon,you continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
35429,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my friend. and friends support their friends, apparently. so i am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie."
43621,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve got terrible news."
35431,Sheldon,"i’m listening, amuse me."
43624,Sheldon,that kind of stinks? why aren’t you more upset? did i soften the blow too much? because this here is more like a picasso painting.
43629,Sheldon,but you won’t need much for that.
43632,Sheldon,he could’ve softened the blow.
43636,Sheldon,four questions. there answer’s four.
35446,Sheldon,"i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. but returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
43638,Sheldon,"really? you know i don’t like buying things at night. january 7th, 2009, i went to the ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up cracklin’ oat bran for the morning and what did i see?"
43641,Sheldon,of course i do. i don’t want that swedish team scooping us.
35453,Sheldon,"afk. i’m playing age of conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e. howard’s conan the barbarian."
35454,Sheldon,"sheldor, back online."
35455,Sheldon,afk. away from keyboard.
43648,Sheldon,aren’t you just made of sugar.
43649,Sheldon,"oh, of course. an nondescript, white panel van. you may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van."
35458,Sheldon,now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
35459,Sheldon,"just click on them. congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
43651,Sheldon,"wait, hold on, hold on. how do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?"
43652,Sheldon,exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. you give us the helium first.
35462,Sheldon,"well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
35468,Sheldon,"no, no, no, it’s… oh for god’s sakes, gimme. "
35472,Sheldon,"danger, danger."
35476,Sheldon,i spilled grape juice.
43669,Sheldon,"well, you can’t be sure of that. what if the helium dealer rats us out? what if kripke asks where we got it? what if the university checks my family tree and finds out i don’t have an uncle harvey?"
43674,Sheldon,"that’s true. there’s the u.s. air force, u.s. department of defence, u.s. navy, you and i are going to jail."
35484,Sheldon,"god, no."
43676,Sheldon,"he has glasses and i’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison."
35488,Sheldon,"well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. if you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
43680,Sheldon,"finally, something breaks our way."
35491,Sheldon,yes.
35493,Sheldon,"oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, i’m too tired to do this."
35499,Sheldon,zip it pip it. can i have your phone number?
35505,Sheldon,frenzy stance.
43700,Sheldon,when we got the security camera.
43701,Sheldon,"aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
35514,Sheldon,"well, what passes for science on dating sites. they claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
43706,Sheldon,"all right then. see? just my valuables. my passport, uh, my will."
35516,Sheldon,"tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
35517,Sheldon,i’m surprised you struck out with penny. apparently she’s a big old five.
35518,Sheldon,"oh, good, you got my note. penny, i’d like you to meet tom, uh, penny, this is tom, tom, may i present penny."
43708,Sheldon,oh. that is an engagement ring that i was going to give my girlfriend amy.
35520,Sheldon,"but wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
43709,Sheldon,"no, no. this has been in my family for generations. except for a short time when comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it."
35526,Sheldon,i’m confused. was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
35527,Sheldon,what people?
35528,Sheldon,"yeah, but exactly who are these people? what are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
35532,Sheldon,"apologise, for what?"
35533,Sheldon,i sense you’re trying to tell me something.
43724,Sheldon,"well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. as the vulcans say, kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish du stau."
35535,Sheldon,"how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? when i was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
43725,Sheldon,"well, this is ridiculous. being upset about amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. if i want to resolve this situation, then i need to take action."
35538,Sheldon,but i’m not.
35539,Sheldon,"fine, what do you want me to do?"
35540,Sheldon,dr gablehauser.
35541,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 nq sub 17."
43731,Sheldon,"yeah, i am indeed. i have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about amy, it is time that i find myself a new female companion."
35543,Sheldon,"he gets a new office, i can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?"
43733,Sheldon,"no, i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyper-focus on my work again."
43735,Sheldon,"ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. you know what? you eat it. you’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like."
43741,Sheldon,"all right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. now, chop-chop."
43747,Sheldon,"oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates."
43756,Sheldon,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. you know, probably half that if i break out the old cow eyes."
35565,Sheldon,"yes, lucky."
35566,Sheldon,"while others mourned lucky, i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
35569,Sheldon,"irrelevant. see, i was studying recombinant dna technology and i was confident i could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
35570,Sheldon,"my point is, if koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
35571,Sheldon,"that’s one option, but who has the time? but consider this, the japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at disney, next thing you know, we’re playing halo with a multi-lingual abraham lincoln."
43761,Sheldon,all right. can i help you?
35573,Sheldon,he should share our love of technology.
43764,Sheldon,"and just like that, you’re a klingon-sanskrit junkie."
35576,Sheldon,"oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up."
43768,Sheldon,"well, howard, what about you?"
35578,Sheldon,then you can drive. let’s go.
43770,Sheldon,"no. they’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year i finally touch a starfish. anyway, i wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like."
43772,Sheldon,you don’t think that will be awkward?
43773,Sheldon,"very well, then. i’ll see you on thanksgiving morning."
35585,Sheldon, penny…
35587,Sheldon,"no, wait. you have to drive me to work."
43785,Sheldon,very well. i know you’ve been seeing other men. have you had coitus with any of them?
35595,Sheldon,"well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
43788,Sheldon,just a few.
35601,Sheldon,leonard takes los robles avenue.
43794,Sheldon,"you know, for a thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad."
35603,Sheldon,"the answer’s tricky. it’s second street. you see, you’d think it would be first street, but in most towns, first street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like main street, broad street, michigan avenue. leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. we also play games. would you like to play one?"
43796,Sheldon,oh. would you care to play an ocean-themed game i invented?
35607,Sheldon,okay. i’ll give it a shot. 
35609,Sheldon,"good, perfect timing."
43802,Sheldon,"well, i’d befriend spongebob but he’s not real, so i can’t do that, can i?"
35612,Sheldon,penny. but i sense that’s no longer an option.
43809,Sheldon,"well, i can’t take all the credit. it was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."
43810,Sheldon,oh. i thought we were just friends.
35619,Sheldon,good morning.
43813,Sheldon,"sheldon cooper’s descent into madness, day two. it’s 2:25 a.m., and i feel the urge to urinate. my normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here i am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. it’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. i suppose i should pee while i still know what a toilet is."
43815,Sheldon,"are you sure? sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise."
35625,Sheldon,and radio shack.
35628,Sheldon,i was otherwise engaged.
35629,Sheldon,examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
35631,Sheldon,oh.
43823,Sheldon,"this is penny. she is your friend. if she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. you probably paid for it, anyway."
35633,Sheldon,yes?
43828,Sheldon,"bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. this song is never going to stop. have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
35637,Sheldon,"no, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
35639,Sheldon,but i’m not done. i have many additional concerns about these questions.
43834,Sheldon,of course. i’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… i know why the song was in my head.
43836,Sheldon,"it’s about how she made my life better. consider the lyrics. i was living like half a man. then i couldn’t love, but now i can. more soul than i ever had. i love the way you soften my life.”"
43838,Sheldon, amy?
35647,Sheldon,what if a simulated van rear-ends me?
43841,Sheldon,"amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, i really want to be your boyfriend."
35650,Sheldon,"i don’t know. i was on the pasadena freeway, i missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
35652,Sheldon,"remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed."
43844,Sheldon,what?
43846,Sheldon,"all right, this goes against everything i stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. lord, this is sheldon cooper. you’re good friends with my mom. i know i’ve spent my life denying that you exist."
43848,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
35657,Sheldon,"well, no, no, i’m not going to go so far as to say that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a homo novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. but i am convinced that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because i’m not meant to."
43852,Sheldon,"arthur, what brings you back?"
35665,Sheldon,"oh, yeah? well… you’re a mean person."
35668,Sheldon,the fact is i’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
35669,Sheldon,it’s what i do.
35676,Sheldon,yes. apparently i’m getting a free dinner.
35681,Sheldon,not in these pants.
43874,Sheldon,"well, amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so i was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the wisconsin sheep and wool festival."
43876,Sheldon,that i have coitus with her.
43877,Sheldon,"which do you think she’d prefer? because i checked the sheep and wool festival web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left."
43878,Sheldon,"intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but i’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time."
43881,Sheldon,"i suppose you’re here because i’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and i’ve never done that before."
35691,Sheldon,"yes, i am. it’s wednesday. wednesday’s halo night.</i>"
43884,Sheldon,i think they say junk.
35694,Sheldon,you heard her. how can i argue with me?
35698,Sheldon,drat.
43890,Sheldon,"hello. sorry i’m late. i also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and i chased it for a while."
35702,Sheldon,i see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
35708,Sheldon,"yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
43905,Sheldon,"well, i enjoyed that more than i thought i would."
43913,Sheldon,all right. enjoy the neurobiology conference.
35724,Sheldon,get out!
43916,Sheldon,"bye. oh, good news, gentlemen. amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means i’m available to be entertained, hmm. as today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their sheld-on?"
35731,Sheldon,i’m just so… full.
35734,Sheldon,what’s wrong with your tv?
43926,Sheldon,hmm. what are you doing now?
43929,Sheldon,"yep, i’m on it. hey, look at that, an indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
35738,Sheldon,"all right, boggle warriors, kapla’!"
43931,Sheldon,"but, look, an optical transient."
43935,Sheldon,maybe it’s a new planet.
35746,Sheldon,extra breading?
43938,Sheldon,that’s it? how common. that’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
35749,Sheldon,vociferously?
35751,Sheldon,"oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?"
35753,Sheldon,but you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
43945,Sheldon,"nah, you’re right, that’s dumb."
35755,Sheldon,who touched my…
35758,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, but that is your second strike."
43950,Sheldon,i haven’t settled on anything yet.
43953,Sheldon,"i like it. yeah, we’ll take the a-m from amy and, uh, the y from emily."
35762,Sheldon,the photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
43955,Sheldon,good news. you’re an asteroid.
35767,Sheldon,"leonard, she’s in my spot."
35770,Sheldon,"wait. excuse me. you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
35771,Sheldon,why?
43962,Sheldon,i’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
35773,Sheldon,thank you.
35774,Sheldon,oh! hello.
43965,Sheldon,"penny, rub vicks on my chest."
43966,Sheldon,"oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me."
35784,Sheldon,apologize.
43977,Sheldon,you stayed in michigan all week to avoid being around me?
43978,Sheldon,"you know, i’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. when penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly i could barely hear the television."
35787,Sheldon,"i am meeting you halfway, i’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things."
35788,Sheldon,"i had no choice, leonard, she ruined laundry night."
35789,Sheldon,mwah-ha-ha.
35792,Sheldon," i am very, very sorry for what i have done. here’s your laundry, i rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished."
35793,Sheldon,thank you.
35796,Sheldon,just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
43992,Sheldon,"fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
35802,Sheldon,"oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
43994,Sheldon,"fine. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him. hey, i felt a little something. let me try again. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him. i was mean to him. he must have felt terrible. oh, now i feel terrible. neat."
43998,Sheldon,"hey, if you didn’t know bruce willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. okay. here it comes. you tried to take care of me when i was sick, and i was mean to you. there’s no excuse for that. and i’m truly sorry."
35807,Sheldon,"defcon 5? well, there’s no need to rush."
35808,Sheldon,defcon 5 means no danger. defcon 1 is a crisis.
35809,Sheldon,"okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. secondly, star trek i is orders-of-magnitude worse than star trek v."
44002,Sheldon,"well, all right. what if i apologize to all of them?"
44006,Sheldon,"no, no, no, wait. i’m not done. allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of brenda lee’s i’m sorry played on the pan flute."
35816,Sheldon,"oh, how nice. maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
35819,Sheldon,snap what?
35820,Sheldon,why wasn’t that plan a?
35827,Sheldon,"leonard, a moment."
35828,Sheldon,"if someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should i say?"
44022,Sheldon,all i know is after the fight i went to emily’s to smooth…
44023,Sheldon,"look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. that is some top-shelf empathy. hey, well, we should start a club."
35832,Sheldon,this would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
35833,Sheldon,see? why don’t i believe you?
44024,Sheldon,"that is true. well, i suppose i should apologize again."
44027,Sheldon,aha.
44030,Sheldon,"emily, as i’m sure you know, i’m considered an odd fellow. but what you don’t know is that, while i often say the wrong thing, in my heart i mean well. i think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? and we all think that you can do better than koothrappali."
44036,Sheldon,are you relieved that you and raj were able to patch things up?
44037,Sheldon,"here’s a fun postal fact. the inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. so, if you broke my right thumb, that’s pasadena city police. but if you broke my left thumb, that’s the fbi."
35846,Sheldon,"all right, but i’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
44038,Sheldon,"oh, i got a letter from my meemaw. umm. smell this."
35850,Sheldon,good. what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
35858,Sheldon,"well, this is very pleasant."
44056,Sheldon,"if i did, would i find any?"
35865,Sheldon,really? that’s where i was born!
35868,Sheldon,"no, i didn’t try, i succeeded. in fact, i was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, snowball, before he caught fire. it led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner."
35872,Sheldon,"you’re kirk, i’m spock, wolowitz is scotty, koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got mccoy."
35876,Sheldon,"my apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. leonard, you want to slide over one?"
35881,Sheldon,"i’m afraid i can’t allow that. pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a, you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command."
35882,Sheldon,give me one good reason why not.
44074,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. it was quite tense. so here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?"
44078,Sheldon,"oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. i always looked up to you and pop-pop. i, i know what a challenging man he could be, but i saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
44080,Sheldon,well…
44086,Sheldon,not a clue. raj?
44098,Sheldon,"please, all comments and questions should be flag-related."
35907,Sheldon,"go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
44100,Sheldon,"speaking of ending relationships, when british honduras became belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and i would like to hang myself from that tree."
44104,Sheldon,"fine. if you insist on making me a part of this, yes, i knowledge how painful they can be. however, pain has an evolutionary purpose. it provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us."
44107,Sheldon,"when, when we were apart, i learned how important you are to me. and i realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…"
35916,Sheldon,"well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. i just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
44108,Sheldon,i stand corrected. fun.
35921,Sheldon,"well, you’re the doctor, but i am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
35922,Sheldon,is it a high-frequency whistle?
44118,Sheldon,"oh, really? okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
44121,Sheldon,"oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. you know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. i have two doctorates, i still had to go in the sink."
35931,Sheldon,"you initialed it. see? l.h., l.h., l.h."
44126,Sheldon,this place is terrific. why. why have we never been here before?
35936,Sheldon,i heard you ask it over and over. how is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
35940,Sheldon,really? i have never once been invited to have cereal with mrs. vartabedian.
44133,Sheldon,and stronger. who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
35944,Sheldon,do i have to pull out the paperwork again?
35946,Sheldon,"my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. she thought if i failed at theoretical physics that i should have a trade to fall back on. and by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
44141,Sheldon,what is it?
35950,Sheldon,can i at least have the upper gi? i already drank the barium!
35954,Sheldon,"your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. it is well established superman cleans his uniform by flying into earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
44146,Sheldon,"fine. as you know, i have a twin sister with whom i obviously share a birthday. every year we’d have a party. no one i invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me."
35958,Sheldon,superman would have taken his uniform to a kandorian dry cleaner before he left the bottle.
44153,Sheldon,"well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. i don’t need my dessert yelling at me."
44159,Sheldon,"no, i just, i got a little light-headed."
35983,Sheldon,"mmm, great news, leonard, i’ve solved my penny gift dilemma."
44177,Sheldon,thank you.
35986,Sheldon,"thank you, that’s very gracious.     gentlemen."
44179,Sheldon,professor hawking.
35990,Sheldon,i possess the dna of leonard nimoy?!
44183,Sheldon,i’ve never applied for a patent before. i wanted to make a good impression.
35993,Sheldon,"i know! it’s not enough, is it? here."
36002,Sheldon,"leonard, i believe it is. this is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. also, i’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
44197,Sheldon,"i’ll say it looks good. it’s in my proprietary font, shelvetica."
36012,Sheldon,"no, leonard. for years, merciless thugs like kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named indian burns. that stops now."
36013,Sheldon,"what you fail to realize is kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power."
36014,Sheldon,"trust me, kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. observe. kripke! i would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
36015,Sheldon,"he’s right, leonard. the paradigm is to the death."
44206,Sheldon,"well, i believe i’m treating you generously. that’s why i’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
44209,Sheldon,"yeah, that, too. and scoot over. part of your shadow’s on my spot."
36019,Sheldon,"don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,"
44212,Sheldon,do you still like cilantro?
44214,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve always valued education over money. and the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive i’ve been of your contributions."
36024,Sheldon,"first off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. it is extracted from the plant…"
36026,Sheldon,tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta. due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
36029,Sheldon,"well then, the solution is simple. i shall befriend him. kripke!"
36034,Sheldon,hi.
44229,Sheldon,"choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual. you have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. i, haven’t i lost enough today?"
36039,Sheldon,"you got it, buddy."
44233,Sheldon,"yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
44234,Sheldon,"i suppose i should set this up. or would you like to rob me of that, too?"
36047,Sheldon,i don’t see how you could.
36055,Sheldon,family or friend?
44249,Sheldon,"no, i meant turn right, and you missed it. maybe you do need to know."
44251,Sheldon,just wait.
44253,Sheldon,"it’s basically everything i’ve ever owned. um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. just all of it."
36065,Sheldon,we were really hitting it off.
44263,Sheldon,i have an old teddy bear i secretly wiped my nose on for years.
36072,Sheldon,"this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. no, one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
36073,Sheldon,"hardly. fear of heights is illogical. fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. what would you say is the minimum altitude i need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
36076,Sheldon,i am? i was wrong. it is a fear of heights.
44268,Sheldon,i will always have the dent to remember it by.
44269,Sheldon,"actually, yes. i do."
44271,Sheldon,i’m glad i told you about the storage unit.
44273,Sheldon,"you look amazing. i mean, this resolution is remarkable."
44276,Sheldon,i know.
44278,Sheldon,"i was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face."
36087,Sheldon,"don’t be silly. howard, you do not have a phd, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays."
36088,Sheldon,"no. you, too, are safe."
36092,Sheldon,no? but we’re friends!
36096,Sheldon,"right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
44289,Sheldon,"well done, it worked, we’re going."
44297,Sheldon,"eh, most of the jenga pieces are missing and the scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on."
36107,Sheldon,"if you recall, i pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago."
44299,Sheldon,that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
44301,Sheldon,"hey, now, wait. have we started? do i drink? what is happening?"
36115,Sheldon,i see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine.
44308,Sheldon,"oh, and how."
44310,Sheldon,"all right, my turn. mm. oh, i know. never have i ever kept a secret bank account, because i think my wife can’t handle money. did i win? i feel like i won."
36119,Sheldon,"you know, i’ve given the matter some thought, and i think i’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
36123,Sheldon,was that sarcasm?
36124,Sheldon,was that sarcasm?
36126,Sheldon,"penny, you appear to have a package here."
36129,Sheldon,"oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. i wasn’t sure."
44321,Sheldon,"i like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting."
44322,Sheldon,"hmm? well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. lucky for you it’s tomorrow."
36132,Sheldon,"oh, good. dinner’s here."
44326,Sheldon,"well, we’ll just see about that."
36138,Sheldon,are you sure? because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
44331,Sheldon,"well, i should hope so. tomorrow’s picture day."
36140,Sheldon,they did.
36141,Sheldon,"they had a terrible time of it, leonard."
44336,Sheldon,all this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
44337,Sheldon,"oh, it’s just a meeting. one simple meeting."
36146,Sheldon,"congratulations. you may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.  "
36147,Sheldon,"hello, penny."
44347,Sheldon,"it’s not always because they die. in one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. yeah, but i won’t say who it is. it’s brann."
36156,Sheldon,that seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
44348,Sheldon,she did.
44354,Sheldon,fair enough.
44359,Sheldon,"if batman were bitten by a radioactive man-bat, and then fought crime disguised as man-bat, would he be man-bat-man-bat-man or simply man-bat-man-bat-batman?"
36169,Sheldon,i’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
44362,Sheldon,"i also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember."
36171,Sheldon,my apologies. i’ve been living with your son too long. gotten into some bad habits.
44363,Sheldon,"wine again? yeah, no, thank you. i like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box."
36173,Sheldon,i feel very comfortable around you.
36176,Sheldon,i’d like to do the math.
44377,Sheldon,"oh, no bubble baths either. they can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
44378,Sheldon,"oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury."
36190,Sheldon,"no. despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. now i’m done."
36191,Sheldon,is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
44384,Sheldon,cinnamon toast?
36194,Sheldon,you’re in my spot.
36195,Sheldon,"no, i’m going to the comic book store."
44386,Sheldon,you get where i’m going here?
44390,Sheldon,"well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
44394,Sheldon,ready?
36204,Sheldon,why don’t i just eat in my desk chair?
44397,Sheldon,"you’re parched and weary from battle. you stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm."
44399,Sheldon,he wants to see i.d.
36222,Sheldon,i still don’t like this cushion.
36223,Sheldon,"right, just one thing before we start."
44414,Sheldon,taylor swift.
44419,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, who is mike drop?"
36229,Sheldon,"but once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. the warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. he offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. this little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
44425,Sheldon,"oh, well, i have a few questions for him about the last avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers."
36236,Sheldon,"i’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. see, by attaching rfid tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. i will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
36237,Sheldon,"assuming i can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
36238,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
44429,Sheldon,"you know the golden rule of line etiquette. no cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
36240,Sheldon,what on earth are you doing?
36246,Sheldon,"unlikely. that’s a television show, leonard."
44438,Sheldon,you would do that?
44439,Sheldon,you’re a good man.
44442,Sheldon,"oh, thanks, you’re a peach. beverly, we’ll catch up soon. bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, penny, you have spinach in your teeth."
36256,Sheldon,so we have to go back.
36259,Sheldon,then i won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
44452,Sheldon,"well, no. it’s not cool. if there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. but this line is first-come, first-served. not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. right here."
36261,Sheldon,"you forgot your flash drive, you forgot your flash drive "
36265,Sheldon,the key is hidden in my room.
36269,Sheldon,"okay, step four. do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
36270,Sheldon,it’s sheldon.
44463,Sheldon,"no, i can’t. this isn’t right."
36273,Sheldon,"okay. enough chitchat. okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. step two, enter our apartment. step three, enter my bedroom."
44468,Sheldon,"because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
36278,Sheldon,don’t read those letters!
36280,Sheldon,i’m back.
44472,Sheldon,"well, actually, i…"
44475,Sheldon,"mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire."
36284,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the usb port. she calls me moon pie because i’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the usb port. the one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
44477,Sheldon,isn’t this nice?
36289,Sheldon,"so, penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or i punch you in the throat rule."
44483,Sheldon,"don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking."
44485,Sheldon,"if i’d known you were broke, i wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread."
36295,Sheldon,"when i signed for the package, i was deputized by the united parcel service and entrusted with its final delivery. i now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that i’m fully indemnified and no longer liable."
36298,Sheldon,"obviously, not a cleaning business."
36299,Sheldon,good for you. sign here.
36301,Sheldon,what’s her name?
36303,Sheldon,i think you’re just making that up.
36306,Sheldon,and how much profit do you make per penny blossom?
36308,Sheldon,before taxes.
36315,Sheldon,and you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while i’m doing so.
36317,Sheldon,sarcasm. good-bye.
44511,Sheldon,what? in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia? i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
36321,Sheldon,you’re questioning my math?
44514,Sheldon,but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
44515,Sheldon,"hang on, hang on. we’re smart, we can figure this out. okay, so: mary and beverley can’t be together. uh, alfred and beverley can’t be together. leonard and i can’t be together. now, i could be with alfred but i don’t like his face. oh, here. i’ve got it."
36327,Sheldon,"penny’s making hair accessories. i’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. all right, break’s over. "
44520,Sheldon,why do people cry at weddings?
36329,Sheldon,"it won’t work, the flower’s too porous."
44529,Sheldon,look at this. elon musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
44530,Sheldon,"well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game."
36342,Sheldon,"penny, everything is better with bluetooth."
44540,Sheldon,hello.
44541,Sheldon,"don’t sign anything? that’s your advice? okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
36361,Sheldon,the horror!
44554,Sheldon,they made me promise i wouldn’t talk.
44555,Sheldon,"well, now, see? you knew what was gonna happen. why didn’t they? anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me."
36364,Sheldon,"no, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. they say it is, but it’s not."
36365,Sheldon,"i never met them. that’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
44556,Sheldon,"mm. if it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
36371,Sheldon,i’m checking for musical instruments. does that sound like castanets to you?
44564,Sheldon,impressive.
36373,Sheldon,hello.
44571,Sheldon,and look how irritable it’s making you!
36381,Sheldon,"if that changes, let me know. and finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
36382,Sheldon,alicia?
44575,Sheldon,"oh, that was never happening."
44578,Sheldon,"oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
36388,Sheldon,"oh, mimicry. i enjoy mimicry. i’ve been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi. “it’s a trap.” you have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “it’s a trap. it’s a trap. it’s a trap.”"
44581,Sheldon,i am facing a great deal of work. and i do like things better when famous people also like them.
36393,Sheldon,"in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo."
36396,Sheldon,"who is it? oh hello, penny, it’s open, come in. sarcasm."
36397,Sheldon,"you think i can’t hear them? listen to that. stomp, stomp, stomp. that’s wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
44588,Sheldon,that’s a craving. that’s a sign of chemical dependency.
44591,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. yes, of course."
36402,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white?"
44594,Sheldon,"uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when i’m trying to get my life back on track?"
44595,Sheldon,i do.
44596,Sheldon,"yeah, but i do."
36407,Sheldon,you once had leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
36409,Sheldon,you got the wrong mustard.
44601,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll just toss this out to the room. um, i was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. now, i couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but i did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. you know, the interesting fact about the rectum…"
44603,Sheldon,i can’t.
36416,Sheldon,"rut? i think you mean consistency. and if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it thursday? let’s call it quonko day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra."
44613,Sheldon,"yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? i mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven."
36426,Sheldon,a superb choice.
44620,Sheldon,"you’re darn right, you wouldn’t. no matter where i am, this will always be my spot. like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
36431,Sheldon,i need it for my robin collection.
36438,Sheldon,"look at that, that’s a dent. thank you, howard ham-fisted wolowitz. did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode?"
36439,Sheldon,are you ill?
36440,Sheldon,all right. then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening?
36441,Sheldon,"a moment ago, when you turned off the tv in the middle of }during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode. would you like some advice?"
44632,Sheldon,"wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. "
44641,Sheldon,"leonard, please, let me go."
44643,Sheldon,i guess the experiment begins.
44645,Sheldon,"no, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. you know? i know that i have a tendency to be controlling, so i would rather you choose."
44652,Sheldon,i suppose that works.
36466,Sheldon,"i believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
44660,Sheldon,who are you calling? aaargh!
44662,Sheldon,really? i slept great.
44666,Sheldon,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
44667,Sheldon,how dare you?
36476,Sheldon,"do you know, i’m such a good mood, i’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language folksy and charming today."
44668,Sheldon,"whoa, whoa! now you’re making fun of my bona fides?"
44674,Sheldon,will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
36485,Sheldon,you’re the milk thief! leonard said i was crazy but i knew that carton felt lighter.
44679,Sheldon,"well, as a male, i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna. restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
36488,Sheldon,"so, how was your day?"
44680,Sheldon,"don’t blame me. blame your pal, biology. he’s the pervert pulling the strings here."
44682,Sheldon,yes.
44688,Sheldon,have you noticed it’s always an a-flat?
44691,Sheldon,"being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within. when i see a pretty gal walking down the street, i think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
36501,Sheldon,"i really have no idea. i don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…"
36502,Sheldon,"thank you, that’s very helpful."
36510,Sheldon,i’m homesick.
36512,Sheldon,sing soft kitty.
36515,Sheldon,sleepy kitty.
36525,Sheldon,"excuse me, spoiler alert."
44718,Sheldon,you never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
44719,Sheldon,"oh. well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that i’m great at surprises."
44721,Sheldon,"the average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. if that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
44726,Sheldon,"so until amy’s apartment is fixed, she and i are living here together."
36535,Sheldon,"you have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. if that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
44730,Sheldon,"okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. i’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
36542,Sheldon,"for what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make jesus cry."
36543,Sheldon,"all right, what if we use this two-inch pvc to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
44735,Sheldon,"you know, in fact, i’d like to propose a toast. to stuart. a fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
36545,Sheldon,it won’t work. the diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
44737,Sheldon,your handwriting is impeccable.
36552,Sheldon,"i must say, howard, i think a detailed letter to mit describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree."
44746,Sheldon,who haven’t learned their place yet.
36555,Sheldon,"oh, boy."
36563,Sheldon,why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
44757,Sheldon,"i have a feeling you’re still doing it. but i find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
36567,Sheldon,"aw, how nice. well, a space opened up at the last minute on the nsf expedition to the arctic circle."
44762,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
44764,Sheldon,"oh. well, i feel both flattered and hurt. like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas."
36576,Sheldon,it wasn’t. his wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
36582,Sheldon,"i’ll admit that was a concern. but the fact is, i’ll need a support team. and the three of you are my first choice."
44775,Sheldon,jlyajbe’. dah nep’a’ penny? 
36586,Sheldon, penny.
44783,Sheldon,i’m open to the possibility.
36592,Sheldon, penny.
44786,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
36595,Sheldon,"i don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, i’m going to the arctic circle with leonard, wolowitz and koothrappali."
36596,Sheldon,yes.
44793,Sheldon,but what if we move and we don’t like it? what if there’s a smoker in the building? or pets? or there could be mould? there could be traffic noise. i’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. are you trying to soothe me by singing the star trek theme as a lullaby?
44795,Sheldon,"do you know 2001: a space odyssey? all right, now that’s soothing."
36604,Sheldon,"that feels like a bonus question. i’m going to stop here while i’m ahead, but i’ve had a great time."
36606,Sheldon,and begin.
44798,Sheldon,that’s my girl. what on earth? what is going on?
36609,Sheldon,i hadn’t thought of that. i guess we’re done here.
44801,Sheldon,yes.
36612,Sheldon,"because in the frigid temperatures in the arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
36621,Sheldon,what is it?
36622,Sheldon,"oh, that’s clever. let me see if i understand this correctly. her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
36623,Sheldon,"all right. well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
44813,Sheldon,"on a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
36625,Sheldon,"leonard, you may be right. it appears that penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
44814,Sheldon,eating a whole altoid?
36627,Sheldon,"all right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. i suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
44820,Sheldon,thank you. now yell charge and we can get out of here.
36629,Sheldon,what are we having?
44821,Sheldon,did it work? are they brain cells yet?
36632,Sheldon,"flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
36639,Sheldon,"of course, i can’t mention you in my nobel acceptance speech, but when i get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
36642,Sheldon,"if there’s going to be a theme, i should let you know that i don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
44835,Sheldon,"yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
36647,Sheldon,did leonard know about this? leonard’s my best friend in the world. surely leonard didn’t know.
44841,Sheldon,"oh, i see what’s happening here. you’re playing hard to get."
44843,Sheldon,"well, hello."
44845,Sheldon,"good choice, it’s disgusting."
44847,Sheldon,anything you’d like to pet? not my hair. there’s a lot of goop in it.
44852,Sheldon,"hey, it’s not even called the genius grant, it’s the macarthur fellowship. just like it’s not frankenstein, it’s frankenstein’s monster. which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. and if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way i brought that full circle."
36664,Sheldon,i missed comic-con and the new star trek movie!
44858,Sheldon,"who leaves their bike in the hallway? you know, if i knew how to ride one, i’d steal it."
44859,Sheldon,who listens to the radio any more?
36668,Sheldon,"all right, i’ve had enough. attention, everyone. i’ m dr. sheldon cooper. as many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
44861,Sheldon,you want me to read a geology paper?
44864,Sheldon,"yeah, well i am angry. and you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. and do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
36674,Sheldon,fed.
44870,Sheldon,"i can’t believe i was surpassed by a geologist. i mean, rocks. he studies rocks. if rock is so great, how come paper beats it? leonard, i’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
36681,Sheldon,that was different. they were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
44874,Sheldon,"yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you."
44875,Sheldon,"uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
36689,Sheldon,"oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
44882,Sheldon,"excuse me, i need to pay bert a proper congratulations."
36695,Sheldon,"if that’s morse code, that’s terrible. as i was saying, you and leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. earlier this evening, leonard characterized it as just fine. so what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
44892,Sheldon,"all right, let’s do this, bert? we need to talk."
44894,Sheldon,"i was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, i’d somehow be unburdened."
36706,Sheldon,fair enough. what stake do you propose?
36707,Sheldon,"all right, you have a wager."
36709,Sheldon,one at a time.  what was that?
44904,Sheldon,"what a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a nobel?"
36713,Sheldon,"oh, really? well, i grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and i believe i could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
36714,Sheldon,"if i were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
44906,Sheldon,"oh, actually, i would."
36717,Sheldon,"an appropriate cricket name. for example, jiminy."
44910,Sheldon,it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny.
44912,Sheldon,"look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting."
36724,Sheldon,"excuse me, are you professor crawley?"
36729,Sheldon,"no, no, wait. dr. crawley, are you sure?"
44923,Sheldon,i’ll be right across the hall. you’ll probably be able to hear it.
36735,Sheldon,why would that make me feel better?
36740,Sheldon,i just said that. this conversation has started to circle. meeting adjourned.
36742,Sheldon,"oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. all right. well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my flash 123 to goeth to wolowitz."
36743,Sheldon,"leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. i lost a bet to wolowitz."
44938,Sheldon,it’s a good thing you’re cute.
44939,Sheldon,what do you think you’re doing?
36749,Sheldon,"penny, while i subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of sheldons in an infinite number of universes, i assure you that in none of them am i dancing."
44941,Sheldon,"so, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, i see you’ve met theodore. theodore, these are your new room mates, leonard and penny. they’re very honest, but i would not leave cash lying around."
44942,Sheldon,"my room is paid up until the end of the month, so i can do with it whatever i please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
36761,Sheldon,you can catch even more flies with manure. what’s your point?
44959,Sheldon,i didn’t put on my come-hither plaid pj’s for nothing.
36769,Sheldon,"bazinga! none of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
36770,Sheldon,did you? i didn’t notice. have a chocolate.
44973,Sheldon,"because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…"
36789,Sheldon,thank you. 
44981,Sheldon,"oh, you’re right. i’m sorry."
36800,Sheldon,and you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? highly unethical for an astrophysicist. although practically mandatory for a pirate.
44992,Sheldon,"oh, you know., the lone star state. hmm. that should be its yelp rating."
36804,Sheldon,elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
44997,Sheldon,do we have to? i really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
36807,Sheldon,"understandable. your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
45002,Sheldon,welcome to texas.
36815,Sheldon,for me.
45007,Sheldon,"what, so you thought i was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
45008,Sheldon,"well, this is highly insulting."
45014,Sheldon,can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
36828,Sheldon,"this is not the time for joking. we’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
45022,Sheldon,"so my mother thought i was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks i’m incapable of running my own life."
36831,Sheldon,alright?
45027,Sheldon,yeah. here. i’ll catch you up.
36836,Sheldon,there is a fine line between wrong and visionary. unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
36843,Sheldon,give me the eraser.
36844,Sheldon,i said give it to me.
45035,Sheldon,"wait, so how does the story end? is the baby a jerk or is bernadette a bad mother?"
45038,Sheldon,"thank you, internet. i’m telling you, with the right youtube video, i can give howard a vasectomy."
45042,Sheldon,"that’s small. so, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
36852,Sheldon,in this context for me could mean with me.
36853,Sheldon,i reject them all.
36854,Sheldon,"wait, you have to drive me home."
45051,Sheldon,"leonard, she might be drunk. all she had was chips."
45055,Sheldon,bye.
45065,Sheldon,"you want to play jenga? or, uh, ticket to ride? hearthstone? what would you be the happiest losing at?"
36881,Sheldon,"from hell’s heart, i stab at thee."
45075,Sheldon,there’s a cucumber in my water.
36888,Sheldon,underworld guardian. we skirmish to the death.
36893,Sheldon,"you’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet hoth. your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
36894,Sheldon,"the year was 1995, the place, jackson, mississippi. having spent ten hours on a bus, during which i had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, i finally arrived at the fourth annual dixie-trek convention only to find that my idol wil wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
36898,Sheldon,"oh, yes."
45091,Sheldon,yeah.
45093,Sheldon,"don’t fall for it. he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
36902,Sheldon,"excuse me. you’re misusing the word ho. it’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, land, ho! or, uh, westward, ho!"
36906,Sheldon,"wolowitz is trying to outflank us. let out some string, add altitude and i’ll go under and cut his line."
45101,Sheldon,you could make it a train room.
36910,Sheldon,victory!
45102,Sheldon,"i know, and amy says i can’t have a train room."
45103,Sheldon,wonderful. although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig.
36916,Sheldon,"i grew up in texas. football is ubiquitous in texas. pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, european football, which most texans believe to be a commie plot."
45113,Sheldon,"no, wait, uh, hold on. oh, what, you are. aren’t you sweet?"
45116,Sheldon,yes.
45117,Sheldon,it’s like you’re twins.
45119,Sheldon,he’s still mad.
45121,Sheldon,"hey, i shared my honey nut cheerios with you."
36930,Sheldon,"huh. seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? by the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
36935,Sheldon,"you shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
36944,Sheldon,why not?
36946,Sheldon,"your turn, leonard."
45139,Sheldon,keep filling this one with babies. she’s good.
36952,Sheldon,it’s also your roll.
45146,Sheldon,"oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best."
36963,Sheldon,"go, go, power rangers, go!"
36966,Sheldon,"leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago i told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
45159,Sheldon,sorry. i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish.
45162,Sheldon,"no, thanks. i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
45168,Sheldon,"oh, what choice do i have? you need me. i’m like the crankshaft of this team."
45171,Sheldon,i’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.
36980,Sheldon,yes.
45172,Sheldon,may i borrow your water?
36983,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
45177,Sheldon,he’s not gonna make it.
36986,Sheldon,were you under the impression that leonard has no complaints about you?
36989,Sheldon,"because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
36992,Sheldon,go apologize to penny.
36997,Sheldon,"i’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know i’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a richard feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her franklin mint collectible plates."
37000,Sheldon,"can i get this comic book, too?"
45194,Sheldon,"although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. oh, he looks sad again."
45199,Sheldon,"is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. that works."
45200,Sheldon,"well, wait. this is our first fight as a couple who live together."
37010,Sheldon,tubs are slippery.
37011,Sheldon,i have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
37012,Sheldon,they’re holding umbrellas.
45203,Sheldon,"that lady has a name. i don’t know what it is, but one time i accidentally called her mom."
45208,Sheldon,"i’m sorry you were embarrassed. and now i understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, dr. fink."
37022,Sheldon,my mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
45214,Sheldon,i like being chauffeured around. it makes me feel important.
45216,Sheldon,"excuse me. may i have your attention, please? i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip. and i just want to say, shame on all of you. we’re scientists. our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives."
45223,Sheldon,"let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
37035,Sheldon,"yes, and i have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
45227,Sheldon,what emergency happened at the l.a. zoo?
37037,Sheldon,"one moment. according to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. there’s the handle. oh, no, too far, bringing it back. optimized. now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
37039,Sheldon,"yes. as soon as i adjust my seat. whee! oh, dear. i’m going to have to start again."
45233,Sheldon,she’s gonna hate the panels.
37042,Sheldon,all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
37043,Sheldon,"mr. spock did not pilot the enterprise. he was the science officer, and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
37046,Sheldon,"no, it isn’t. but i suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
45239,Sheldon,"if i may speak for comic-con, we don’t want that either."
37049,Sheldon,all right. and how did the accident occur?
37051,Sheldon,kidney disease?
37057,Sheldon,episodes of sub psychotic rage.
45250,Sheldon,are you listening to this? they deceive each other about everything.
45252,Sheldon,"yeah, well, get this, neither does penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. you set ’em up, i knock ’em down, good job."
45256,Sheldon,"when the irs questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
45257,Sheldon,"i’m a big boy, and if i missed one, i’d throw a big-boy tantrum."
45262,Sheldon,what? can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
37071,Sheldon,"all right. these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow. i need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
45263,Sheldon,"well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. it’s a list of this year’s panelists. it’s long, isn’t it?"
45266,Sheldon,"hi, uh, penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine."
45269,Sheldon,what about his dog?
37081,Sheldon,what do you want?
37082,Sheldon,it wasn’t funny.
45275,Sheldon,"oh, i’m outraged. "
45279,Sheldon,"yes, probably. but until we know for sure, how can i feel better?"
37092,Sheldon,"yes, exactly."
37094,Sheldon,"you flatter me, sir."
45290,Sheldon,fine. you took my room. you turned my friends against me. i hope you’re happy.
45293,Sheldon,"well, our friend raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
45298,Sheldon,"hey, raj, i owe you an apology. look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
37110,Sheldon,your shoes are delightful. where did you get them?
45303,Sheldon,i can’t sleep.
45305,Sheldon,yes. i don’t care for unconscious thoughts. my brain and i are best friends. it should tell me everything. 
37119,Sheldon,"can’t you surprise him in some other way? for example, i’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
45311,Sheldon,"oh, the project is classified. i can’t tell you. oh, i suppose i could redact the classified parts. all right, um, i came up with an elegant solution to the  wow, i wonder what they’re redacting."
45313,Sheldon,so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
45317,Sheldon,"amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. now, i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means, so i’ll wait."
45319,Sheldon,"i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and i realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation."
45322,Sheldon,that is a valid point. perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
37131,Sheldon,tests. here. it’s college-ruled. i hope that’s not too intimidating.
45324,Sheldon,is it?
37133,Sheldon,"hush. if you have questions, raise your hand. it’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 bc, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. there you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. yes, penny?"
37138,Sheldon,"now, remember, newton realized that aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. so let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as a and we get force, earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. so we can see that ma equals mg and what do we know from this?"
45333,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, go ahead."
37142,Sheldon,i’m sorry.  have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
37144,Sheldon,all right. it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
45336,Sheldon,"yes, this is remarkable."
37152,Sheldon,"that’s no reason to cry. one cries because one is sad. for example, i cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
37156,Sheldon,"and to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
45348,Sheldon,"it seems we have a choice to make. abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
37159,Sheldon,"no, on the contrary. i found the grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and i was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved christmas. what a buzz kill that was."
45353,Sheldon,i love that one.
37171,Sheldon,"if i can interject again. leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. he probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu."
37172,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, i believe the word is om."
45363,Sheldon,"oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
45367,Sheldon,brb. that’s short for be right back. i’m saving so much time.
45368,Sheldon,the two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and t equals zero. and i know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
37179,Sheldon,my bad. i did send a gift from both of us.
45377,Sheldon,just do your laundry.
45380,Sheldon,what i need is to get to work.
37192,Sheldon,that’s not the comforting part.
37194,Sheldon,"well, the germans have always been a comforting people. just remember, leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
45386,Sheldon,"at, at the lab? why am i naked from the waist down?"
45388,Sheldon,"leonard, would you be a lamb?"
45389,Sheldon,"wait, wait. where’s my bag? my phone and my wallet are in my bag."
37198,Sheldon,i don’t blame you. you were intoxicated.
45390,Sheldon,"where’s my notebook? my notebook’s gone. oh, no. "
45391,Sheldon,what’s the big deal? it’s full of classified information about the air force project.
45393,Sheldon,i’m trying.
45394,Sheldon,why?
37203,Sheldon,"it is great, isn’t it? we have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
37205,Sheldon,"all right. well, i’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
45400,Sheldon,"uh, no, thank you. we now know why mastercard sent me a fraud alert."
37214,Sheldon,"one of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in edwin abbott’s mathematical fantasy, flatland."
45407,Sheldon,we really need to skedaddle. thank you.
37217,Sheldon,"well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in flatland. oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
37218,Sheldon,"tell her you’re a circle, flatland gals are all hot for circles."
45414,Sheldon,"all right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their a-game, good energy. hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
45415,Sheldon,"and welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of fun with flags on an episode we’re calling…"
37230,Sheldon,"when i lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
37237,Sheldon,we scored. i’m the wingman.
37240,Sheldon,i don’t say anything. i merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
37241,Sheldon,"yes, exactly, i had a great time. that’s done, i’ve moved on to other things. for example, after i learn finnish, i’m not going to learn finnish again."
45432,Sheldon,"oh great, see you at seven. "
45438,Sheldon,fine.
45439,Sheldon,"aw, man."
45443,Sheldon,"okay. so, feynman, einstein and schrodinger walk into a bar. feynman says, it appears"
37252,Sheldon,"oh, is it? look at this. general tso’s chicken is no longer listed under specialties. it’s now under chicken."
45449,Sheldon,so he’s using his money to attract a mate. is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy? or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny?
37262,Sheldon,"they took our tv, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our ps2, our ps3, our x-box, our x-box 360, our classic nintendo, our super nintendo, our nintendo 64 and our wii."
45454,Sheldon,"okay, one second."
45456,Sheldon,what happened to me? i used to excel at these things.
45461,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
45465,Sheldon,"the theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
37275,Sheldon,"we just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
45467,Sheldon,jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.  
45476,Sheldon,"okay, i think i got that."
37289,Sheldon,"listen to her, jim."
37299,Sheldon,"oh! no, she’s right, i don’t need to know what you were doing. carry on. "
45492,Sheldon,this article says the peak age for making a nobel prize-winning discovery is 40. 
45495,Sheldon,"hey, i thought you were sweet on me."
37306,Sheldon,"our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, i’m leaving pasadena forever. tell me how that’s overreacting."
37307,Sheldon,"oh, if that were only true. unfortunately, as i’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, i need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena. like enid, oklahoma. low crime rate and high-speed internet connectivity, but no model train shops. sorry, enid."
37310,Sheldon,"i sense you’re making a joke, but bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin, so do not forward my mail there."
45502,Sheldon,who else has access to this room?
37312,Sheldon,they should. it’s one of the first things i plan to bring up upon arrival.
45507,Sheldon,"you know, i have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. it’s too bad i enjoy doing them so much. the air force did it again. they’re erasing our lives."
37317,Sheldon,i’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
45510,Sheldon,thank you. can we just talk about something else?
37320,Sheldon,why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
37321,Sheldon,"captain hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. if you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
45517,Sheldon,"no, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. mmm, tasteless. how do you do it?"
45520,Sheldon,"well, a lot, it’s very annoying. has something changed? um, is there something that you’re not telling me?"
45521,Sheldon,"princeton? a fine institution. the place where albert einstein taught. and where leonard got his phd, so it may have gone downhill."
37332,Sheldon,good lord! you’re ruining everything!
37334,Sheldon,"well, i needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t i?"
37336,Sheldon,they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
37337,Sheldon,impaired cognitive function.
37338,Sheldon,but i don’t want to go to bed.
45529,Sheldon,"no, but that list was sounding a little thin."
37342,Sheldon,but i’m still working.
45534,Sheldon,"well, i’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. besides, princeton is in new jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. uh, i know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…"
45537,Sheldon,"all right, then. let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
45538,Sheldon,"or, what if we fold them?"
45549,Sheldon,"and just remember, i am proud of you and i support you in all that you do."
37358,Sheldon,a menial job. like yours.
45552,Sheldon,"now, i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk. would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? they’re both shocking."
37361,Sheldon,you didn’t really type.
45554,Sheldon,"i miss you, too."
45555,Sheldon,i’m sorry you had to go through that.
37364,Sheldon,one question.
37369,Sheldon,i’m trying to get these tables cleared. we’re slammed.
37371,Sheldon,"oh, heavens, no. since i don’t need to be paid, i didn’t need to be hired. i simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. let me get that plate out of your way."
45563,Sheldon,"so, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
37374,Sheldon,"all right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. beer-battered fish and chips. now, here’s your tartar sauce. i also brought you salsa. it’s a little unconventional, but i think you’ll like it. it’s zingy. and for you, factory burrito grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. bon appétit."
45566,Sheldon,"yeah. raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
45568,Sheldon,"oh, dr. nowitzki is a woman. "
45569,Sheldon,"many years ago. back when she was a grad student. she’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at caltech."
45570,Sheldon,"yes. i think you’d like her. she’s extremely intelligent, just like you. unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer."
45573,Sheldon,"i was scared, but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub. then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
37382,Sheldon,"in pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
37383,Sheldon,"given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
45576,Sheldon,that is true. she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone.
45577,Sheldon,"leonard, your wife is sitting right here. what are you doing?"
45581,Sheldon,"oh, fun. like a play date."
45582,Sheldon,here you go.
45583,Sheldon,"hmm? oh, no, no, no. they’re from many famous people. see? oh, like this one. this is from patrick stewart. it says if i come to his house again, i get to meet his dogs. oh, excuse me."
37392,Sheldon,shame on you! that’s no dream for a scientist!
37398,Sheldon,"no, that seemed a little farfetched."
37400,Sheldon,is that your final decision?
45594,Sheldon,that doesn’t make any sense. she knows i have a girlfriend.
37405,Sheldon,"he owns fox, and they cancelled firefly. hint, he and darth vader are tied for number 2."
37406,Sheldon,"morning, old chum."
45599,Sheldon,"penny, look. i appreciate your concern, but i don’t think that’s what’s happening."
45600,Sheldon,i think dr. nowitzki is a friendly colleague. i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
45601,Sheldon,"uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. i did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating."
37410,Sheldon,"what you’re tasting is respect and affection. and about a pound of crisco. after you’ve finished breakfast, i thought we could spend the day watching the final season of babylon 5 with director commentary."
37411,Sheldon,"i do. it fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. but you like it, and you’re my friend."
37412,Sheldon,drat. no frodo for you.
45603,Sheldon,"and i with you. question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"
45605,Sheldon, amy. will you marry me?
37415,Sheldon,"yes, amusing. extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. i believe you know why i’m here in the laundry room."
37416,Sheldon,here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. aka me. and here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. aka you.
37417,Sheldon,"please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. this is the large hadron collider at cern in switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. it is a mecca for physicists the world over. this is bath and body works on colorado boulevard. they sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
37419,Sheldon,very well. enjoy yourself. you’re going to be in the presence of something that i’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. i just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
37421,Sheldon,"since i rarely hug, i’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
37429,Sheldon,really?
37432,Sheldon,with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at bill gates’ house should i be invited.
37433,Sheldon,"great. i’ll start packing. in a minute.  oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
37435,Sheldon,with the little stars?
45629,Sheldon,no. i can’t let you do this. 
37441,Sheldon,"well, look who thinks he’s stuart’s uncle now."
45633,Sheldon,show me your mucus! your mucus! 
45635,Sheldon,hi penny.
45641,Sheldon,"please penny, enough, i have to sleep."
45643,Sheldon,have we at this point met our social obligations?
37453,Sheldon,"yes, it is."
45648,Sheldon,i’ve got it! i finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
45649,Sheldon,"greetings, hamburger toucher. you are probably wondering why you cannot im with your little friends about how much you heart various things. well, this recorded message is alerting you that i am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our wifi. if you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own wifi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me."
37461,Sheldon,"now you see what you’ve done? because of you, we’re all going to miss stan lee."
37462,Sheldon,"well, you’re my friends. you’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when i’m victorious."
45655,Sheldon,"hello, kripke. yes, sheldon cooper here. it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see. well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… i see. no, no, no, wait. don’t hang up yet. what about a recreational activity? i bet we share some common interests. tell me an interest of yours. really? on actual horses? tell me another interest of yours. oh no, i’m sorry, i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to. tell me another interest of yours."
37465,Sheldon,"raj? you’ll be there, won’t you?  all right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. so, i guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
37466,Sheldon,please try to wear something appropriate. it won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
45657,Sheldon,there. we’re outlaws.
37468,Sheldon,that’s just wrong.
37469,Sheldon,"wait, hold on. before we get to the courthouse, i’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
45666,Sheldon,freaky?
45667,Sheldon,gentlemen.
37483,Sheldon,i am a scientist. i never apologize for the truth.
37486,Sheldon,i need to use the restroom.
45678,Sheldon,"oh, penny, thank you!"
37492,Sheldon,you had gelato with stan lee?
37493,Sheldon,"well, i hope you’re satisfied, penny. you are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
45686,Sheldon,"don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know i’ll do it!"
45688,Sheldon,that’s it! prepare for marshmallow death!
37497,Sheldon,"oh, lord, you just rang stan lee’s doorbell. at stan lee’s house. we’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with stan lee."
37498,Sheldon,we’re not friends at the moment. depends on how this goes.
45689,Sheldon,"ez aquarii b, ez aquarii c, excuse me, madam."
45690,Sheldon,junior mints.
45692,Sheldon,"the prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…"
37502,Sheldon,"plus, i get to hang out with him again at the hearing. this is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from leonard nimoy."
37503,Sheldon,"well, it’s very simple. in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, i’m the smart one, wolowitz is the funny one, and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. that leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
45695,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…"
37506,Sheldon,"no, what’s sad is that you don’t know adam west was tv’s batman."
37508,Sheldon,it appears to be a lord of the rings ring.
45700,Sheldon,who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? you really are an ass.
45702,Sheldon,help me! come back! penny!
45704,Sheldon,have you ever thought of teaching physics?
45708,Sheldon,"well, you can add jerry’s junction to the list of train stores sheldon cooper will never set foot in again."
37519,Sheldon,looking for something?
45714,Sheldon,"take the hint, stuart. the lady said good night."
37524,Sheldon,i would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. i have endless patience. i once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with hewlett-packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
37527,Sheldon,no! i call no meemaws.
45722,Sheldon,"nope. oh, you have no idea how annoying this is."
37532,Sheldon,waterfalls!
37536,Sheldon,"wait, just to clarify. when you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
37537,Sheldon,excellent choice.
37538,Sheldon,i’ve done it! i’ve won! the ring is mine! it’s mine!  where’s the ring?
37539,Sheldon,i knew it. give us the precious!
45728,Sheldon,"president siebert, listen to reason. yeah, i understand i don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. i… yes, i’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. and i know you were there, because i saw you through the mail slot. yeah, well, that’s some salty language. may i remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the potty mouth club. there it is again. do you kiss your mother with that mouth? oh, well, i’m sorry for your loss. good night, sir. unbelievable. he says wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university."
37541,Sheldon,"and you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? i am the william shatner of theoretical physics. all right, i’ll play. what self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
45731,Sheldon,"hello, syfy network? yeah, this is your vice president of programming. now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding alphas. yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and i don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if i really am who i say i am, you know? i just. i want this done. no, i am not the person who just called. that man was clearly a cowboy. yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. why do they keep hanging up on me?"
37543,Sheldon,"i won! this is astonishing. not that i won the award, no one deserves it more. actually, i guess i misspoke. it’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. i’m not sure what to do first. maybe i should call my mother. wait! i know, i’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
37544,Sheldon,"hello? oh, chancellor morton, how are you, sir? yes, i was expecting your call  problem."
45733,Sheldon,"me, too."
45735,Sheldon,"do you realize that in less than nine hours, arthur jeffries, aka professor proton, will be in our apartment?"
45738,Sheldon,"ah, just as well. where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?"
45739,Sheldon,"nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, prof… ow! leonard?"
37553,Sheldon,don’t trample me.
37554,Sheldon,"come on, mother, you know why i can’t accept the award. with all due respect, i don’t think praying will help. no, i have not heard the song, jesus, take the wheel. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. yes, i’ll buy it on the itunes, mother. good-bye, mother.  hello."
45745,Sheldon,amy? amy? did you hear what i said?
37557,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, that is what i meant."
45751,Sheldon,"hey, guess who i am. beep bop boop bop. i’m you. get it?"
45754,Sheldon,shotgun.
37563,Sheldon,and i appreciate the pretence.
37564,Sheldon,"no. the x-men were named for the x in charles xavier. since i am sheldon cooper, you will be my c-men."
45759,Sheldon,"but on a more serious note, the most important reason i want to go to mars is that i believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. now, i know that life on mars will be difficult. but life here on earth is no picnic. also, picnics are no picnic. where should we go for lunch? oh, i know, the ground. in conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. to mars."
37569,Sheldon,i’m sorry. proceed.
45761,Sheldon,greetings from planet earth. just turn left at alpha centauri. you can’t miss it.
45763,Sheldon,"knock, knock, knock, penny? knock, knock, knock, penny? knock, knock, knock, penny?"
45766,Sheldon,"buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. you got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. i have an eidetic memory. sometimes it’s a curse."
37575,Sheldon,"you know, the nice thing about shel-mart is i own it, so i get a 15% discount."
37576,Sheldon,"look, i didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
45767,Sheldon,"hello, amy. it’s sheldon. yeah, i, i know that we’re broken up, but i’m leaving this message because i thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about mr. spock. or as i like to call it, a spockumentary. yeah, i’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. you know, hysterically, hmm? and with a tinge of sadness that i’m no longer in your life."
37578,Sheldon,"a godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. i have to get my people to safety. people of sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. follow me. if the children can’t run, leave them behind. oh, the simulated horror!  raj? just as i suspected. meditation is nothing but hokum."
45770,Sheldon,i’m surprised you have to ask.
45773,Sheldon,no they make my earlobes sweat.
37588,Sheldon,would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams?
45782,Sheldon,"oh, amy, you naughty vixen."
45789,Sheldon,this is delightful.
37598,Sheldon,"oh, dear."
45800,Sheldon,"don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running."
37611,Sheldon,"not literally. but as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
45804,Sheldon,closer to the microphone.
45805,Sheldon,no. you have to start over.
45806,Sheldon,bazinga.
37615,Sheldon,but i sense you’re going to and i don’t want to hear about it. excuse me.
45808,Sheldon,"hello, professor hoskins. nice to see you, mindy. konichi-wa dr. nakamora. sorry the swedes disproved your theory. leonard, my door."
45809,Sheldon,be a lamb and open it for me.
37618,Sheldon,"good, penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
37621,Sheldon,"remember, seven o’clock."
45813,Sheldon,isn’t this nice? the pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
37623,Sheldon,please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
37624,Sheldon,these are my own bowling shoes.
45819,Sheldon,it’s still six spots above steve jobs. i care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
45820,Sheldon,"one of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 apple two. despite the file system limitations of apple dos 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement."
37629,Sheldon,"oh, foolish wil wheaton, it was never off."
37641,Sheldon,when are you going to talk to him?
37642,Sheldon,he’s in the laundry room now. now would be a good time.
37663,Sheldon,"well, if he does, don’t believe it. he’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
37664,Sheldon,"enjoy the accolades now, wil wheaton, but like your time on star trek: next generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
37667,Sheldon,"are you insane? if she leaves, it’s over!"
37669,Sheldon,"no, i suppose not."
37677,Sheldon,just to be clear do i have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
37681,Sheldon,bazinga.
37684,Sheldon,"that’s the sauce my mother uses. she likes cooking italian because according to her, that’s what the romans made jesus eat."
37685,Sheldon,i’m hungry now.
37686,Sheldon,will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
37701,Sheldon,"hold on. nope, no reason."
37703,Sheldon,what?
37707,Sheldon,i’m going the other way. bye.
37708,Sheldon,"no. i mean, i have no idea what you smell."
29522,Sheldon,"greetings. as you know, i’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared this short video. the four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. though i cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, i am comfortable if you choose to believe that. since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. live long and prosper."
37715,Sheldon,i’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
37716,Sheldon,"oh, i believe that was something else i wasn’t supposed to mention."
37731,Sheldon,thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
37732,Sheldon,maybe this isn’t a good time.
37735,Sheldon,point taken. you may want to sit up.
37740,Sheldon,"yes, but i rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
37741,Sheldon,"oh. well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified?"
37742,Sheldon,"well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
37746,Sheldon,i can still eat.
37753,Sheldon,i’ve heard enough. sit over there.
37758,Sheldon,"for your information, i’ll be playing host to dr. elizabeth plimpton."
37767,Sheldon,"oh, penny, excellent. i have a question about these maxi pads. are the wings truly functional or have i fallen victim to marketing hype?"
37772,Sheldon,"a word of warning. my guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
37783,Sheldon,from the mind that brought you hi-lo. let me show you to your room.
37784,Sheldon,"get it together, man."
37798,Sheldon,"ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. i’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
37802,Sheldon,"excuse me. i’m uncomfortable with you recommending that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr. plimpton, who i assure you has better things to do."
37814,Sheldon,"no, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. the roommate agreement screws you."
37819,Sheldon,"that’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that i was right."
37820,Sheldon,there you go.
37837,Sheldon,make it so.
37840,Sheldon,i can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
37843,Sheldon,what’s going on?
37845,Sheldon,"in what universe is this low-pulp? good morning, penny."
37849,Sheldon,"oh, god. that i’ve heard on multiple occasions. in what universe is that lightly toasted? this has to be the worst day of my life. good morning, leonard."
37851,Sheldon,she returned to her apartment. i presume to shower and vomit. not necessarily in that order.
37863,Sheldon,he didn’t date. it was pon farr. his blood boiled with mating lust.
37866,Sheldon,what’s life without whimsy?
37880,Sheldon,"i wouldn’t say amazing. at best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us country bear jamboree."
37884,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
37913,Sheldon,that depends. does square-dancing with my sister at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown count as a date?
37916,Sheldon,"if you know so much, how come i have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
37918,Sheldon,"oh, no, i wouldn’t care for that. amy?"
37919,Sheldon,no.
37920,Sheldon,all right. it was hell.
37926,Sheldon,your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
37928,Sheldon,i’m sorry. 16?
37948,Sheldon,"it was thanksgiving. uncle carl said, i think there’s a badger living in our chimney. hand me that flashlight. those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
37953,Sheldon,by this much.
37954,Sheldon,"you don’t get it, leonard. i’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
37955,Sheldon,a hybrid dog and octopus. man’s underwater best friend.
37958,Sheldon,"no, thank you. i’m not eating pizza tonight."
37966,Sheldon,"that’s an excellent idea. yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
37970,Sheldon,"i haven’t. i’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
37973,Sheldon,"oh, lord, i think it’s about to burst!  on the other hand, it might have been the brussels sprouts."
37975,Sheldon, penny.
37980,Sheldon,"what do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
37986,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ve been reading up on biomechanics. i think you’ll be surprised at my… wah! oh!"
37996,Sheldon,"you have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
38006,Sheldon,it’s fun for ages eight to eighty. join us.
38007,Sheldon,"you’re in luck, this is an easy one. in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
38028,Sheldon,do i detect a hint of condescension?
38037,Sheldon,hello.
38043,Sheldon,"oh, gentlemen."
38048,Sheldon,"i was going to name him herman von helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy."
38051,Sheldon,a group of cats is a clowder. or a glaring.
38059,Sheldon,"i’d like you to meet oppenheimer, frisch, panofsky, feynman, weisskopf…"
38063,Sheldon,coming!
38066,Sheldon,"all right, but you’re not fooling me. whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
38070,Sheldon,a physics point.
38078,Sheldon,"yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and the phantom menace would be a timeless classic."
38085,Sheldon,you’re two for two.
38092,Sheldon,"well, you really want to dot the i’s and cross the t’s, don’t you?"
38099,Sheldon,brobdingnagian.
38104,Sheldon,yes.
38108,Sheldon,yes.
38109,Sheldon,why do you even want this here? its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
38111,Sheldon,stand by for my upcoming tat.
38114,Sheldon,i’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. just a little experiment in pest control.
38118,Sheldon,that is apt and amusing. i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler. she’ll appreciate the witticism.
38119,Sheldon,it’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
38125,Sheldon,"jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. in this iteration, jennifer connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe in a beautiful mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
38133,Sheldon,it’s not a home. it’s a senior centre.  we’d never put meemaw in a home!
38135,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no!"
38144,Sheldon,"did you know that, leonard?"
38149,Sheldon,let’s make that our word of the day.
38151,Sheldon,yes?
38152,Sheldon,i see. can i get back to you on that?
38153,Sheldon,"good night.  leonard, leonard, leonard,"
38160,Sheldon,you’re right. it would never work. amy finds you tedious.
38164,Sheldon,amy’s right. he is tedious.
38173,Sheldon,tell her i’m not here.
38175,Sheldon,way to go on the details.
38176,Sheldon,rats!
38179,Sheldon,and you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
21796,Sheldon,yes?
21804,Sheldon,each more daunting than the last. have a seat.
38192,Sheldon,cobbler. i’m still laughing.
21811,Sheldon,and you’ll be willing to drive me?
38199,Sheldon,do you like trains?
21817,Sheldon,this isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. when do you evacuate your bowels?
38204,Sheldon,"go north. you can’t go that way. go west. a troll blocks your passage. okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. with what? with sword.  you don’t have the sword. good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me."
21827,Sheldon,"never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. and next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
38212,Sheldon,no. but it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. who was at the door?
21829,Sheldon, leonard?
21830,Sheldon, leonard?leonard?
21834,Sheldon,what is going on here?
38220,Sheldon,"oh. well, good job, quite convincing. i smell perfume."
38223,Sheldon,"very well, i’m sure i can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
21839,Sheldon,"but you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
21841,Sheldon,"i put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
38230,Sheldon,priya?
38231,Sheldon,"for shame, leonard. for shame. and to think i was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
21846,Sheldon,we don’t watch babylon 5 in this apartment.
21850,Sheldon,there’s a draft on my neck over here.
21851,Sheldon,you’re protected by your turtleneck.
21852,Sheldon,"hmm, i’m still not comfortable. of course. there’s too many people here."
38241,Sheldon,"violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
21858,Sheldon,"this is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
38245,Sheldon,why do you get to be batman?
38250,Sheldon,"i know, that’s why i shortened it."
38253,Sheldon,"the fun loving, and morally loose, miss maggie mcgeary."
38254,Sheldon,"you met her at pasadena’s most popular irish watering hole, lucky baldwin’s, where maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
38268,Sheldon,for science.
38270,Sheldon,and i’m sorry. but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. we are no longer friends.
38275,Sheldon,no.
38279,Sheldon,nothing. it was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
38287,Sheldon,"you say you’re special agent page, fbi."
38293,Sheldon,"a little, but go on."
38296,Sheldon,very well. would you be interested in knowing that mr. wolowitz once snuck onto my world of warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from sheldor to smeldor?
38300,Sheldon,i don’t want to. not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
38302,Sheldon,"well, your expectations have been subverted. aha."
38310,Sheldon,do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
38318,Sheldon,"i don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. for instance, when i first met leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a north korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
38337,Sheldon,"you’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. then ignite the rum, caramel…"
38343,Sheldon,"i see. you’re saying i’m facing starfleet academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the kobayashi maru."
38346,Sheldon,kirk beat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the simulator. that’s it.
38351,Sheldon,"yes, you are. i’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
38354,Sheldon,"nevertheless, i’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, i want you to have this."
38368,Sheldon,but how were our seats?
38369,Sheldon,"i rest my case. amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
38371,Sheldon,"wait, now, we don’t know that yet. he isn’t finished. i have a girlfriend and you don’t who?"
38372,Sheldon,knock-knock.
38374,Sheldon,hugh people need to listen to me. it’s time to get in line for the movie. and that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
38378,Sheldon,"and here’s where we are. the runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of indiana jones."
38384,Sheldon,of what? poorly executed beards?
38386,Sheldon,"i will not calm down. this affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. as captain jean-luc picard once said, the line must be drawn here! this far, no farther!"
38393,Sheldon,"look, a side door. come on, short round."
38399,Sheldon,"da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
38402,Sheldon,"now you just being silly. wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  hello. yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. of course you can. pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. that means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. be part of that proud tradition."
38405,Sheldon,"you went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
38406,Sheldon,aw.
38412,Sheldon,"leonard, penny, excellent. i’d like to say i’m very happy that you’re back together, and if i can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, i will. in the meantime, i’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address penny’s annoying personal habits."
38417,Sheldon,"do you even think about other people, leonard? do you?"
38425,Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. eh? eh? did i lie?"
38426,Sheldon,"chuck norris wishes. in binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. all chuck norris backwards gets you is sirron kcuhc."
38427,Sheldon,aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
38430,Sheldon,"are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? i did that one summer. ah, youth."
38432,Sheldon,all right. what were the symptoms?
38438,Sheldon,"all right, let’s start over. what did you say when zack walked in?"
38439,Sheldon,zack.
38442,Sheldon,"all right, i think i have enough to go on. possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and i only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
38444,Sheldon,are you sure? you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
38448,Sheldon,"don’t. it’s terrible. however, in it, we learn that when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinar."
38472,Sheldon,please don’t drag this out. this is never going to come off.
38473,Sheldon,i’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
38475,Sheldon,not so fast. infinite sheldon.
38493,Sheldon,why not? penny did it.
38496,Sheldon,complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. invisible plane sold separately.
38502,Sheldon,i’m sorry. but in what universe is wonder woman blonde?
38504,Sheldon,  penny.
38508,Sheldon,don’t worry. wonder woman was an amazon. and amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
38510,Sheldon,i may have failed.
38513,Sheldon,yes. and make her wear the black wig. good luck.
38514,Sheldon,oh.
38527,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, shush."
38528,Sheldon,"you have so few good ideas, leonard. and you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
38537,Sheldon,"because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. fyi, my mother’s birthday is coming up. i’m going to need you to pick up a present."
38541,Sheldon,"all right. all right, i’m not going to argue with you. sheldon cooper is nothing if not a team player. dr. hofstadter, you have the conn."
38544,Sheldon,this diagram. i assume you were opening with a joke. it certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
38554,Sheldon,is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
38555,Sheldon,i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
38564,Sheldon,"they are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. but perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
38571,Sheldon,"greetings, gentlemen. how goes your little project?"
38594,Sheldon,"well, i suppose it’s appropriate."
38595,Sheldon,a disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
38613,Sheldon,probably serving food that was ordered today.
38615,Sheldon,i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant workers’ solemn oath of ethics and cleanliness.”
38625,Sheldon,no. amy?
38640,Sheldon,i guess not.
38648,Sheldon,"oh, tweets about my lecture. hmm. that’s rather unfair. that’s downright cruel. plus, insects have six legs. yeah, i’m not familiar with the acronym kmn."
38649,Sheldon,"well, i suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. i think i’ll turn in. i didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
38651,Sheldon,no.
38655,Sheldon,isn’t that their burden? i’m the one with something interesting to say.
38662,Sheldon,"it has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, i suck the big one."
38664,Sheldon,i suppose that’s one way to look at it.
38675,Sheldon,why not? it seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
38677,Sheldon,all right.
38678,Sheldon,action.
38686,Sheldon,you have any frozen yogurt?
38687,Sheldon,yes. i didn’t care for it.
38688,Sheldon,"so is the mcrib sandwich. i don’t care for that, either."
38690,Sheldon,why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
38702,Sheldon,"i understand. oh, shelly? a man’s here to take you away to the future! be sure to pack clean underwear.”"
38710,Sheldon,well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. case closed.
38715,Sheldon,aha! the tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
38722,Sheldon,"unlikely. but make your case. keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our saturday night together, and i’m not above minimizing your window."
38727,Sheldon,"oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
38734,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where sandra bullock is?"
38737,Sheldon,"oh, wow!"
38742,Sheldon,"well, come now, leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
38744,Sheldon,"hold on, i have something for you."
38753,Sheldon,i’m so proud of you! you sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
38761,Sheldon,"leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
38763,Sheldon,"cocoa, leonard. focus. i’m down in the dumps here."
38769,Sheldon,hello.
38773,Sheldon,"no, no. it’s not an imposition. at this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
38782,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it’s not optional.
38788,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
38789,Sheldon,because we don’t throw parties.
38798,Sheldon,"the audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
38802,Sheldon,"oh, what fun. we’re like hippies at a love-in."
38813,Sheldon,don’t worry. my problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
38819,Sheldon,possibly. i tweeted him.
38824,Sheldon,okay. i have guests coming. i’m afraid i’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
38838,Sheldon,"better. it has a gold crown. you see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution. because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. but, while bathing, archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
38847,Sheldon,"then it’s not chili. real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
38857,Sheldon,"i do. you just happen to have caught me on a break. oh, let me see those cards."
38858,Sheldon,not knowing is part of the fun. was that the motto of your community college?
38859,Sheldon,this deck is rigged in some fashion.
38860,Sheldon,so you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
38861,Sheldon,um…
38862,Sheldon,"oh, oh, please, if i don’t know, you don’t know. that’s axiomatic."
38867,Sheldon,drat. is this your card?
38868,Sheldon,i’ll be right back.
38871,Sheldon,"i’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. by the way, if you hope to have children, i suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. your testicles look a tad warm."
38883,Sheldon,"apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the department of homeland security tattling to your mother."
38889,Sheldon,"they stole everything, leonard, everything."
38890,Sheldon,"what didn’t they get? they got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
38891,Sheldon,"what choice did i have? the mighty sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. plus, the fbi hung up on me."
38893,Sheldon,"yes, glenn! the only bird i ever loved."
38902,Sheldon,"three thousand hours. three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. it’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
38908,Sheldon,i thought i just did.
38911,Sheldon,and people think i don’t get sarcasm.
38915,Sheldon,excellent! it’s in a cul-de-sac. we can box him in.
38917,Sheldon,"i don’t know if you’ve been following the news, leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
38930,Sheldon,coming.
38942,Sheldon,of course.
38947,Sheldon,todd zarnecki was mean.
38950,Sheldon,agreed. wait till you hear how he dumbs down werner heisenberg for the crowd. you may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
38966,Sheldon,"oh, please, i was just pointing it out. i have no desire to engage in the activity."
38970,Sheldon,"that’s all. i’ve just been thinking about it. now, i’m thinking about fractal equations. now i’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. now i’m thinking about trains."
38977,Sheldon,howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to bernadette.
38981,Sheldon,your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. how might we examine this more closely?
38984,Sheldon,"look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. you’re a vixen, amy farrah fowler."
38988,Sheldon,yes. why do you ask?
38990,Sheldon,"well, we may never know. as my mother would say, the asians are an inscrutable folk. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have work to do."
38991,Sheldon,did you get that?
38999,Sheldon,perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
39004,Sheldon,"mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
39005,Sheldon,i assure you i do.
39009,Sheldon,"come on, you can’t wait two minutes?"
39012,Sheldon,"dr. leonard hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. do you waive reading of the charges?"
39016,Sheldon,"oh, that’s ridiculous. a bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
39020,Sheldon,what is that you’re eating? tonight is pizza night.
39026,Sheldon, penny?
39030,Sheldon,"really, amy? tobacco and alcohol? need i remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
39038,Sheldon,"against my will. in the south, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century vienna."
39044,Sheldon,and there’s your answer.
39051,Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
39054,Sheldon,"no, of course not."
39062,Sheldon,"affirmative. computer, this is dr. sheldon cooper. activate self-destruct sequence. code 1-1-a-2-b."
39070,Sheldon,"it’s a laptop with a full charge. honestly, what do you see in him?"
39074,Sheldon,"good morning, amy."
39083,Sheldon,"when the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. ugh."
39085,Sheldon,that’s because it’s simple.
39086,Sheldon,and…
39089,Sheldon,you know i’m right.
39091,Sheldon,"sorry, i have company."
39092,Sheldon,i don’t want to hug you.
39096,Sheldon,"all right. come in. you look positively orange with loneliness. no, i don’t see that catching on at all."
39100,Sheldon,it’s not optional. we’re out of tea. i hope you like bouillon.
39101,Sheldon,"actually, i was wondering if i could add a third new chess piece. how do you think people would feel about prince joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
39108,Sheldon,i’m glad you think so. that’s what i strive to emulate.
39120,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, do i really need to connect the dots for you? the backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
39125,Sheldon,i gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
39128,Sheldon,could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
39130,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord!"
39131,Sheldon,where’s the mouthwash?
39134,Sheldon,so your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
39135,Sheldon,is there a station coming up where i can board your giggling train of thought?
39136,Sheldon,jibber-jabber? i don’t jibber-jabber.
39139,Sheldon,"to a hospital? full of sick people? oh, i don’t think so."
39150,Sheldon,"will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
39154,Sheldon,must you?
39156,Sheldon,"not quite accurate. the macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
39164,Sheldon,"i’d like to respond to that sarcastically. yes, i relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
39167,Sheldon,rotating.
39174,Sheldon,"the hammurabic code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
39176,Sheldon,"wait. not yet. we still have to go over safety procedures. now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. in the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
39178,Sheldon,"good news, raj. i got the blood work back from the lab. you’re okay to stay for a while."
39179,Sheldon,"not important. your sugar was a little high. i’d follow up with your regular physician. in the meantime, i have some paperwork here for you to go over."
39184,Sheldon,what is this?
39187,Sheldon,"my new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  uh, nice touch, by the way."
39188,Sheldon,the same thing that happened to homo erectus. he was replaced by a superior species.
39189,Sheldon,you’re living here provisionally. but i must say it’s looking good.
39194,Sheldon,"mmm, all right. it would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. good night. please note, it is now past ten p.m. per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
39199,Sheldon,why?
39200,Sheldon,"leonard, do you understand this?"
39201,Sheldon,talk to him.
39207,Sheldon,oh. well don’t i look silly sitting here wearing this?
39220,Sheldon,"this is a game to you? uh, was the battle of antietam a game? huh? was the sack of rome a game?"
39224,Sheldon,"if there’s ever a church of sheldon, this will be when it started. ow!"
39231,Sheldon,paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. dinfast .
39233,Sheldon,as well you should. but i’m going to make an exception here.
39237,Sheldon,don’t you like amy?
39238,Sheldon,"well, there’s the difference. "
39240,Sheldon,thanks for letting me stay here while leonard skypes with his girlfriend.
39243,Sheldon,"good. on the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. i must say, i am enjoying your new chair."
39249,Sheldon,there’s a wet band-aid on the shower floor. .
39253,Sheldon, penny.
39267,Sheldon,no.
39269,Sheldon,"you’re good friends with penny, right?"
39270,Sheldon,i was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
39274,Sheldon,you mean like salt lake city?
39275,Sheldon,thank you.
39281,Sheldon,"no, penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
39282,Sheldon,"oh, i’m not buying anything. they’re having a lecture. h-o gauge railroading. half the size of o-gauge, but twice the fun. very controversial topic."
39287,Sheldon,"i don’t want to talk about it. but it’s not a spine,i’ll tell you that."
39295,Sheldon,what exactly do you mean by that?
39298,Sheldon,"the entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. you manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. what do you do?"
39299,Sheldon,"seventeen. the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. by the by, i liked it, too."
39307,Sheldon,let’s see what i’ll be washing that succotash down with. a pitcher of margaritas.
39313,Sheldon,the dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
39316,Sheldon,"okay, get this. it doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
39317,Sheldon,"well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. i’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
39318,Sheldon,"no, you’re wrong. see, as you know, a few years ago, i achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. well, from time to time, i notarize banking documents for raj. the koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re richie rich rich."
39329,Sheldon,"only 8,000? we’re wasting precious time. buy it."
39330,Sheldon,"oh, did you hear that? we’re getting the friends and family discount. we are honoured and we will take it."
39339,Sheldon,sucker. didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
39344,Sheldon,"at this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. until you either do not go or go to wil wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. i’m characterizing this phenomenon as schrodinger’s friendship."
39363,Sheldon,i don’t care.
39368,Sheldon,an original mint-in-package wesley crusher action figure.
39373,Sheldon,"come on, buddy. let’s not waste another second on this loser. love your house."
39379,Sheldon,won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
39383,Sheldon,the prospect of fried chicken.
39391,Sheldon,coffee.
39392,Sheldon,"i’m not going to get my pecan pie, am i?"
39407,Sheldon,"i’m not going, and you can’t make me."
39413,Sheldon,"no, i’m just allergic to people who get nobel prizes for no good reason."
39414,Sheldon,"no. or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
39416,Sheldon,are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
39417,Sheldon,"oh, yes, the common cold. just like everyone else. you’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
39422,Sheldon,"and just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
39430,Sheldon,get out!
39432,Sheldon,"what are you trying to pull, mom? from the top."
39442,Sheldon,nothing. it’s not suspicious that i’m fixating. it’s consistent with my personality.
39445,Sheldon,"it is, isn’t it? oh, bother. isn’t that just always the way? you go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. gosh, i wish i’d known that earlier today when i was at staples."
39455,Sheldon,"well, if it’s of any help, i’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including dr. seuss."
39462,Sheldon,"it’s me, sheldon, mrs. wolowitz."
39466,Sheldon,"holy smoke, why didn’t i think of that? you’re a better man than i, howard wolowitz. you put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
39467,Sheldon,it was a harmless halloween prank. look.
39468,Sheldon,"well, i thought he made that up. isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of jewish people?"
39502,Sheldon,the two of you need to get your women in line!
39505,Sheldon,"you invited her to lunch four years ago. everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
39510,Sheldon,"i’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
39511,Sheldon,"shoo, shoo! be gone!"
39513,Sheldon,"it’s called ornithophobia. and someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. which is unfortunate, because i have a fear of nets."
39514,Sheldon,that doesn’t help.
39515,Sheldon," go away, bird."
39521,Sheldon,or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
39537,Sheldon,every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. i’m not going to be another statistic.
39541,Sheldon,"yes. it should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? not anymore. we’re going to have so much fun together. you can carry messages to all my enemies. i can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
39544,Sheldon,mine was great. i’m going to be a mommy. 
39558,Sheldon,"and i suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
39560,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s just play."
39561,Sheldon,"cluck, cluck, cluck. what are we, ladies at a quilting bee? or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
39562,Sheldon,"and may i point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with stuart and amy, not me. i think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. "
39564,Sheldon,don’t be silly. i’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
39569,Sheldon,why?
39571,Sheldon,penny. 
39577,Sheldon,"i am not trying to get her back. but, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
39581,Sheldon,you tramp.
39587,Sheldon,i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
39588,Sheldon,"with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, i would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
39591,Sheldon,"well, that’s enough of that. sorry to interrupt. you two enjoy your date. here’s a dollar for your troubles. get yourself some sour patch kids."
39593,Sheldon,"i present to you the relationship agreement. a binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of sheldon lee cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and amy farrah fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
39597,Sheldon,i got a splinter.
39607,Sheldon,was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
39610,Sheldon,nobel prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from stockholm.
39612,Sheldon,"so, what’s got you up? did you have a bad clam?"
39615,Sheldon,"oh, now perlmutter’s shaking the king’s hand. yeah, check for your watch, gustaf. he might have lifted it."
39616,Sheldon,and there’s the first zinger. ouch.
39617,Sheldon,"congratulations? the newcomb medal? oh, please. that’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
39618,Sheldon,"oh, good lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear leonard apart like this?"
39619,Sheldon,my point.
39622,Sheldon,"you clearly don’t. what my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
39625,Sheldon,this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard. one of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
39630,Sheldon,heated to precisely 183 degrees?
39635,Sheldon,you’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
39642,Sheldon,"i’m not going to say i told you so, but we could have killed him."
39650,Sheldon,a magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. this is an ordinary top hat. you’ve chosen that card freely. i do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
39653,Sheldon,it’s still there. takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
39659,Sheldon,"mm-hmm. mm-hmm. ooh, 101! air’s getting a bit thin up here."
39660,Sheldon,"well, that’s odd. we both washed up when we came in. it’s probably a euphemism for urination."
39661,Sheldon,"not much. although, i can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. i don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, i just melt inside."
39665,Sheldon,yes.
39676,Sheldon,"it’s appreciated. and if you ever manage to find a woman again, i’ll be glad to return the favour."
39677,Sheldon,i don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at sears.
39689,Sheldon,i told you.
39691,Sheldon,you ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
39702,Sheldon,"now, where were we? oh, yes. does anyone have any wood? oh, come on! i just want wood. why are you making it so hard?"
39710,Sheldon,really? i didn’t see you in there.
39712,Sheldon,in your pyjamas?
39717,Sheldon,"after you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
39719,Sheldon,here’s two dollars. go buy some beef jerky.
39722,Sheldon,leonard will be here in a moment. he’s looking for a different parking space.
39732,Sheldon,"hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. over the next 52 weeks, you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
39734,Sheldon,did you have fun doing it?
39737,Sheldon,"now, today’s episode of fun with flags is not fun, but it is important. flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. this edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…"
39760,Sheldon,"yeah, really? you think those hippies in washington and oregon can stop them?"
39762,Sheldon,"you make that joke every three months. i still don’t get it. leonard, wait. what are you doing?"
39766,Sheldon,you can’t go home. you have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
39768,Sheldon,"yeah, they have to, i’m a biter."
39778,Sheldon,"oh, your concern for me is touching. it will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
39783,Sheldon,"no, no. i was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
39786,Sheldon,and your father? alive?
39790,Sheldon,"can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? i see where your therapist was coming from."
39792,Sheldon,"not necessary. no. i found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
39806,Sheldon,"this is a bunsen burner. i’m a scientist, i know what i’m doing. oh, drat.  aw. it took me a gallon of urine to make that water."
39807,Sheldon,what are you proposing?
39811,Sheldon,"of course you do. it’s about you, like everything else.  oh, thank goodness. i don’t think i had it in me to make another glass of water."
39812,Sheldon,no.
39822,Sheldon,good one. and an electrical charge.
39824,Sheldon,"oh, oh, lord, that multiplication error! he thought he carried the one. but he didn’t."
39825,Sheldon,stop! i’m going to wet myself!
39831,Sheldon,bleeding from my ears.
39836,Sheldon,i have gps on my phone. i know you turned around.
39853,Sheldon,i intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
39854,Sheldon,you know what this place needs? a suggestion box.
39860,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
39861,Sheldon,maybe that’s because i’m not being challenged. it’s the same reason einstein failed math.
39868,Sheldon,"you know, i have ten fingers and ten toes. if i tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on."
39869,Sheldon,"ah, seeing as i’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. don’t let me have too many of those."
39874,Sheldon,i was not myself. i had lost a lot of thumb blood.
39879,Sheldon,fine. sorry.
39881,Sheldon,these shrimp are all the same size. there’s no the logical order to eat them in.
39882,Sheldon,"mm, indeed."
39887,Sheldon,shut it. offices are assigned by seniority. i arrived at the university first.
39899,Sheldon,you sure i can’t get you that cup of tea?
39904,Sheldon,"is he? well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. i’d smack you with a glove, but just last week i packed away my winter things."
39917,Sheldon,"aha! good question. it turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. no. it’s next door, in professor davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
39920,Sheldon,"no, i hate them, but it gets worse. there it is."
39923,Sheldon,"no. the vibration. we are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
39931,Sheldon,"oh, dear, mr. d’onofrio’s in the hospital. why do these things always happen to me?"
39933,Sheldon,"he’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. he’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. besides, mr. d’onofrio knows exactly how i like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in texas."
39946,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i’m looking for a barber and i’m running out of time. my hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. i mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it."
39950,Sheldon,yes. do you have something i could use as a cape?
39960,Sheldon,i don’t know. i could do anything. all bets are off. the world is my oyster. i got it. i’m going to put on my tuesday pyjamas tonight.
39964,Sheldon,leonard no sleep while i play bongos. bongo solo.
39969,Sheldon,"wherever the music takes me, kitten. i play bongos walking down the stairs.  oh! oh! never play bongos walking down the stairs."
39975,Sheldon,"at the end of the haircut, mr. d’onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
39980,Sheldon,the online game? bully!
39986,Sheldon,"yeah, please, amy! it’s got lightsabres!"
39990,Sheldon,then no. what else?
39992,Sheldon,"oh, it’s not your fault. i’ve been to the model train store. i’ve been to radio shack. this woman is impossible to shop for."
39994,Sheldon,"well, i took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
39998,Sheldon,"hello, penny. i just stopped by to bring you this gift."
40003,Sheldon,"all right, then, i have no choice but to go on to plan b."
40004,Sheldon,i’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
40006,Sheldon,all right.
40012,Sheldon,those women are prostitutes? you said they were raising money for stem cell research.
40017,Sheldon,that is the most sickeningly sweet thing i have ever experienced. and i am sipping kool-aid through a red vine.
40018,Sheldon,armin who?
40029,Sheldon,"oh, that was no joke. but i understand your confusion as i am our group’s resident cut-up."
40032,Sheldon,interrupting physicist.
40039,Sheldon,they’re mint in box.
40044,Sheldon,but it’s mint in box.
40045,Sheldon,"well, i’m not going to dignify that with a response."
40051,Sheldon,you’re the one who told me to play with it.
40055,Sheldon,"you know what you are? well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here."
40063,Sheldon,"yes. yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. yeah, let’s all be mad at stuart."
40066,Sheldon,i can’t because that was a lie. yours was broken in an earthquake. and that’s a lie.
40067,Sheldon,my mr spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. and when the toy broke i switched it for yours. later he encouraged me to do the right thing and i defied him. and then i was attacked by a gorn.
40081,Sheldon,"howard, please. this is stephen hawking. perhaps my only intellectual equal."
40088,Sheldon,oh!
40095,Sheldon,"he will, he’s really smart."
40102,Sheldon,what kinds of things?
40109,Sheldon,my mee-maw must never know of this. now will you give professor hawking my paper?
40115,Sheldon,"because if i don’t, he won’t give my paper to stephen hawking. he’s a famous physicist."
40120,Sheldon,or don quixote is a book about a donkey named hotay.
40125,Sheldon,what do you want me to do?
40126,Sheldon,"oh, no, you know, i’m not really the holding kind of… oh!"
40130,Sheldon,okay.
40133,Sheldon,"oh, i understand the confusion. i have never said that you are not good at what you do. it’s just that what you do is not worth doing."
40134,Sheldon,now will you give my paper to hawking?
40137,Sheldon,"professor hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
40138,Sheldon,i want to thank you for taking time to see me.
40146,Sheldon,"wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?"
40148,Sheldon,"all right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. now, as a human, i appreciate beethoven. as a fungus, i have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. and no thank you, expensive concessions. because as an algae, i’ll just snack on this sunlight."
40151,Sheldon,"boo, wine! but yay, trains. i’m in."
40153,Sheldon,"indeed. if i’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then i must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. jeepers! that’s yucky."
40155,Sheldon,oh. i guess you’re just friends with anybody.  aagh!
40156,Sheldon,"and, apparently, wil wheaton’s best friend."
40161,Sheldon,"jeepers, i’m drunk."
40164,Sheldon,"chicken broth. it seemed culturally appropriate. also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when i moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. so, as they say, two birds."
40175,Sheldon,"i must say, i was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. as i mentioned, the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the lego store is having a midnight madness sale. you ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
40180,Sheldon,"well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
40182,Sheldon,"i see what you’re doing. you’re attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work."
40189,Sheldon,i’m fine.
40198,Sheldon,i assume we’re talking about you now?
40200,Sheldon,"well, no wonder the women are winning."
40210,Sheldon,"i’ll do it, provided i can perform the ceremony in klingon."
40213,Sheldon,"oh, dear. i was afraid of this."
40219,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll do it in english, but it loses something. the need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. maybe because i’m so interesting all by myself. with that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own. the klingon would have made you cry."
40220,Sheldon,and the klingon high council…
40222,Sheldon,"i must admit, i can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. he can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. his dim, uncomprehending eyes. it’s like a cat in an airport carrying case."
40234,Sheldon,"oh, i’m glad you like it. raj picked it out."
40237,Sheldon,"yes, it is. there’s a loophole in the relationship agreement."
40241,Sheldon,i just had cobbler.
40251,Sheldon,i am talking to a man in space. if you don’t have the  then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street.
40255,Sheldon,excuse me. i didn’t authorize this.
40256,Sheldon,that’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
40260,Sheldon,"well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s raisinets."
40269,Sheldon,"so, if she wants to end her pair-bond with leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?"
40270,Sheldon,"string theory is complicated. that’s just yucky. don’t get any ideas. all right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. why doesn’t penny just end the relationship?"
40271,Sheldon,"how can she not be sure how she feels? you know, when i have a feeling, i know it. trains? love them. swordfish? i love them, too. they’re fish with a sword for a nose."
40273,Sheldon,"uh, fine. fyi, secret-keeping? hate it. hand-holding? not a fan. hammerhead shark? i love that thing. yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head."
40277,Sheldon,i can’t tell you.
40279,Sheldon,good night. i’m sorry. this is really important.
40282,Sheldon,you do?
40286,Sheldon,never mind. i still can’t tell you.
40288,Sheldon,you frightened me.
40290,Sheldon,"yeah, really? i’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when i do it, it’s weird?"
40302,Sheldon,thank you. coconut? what were you thinking? are you a hula girl?
40303,Sheldon,"yeah, just a heads-up: penny knows that you blabbed about leonard. she’s pretty mad."
40305,Sheldon,i’m sorry. wolowitz would never play that card.
40307,Sheldon,leonard? maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
40308,Sheldon,"yeah, for now. but that woman has a death wish, leonard. she talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. if i were you, i’d get a back-up."
40312,Sheldon,"yeah, settle down there, fake wolowitz. no one likes a kiss-up."
40315,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s journals and research papers i wrote as a child."
40321,Sheldon,"yeah, the point is higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps i’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my nobel prize."
40325,Sheldon,"you, really? you can assess the quality of my work? okay, um, here. i wrote this when i was five years old."
40327,Sheldon,"all right, ms. jenson. uh, before we begin, may i offer you a refreshment? water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?"
40333,Sheldon,"oh, well, thank you. welcome aboard."
40339,Sheldon,two cherries?
40346,Sheldon,the original title was “a rederivation of maxwell’s equations regarding electromagnetism”” i dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say i was a witch.
40348,Sheldon,"yeah, you had a good run, fake wolowitz. we’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the vhs tape, or, or leonard’s gym membership."
40354,Sheldon,"yes, it’s just that in all the years i’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. i was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened."
40355,Sheldon,i know.
40357,Sheldon,"yeah, once again, i know."
40362,Sheldon,it’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
40368,Sheldon,"wait, no, no. no. the word is polish. see, look. polish sausage. and the, the model of the solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus, a polish astronomer. and then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is madame curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized french citizen, was polish by birth."
40373,Sheldon,all right. let’s play physics fiesta.
40382,Sheldon,"hurry up, find him, find him."
40388,Sheldon,wait. i’m a little concerned. blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
40396,Sheldon,what kind of tea would you like?
40397,Sheldon,two tea bags in one cup? you’re not at a rave.
40405,Sheldon,what are you smiling at?
40406,Sheldon,"a tardis makes no sense. it’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. it has nothing to do with halloween. that being said, if you don’t get a tardis, you stink and your party stinks."
40408,Sheldon,yes.
40411,Sheldon,"look at that, the problem solved itself."
40412,Sheldon,what if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
40420,Sheldon,"friends! it’s words with friends! which stephen hawking and i officially are. now all i need is a bunk bed with a slide, i’ll have everything i’ve ever wanted since i was six years old."
40424,Sheldon,"yes. i play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. that ought to let the air out of your tyres, hawking."
40425,Sheldon,it is glorious. one of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. and i’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.
40426,Sheldon,what’s your point?
40429,Sheldon,"although, i could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . ethical conundrum avoided. thanks, brain."
40431,Sheldon,not challenging? i was humiliating the man. i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl.
40435,Sheldon,trying to use a jedi mind trick to control stephen hawking. play. play. ugh! he must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
40437,Sheldon,then suffer in silence. play. play. play.  stephen hawking.
40438,Sheldon,stephen hawking hates me.
40442,Sheldon,"hmm. beats me. now, i know hawking’s not busy because i can see he’s playing other people right now."
40448,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. no. i listened to your dumb thing. leonard, come back. leonard, come back. leonard, come back."
40453,Sheldon,"yeah, way ahead of you. i will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."
40458,Sheldon,"‘course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? and send."
40459,Sheldon,she sounds exactly like you.
40460,Sheldon,it’s stephen hawking.
40461,Sheldon,"professor hawking, how nice of you to call."
40462,Sheldon,"oh, me, too."
40464,Sheldon,"oh, i love brain teasers."
40469,Sheldon,"it’s true. in 1982, wil played the voice of martin the mouse in the secret of nimh. you moved me."
40470,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
40479,Sheldon,"yeah, i did, but then wil called amy a pain in the a-s-s. she got huffy and left, then wil and i headed out to dinner. that place really did remind me of my hometown. because there we also have a hometown buffet."
40489,Sheldon,"wow, amy’s mad and leonard was right. what a weird day."
40491,Sheldon,"i’ve been thinking about what happened, and i hope this gift will make things better."
40496,Sheldon,will that calm my nerves?
40497,Sheldon,sold.
40508,Sheldon," wil wheaton! wait, how many was that?"
40513,Sheldon,my fists are not up here because i’m milking a giant invisible cow. they’re up to beat an apology out of you.
40517,Sheldon,"i don’t know what she’s talking about, but i’m obligated to agree with her. she’s my girlfriend."
40530,Sheldon,"well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on earth are more attractive than you. that’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade."
40537,Sheldon,i thought you left a long time ago.
40540,Sheldon,"you don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know."
40542,Sheldon,"if a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. however, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. so, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on."
40545,Sheldon,that’s my parking spot.
40560,Sheldon,cookie.
40564,Sheldon,give me back my parking space.
40565,Sheldon,you don’t need an iron man helmet. you’re not iron man.
40566,Sheldon,keep a lookout. this place is swarming with campus security. they will not hesitate to scold us.
40569,Sheldon,"all right, colour me intrigued."
40577,Sheldon,no. that’s it. i am calling campus security. you prepare for the scolding of your life.
40581,Sheldon,just breaking in your new car.
40586,Sheldon,there is nothing to say. except i’m the bigger man. i’m not kidding. say it.
40593,Sheldon,is that your son?
40599,Sheldon,"you know what i like to do when i’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? i bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between spider-man and spiders."
40603,Sheldon,what can i say? i put the fun in funeral.
40609,Sheldon," amy. i made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. additionally, you are my girlfriend, and i care about your well-being."
40610,Sheldon,you’re welcome. now let’s get this over with.
40616,Sheldon,yes. all over it.
40617,Sheldon,"now you’re being a responsible patient. now, you may notice some tingling."
40618,Sheldon,"no. i need to get you down for a nap. and for some reason, that vaporub gets you all fired up. "
40623,Sheldon,"i got the results back. have you developed any of the following symptoms? a growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
40627,Sheldon,"oh, that seems overly harsh. i mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. you know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
40629,Sheldon,are you prepared to receive your punishment?
40631,Sheldon,"very well, then. get over my knee. let’s begin."
40638,Sheldon,"oh, where to begin? trees indoors. overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. and the absurd custom of one stocking. everyone knows socks belong in pairs. who uses one sock?"
40643,Sheldon,lucky.
40650,Sheldon,"it was simple. i combined a well-known historical fact about bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, mee-maw and pop-pop, singing christmas carols while i sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of legos."
40651,Sheldon,"w-w-wait. there’s still four more verses. you don’t sing a song and not finish it. hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. yonder peasant, who is he? where and what his dwelling? brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…"
40652,Sheldon,"ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. ba-da-bum."
40653,Sheldon,i think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
40654,Sheldon,melted snowmen? are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
40662,Sheldon,"yeah, i’m familiar with your work. c-minus was your gift."
40667,Sheldon,"my mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what i wanted for christmas. and i told you, my pop-pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. i missed him and i wanted him back."
40670,Sheldon,"well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots."
40675,Sheldon,"wait, uh, uh, hang on. in my defense…"
40676,Sheldon,"well, i must say, leonard, when i first heard your idea for giant jenga, i was sceptical."
40681,Sheldon,"well, that’s not acceptable. i mean, i’m her boss. she needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality."
40682,Sheldon,"oh, please. look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips."
40705,Sheldon,"hmm, let me think. nothing. i’m a delight."
40706,Sheldon, human resources department.
40712,Sheldon,"well, y-you, i-i’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…"
40719,Sheldon,"and thanks to you, i know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. and based on your behaviour, i don’t have to."
40720,Sheldon,"it has been pointed out to me that some of the things i said to you could be construed as offensive, and i would like to offer you my sincerest apology."
40723,Sheldon,"interesting. do you recall this conversation? leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? no, sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost."
40738,Sheldon,stealing is against the law!
40750,Sheldon,"scotty was on the original series, and we’re next generation. so, joke’s on you."
40751,Sheldon,"actually, it’s three against one."
40763,Sheldon,"so they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. that’s hard cheese, barry. you’re one of the good ones."
40766,Sheldon,tea is for when i’m upset. i’m not upset. the university’s forcing me to work with kripke. i’m outraged.
40768,Sheldon,"see, i did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. i am angrier than ever and filled with despair."
40770,Sheldon,"and yet, now you’re in my office. point, cooper. welcome to the thunderdome, kripke."
40772,Sheldon,how do i know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
40780,Sheldon,"i read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as i had thought. it’s his mommy."
40786,Sheldon,"oh, dear. now i’m not even smarter than you."
40788,Sheldon,"all right, geez. what a grouch."
40800,Sheldon,"penny, all my life, i have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. but i’m working on it, you know? just recently, i had to put vaporub on amy’s chest. a year ago, that would have been unthinkable."
40803,Sheldon,"well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant."
40808,Sheldon,can we get back to work?
40810,Sheldon,"that’s a good one. dumbledore dies in that one. yeah, i know, i didn’t see it coming, either."
40811,Sheldon,"you brought up the subject. i contributed an interesting fact on that subject. it’s called the art of conversation. okay, your turn."
40816,Sheldon,"what? i’m annoying? you criticize my behaviour all the time. sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. you’re impossible."
40818,Sheldon,you pick that up right now.
40819,Sheldon,"roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the american flag, cannot touch the ground."
40830,Sheldon,"that would be ideal. if a person like that existed, i would sign on, no further questions asked."
40837,Sheldon,"hey, good buddy. so, uh, i was just talking to amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing."
40839,Sheldon,"okay. amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so i need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. that’s a lot of product."
40845,Sheldon,"you gave leonard somewhere to go. thanks to you, amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. like i’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it."
40847,Sheldon,you think this is fast? it’s just a matter of time before i see amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
40849,Sheldon,that’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
40851,Sheldon,is it kung pao chicken?
40853,Sheldon,spicy mustard from the korean deli?
40854,Sheldon,"yes. amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"
40860,Sheldon,you did.
40865,Sheldon,i thought we were talking about the other thing.
40869,Sheldon,or maybe she doesn’t. let’s find out.
40872,Sheldon,"ah, alex, excellent. i have a research problem that i believe you can help with."
40883,Sheldon,i think i’ll keep it for myself.
40885,Sheldon,hello.
40888,Sheldon,what is that?
40896,Sheldon,"it’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend."
40905,Sheldon,"gosh, penny, what’d you have for breakfast? a big glass of good question juice? the nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. spread your legs, invite them in."
40909,Sheldon,i know. i’m still learning to control it.
40917,Sheldon,"oh, that sounds terrible. why would i want to do that?"
40927,Sheldon,"you know, i haven’t seen raj in several days. is he no longer a part of our social group? and if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? perhaps, this time, we go latin."
40930,Sheldon,"all right, let’s get this stupid play over with."
40931,Sheldon,why?
40936,Sheldon,"how can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?"
40937,Sheldon,i got the b word.
40939,Sheldon,helping anyone. people should take care of themselves.
40940,Sheldon,i’m not saying people can’t use tools. even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
40942,Sheldon,"howard’s disturbing recollections aside, i don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work."
40946,Sheldon,"no, you’re a tool i was using to make my point."
40951,Sheldon,"oh, hold on. while i’m comfortable speaking about science, i’m not sure i know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. better google it."
40953,Sheldon,"this must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut."
8192,Howard,a little snack. you got any string cheese?
10240,Howard,"okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster."
10252,Howard,we’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
10254,Howard,yeah.
8207,Howard,cheers. you realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
8210,Howard,"hey, raj, wanna see a new magic trick i’ve been working on?"
6163,Howard,it’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.
8211,Howard,"here, shuffle these."
8213,Howard,"now remember your card, put it back in the deck."
6166,Howard,and you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
10259,Howard,but you didn’t hear what it was.
8218,Howard,"you ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?"
8219,Howard,"that’s your card, right?"
10271,Howard,with comfy seats.
6178,Howard,but does it have peanut oil?
10275,Howard,"and a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
6180,Howard,.
6181,Howard,haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless russian?
8228,Howard,you’re right.
6183,Howard,"he can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented goddess!"
10279,Howard,hey. i didn’t think you’d make it.
6185,Howard,what’s his problem?
8234,Howard,three of clubs. 
8237,Howard,incoming.
6190,Howard,"how about liquid coolant? maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch pvc…"
10294,Howard,like behavior modification?
6200,Howard,leonard look out!
8248,Howard,"redheaded troll, goes by the name of glumly. according to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy."
10301,Howard,"oh, of course. what did you guys want to talk about?"
6207,Howard,"i disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. or hits you with the pepper spray. "
8257,Howard,"also, tonight’s the sabbath and my mother and i have a tradition of lighting the candles and"
10308,Howard,not a lot.
8263,Howard,"i know. it’s her superpower. well, that and jiggling her arm fat."
6216,Howard,"so, how did it go with lesley? "
8266,Howard,"next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train."
8272,Howard,"hmm? oh, i’m sorry. i was somewhere else."
8275,Howard,yeah. i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
8276,Howard,sure.
6229,Howard,"if you’re into music, i happen to be a human beatbox. "
6230,Howard,what’s the matter?
6232,Howard,"hey, look, it’s doctor stud!"
8280,Howard,"yes, what?"
6234,Howard,i put it there. 
10331,Howard,that’s fine. i don’t care.
10333,Howard,"hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating."
6239,Howard,a boy-girl party?
8287,Howard,most of those guys live in texas.
10339,Howard,"bernie’s really excited. i could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling."
10340,Howard,yep.
8295,Howard,"nice. okay, rook to transporter pad. and he comes out at leonard’s queen’s bishop"
6248,Howard,"hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. i believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough. "
6250,Howard,"you know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on vh1 about how to pick up girls. "
6258,Howard,no.
6259,Howard,if we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time. 
6260,Howard,"see a penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck."
8312,Howard,"that’s good to hear, ’cause i’ve got some news."
6265,Howard,"ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
8314,Howard,"so i knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
10365,Howard,"told you, not funny."
6271,Howard,"i’m sorry, i should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is wolowitz."
8320,Howard,"well, maybe. mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
10367,Howard,why? your father barely speaks to your mother.
6275,Howard,really?
6276,Howard,"yay! if you’ll excuse me, i have some bar-mizvah bonds to cash. "
10372,Howard,i’m not answering that. it’s a trap.
8326,Howard,"bernie, wait!"
6279,Howard,"sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle. "
10373,Howard,and here i am in the trap. you just keep talking. i’m gonna chew my leg off.
8329,Howard,what’s wrong with the bathroom here?
6285,Howard,"me too. of course, it speaks to me culturally. "
8334,Howard,jews have been asking that for centuries. there’s no real good answer.
10384,Howard,i love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
6297,Howard,"oh, yeah, i tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. "
6298,Howard,"oh, no it isn’t. "
8345,Howard,uh..
10395,Howard,mmm. it’s just columns of random numbers. toss it.
8353,Howard,yes!
8354,Howard,"sheldon, yes! everybody’s a doctor but me!"
10404,Howard,"i guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
6311,Howard,"i’ve got one, hey leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed…."
6313,Howard,"i just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
10413,Howard,i thought you did.
10416,Howard,"well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it."
6321,Howard,"wait a minute, farminfarmian is speaking and you’re bogarding the symposium. "
6322,Howard,"no, no, you’re quark-blocking us. "
8370,Howard,you’re not in love with penny.
10417,Howard,don’t yell at me. you’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
6325,Howard,"yeah, uh, break a leg."
8374,Howard,maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
6327,Howard,i’m game.
8376,Howard,"let it go, sheldon. i’ll get you a jamba juice on the way home."
10425,Howard,"again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys."
10430,Howard,"i said, stay out of it."
8384,Howard,"you know, the virtual pickle tickle. the digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
10432,Howard,how do you know it wasn’t leonard?
10436,Howard,"on three. one, two, three."
8389,Howard,"just his head, right?"
10437,Howard,"it was an accident. oh, my god. oh, my god."
8391,Howard,"almost. really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
10440,Howard,"when i was ten, i was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. i mean, i tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. the worst part was it smelled delicious."
6346,Howard,"unless sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. "
10443,Howard,i am tasting a lot of slim jim.
6355,Howard,"because you didn’t keep true.  okay, turn right. "
6358,Howard,"oh, i guess you didn’t. "
8407,Howard,"why not? it’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, mom’s there to help. you know, when she tells the three little pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
10456,Howard,maybe you need to do something more productive.
6363,Howard,"you know, sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. "
10459,Howard,you happy? now you can relax.
8413,Howard,"the bugs only come here because you’re their queen! listen, how about this. before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like."
6366,Howard,"i’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello."
8414,Howard,"sure she would. ma, do you mind if bernadette stays here this weekend?"
6372,Howard,go away. 
10470,Howard,"you believe in your religion, i’ll believe in mine."
8423,Howard,problem solved.
8424,Howard,"oh, come on, honey. she’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. you can’t see anything. i go in all the time."
6378,Howard,what about biology? 
6379,Howard,"you know, biology? the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. "
6380,Howard,"yeah, so, when i was fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. "
8426,Howard,"morning, mom."
8429,Howard,is there any butter?
10474,Howard,like am i dressed okay?
8432,Howard,"well, i guess i’ll cut these by myself."
10477,Howard,raj.
10478,Howard,"raj, you just got a text. the probe turned on. it’s fine."
10481,Howard,"okay, who was he talking to, emily or cinnamon? i want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it."
8439,Howard,"so, what’s for dinner?"
8440,Howard,"uh, i don’t want to show any more of your friends how i can fit in the booster seats."
10494,Howard,"that was the last one, i promise. we won’t play any more."
10496,Howard,"hmm, it would. okay, back to emily or cinnamon? how can such a little girl eat such a big steak?"
8451,Howard,no.
6404,Howard,outweigh the needs of the few. 
8452,Howard,she doesn’t know what james earl jones sounds like.
8454,Howard,"she says, do you play an instrument?"
8455,Howard,do you hear yourself
8456,Howard,texting bernadette that i’m gonna be late.
10500,Howard,"hey, your paper got mentioned on the quantum diaries physics blog."
6410,Howard,some of us might have the correct answers too. 
10505,Howard,this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
6412,Howard,okay. 
10508,Howard,"well, i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face."
6414,Howard,so who’d he get to be on his team.
6415,Howard,"that sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians. "
8462,Howard,you? i made you smooth. you were an idiot.
8463,Howard,"it might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
8464,Howard,okay.
10515,Howard,"i appreciate that, and i’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?"
8468,Howard,and she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
6422,Howard,"well, we tried. just have to face sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. a-mano. "
10518,Howard,"well, i’m her son, and i say it’s not okay."
10520,Howard,your store? my mother gave you the money to reopen. i’m not going anywhere.
8473,Howard,smart. whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
8474,Howard,"she says, sure, what about him?"
8475,Howard,"right. are you a gold digger or not? oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? mind your own something business and go something yourself. oh, wait, i got this now."
8477,Howard,"thanks for dinner, buddy."
6430,Howard,a time machine from the movie the time machine? 
6431,Howard,"oh, that’s cool."
10525,Howard,no.
6434,Howard,you lucky duck. 
6435,Howard,why don’t we share it? we’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.
6436,Howard,"it’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. "
10532,Howard,i really did mean first.
6439,Howard,talk about your chick magnets. 
10535,Howard,"oh, okay, great. so, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet earth."
10539,Howard,"oh, thank god. it’s okay, she’s here. ma’s here."
8495,Howard,"hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when i was 11. we never saw him again."
10543,Howard,"oh, bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  hey, what’s up?"
8497,Howard,really?
10549,Howard,"okay, calm down. there’s probably something jammed behind it. just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there."
10552,Howard,"okay, let me see the damage."
6458,Howard,"nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… bam!  howard wolowitz. "
8508,Howard,"well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause i’m not just gonna stop with the space station. yeah, i want to go to the moon, i want to go to mars. i want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
6462,Howard,"destiny, thy name is anaheim. "
6463,Howard,"come on, shelly, she’s family."
6464,Howard,"i’ll walk you to your car. you’re in structure 3 level c, right? "
10558,Howard,we should hang up.
6466,Howard,can i get a hallelujah. 
10559,Howard,"but we’re not going to, are we?"
10564,Howard,"stuart, we’re here."
8517,Howard,"oh, me? no. thanks, i’m good. i’m really just trying not to burst into flames."
6470,Howard,"yeah, well my people invented circumcision. you’re welcome!"
8518,Howard,he says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
6472,Howard,"okay, you two have to back off."
8521,Howard,we can’t beat him. he’s just too smart.
8522,Howard,who had money on faints?
10567,Howard,"oh, my god."
6476,Howard,"i’m warning you, i was judo champion at math camp. "
6477,Howard,who are you to decide that?
6478,Howard,wait a minute. leonard made you aware of that? 
10575,Howard,"no. if i find my foreskin, i’m gonna kill myself."
6480,Howard,"look, we have to settle this."
6481,Howard,"oh, you poor, deluded bastard. "
10579,Howard,i’m never gonna talk to her again.
6484,Howard,"come on, come on, get up. "
10582,Howard,"hey, guys."
6487,Howard,"then you are in for a treat. behold, an ordinary cane. "
8535,Howard,i guess.
8538,Howard,what do you want us to do about it?
6495,Howard,"fine. if i do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. i’m just kidding, yes you can. can you bring a friend? "
8544,Howard,i have a masters degree from m.i.t.
10597,Howard,that’s not fair. it’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
8553,Howard,"we’re not wearing cowboy hats, sheldon. it looks ridiculous."
10601,Howard,"that’s right, okay, raj can play for me."
8555,Howard,very.
10603,Howard,"come on, raj. you are the king kong of ping-pong. you are the menace of table tennis. put her away, ’cause i don’t have a third one. yes. woo."
6509,Howard,"so, listen, the new art is showing the revised definitive cut of blade runner."
8557,Howard,sorry. creepy tepee.
8558,Howard,you are.
10605,Howard,"don’t listen to her. you and i go way back, we’re like brothers."
10608,Howard,"you know, i thought our friendship meant more to you."
8563,Howard,"hey, we’re here to support you, buddy."
6516,Howard,"i don’t know, it was just there."
8566,Howard,like the black death and europe.
8567,Howard,how exactly would these glasses work?
8569,Howard,completely empty box. if you’d like to examine it?
8572,Howard,how is this lying?
6533,Howard,"look, i’ve done my best but he wants to go home and i don’t know how to stop him. "
8582,Howard,"well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. this is good practice. i mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
10631,Howard,"thank you. come on. and i’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy."
6536,Howard,pees hep me! 
6537,Howard,fank-u. 
10633,Howard,"i’m surprised you could hear me with this thin mint in your ear. yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
10639,Howard,sure.
6544,Howard,what’s this? 
8592,Howard,"all right, settle down. red light. red light, red light! okay, we’re fine."
6546,Howard,"you know, i’m really glad you decided to learn mandarin."
10640,Howard,"yeah. well, i like music, i like science, i like making fun of sheldon. hit it."
10641,Howard,hey.
6549,Howard,"not now, i have a blog to find. "
6551,Howard,"apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which i cannot find anywhere. "
8599,Howard,"i don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
8601,Howard,you should keep it. you could wear it again sometime.
10647,Howard,first take a picture with me.
6555,Howard,"for god’s sake, sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken."
6556,Howard,"boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. "
6557,Howard,"oh, hey, leonard, how was your date?"
6558,Howard,"you should thank us. when future generations try to determine why your relationship with penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. "
8605,Howard,really? that’s great. what?
8609,Howard,"i would love that. but what is that behind your ear? oh, look, it’s a condom."
10657,Howard,exactly what sheldon and howard said.
6563,Howard,give him time.
6568,Howard,bye  
8617,Howard,"leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you."
10667,Howard,it’s not always.
6573,Howard,"get out of bed, we’re switching."
8624,Howard,great.
8627,Howard,uh-huh.
8633,Howard,i got pretty exciting nasa news today. next week i fly to houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
10681,Howard,it means the calibration failed. we have to start over.
8635,Howard,"absolutely. but when ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid."
10686,Howard,"sheldon, i have a master’s degree in engineering. i wipe my bottom with warranties. except for applecare. that pays for itself in the long run."
8639,Howard,"yeah, terrific. the other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named crash."
8640,Howard,"yeah, it’s great, but i told you, i don’t get to pick my nickname. it has to come from the other astronauts."
6593,Howard,i’d hit that.
10689,Howard,"well, i, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
6596,Howard,"come on, sheldon, there’s so few places i can wear my jester costume."
10693,Howard,hey.
6600,Howard,that’s what makes it get all funky.
10698,Howard,suicide.
8651,Howard,not now!
8654,Howard,e.
6607,Howard,"yes, you are."
10704,Howard,"all right, the power supply is reconnected. i think we’re back in business. let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. sheldon, we got wifi?"
8657,Howard,no. you should go.
6610,Howard,so what’s your news?
6611,Howard,"oh, i’d so do her."
10705,Howard,gps?
10710,Howard,"hang on, hang on. it’s working. i did it."
6615,Howard,you were a colossal ass-hat.
10711,Howard,"no idea, but i did it."
6617,Howard,"well then fake it. look at me, i could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but i’m bigger than that."
6620,Howard,we just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
6621,Howard,dr gablehauser.
6622,Howard,"wait a minute, i called dibs on fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe."
6623,Howard,told you.
10716,Howard,kiss-ass.
6625,Howard,they gave him an assistant? if i want a new pen i have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
8674,Howard,i’m not signing a pre-nup.
6627,Howard,"gee, i’d love to raj, but i can’t make it."
6629,Howard,"hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about penny any more, look, there are hundreds of croatian women just waiting for you to contact them."
10727,Howard,how are you saying that with a straight face?
10728,Howard,"buddy, other than jenny craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life."
6633,Howard,"it can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the simpsons."
6635,Howard,lucky?
8684,Howard,i wonder how long sheldon’s got.
10735,Howard,"oh, i’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer."
6641,Howard,and he should know a lot of women.
6642,Howard,"no, just for the fun of it, i’m gonna take his side."
10737,Howard,good luck.
6647,Howard,"yeah, but albert einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
10744,Howard,i’m not saying anything bad. just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
10747,Howard,"yeah. i mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
8700,Howard,"it’s pretty neat. you get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
8703,Howard,"i got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and i have a hunch i packed a little light."
6656,Howard,black it is.
10751,Howard,i don’t know. sounds pretty bad. penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
10753,Howard,leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
10754,Howard,"you think it’s hard having one wife, try having two."
8708,Howard,"i ate a butterfly. it was so small and beautiful, but i was so hungry."
10756,Howard,"look, i know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself."
6662,Howard,woof.
8710,Howard,"thanks, honey, but i can’t quit. if i do, i’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
6669,Howard,my mom’s making a brisket tonight.
10767,Howard,i’d like to spongebob her squarepants.
8721,Howard,"now, i downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. "
8726,Howard,"fine, i’ll change.  "
10775,Howard,we are going to me-hi-co.
8730,Howard,"hey, raj, you didn’t send your rsvp in. i’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding."
10780,Howard,"hey, i have to return this van. keep your creative juices in your pants."
8733,Howard,"come on, who is it?"
10782,Howard,it’s the tyre.
8735,Howard,hindus do the same thing. except they leave room for a cow.
8737,Howard,well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
6690,Howard,then you’re not invited to our wedding.
8739,Howard,"yep, one sec.  ah, good. ma would have killed me if she’d found out i’d broke my retainer."
10785,Howard,"no. i took the other four off and when i got to this one, i thought, you know, i’m in a rut, let’s shake things up."
10789,Howard,what makes you say that?
6694,Howard,"one of us, one of us."
10791,Howard,we have plenty of food for the animals.
6696,Howard,"when we find it, you want to go with us?"
8745,Howard,"why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you."
10795,Howard,great. couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
10799,Howard,why?
10807,Howard,thor versus indiana jones? you just blew my filking mind.
8764,Howard,"oh, you can’t be serious."
8765,Howard,hang on. are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
6718,Howard,"oh, thank god, you’re here."
10815,Howard,"you are such a wimp. she didn’t like it, now you don’t like it."
6721,Howard,"yeah, baby, i’ll be right in."
10819,Howard,i don’t need this. i’m quitting the band.
8774,Howard,"you don’t seem to be understanding the english word no. maybe a different language will help. russian, nyet. chinese, bu. japanese, iie. klingon, qo. binary coded ascii, 0110111001101111."
6727,Howard,i’ll call ya.
10822,Howard,"indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
10826,Howard,"the other day, when she tried to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her."
10827,Howard,"you make an excellent point. ooh, i think i’m getting a runner’s high."
10828,Howard,"well said, puss."
8781,Howard,"sheldon, come on back."
6738,Howard,it’s leonard!
10835,Howard,i thought you were puss in boots.
10837,Howard,"sheldon, instead of focusing on amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl."
8794,Howard,what’s the matter?
6747,Howard,"so, anyway, lisa, i just wanted to tell you again how much i enjoyed the other night, and again, i’m sorry for how it ended. but again, if you could let me know about friday. my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get."
6748,Howard,"anyway, call me. it’s howard."
8796,Howard,"hey, i gave you first crack at it."
6750,Howard,i’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
8797,Howard,he’s mean to me all the time. you’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
8800,Howard,"oh, guys, i just remembered. i got you some hawking souvenirs."
10842,Howard,maybe he’s not for you.
10847,Howard,"hang on, i’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. the man who will father your children. okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
8803,Howard,i should have sent you to the custom car cover place in altadena. they have her pattern on file.
6756,Howard,"i’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on."
8804,Howard,i don’t know.
10850,Howard,who’s dave?
8808,Howard,"well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
6762,Howard,"so, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? sounds serious."
8811,Howard,i gave it to him three days ago. he was really impressed. he wants to meet you.
10858,Howard,i’m listening.
8813,Howard,"sounds like loads of fun, but i promised bernadette no strippers."
10860,Howard,"no way. no, this is the room i associate the most with my mom."
8817,Howard,she was my second cousin.
10865,Howard,your dad’s on your side.
6774,Howard,"okay, he’s invited for dinner in the bottle city of kandor. he miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little kryptonian tetherball?” superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible kryptonian perspiration."
10872,Howard,why wouldn’t i want to hear it?
10878,Howard,why are you still here?
10879,Howard,"all right, i admit that i don’t help out a lot. and i need to work on that. but if we had a kid, it would be different."
10881,Howard,"and this an actual i’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar i’ll think about it”?"
6786,Howard,"gather round, kids, it’s time for sheldon’s beloved christmas special."
6787,Howard,"and that, charlie brown, is what boredom is all about."
8834,Howard,"all right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
10888,Howard,isn’t that a little unreasonable?
8841,Howard,howard wolowitz.
8843,Howard,"well, that’s it. my orders have been rescinded. i am officially no go to space."
10894,Howard,"i have an idea. what if we put a post on craigslist that says world-class caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. if interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."
10895,Howard,"well, this is actually an interesting social experiment."
10899,Howard,"well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a saturday night."
8853,Howard,it looks like i’m going into space after all.
6808,Howard,"wait a minute. this isn’t flirting, you’re serious."
8857,Howard,"you’re right. i, i can’t go to space. i have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. i’ll call him back."
6810,Howard,"i’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
10905,Howard,maybe we did make the test too difficult.
10906,Howard,"it’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty."
6813,Howard,i don’t want to talk to anybody.
6816,Howard,you make me want to kill myself.
6819,Howard,ma!
8867,Howard,"no, thank you. i’m allergic."
6822,Howard,"fine, you’re sorry. good-bye."
10919,Howard,"all right, i think i’m getting into a groove here. this isn’t so bad."
8872,Howard,"i’m sorry, i didn’t know, is this going to… well, i should sit… may i be seat… well, i’ll just sit."
6825,Howard,"marcy grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, marcy grossman is the month of may…"
6826,Howard,"i guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, marcy grossman, marcy grossman, marcy grossman, talkin’ ’bout marcy…"
6827,Howard,grossman.
8873,Howard,"i’m aware of that, sir."
10926,Howard,"wh, what are you doing here?"
6836,Howard,"well, don’t get the wrong idea. the way i see it, i’m halfway to pity sex."
8884,Howard,"good! good! oh, quick question, i missed it in the briefing. how much urine do these suits hold?"
10932,Howard,thank you.
10935,Howard,"mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, god, where’s the memo with what we do now?"
8891,Howard,"okay, but i’m going to have to get it back from you so i can take it to the international space station. that way, when i come home, you will have a star that was actually in space."
6844,Howard,"that’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
10939,Howard,we did raise the roof that night.
8896,Howard,but i’m leaving in two days.
6851,Howard,"me, me. let it be me."
10947,Howard,"damn. i don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or i’m his. hey, trent just liked our comment."
6853,Howard,oh come on. what do i have to do?
6854,Howard,"suddenly i’m looking pretty good, huh?"
6855,Howard,you gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
10953,Howard,"after that, all i did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until i found his twitter handle."
8907,Howard,"you know, we could always drive to vegas and get married."
6860,Howard,it’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad jew.
6861,Howard,he was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
6862,Howard,"yeah, raj, what are you saying?"
8911,Howard,that’s great.
10957,Howard,i can’t watch.
6866,Howard,you want the valley of fire? it’s right here.
6867,Howard,what is it?
8915,Howard,what happens on the tenth time?
8917,Howard,"fantastic four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. the one where mr. fantastic and the invisible girl get married."
10964,Howard,what are we gonna do?!
10967,Howard,"it’s like going with your grandpa. instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
6875,Howard,"penny, come on, we were just finding our sound."
10975,Howard,he’s right.
6880,Howard,"so, she’s close to curing diabetes?"
6881,Howard,"wow, you must be very proud."
8931,Howard,how about calling her my wife?
10979,Howard,"well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? then you’ll get to talk to her."
8933,Howard,"ma, please. everyone from nasa is listening to this phone call."
8934,Howard,"okay, ma, great talking to you. gotta go. well, space is ruined."
10983,Howard,that was incredible.
6888,Howard,why is it always my responsibility?
10985,Howard,"what is it, stuart?"
6891,Howard,that was close.
10987,Howard,what’s up?
6896,Howard,why don’t i run away and you cover me?
10995,Howard,"well, i was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave."
10996,Howard,"as long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
8949,Howard,"stop it, ma. i’m sure i can get bernie to come around."
8952,Howard,"hey, i’m a grown man. i’m gonna live with my wife. my mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own."
11002,Howard,of course not. he drove us crazy. like when you were gonna make that pie and stuart ate all the blueberries.
6909,Howard,"okay, i didn’t want to say anything ’cause i know you and leslie have a little history."
6910,Howard,"great, ’cause i’ve been dying to say something."
8959,Howard,it’s better. i wake up every morning and i just can’t believe i’m on this incredible adventure.
11006,Howard,glad to hear it.
6913,Howard,"court-martial, schmort-martial, leslie winkle is the fifth girl i’ve ever had sex with. i mean, for free."
8961,Howard,"funny. we’re always giving each other a hard time up here. it’s kind of like being in a frat. you know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings."
8965,Howard,bye.
6918,Howard,"oh, it’s great. everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out."
11014,Howard,wow. i’m impressed.
8969,Howard,the other astronauts are being mean to me.
11018,Howard,"ooh, check out the stripper pole."
6924,Howard,are you jewish?
8972,Howard,what am i supposed to say?
8973,Howard,"great, i’ll do that when i want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie."
11020,Howard,"i’m just saying, instead of let it go, she should really sing, look at me hiding in a freezer like a dove bar."
6928,Howard,"what am i supposed to do, leonard? there’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. you understand, right?"
6929,Howard,"nevertheless, i must depart. by the way, did i tell you? leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to geneva to check out the cern supercollider."
11021,Howard,"here we are talking about frozen, and yet, you got burned."
11024,Howard,you should. he’s really looked.
11025,Howard,hi.
8981,Howard,"okay, here it is. i really miss gravity. can you drop something so i can watch it fall?"
11027,Howard,"he does, and he has the lilo & stitch collector plates to prove it."
6935,Howard,thanks.
8984,Howard,"well, remember the soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?"
11032,Howard,really? so it’s okay if i fl…
8986,Howard,"i don’t know how much longer i can take this. i can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. i’m down to my last three tums."
11034,Howard,what?
11038,Howard,"okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind i’m dumping emily."
8991,Howard,"better. much better. the other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. oooh. attention, people of earth. tonight, there will be two moons in the sky."
8992,Howard,whee! whee!
11041,Howard,hello.
6947,Howard,for taking daffodils to your unicorn.
8995,Howard,"i missed you, too. where are the guys?"
11044,Howard,you’ve been talking about breaking up with emily forever. why don’t you just do it already?
6956,Howard,"um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. one, i saw her first."
6957,Howard,"fair enough. but then let me move on to number two, unlike you, i can actually talk to women when i’m sober."
11052,Howard,"i hope you don’t think i’m just saying this because it’s valentine’s day, but, i love you so much."
11053,Howard,"well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?"
11056,Howard,"to make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. if it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. yeah."
6963,Howard,what?
6964,Howard,what’s going on?
6965,Howard,"placebo, you say. interesting."
6966,Howard,raj.
6967,Howard,look.
9012,Howard,who is that?
11060,Howard,"no, i’m not okay. wild rabbits can have rabies."
11065,Howard,"good. thank you. oh, okay, there is a test. all they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
9019,Howard,former dentist. i need a new one now that i know where his hands have been.
6973,Howard,"okay, here’s another one. if you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter, you’d be summer winter."
6976,Howard,fair enough. i’ll leave you in peace.
6979,Howard,terminator broke my phone.
11075,Howard,"but how’s this all gonna work? do we get a nanny? i mean, can we afford a nanny? and if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. we can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid."
11077,Howard,"how’s it gonna be okay? look at me, i’m a mess. and that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. and that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny."
9030,Howard,i don’t think so.
6984,Howard,i think i bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
9032,Howard,"oh, thank you so much. i’ve been having the worst night. i just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, i went to my mom…"
6986,Howard,you’re kidding. any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
11083,Howard,"a million dollars? god, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. that’s it, i got to start earning more money right now."
6988,Howard,"uh, i’ve seen this before."
11085,Howard,"you’re right, it is, i’m just a little overwhelmed right now."
11086,Howard,"well, look at this. i bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. he can have all the kids he wants."
6991,Howard,please. dateline could use it to attract predators.
9042,Howard,"that reminds me, i was thinking about wearing my nasa jumpsuit as a costume. but then i realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"
6995,Howard,"oh, stop with the fake third world crap. your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
11092,Howard,"hey. in your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?"
11093,Howard,"well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?"
11098,Howard,"if this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
9051,Howard,"i love you, too. i can’t tell you how many times i dreamed i was in bed here with you when i was… you know. what, i can’t even point?"
7006,Howard,"oh, actually i’m, uh, living with a woman in altadena. purely platonic, she’s also my maid."
11103,Howard,i’m sorry i freaked out this morning. i want you to know i’m done being scared.
11106,Howard,"i’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. i love you, bernie.  havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me."
7013,Howard,i know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
9061,Howard,i’m sorry. i just don’t want to go.
11110,Howard,don’t say that to him.
7016,Howard,"according to alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on csi."
7017,Howard,here we go.
9066,Howard,"great, now i’m in trouble. you happy?"
11111,Howard,"really? you’re ahead of bale? the man who personified the words, i’m batman."
11115,Howard,what? you gotta be kidding me?
9069,Howard,"then why are you trying to take this away from me? being an astronaut is the coolest thing i’m ever gonna do. if i stop talking about it, then i’m just…"
9071,Howard,you’re just saying that.
11121,Howard,can you imagine if we make money with this?
7026,Howard,"let it go, sheldon."
11123,Howard,seventy-five percent?
7028,Howard,"oh, come on! i need this for my batman collection."
7029,Howard,rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock?
7030,Howard,you let go.
9078,Howard,why?
11126,Howard,"we can’t. it says on their web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with."
7033,Howard,who’s up for sheldon-free saturday?
11127,Howard,"either way, i get nothing."
7035,Howard,"see you, stuart."
7036,Howard,yes.
9083,Howard,"one time when i was working with him, he said that johnny depp was in the matrix. i told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. so i looked it up online and showed him. well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. and then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."
9084,Howard,terrible.
9087,Howard,"so, now all you have to do is let him win."
11130,Howard,"you can do it, sheldon."
7043,Howard,"look, there are plenty of bars in los angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
9091,Howard,don’t take it personally. she likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
11141,Howard,here we go with the ironclad logic again.
11143,Howard,hey.
11146,Howard,see? this is what happens every time we work together.
11147,Howard,i’m on board.
11148,Howard,"article three, as it pertains to this project, dr. sheldon cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward howard wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the ghost rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
7053,Howard,"wait, is this your card or isn’t it? trust me, this was their card."
11149,Howard,"all right, let’s sign this."
11154,Howard,"there’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
11155,Howard,"while we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with teflon tape."
11156,Howard,i don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
11157,Howard,"what can i say, i play hard, i solder even harder."
9115,Howard,"okay, i have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. you are now the only woman in my life who i’ll see naked in the bathroom."
7068,Howard,i don’t want to go anywhere.
7069,Howard,"it could be fun. i know my weekend’s wide open, now that…"
7070,Howard,now? right now?
9118,Howard,"she was just so sad all the time. i was the only person who could cheer her up. well, me and ben and jerry."
9119,Howard,"you know, she’s why i first got into magic. i would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. and part way through the act, i would say i needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. i can still remember the way she’d smile. for a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was."
9121,Howard,"no, but i want to live here."
11165,Howard,but we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
11166,Howard,"well, i lie a lot."
11167,Howard,"well, i keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
11169,Howard,i know. i want to make him feel bad.
11170,Howard,hi.
7079,Howard,"seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?"
11172,Howard,yeah. anywhere you want.
11175,Howard,ready for dinner?
11177,Howard,"did you get graham crackers? i mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?"
7083,Howard,yeah. excuse me for a moment.
9132,Howard,"no, you didn’t."
11179,Howard,really?
11180,Howard,"oh. well, i guess that’s kind of sweet."
11182,Howard,what the hell are you watching?
11186,Howard,so he can be part of the experience?
9145,Howard,thank you.
7099,Howard,"i’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then i’ll tell them."
7102,Howard,"yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station. we gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
9151,Howard,what?
9155,Howard,i don’t know. the solution to an equation?
11206,Howard,"hey, look at that. it’s weird again."
11208,Howard,"well, give me a second."
9161,Howard,why would you know that?
11210,Howard,we did.
11211,Howard,you didn’t.
7116,Howard,"damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations."
7117,Howard,"okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. "
9164,Howard,not me.
11212,Howard,but batman is a man. you’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. that’s just man-man.
11213,Howard,so does that answer your question?
9169,Howard,"million dollar camera, ten dollar lock."
11217,Howard,i guess i am lucky.
9171,Howard,wormhole generator test? 
7124,Howard,we could sit on the left side of the couch.
11219,Howard,"i’m not sure if i’m hoping for a boy or a girl. i mean, if it’s a boy, i’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. which means i’m gonna have to google how to play catch. if it’s a girl, i mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are."
7126,Howard,to the north pole?
11220,Howard,there you go again.
9178,Howard,"yep. for as long as i can keep my mother out of it. if you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294."
11228,Howard,as long as i don’t have to watch with him.
9182,Howard,are you listening to yourself?
9188,Howard,hi sheldon.
7141,Howard,i didn’t say that. you never listen to me!
9191,Howard,you don’t need a parking space. you don’t have a car.
11241,Howard,son of a bitch.
9194,Howard,"okay, you need to move now."
9195,Howard,you can’t stay there forever.
11245,Howard,i’m fine. just a little embarrassed i had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. thanks.
9199,Howard,would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
11247,Howard,"well, we’re out. bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. and she’s pregnant because we had sex. and we had sex because, well, come on."
9202,Howard,"oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. don’t hate me just because i lived the dream.  "
7155,Howard,"sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
11250,Howard,okay. everything’s hooked up. we’re ready.
7158,Howard,we had to.
9206,Howard,"i had no idea how much that spot meant to you. anyway, i called president siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and i’ll park in the structure across the street."
11254,Howard,"you know, i don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out."
7162,Howard,"personally, i don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
9214,Howard,it’s torture. especially with her dad. we have nothing in common.
7167,Howard,this neighbourhood is more texas chainsaw massacre.
7168,Howard,"no, i want to blend in."
7169,Howard,"howdy, ma’am."
9217,Howard,"so, how have you been?"
7171,Howard,"if y’all don’t mind, i got a hankerin’ for a lone star beer."
11265,Howard,"you could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever."
11267,Howard,a lot.
9225,Howard,took the words right out of my mouth.
11274,Howard,you got something better?
9227,Howard,sure. i can hear it in your voice.
7182,Howard,sex is never the way i dream it’s gonna be.
7184,Howard,"uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out."
9232,Howard,great.  thanks for the help.
11280,Howard,some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
9235,Howard,"come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this."
11283,Howard,you look like you come with a kickstand.
7189,Howard,"no, no, not this time. i know insects, my friend, i spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. in latin."
7190,Howard,"okay, okay, tell you what. i am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket."
7191,Howard,"what’s the matter, you chicken?"
7192,Howard,"okay, i believe a chicken made you his bitch. but the cricket thing, i don’t buy. bet me."
9238,Howard,okay.
7194,Howard,hmm.
9240,Howard,fine. there.
9242,Howard,"no, i’m fine. keep going."
11294,Howard,"hmm. we request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. that’s weird."
7200,Howard,"all right, sheldon, here we go, kleingast’s field guide to north american insects. hey, toby. right here, see it? the common field cricket, aka gryllus assimilis, which is latin for suck it, you lose."
7203,Howard,"yeah, fine, whatever. the point is, you’re wrong again."
11299,Howard,"i’m sorry, you find this funny?"
9253,Howard,"so, what do we do now? they expect us to go away for the weekend."
9254,Howard,"no, but i’m not a stranger to dice games. i was the temple beth-el hebrew school yahtzee champion."
7208,Howard,yes!
7209,Howard,no. raj and i are going a goth club in hollywood to hang with the night people. anybody want to come along?
9256,Howard,"okay. oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, mike?"
11306,Howard,"oh, god. i think someone’s following us."
9260,Howard,"i follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way."
9261,Howard,"okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
9262,Howard,can we please move this along?
7215,Howard,"oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
11307,Howard,"i’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail."
11308,Howard,i told you.
9267,Howard,never heard of it. must be the one christmas song not written by a jewish guy.
11316,Howard,yeah. i would not have done that for you.
7221,Howard,thanks. can we buy you ladies a drink?
9269,Howard,done?
11317,Howard,"all right, all right."
9272,Howard,"yes, we found santa. christmas is saved. don’t ever tell my mother i said that."
9275,Howard,what’s going on?
7229,Howard,okay.
11327,Howard,the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. they want to have a meeting.
7232,Howard,let’s go.
11328,Howard,"and if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially."
7236,Howard,"well, i can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or kermit the frog."
9284,Howard,"hey, janine. how are tom and the kids?"
11333,Howard,"why? because i’m jewish? that’s like me saying, hey, you’re indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?"
9287,Howard,has it really only been ten miles?
7240,Howard,"i know, but it was cold. ow, ow, ow!"
11336,Howard,"first of all, he’s in boca raton, which is better than fort lauderdale. but more importantly, he lasted two days on jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy."
11337,Howard,"hey, marty. thanks for talking to us."
11342,Howard,no.
11344,Howard,"it’s a group effort, but i guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
11345,Howard,really? you’re a physicist?
9298,Howard,i wish my mom was here. we could all hang out in her shadow.
11351,Howard,i love your french toast.
9305,Howard,"you’re still out, right?"
11354,Howard,would you stop? we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.
11355,Howard,you are a deeply silly man.
9308,Howard,"oh, man. look at my nose."
7261,Howard,"yeah, i really wish i could, penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
7262,Howard,turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. it’s not as good as it sounds.
9310,Howard,i can’t believe i wasted all that money.
9311,Howard,get that waste of money out of my face.
7265,Howard,"the bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
7266,Howard,"penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
9315,Howard,"yeah, but they’re so expensive."
11358,Howard,let’s find out.
7269,Howard,"okay, guys, think, how do we keep raj in the country?"
7270,Howard,"come on, what are you waiting for? call him and set up an interview."
9317,Howard,"and we can make stuff we need for work with it. prototypes of my cad/cam designs, specialized tools…"
7272,Howard,i’m really going to miss you.
11361,Howard,what?
11362,Howard,"hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere."
11364,Howard,"well, i don’t know, midnight, one."
11365,Howard,"if you’re tired, have some coffee."
11366,Howard,i am having coffee.
11370,Howard,you wanted him awake.
7279,Howard,but he’s working with sheldon.
7281,Howard,"okay, i guess i can hang for a little while. so what are we watching? sex and the city."
7282,Howard,"fine, let’s watch it. maybe all our periods will synchronize."
7283,Howard,top o’ the mornin’o ya!
11378,Howard,"when the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
9334,Howard,"yes, but we’re married now. that means, when you get sick, i take care of you. and when you make a bunch of money, i get to buy stuff. sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works."
7287,Howard,"sure. ‘sup, homes?"
11383,Howard,cool. ‘cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
7290,Howard,"oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
9339,Howard,it’s my suitcase. i lent it to you two years ago.
11386,Howard,"yeah, i was just thinking the same thing."
7296,Howard,"that reminds me, i have a bone to pick with you."
11392,Howard,"but you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. ta-da."
9346,Howard,really? what do you got going on?
7299,Howard,why not?
11394,Howard,but you just said you wanted to know.
7308,Howard,"so, tell me more about the future mother of my children."
9357,Howard,here’s some more ice.
11406,Howard,does it sound sexy?
9359,Howard,"honestly, if i could bend that far, what would i need with you?"
11409,Howard,"well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. in fact, what’s this between your toes?"
11410,Howard,"it sounded like it. oh, my god. someone’s in the house."
9364,Howard,it’s too late. we’ll see him at his bar mitzvah.
11416,Howard,"well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
7321,Howard,okay.
9369,Howard,a micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
11417,Howard,stuart. he heard me talking about us going away. i guess he decided to invite himself over?
11423,Howard,"those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
9376,Howard,"look, we can still have a nice night. just tell me where it is."
7331,Howard,corolla!
11427,Howard,i felt a kick. there’s a baby in there.
7334,Howard,a catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm i’ve been hoping for.
7336,Howard,kites ho!
7339,Howard,"that chick, she smiled at me."
7344,Howard,i totally had a shot.
9393,Howard,he’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.
9396,Howard,"come on, she came back. this is good news. you should celebrate."
7349,Howard,sheldon knows football?
7351,Howard,"hey, pal."
9399,Howard,"boy, i want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy."
9401,Howard,okay.
7354,Howard,"look, i admit i haven’t always been the best friend i could be."
9405,Howard,"oh, i did spend a lot of my shower time with lieutenant uhura."
7360,Howard,"fine. you’re mad at me. i get it. now, how about we go spend the day together? just the two of us. we’ll go anywhere you want."
9409,Howard,"maybe i could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students."
21701,Howard,right.
11464,Howard,"see, i’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, i waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
9417,Howard,"no, but i was in the rocket. i didn’t actually…"
21704,Howard,so do i.
11467,Howard,"you know, if he moves across the hall for good, leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in sheldon’s old room. solves everything."
9420,Howard,"bernie, i’m home. you have fun today?"
11470,Howard,"huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
9423,Howard,you said clean up. i’m cleaning up.
11471,Howard,"no, she’s right. as long as i’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
11472,Howard,"oh, did you meet her at work?"
9429,Howard,"no, we wouldn’t ask him. we’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there."
11480,Howard,ah.
7389,Howard,anything yet?
7390,Howard,"hang on, how about now?"
7391,Howard,"ooh, real sex."
9442,Howard,he abandoned me and my mother. why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
11496,Howard,you laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
9451,Howard,so everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
7404,Howard,i lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie.
9452,Howard,how could you do this?
9453,Howard,"no, i don’t want to know. i mean, i do, but… i got to go."
7407,Howard,anything?
11502,Howard,you’re in a good mood.
11508,Howard,"yeah, let him do it."
11510,Howard,it’s like we have a butler. if i had a batsuit i’d be bruce wayne.
7416,Howard,that’s still not funny.
11517,Howard,"guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
7422,Howard,"to be honest, i was hoping at least second base."
7424,Howard,"no, i was just… never mind."
11521,Howard,"stop that, this isn’t india."
9476,Howard,"yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. oh, yeah, that’s what i was hoping for, meerkats."
9477,Howard,"ooh, meerkat fight!"
9478,Howard,you could talk some smack about his mother.
9480,Howard,"i think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. the optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out."
11531,Howard,"deep breaths, slow breaths."
9485,Howard,i can’t believe i have to explain this. people change names on blogs to protect their privacy. roger is raj.
9490,Howard,ready to go to lunch?
9491,Howard,yeah. let’s go.
11538,Howard,yeah. i was 20 years old before i figured out tootsie rolls weren’t naturally warm.
7446,Howard,you want to play cylon and colonist?
7447,Howard,"you mean, bernadette?"
11542,Howard,"she’s here, the baby’s here."
9497,Howard,the key to her heart. that’s nice. were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
11547,Howard,of course.
7452,Howard,"don’t remind me!  oh, man. all soaped up and no place to go."
9501,Howard,"to be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. i’ll talk to bernie. i’m sure it’s fine."
9502,Howard,you mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
9508,Howard,it was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
11558,Howard,"i mean, it’s stuart. maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away."
7465,Howard,"i hope it’s all right, i told my girlfriend bernadette she could join us for dinner."
7466,Howard,"come on, sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
9514,Howard,"yes, you were!."
7468,Howard,yeah?
11563,Howard,great. and where are you?
11567,Howard,is it okay if i get some sleep?
7475,Howard,"could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
11572,Howard,"all right, got halley to sleep. "
7479,Howard,don’t play innocent with me. i practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
11578,Howard,"mit’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
7483,Howard,"oh, that explains a lot."
9532,Howard,"uh, it does. "
7485,Howard,"that’s great, ma!"
9533,Howard,what are you doing back?
7487,Howard,please? i got a real hankering.
7488,Howard,"thanks, ma."
11579,Howard,no.
9538,Howard,"uh, fifteen or higher."
7493,Howard,"uh, what do you mean?"
7501,Howard,"i don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
11597,Howard,this thing’s pretty cool. it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
7504,Howard,same thing you’re doing here. i came to see leonard’s experiment.
7508,Howard,but i now realize how foolish that is.
9558,Howard,it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard.
7511,Howard,what? no.
9561,Howard,"raj, i can’t come to the party. this is all just too much for me. i don’t think we should see each other any more. sorry. lucy."
7514,Howard,she had to go out of town. her grandmother died.
7516,Howard,what do you mean you don’t know what i’m talking about? tell her i have a girlfriend!
7517,Howard,"her name is bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist."
11614,Howard,"yeah, the field was just here. the field said no."
11616,Howard,too late. stuart called dibs.
11618,Howard,those do look fun.
11622,Howard,okay. how about if i eat like this?
7528,Howard,"well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. leonard?"
7530,Howard,sorry.
9578,Howard,both versions: original and lohan. you’re an idiot.
11629,Howard,yeah. it doesn’t need to be smaller. 
9584,Howard,awful. i had to rub her ointment all over her again.
7538,Howard,"hey, i’m sure penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you."
9586,Howard,i don’t know. few weeks. why?
7540,Howard,i respect that.  
11634,Howard,it’s so peaceful without him here. can i ask you how much that cost?
9590,Howard,i feel so stupid. and fat.
9591,Howard,"sex? really? i mean, that’s just your solution to everything. "
9592,Howard,thanks for coming over.
7545,Howard,"sure, no mobsters there."
11637,Howard,"okay, but that’s just a theory. it’s not even a complete thought."
9595,Howard,"come on, raj, it’s a yes or no question."
11643,Howard,he’s worried about looking foolish. that’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.
9600,Howard,"okay, let me feel. no, i am definitely up a cup size. "
7553,Howard,how long has he been stuck?
9605,Howard,"i said, stop it. now, listen to me. you two aren’t just friends. you’re best friends. and that’s a beautiful thing. i mean, leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? it’s ’cause he missed you. yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. as i do. this man held my breast the other day and i love him for it."
11655,Howard,"go. come on, raj."
9608,Howard,"whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry."
9611,Howard,"oh, i loved those. i did them every year there."
7564,Howard,not really. i was in my boogie zone.
9613,Howard,and princeton.
9614,Howard,"yes, to be fair, do people who went to princeton get a head start?"
11666,Howard,"what, what are you doing? i, i, i schlepped the baby over, i brought imported beer. why don’t you like me?"
9620,Howard,"huh, i guess you’re right. wonder why that is?"
11671,Howard,i thought your dad paid your cards.
11675,Howard,and hate all the crowds at the panels.
9629,Howard,on the boats and on the planes. 
7582,Howard,i’m sad to say i taught him those moves.
11678,Howard,"yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. you could charge people money to punch you."
9632,Howard,today!
11679,Howard,so?
9634,Howard,just pour me a drink.
11683,Howard,"no. i just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
11689,Howard,yeah.
9642,Howard,"leonard, you ready for lunch?"
9643,Howard,"hi, penny."
11692,Howard,they complete my ensemble. what do you want?
9649,Howard,"yeah. i guess i was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
11698,Howard,"dinner’s almost ready. if you like meatloaf, i’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
7605,Howard,"oh, my god. an alf doll. when i was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. i used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet melmac, and alf was going to bring him back to me. but he never did. where’s my daddy, puppet? where is he?"
9655,Howard,"i’m copying leonard. when he does this to penny, they have sex and watch monty python."
11704,Howard,"maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. fine, what should we do?"
7609,Howard,"so, i was doing some checking on the ring."
7610,Howard,"listen, i was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. no copyright notice on it. so, i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
9661,Howard,"yeah, i know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. bipolar bear."
11710,Howard,"i know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
7615,Howard,"eddie crispo. anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. it’s the real deal."
9665,Howard,it’s nothing in particular. i…
7618,Howard,"yes. he figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
9666,Howard,my arm is feeling numb.
11713,Howard,"yeah. we barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours."
11716,Howard,great. go live there.
9670,Howard,"please, stop talking."
9674,Howard,you got the tropical fruit kind?
7631,Howard,"i’m sorry, ma, i have to stay late at the office."
11728,Howard,"well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
9681,Howard,should i go after you?
7636,Howard,then let go of the ring and walk away.
11733,Howard,wait. what? what do i make you do?
11736,Howard,"anyway, sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
11737,Howard,"well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
11744,Howard,"oh, cool."
7649,Howard,"well, no, you’re mistaken. you give speeches all the time. what you can’t do is shut up."
11747,Howard,you okay?
9700,Howard,i’m getting worried about bernadette. i’m gonna call and check on her.
9701,Howard,"guys, there was an accident at bernie’s lab."
11750,Howard,hey.
7655,Howard,"hey, leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
9703,Howard,"oh, my god, bernie, what happened?"
11751,Howard,"look, something’s going on with bernadette. she say anything to you?"
11752,Howard,"come on, be honest. did you tell her i tried her breast pump?"
11758,Howard,"let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it i took from bernie’s purse."
7664,Howard,did you ask her to start waxing?
7665,Howard,"while making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out mommy?"
7666,Howard,that wasn’t a no.
7667,Howard,did you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? because you can die that way.
9715,Howard,not his testosterone levels.
7669,Howard,then what’s with the disinfectant?
9716,Howard,how is that possible?
7671,Howard,"i’m sure you’re probably sick of star trek questions, but, whoopi goldberg, you ever hit that?"
9721,Howard,"so i won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
11770,Howard,"and the best part is halley won’t remember a thing. babies are cute, but they’re dumb. i mean, i go like this, she thinks i’m gone, then magically i’m back. i mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
11773,Howard,this is supposed to be our family fun day. what’s so important on your phone?
7680,Howard,"nah, i can’t. i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. looks like the manatee tank at sea world."
9728,Howard,"everything we need to make jewellery moulds. here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
7682,Howard,"yeah, since when do you take walks?"
9730,Howard,"i was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. she’s just chins and fat and feet."
7684,Howard,or we could go together.
11778,Howard,learning anything?
9734,Howard,how am i ruining anything? i’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
7688,Howard,"so what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
7689,Howard,which way are you going?
9736,Howard,"buddy, i was just joking around. "
9739,Howard,you didn’t have to do that.
7692,Howard,i definitely smell raw hot dog.
7693,Howard,"all right, have a nice walk."
9740,Howard,"wow, this is so cool. thanks."
9742,Howard,"so, you can never take it off?"
7696,Howard,"sheldon, come on."
9743,Howard,"so, you’re just an idiot?"
9746,Howard,you didn’t have smokey the bear in india?
11787,Howard,"great, now everybody’s crying."
11788,Howard,that’s good.
9749,Howard,that’s a pretty cool idea.
7702,Howard,so you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
11791,Howard,"yeah, me, too. love you."
11792,Howard,what are you doing here?
7705,Howard,"if you want, i can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills."
9754,Howard,"well, if i may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to youtube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
7707,Howard,were you up making another stop-motion lego movie?
7709,Howard,how is a japanese love pillow another person?
9758,Howard,"please? bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and i never have anything to say to that guy."
9760,Howard,"oh, her gout’s flaring up. turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away."
7713,Howard,who’s that
7716,Howard,"yeah, sure. in fact, i’m a dungeon master."
7717,Howard,beg pardon?
7718,Howard,what the frak?
9765,Howard,he doesn’t want me in there. i’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
7720,Howard,i was waiting for the right time. this is the right time.
7722,Howard,yep. welcome to the penthouse forum.
7724,Howard,"that’s a bazinga, right?"
9772,Howard,you ever play football?
7726,Howard,she dumped you?
9776,Howard,that’s why i sit.
9777,Howard,anyone need a beer?
11827,Howard,"all right, very funny."
7733,Howard,"the phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
9786,Howard,"mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me."
7739,Howard,what?
11837,Howard,they wouldn’t say.
7743,Howard,"i’ll show you a picture of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime. leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for sheldon."
9792,Howard,"i know, but they’re tenting his building. he can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs."
7745,Howard,"whatever. right now, dr. sheldon cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. greetings, fellow life-form…"
7746,Howard,not us. him.
9793,Howard,"for a whole week, the nerve of some people."
7748,Howard,sheldon. hey.
9794,Howard,you’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
11839,Howard,not really.
11843,Howard,"hey, wait up."
11844,Howard,you left something at home. a big hug.
9801,Howard,how do you know i didn’t do them?
11848,Howard,oh.
9803,Howard,just go.
7756,Howard,"all right, you can have a hot chocolate."
11855,Howard,"if you’d like, we can help you out."
7760,Howard,and now the kung pao chicken.
11857,Howard,a stranger just lured sheldon away with a candy bar.
7762,Howard,"ah, there you have it, gentlemen. our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
7763,Howard,why?
11858,Howard,"oh, yeah. back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
11862,Howard,it’s unbelievable. sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.
7768,Howard,just wait.
11864,Howard,she’s not that kind of doctor.
7770,Howard,"hey, sheldon?"
11868,Howard,"baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me."
7773,Howard,borrowed. the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
7774,Howard,"raj and i entered sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out amy farrah fowler."
9823,Howard,"hope you’re thirsty, here it comes."
7776,Howard,i’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill sheldon.
11874,Howard,"bonjour mademoiselle, i understand you’re new in town. "
7779,Howard,yes.
7780,Howard,"yes. now, help me!"
7781,Howard,"not funny, leonard."
11877,Howard,we can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
11881,Howard,you won’t believe this.
7787,Howard,i…
7788,Howard,"that’s great, mom, thanks!"
9835,Howard,you can say better. sheldon can’t hear you.
7790,Howard,"yes, but that’s not the point! get me out of here."
7791,Howard,don’t tug. no tugging.
11887,Howard,is he here? 
11888,Howard,i agree.
11891,Howard,"mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do i got? thanks. i can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in israel. "
11892,Howard,what are you so happy about?
11893,Howard,make sure they remember no peanuts.
11895,Howard,hey!
11897,Howard,"hey, qu’est q’wass up?"
11898,Howard,"no, that’s what she said, sheldon."
11899,Howard,"hello, boys."
7804,Howard,i know!  then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
7806,Howard,he’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
9856,Howard,"you know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend bert, it’s totally okay."
11906,Howard,i got your text. how bad is… oy.
9860,Howard,the mineral and rock show? that would be awful even without bert.
9864,Howard,arlene russel.
7819,Howard,philadelphia.
9869,Howard,let’s go.
9871,Howard,"really, really sorry."
9874,Howard,t-minus 30 seconds.
9875,Howard,15 seconds.
7828,Howard,"yeah, we all thought so."
9876,Howard,"five, four, three, two, one. "
11922,Howard,what are you asking me for? i don’t know if you can talk now or not.
11924,Howard,"excuse me. oh, damn. it’s my mother."
11925,Howard,"raj, what are you doing here? you were supposed to help me pimp out my vespa."
9881,Howard,really?
7834,Howard,you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks.
7835,Howard,i thought we discussed the p-word.
7836,Howard,hey. aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
7837,Howard,hello.
9882,Howard,i can’t believe we’re not going.
11933,Howard,"you’re right, penny jogs. maybe you guys can run together."
9888,Howard,what do you mean?
11934,Howard,really? that’s your question? when did he put a ramp in?
11938,Howard,why can’t you get it?
11939,Howard,"i don’t care if eat, pray, love changed your life, i’m not reading it."
7845,Howard,"no, ma!"
11942,Howard,nobody cares about your kegel exercises.
9895,Howard,last night. drank my pepto straight out of the bottle.
11943,Howard,fine.  red five to red leader. what do you want now?
7849,Howard,"okay, i’m a little confused here."
9898,Howard,"oh, no. i’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
9899,Howard,"okay, you guys are such babies. i’ll handle this. if he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
9900,Howard,"i lied about the pepto, i always use the little cup."
11946,Howard,what ya thinking so hard about?
7859,Howard,"now, you see, i don’t know if you’re kidding or not."
11955,Howard,"oh, hey, hi. nice to see you."
11958,Howard,i’ll tell you later.
9913,Howard,i love you so much.
11962,Howard,hi.
9916,Howard,i’m thinking about growing a goatee.
7872,Howard,would you talk to her?
7876,Howard,"no. why would you? i’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. you know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11."
11977,Howard,"all i do is win, win, win no matter what."
7884,Howard,maybe later.
7885,Howard,"so, are you seeing anybody?"
9938,Howard,what’s going on?
9943,Howard,"fine, maybe i was a little scared."
11992,Howard,that’s raj.
7897,Howard,"yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again."
9947,Howard,"okay, so i wasn’t exactly john glenn up there, but i’ve changed. i’m a different man now. yeah, and i’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think i can handle it."
7905,Howard,"no, you don’t. it’s me. the lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants."
9957,Howard,"hey, that’s my wife. if anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me."
7913,Howard,"yeah, i know what you mean."
9961,Howard,the lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. that’s funny.
9962,Howard,hey.
7916,Howard,"come on, just give her a chance. maybe she’ll grow on you."
9966,Howard,"anyway, i got invited to do a little talk at nasa in houston this weekend. they gave me two tickets. bernadette can’t go. you want to come with me? you can visit your mom, and i’ll show you around the space centre."
7923,Howard,"okay, forget who’s hotter. the first time priya came to la, leonard and i made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her."
9972,Howard,"oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car."
9974,Howard,how do i know what you said? damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
7927,Howard,"yeah, i just wanna put it out there in case i inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. happy? . "
7930,Howard,how could you? we had a pact!
7934,Howard,"and as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into leonard’s food."
7946,Howard,"leave me alone, sheldon."
9994,Howard,thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
7948,Howard,"oh. go away, sheldon."
10001,Howard,"what? sheldon, tell me what’s going on."
10002,Howard,you ready to talk about it?
7955,Howard,"penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us friday to see it on the big screen at the colonial."
7957,Howard,"you know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives."
7958,Howard,"actually, i’m not. i’m using sarcasm to mock you."
10008,Howard,"look, she’s a grown woman. and, and your dad’s been gone a long time. maybe this is none of your business."
7972,Howard,let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
10022,Howard,no. were you seeing other men?
10028,Howard,i hope i get to meet her as soon as possible.
10032,Howard,"so, you and emily still together?"
10033,Howard,i spoke to bernadette. she’s free tomorrow night.
7987,Howard,what? galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
10036,Howard,i promise i’ll be on my best behaviour.
10046,Howard,wow. now who doesn’t listen?
7999,Howard,what about that hook-up at comic-con you told me about?
10047,Howard,"it was the most incredible experience of my life. up there in the space station, you’re…"
10048,Howard,can i finish my astronaut story?
10051,Howard,you’re saying it.
10052,Howard,"okay, i’ll say it. i was on the way to pick her up. my stomach felt a little funny. when i got there, i asked if i could use her bathroom."
8005,Howard,fine.
10053,Howard,"one roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, i was so humiliated, i snuck out the window and never saw her again."
10059,Howard,i’m just saying…
10060,Howard,okay. fine.
8015,Howard,"leonard, settle this. of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?"
10063,Howard,you’re awful quiet. everything okay?
10066,Howard,"oh, well, turns out i’d already met the girl raj is seeing when i did a number on her bathroom. and that number was two."
10067,Howard,"get out of here, barry."
8021,Howard,perhaps. are you scared?
8025,Howard,"get it off! get it off! please, raj! ah! ah! ah! please. oh!"
10075,Howard,"i just helped my mom out of the tub, so, i’m one slippery horror ahead of you."
8028,Howard,it’s a bell.
10082,Howard,"raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes the sound of music.  hey, penny. what’s up? no, bernie’s working late. really? thanks for telling me."
10083,Howard,i’m having sex with a catholic schoolgirl tonight.
8037,Howard,"if anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you."
10086,Howard,you’re being so quiet. are you upset or are you just rebooting?
8040,Howard,you narcissistic nincompoop!
8044,Howard,so go apologize.
10092,Howard,"well, at least without sheldon here, we got to start with episode iv."
10093,Howard,"me, too."
10096,Howard,"boy, some of the physical comedy with jar jar is a little tough to watch."
10099,Howard,the doctor says you need to get exercise.
10102,Howard,"please, i’m an mit-trained engineer. i think i can handle… ma, look out."
10103,Howard,"okay, she’s all settled in the guest room."
8065,Howard,sounds like we’re in business.
8066,Howard,"sheldon, i don’t think penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…"
10118,Howard,what took you so long? the grocery store is a few blocks away.
8071,Howard,"so right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…"
8072,Howard,"like i was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
10124,Howard,i’m proud of us.
8077,Howard,"okay, let’s try this one. spherical hankel function."
10133,Howard,"yeah, maybe it’s time we just release ma back into the sea."
10137,Howard,"don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?"
8090,Howard,yeah. it’s the love car.
8093,Howard,"hey, bernie?"
11785,Howard,have a great first day back.
10143,Howard,"okay, let’s go."
10145,Howard,why?
10149,Howard,"i don’t know, they’re, chummy."
8104,Howard,i’m… i…
10152,Howard,"first of all, no one can replace me as a son. i’m her little matzo ball. and secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life."
10153,Howard,i said well past it.
10155,Howard,"uh, what are you doing here? i thought you moved out."
8109,Howard,how would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like angelina jolie?
8110,Howard,"what, i’m not hot enough for angelina jolie?"
8111,Howard,"look. listen to this one. does einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to dr. cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
8112,Howard,"apparently, if you’re sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
8115,Howard,"actually, we should all share the moment. raj, if you would."
10165,Howard,"it is. he’s a grown man. he’s just gonna live there rent-free? how is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? i mean, do you even have a plan?"
8120,Howard,"raj, i have amazing news!"
10170,Howard,"yeah, in my house."
10172,Howard,"yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
8125,Howard,"so, while i’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her."
10175,Howard,and you love the sound of your own voice.
10176,Howard,did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?
10179,Howard,"sheldon, i’m more than smart enough to take your class."
10180,Howard,yes.
10181,Howard,i would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until i found the lowest energy solution.
8134,Howard,"okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
11793,Howard,i get it. i haven’t even made it to my office yet.
10184,Howard,"oh, come on. you might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists."
10185,Howard,no.
8139,Howard,i’m an engineer. most engineers don’t bother with a phd. but you may be interested to know i designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for nasa.
10187,Howard,"before we do, i just talked to leonard. and if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then i’m out. but if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then i’m willing to give this a shot."
8143,Howard,what’s going on?
8148,Howard,what’s so funny?
10206,Howard,"so, how does this game work? i just throw it, like a real ball?"
8159,Howard,i’ve got a better solution.
10209,Howard,"the angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?"
10210,Howard,"well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me."
10212,Howard,cut it out. you’re hurting my feelings.
8165,Howard,nobody has a disease!
10216,Howard,"thank you, that would be great."
8174,Howard,"i don’t know. a couple of days ago. the thing is, bernadette doesn’t like that i have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust bernadette."
8177,Howard,"that’s very nice of you, but i made other plans."
8178,Howard,hey.
8180,Howard,"listen, my mom’s going to palm springs to visit her sister. that’s two whole nights in a row i can sleep over with you all the way to morning. unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case i’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier."
10236,Howard,thank you. thank you.
10237,Howard,"i have a message for the young people here today. when i was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said i couldn’t do it. so, i practiced and practiced, and you know what? that little voice was right, but then i remembered that i’m not an athlete. i’m a scientist. so, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, i present to you a working prototype of the mars rover. and here’s the wind-up, and the pitch."
10239,Howard,"okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about mars."
