14338,Susan,"i know it's years away. she's youthful and vibrant, thank god. but time flies and one day she won't be able to take care of herself and i'll have to step up."
18435,Susan,"shh. not in front of mike! oh, look, mike. ian brought you flowers. i'll just go put them in some water."

14379,Susan,"you're so cute, yeah."
14388,Susan,you're welcome.

14431,Susan,what?
16479,Susan,i don't care.
16480,Susan,"oh, good. i hope the thorns rip him to shreds."
16482,Susan,"yes. i don't need a man. i don't even need sex. i went without it the first sixteen years--twenty-two years of my life, and i can go a few more."
16486,Susan,and support you means--acting like we're in junior high?
16490,Susan,"hey, uh, i waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth. you can't just steal it."
14443,Susan,"yeah, what did he say?"
16493,Susan,say you're sorry.
16496,Susan,"oh, all right, take his side!"
16497,Susan,"look, whatever that court report says, i do not have anger issues. i was just having a bad day."
14453,Susan,give me the bad news first.
14455,Susan,"okay, give me the good news."
14456,Susan,what?
16503,Susan,"well--i was engaged to ian, so--obviously i loved him."
16510,Susan,"yeah, only i didn't know edie was gonna have the party in a park. what if gaby see us?"
14466,Susan,"hi, kendra."
16516,Susan,"uh, what are we doing here?"
14474,Susan,"um, um-she, she-i uh."
14475,Susan,i need you to check into someone else's background.there is this plumber i know.
14480,Susan,i cannot believe you are still coming onto him.
14481,Susan,and that was your cue to come over and flirt? you wasted your time and your doughnuts.
16528,Susan,where are you going?
16533,Susan,"ian, i love you."
16535,Susan,"oh, poor mr. henley. he does seem to be getting worse. thanks for stopping by."
14488,Susan,"when i was packing up your stuff in your bedroom, i found a box of bullets."
16536,Susan,"no. uh, what about him?"
14490,Susan,"oh. really? well ,that was easy. maybe after lunch we can talk about your leather bean bag chair."
14491,Susan,"bonjour. oh, hi, i didn't know that the cooking lesson was gonna be a group activity. well, the more the merrier, right? as long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crepes. how come i'm the only one wearing the apron?"
16543,Susan,"okay, carlos--tell me where to find him."
14501,Susan,he's six cars up. we have to stay this far back or he'll see us.
16553,Susan,"well, it's my daughter's. uh, the whole junior class has them."
16554,Susan,why would i need a tent?
14513,Susan,we heard rex had a heart attack. how is he?
14521,Susan,"oh, my god. where have you been?"
14522,Susan,"well, i'm really sorry for that last message. i was just, uh--"
16571,Susan,what is it?
16573,Susan,"okay, north. i need north. moss grows on the north side of trees."
14526,Susan,great. that's great.
16574,Susan,"what? ugh, damn it! stupid mossy trees!"
14531,Susan,you heard the girl.
14532,Susan,"now, you be a good boy, bongo, or you're gonna go to bed hungry."
16581,Susan,"yes. it's also the anniversary of the day we were supposed to get engaged. a year ago tonight, you were on your way to ask me to marry you when you got hit by that stupid car."
14534,Susan,"edie, what a pleasant surprise."
16582,Susan,is that all you have to say?
14543,Susan,"listen, i know you're upset, but is this really what you think your mother would want you doing?"
14544,Susan,exactly. because she raised you right. look you have been through a lot. you've lost your mom. you're still carrying around the guilt over what happened to your baby sister.
16592,Susan,"oh, my god! i had julie call and cancel everyone."
16599,Susan,"oh, you could change your plans."
14552,Susan,ouch.
16604,Susan,"okay, if you think for one second--"
16607,Susan,"okay, well, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry for getting so snippy yesterday, that when i canceled my wedding, you had every right to--"
16608,Susan,francois!
14563,Susan,"honey, you can let it out."
14564,Susan,why?
14565,Susan,is that?
16612,Susan,"in this town in wedding season? yeah, i do. you might as well have used my caterer and my swing band."""
14568,Susan,"just work it into the conversation. you know, put the word out there."
14570,Susan,what? what is it?
16619,Susan,"i cannot believe that you just said that. okay, you know what? i came over here to give you my response card. but here. this is my response."
14572,Susan,fine. is mike here?
14573,Susan,no.
14576,Susan,edie!
14578,Susan,"wow. um, i find that confusing."
14580,Susan,who cares?
16633,Susan,"mm. lynette is right. you know, marriage is like--it's like these bonbons. you never know what you're getting until you're in the middle of it."
16640,Susan,that's good to know.
16643,Susan,"hey, how about a double wedding?"
14596,Susan,"i know how much you've always wanted a child, and now you have one."
16646,Susan,so what do you think?
14603,Susan,"no, not really. i mean, what do we actually know about our neighbors? i mean, we can tell if they keep their lawns nice or they take their trash cans in, but when they do those things, we stop asking questions 'cause if people are good neighbors--"
16651,Susan,how are you doing?
16653,Susan,"yeah, he sort of wants the day just to be about us. so we're gonna wait till the fall. i'm so sorry."
14607,Susan,"hey! karl, i see you. just stop right there!"
14609,Susan,"that's edie's paper, and this is edie's house!"
14610,Susan,"did you spend the night with edie? oh, my god!"
16658,Susan,will you marry me?
14613,Susan,forbidden!
14614,Susan,"well, i just bet she is!"
14620,Susan,what? how could you not tell me that? we share everything. that's what we're known for. that's our thing.
14621,Susan,"oh, i've never applied that concept to your father's sex life and you know it."
16668,Susan,"well, the doves are not going to release themselves."
16672,Susan,what are you doing?
16673,Susan,it's three o'clock in the morning.
16677,Susan,but we didn't agree on this. maybe i can scale things back a bit.
16679,Susan,"no, i wanna start out happy. but clearly, you're upset, and i don't know why."
16682,Susan,"really? is everything okay, sweetie? 'cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks."""
14636,Susan,jogging? there's no law against jogging.
14637,Susan,shopping. that's casual. that's fun.
14640,Susan,"yes, hi. i was just wondering, are you having some remodeling done on your house or something?"
16688,Susan,just hurry up and get dressed. we only have forty-five minutes.
16693,Susan,you clean up pretty good yourself.
16694,Susan,carlos.how is she?
14654,Susan,we're in the middle of the street. would you get out of here?
16704,Susan,"i wish edie were here.without her,there's no one to give us the dish."
14657,Susan,"in five seconds, i'm gonna punch it."
14659,Susan,"no, i won't!"
14665,Susan,"well, she was gloating about sleeping with you, and i just wanted to shut her up."
14667,Susan,just give me a moment. i'm asking god to kill me.
16717,Susan,sorry.
14671,Susan,i don't know. it's really complicated. so you never answered my question. are you in love with her?
14673,Susan,"it's karl's weekend to have julie, and they're always back by six. that's our custody agreement, back by six, and it's after six."
16728,Susan,"yeah,the part before death. oh!"
16734,Susan,"yep,we're doomed."
14687,Susan,"oh. you have a little, uh, on your--"
14691,Susan,"hi. i'm sorry to interrupt. i knocked, but i guess you guys didn't hear me."
14695,Susan,"yeah, well, we've all seen your talent, which is a nice way of telling you why don't you put some curtains on your bedroom window?"
16744,Susan,more?
14699,Susan,"no, it's okay, honey. who do you want to be with you in the family talent show?"
16752,Susan,she said dylan's not the same girl.
16754,Susan,i'm not sure. but there was something odd about the way they left.
16755,Susan,"uh, that sounds great."
16760,Susan,katherine? are you okay? you seem a little jumpy.
14717,Susan,"what, that's it?"
16765,Susan,"okay, when i'm in labor and i am pushing and screaming to bring your child into the world, do you really want me to remember that you denied me syrup?"
14722,Susan,i accept.
14726,Susan,i can be naked in twenty seconds! that includes travel time.
14729,Susan,"well, thanks for your discretion."
16779,Susan,psst! come here.
16780,Susan,"okay, i'll come there. are you still mad at me about the party?"
16781,Susan,"okay, look, i've been thinking about things, and--just forget what i said earlier."
16783,Susan,"no, and neither are you."
16784,Susan,"i know. i just-- think it's sweet that he worries about you, and i want him to feel like he's part of the decision making process."
14738,Susan,"damn it, zach. it's enough already."
14743,Susan,"what do you think, bree?"
14747,Susan,just to talk to you.
16798,Susan,"oh, that must mean you're matt. i'm susan mayer, and i'm--"
16799,Susan,"yeah, it's fine. would somebody just tell me where i can find--"
16807,Susan,"look, i get that you're upset."
14760,Susan,i can't believe i let you talk me into this. i am so behind in my work. but i'm glad i came. this is fun.
14761,Susan,oh?
16809,Susan,do you think this is easy for me? trying to keep peace between a new husband and a teenage daughter? you're always putting me in the middle.
14763,Susan,"well, of course."
16810,Susan,"please. every time you and mike disagree on something, you give me the look--that pitiful face that says if i don't back you up, i love the other one more."
14765,Susan,"really? ah, i think it might be rude not to. lonnie, what's going on?"
14766,Susan,why?
16814,Susan,"you know, this perfect teenager thing is really starting to chap my ass."
14770,Susan,"oh, my god. lonnie, did you move some of my money?"
16824,Susan,"no, that was a year ago."
14779,Susan,really? so that's it with you. you just get one shot and you screw up and you're out. i didn't know you were such a cynic.
14780,Susan,"julie, i did something bad. something really, really bad. aren't you gonna ask me what it was?"
14781,Susan,"last week, when mike and i went to the park searching for zach, i sort of found him."
14791,Susan,there's no electricity.
14792,Susan,"lonnie, how much financial trouble are you really in?"
16841,Susan,"oh, bless you."
16853,Susan,"honey, i love you, but i wanna win."
16855,Susan,"a whole concept, person, um, let's see. shakespeare, book, and then if you do the signal for book. and you touch your heart, then that's poem."
16856,Susan,dibs on lynette! she's on my team!
14811,Susan,why?
16864,Susan,"bree? can we call a truce, please? so you know i'm not bluffing, um, i brought cake."
16867,Susan,"oh, no. is everything okay?"
16868,Susan,"oh, my god. and there i was, just bugging you about your doctor. i am so sorry. you should've just told me."
16869,Susan,"oh, are you kidding? it's the first baby i've had in 17 years. you know, i could not possibly be more freaked out. this morning, i caught mike building a crib."
16379,Susan,"what, you've never heard of a midnight snack? unless you can think of something else that i can nibble on."
16872,Susan,if we are lucky
14830,Susan,"no, stop! put that pie filling down. slowly. i'm calling nine-one-one."
16878,Susan,"uh, i-i just wanted to say hi. you know, i saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and i just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste."
16879,Susan,"um, i'm susan. i live next door."
16881,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, that's super! yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it. you're just great."
14834,Susan,"uh, he's, follow me."
16882,Susan,"so there's, uh-- there's three of you. well, that must be-- cozy."
16883,Susan,"raphael is your dog, of course. you know, 'cause you folks can't have kids. i mean, uh, i mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed. what a-- nice dog. i should go."
14838,Susan,i'm sorry. i've been waiting for you. i'm just a little upset because everybody thinks i'm crazy.
14840,Susan,"well, right. i mean, there's that."
14843,Susan,"oh. i forgot about that. i just can't believe it. i mean, there he is, a murderer, just living right on our street, and there's nothing we can do about it because you're a convicted felon and i burned down that stupid house. it's unfair."
16891,Susan,"hi. i wanted to bring you a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" present. you should try one while they're still warm from the oven."
16892,Susan,nuts?
14846,Susan,"oh! oh! uh, uh, paul, you, you can't just waltz into people's houses."
14850,Susan,but he's not here. i swear.
14857,Susan,"he was talking so much about julie. i tried to get him to come home with me, i mean, to, to you, but he just kept going on and on about her, and i got scared."
14858,Susan,yes. mike.
16905,Susan,andrew told us that you only said no--'cause you didn't want to impose.
14861,Susan,"no, no, no, no, no!"
14863,Susan,"please, no, please, please. no, mike! mike!"
16911,Susan,"oh, he will. come on. you gotta keep believing."
16912,Susan,don't. we'll just keep looking. i have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
14866,Susan,you walked out on me.
14867,Susan,"oh, gabby, i didn't know you got a sonogram. let me see. oh!"
14870,Susan,"no, i came between the man and his son. there's a huge betrayal. i, i can't even blame him for hating me."
16918,Susan,that's crazy.
14873,Susan,i'm fine. you got any pie?
14875,Susan,"hi. okay, so i got the box on things you left on my porch."
16925,Susan,i think it's a sculpture.
14878,Susan,that's okay. people make-
18426,Susan,edie!
18427,Susan,"mike, i didn't do it to hurt you. you've gotta believe me. i--"
14891,Susan,"well, these days anybody going through a break-up gets my sympathy."
16939,Susan,"this is awkward. uh, i told katherine i'd vote for her."
16940,Susan,"uh, it's not like i'm pro- katherine. i'm just anti-fountain. oh, don't give me that look. i made her a promise."
14903,Susan,"oh, that's just you rebounding from edie."
16952,Susan,"exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position. i love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband."
16953,Susan,"okay, if anybody needs me, i'll be at the hardware store buying chains."
14907,Susan,"okay, there is a good explanation for what happened."
16957,Susan,nice save. now can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?
14913,Susan,"wasn't it, though? you were fantastic!"
16961,Susan,"it wasn't an impression. you said those words--""my father's dead."""
16962,Susan,"how can it be complicated? he's either dead or alive. does it sound complicated to you, michelle?"
14916,Susan,"well, i'm gonna take a shower."
14917,Susan,us? what do you mean? there's no us.
16964,Susan,did you really think i was gonna let you crawl in bed next to me without an explanation for your bizarre behavior?
16965,Susan,i don't care what the issues are. you don't deny your own dad's existence.
16968,Susan,"well, i've got to meet him."
16974,Susan,wonderful. who did you kill?
14930,Susan,you'd be an amazing mother.
16982,Susan,"well, i don't see one."
14935,Susan,"well, i've been writing a book. it's sort of autobiographical. really been forcing me to reexamine some of the different things that have made me me, like the fact that my mother had me so young, and i never knew my dad. big stuff like that. i told you about my dad, right? he was a merchant marine, and his platoon was killed in the battle of hanoi?"
16983,Susan,"you killed a crooked cop who was coming after you. that's self-defense, and even so, you regret it, right?"
14940,Susan,"i'm here. hi, morty, reverend hopkins. i'm sorry i'm late to your rehearsal."
16988,Susan,"if you can't feel the tiniest bit of remorse over taking a human life--no, i don't think you do."
14945,Susan,"well, there's no record of anyone with my dad's name in the armed services."
16995,Susan,"mike, how long are you gonna be? we've gotta get this food over to bree's before it gets cold."
16997,Susan,"there's no way out of it, mike. just do what you need and downstairs. this is what we do in the suburbs."
17000,Susan,"gee, i don't think i've ever heard such strong opinions on the subject. i mean, not that it's something i talk about a lot--or ever."
17001,Susan,ice cream. sorry.
14962,Susan,"are you saying that all this time my father has been alive, and just right across town running the supply and feed store?"
14963,Susan,i can't believe this!
14973,Susan,"well, actually, there's a 'help wanted' sign in the window so i was thinking about getting a job there. and, you know, he would get to know me and i'm sure he would like me and i would like him, and then one day he would say, 'you're like the daughter i never had' and i'd say, 'well, actually, now that you've mentioned it.'"
17021,Susan,"god, the only advantage he needs is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this."
17022,Susan,i wanna believe you. it's just--
17025,Susan,hey.
14978,Susan,"well, i just want to change my life and every since i was a little girl i've always liked horses and the outdoors. well, i'm just fascinated with feed."
14980,Susan,"yeah. they're just like mine. they're, they're nice."
17031,Susan,"oh, fine. break my heart."
14984,Susan,"back in the sixties, you had a brief relationship with a young girl, sophie bremmer. she got pregnant and had a baby and that baby was me,which makes you my father. hi."
17033,Susan,"no, he's at work."
17035,Susan,orgo?
14995,Susan,"oh, that's funny. so, all the times you were cheating on her, that was okay, but having lunch with your daughter, that just crosses the line? i just want a chance to get to know you."
14997,Susan,is that what you think of me? i'm a mistake?
17045,Susan,"oh, mike, you're home. i was dreaming we were ponies."
17048,Susan,oh. he's coming back tomorrow. don't you think he would be perfect for julie?
15007,Susan,how do you think he's gonna react?
15015,Susan,you haven't even finished your coffee.
17068,Susan,"no. no, you didn't do anything wrong. thanks for the supplies."
15025,Susan,can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
17074,Susan,"thank you. finally, some sanity."
15034,Susan,"hello, edie. do you have something you'd like to say?"
17086,Susan,are you okay?
15047,Susan,"so, you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad."
17105,Susan,and i will help her.
17107,Susan,"please, this is what best friends do--right before their friendship ends."
15060,Susan,"oh, you guys,we're all friends.this isn't something to get worked up over."
17118,Susan,"not at all. in--in fact, if you wanna do a dry run for sunday brunch, i'm there for you."
15077,Susan,we have an idea how to bring you and zach together.bowling.
17125,Susan,"oh, i'm just gonna visit for a while. so, andrew, we miss you around here, but i bet you love having your own place."
17127,Susan,"oh! this is a fix-up? well, i just--it never would have occurred to me, you know, because of the vast age difference. but, hell. why not? life is short. certainly shorter for walter."
15080,Susan,go!
17129,Susan,"well, i guess i'll just bring this pie up to julie."
15082,Susan,"oh!okay, write that down--nine!"
15085,Susan,"you know,i'm gonna go, uh,help julie with the food.so you guys just keep talking and bowling.talk and bowl.bowl and talk."
15086,Susan,"oh, my god!"
15090,Susan,i don't know. i saw his face when he looked in the trunk.and he looked just as shocked as i was.
15091,Susan,and there were the noises.
17141,Susan,"i so appreciate you helping us out. mike would be doing our taxes, but he's off--"
15097,Susan,oh! oww! oh!
17146,Susan,"no, i know you're not."
15100,Susan,dr. ron--i need you to pretend there's something wrong with me and admit me for the night.
17151,Susan,"oh, of course you do. that's right! this is my cousin timmy. he stayed with us that summer that he went to band camp."
15105,Susan,right. right.
17153,Susan,"no, that's okay. it can wait."
15109,Susan,"well,the paper said the police are withholding the details."
17158,Susan,"oh, i forgot. uh, tim has some questions about the taxes. do you mind talking to him?"
17159,Susan,"hey, uh, tim, i've got mike here. do you want to talk to him?"
17168,Susan,"you, on the other hand"
15121,Susan,"oh,well,maybe i should go ahead and see him anyway,just to be safe."
17174,Susan,hey.
15128,Susan,so is dr. ron gonna be here for this?
15129,Susan,okay.
15130,Susan,"oh,uh,i-i,uh--then why did you put out a gown?"
17178,Susan,not really.
15132,Susan,"hey,dr. ron?i just have a feeling that everything's gonna turn out fine.and when it does--i'd like to buy you dinner to celebrate my health.you know,i was thinking maybe italian?oh,what the heck,maybe we can call it a date.if you like.dr. ron?"
15136,Susan,symptoms?
15140,Susan,"i know. i know.i feel really awful.i am just not the best at meeting men.and i thought you were cute,and i sort of thought that maybe you thought i was cute,and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy."
15142,Susan,you like me?
15143,Susan,what about your girlfriend?
15145,Susan,oh.maybe we could go out sometime?
17194,Susan,"oh, my god. you thought i was crazy, but it wasn't a dream. you're naked! and that means you're crazy."
17195,Susan,"oh, really? you just happened to stumble naked into my front yard?"
17196,Susan,"""mike""? wait. are you sleepwalking? orson. hello?"
15150,Susan,thank you.i had a fabulous time.
17198,Susan,"you know, it's none of my business, but seeing as i have seen you naked twice in the last week, i think i can ask, is something bothering you?"
15154,Susan,"uh, yeah, yeah,thursday's great."
15157,Susan,a-and you're stopping yourself why?
17208,Susan,i know. i just--i can't stop now. i broke the seal.
15162,Susan,"no?so--we're talking surgery?yeah, well, i guess i can handle that.people get cut open every day."
15164,Susan,"oh, uh, well, um--uh--"
15169,Susan,"well, you know,you're gonna be--hacking into me,and i just wanted to make sure that you feel ready."
15171,Susan,i would like to.but i gotta be honest--the fact that you can't even cut that steak isn't helping.
17222,Susan,oh. what's going on?
15175,Susan,what?i didn't even serve dessert yet.you said you understood!
17223,Susan,"well, you can tell me anything. that's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor."
17225,Susan,"do you hear me, orson?!"
15180,Susan,"i mean, why not?'cause all my life,i have jumped through hoops to keep men from leaving.but i'm not doing it anymore.so tough luck, pally.you just missed out on a good thing."
15182,Susan,really?
17230,Susan,take a step back from what? he tried to murder you.
17235,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
15190,Susan,can't you sugarcoat it a little?
15193,Susan,"hi. i need an operation on my spleen,and i just found out i don't have medical insurance.is there anyone i can sue?"
15195,Susan,"no, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape.my spleen is going careening into my heart.i need that operation now."
17245,Susan,"okay, clearly, this is not going to work. so why don't you take your child bride and find another class?"
15207,Susan,"oh! oh, ah. sure, that's--wednesday's great.i'm--i'm just curious--how did edie convince you to do this so quickly?"
15222,Susan,"oh, yes. no, no,i do need insurance.i just don't have cancer.i have a-- wandering spleen."
15225,Susan,"well, it is.l-i could die."
17275,Susan,"a fount of wisdom, your meemaw. well--i really appreciate this. thanks, adele."
17278,Susan,sorry.
17280,Susan,"although he also enjoys coming home to sesame chicken from red panda, and they deliver."
15235,Susan,what the hell?
15237,Susan,she'd kill us both.
15239,Susan,"11:30, wednesday morning. right?"
15240,Susan,yep.
15241,Susan,"don't worry,honey.this time,it is strictly a business arrangement."
17287,Susan,"oh, my god."
17288,Susan,i can't believe she made a play for orson.
17294,Susan,nice? she's driving me crazy. you have got to stop complaining about me to her.
17296,Susan,"well, the next time she tries to help, she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face, so you better step up and start defending me."
15254,Susan,great!i'll have a light lunch.
15262,Susan,"you mean,like,marriage?"
15263,Susan,"no,no. i'm okay.i-i'm just-- surprised.well,congratulations.what makes you think he's gonna propose?"
15264,Susan,a ring!what did it look like?
17313,Susan,aah!
15269,Susan,karl. karl!come here!why didn't you answer your damn cell phone?
17317,Susan,apology accepted. let's go. aah!
17318,Susan,"oh, i know you do. i don't, and neither does the baby. philip? oh, phil? see? nothing. not even a burp. here's a thought. how about ""nathaniel""?"
17320,Susan,"it sounds like ""mucus."""
15274,Susan,karl--
17323,Susan,"he's a guy who--""killed six, then self."" well, i give up. he's not gonna get a name. when we want him to come, we'll just whistle and say, ""here, boy."""
17325,Susan,"me, too. oh, you finally have a name. dr. conner delfino."
17328,Susan,"i think it's a beautiful way to honor your grandfather. i mean, ""james"" wouldn't be my first choice, but it's a good, solid name."
17329,Susan,"oh, right. maynard. oh, that's awful--that he died."
15282,Susan,"hey,bree.how you doing today?"
15286,Susan,and i'm really hoping you're a lefty.
17335,Susan,"okay, drop the act, ladies. i hate it, too. mike insisted that we name him after his dead grandfather."
15290,Susan,"oh,my god,they're beautiful."
17339,Susan,"hello, maynard. i love you, maynard. my sweet little-- may may. mamie. nerd."
17340,Susan,hello. i need to change the name on my baby's birth certificate.
15293,Susan,"oh,it's sort of private."
17344,Susan,"you gotta help me out here. i'm just trying to protect my child. i don't want him to go through life saddled with the name ""maynard."""
17345,Susan,"well, of course, you don't. you're vanessa. you went through life with a beautiful name. that's why you have such a crackerjack personality."
17347,Susan,we should talk.
15302,Susan,"okay,you know,you can leave now."
15303,Susan,out!it's not funny.
15304,Susan,"oh,sure.oh,that's a little tight.does it have to be that tight?"
17353,Susan,shh!
15306,Susan,ow! ow!
17355,Susan,get out.
15315,Susan,i know. i read the card.
15317,Susan,really?
17370,Susan,hey.
17371,Susan,"uh, um, no, i-i haven't seen her."
17372,Susan,"hey, katherine, are you all right?"
17377,Susan,because i just freaked out about you leaving.
17378,Susan,"yes, in the fall. and i needed those extra three months to get ready. i--i still have not figured out how i'm gonna get by without you."
17379,Susan,seriously--i just lean on you in ways you don't even know.
15335,Susan,i love mike
17384,Susan,"come here, come here."
17389,Susan,amazing.
15343,Susan,only in the legal sense.and i just didn't tell you because i wanted to protect you.
15344,Susan,"okay, you know what?you should come over to dinner and meet karl,that there is absolutely nothing between us."
17391,Susan,"i don't know. come on, zippy, zippy."
17393,Susan,"you know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and i didn't force you to cuddle. so run! go! brag to your friends."
17394,Susan,edie? is that really you?
15349,Susan,i need you to ditch edie tomorrow night and have dinner with dr. ron and me.
17397,Susan,you know--this is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
17400,Susan,yeah. he--he's hard to keep track of.
17402,Susan,"hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell--and wait."
15360,Susan,yeah.
13313,Susan,"yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside and they're totally different on the inside."
17410,Susan,"you, come with me. why would you humiliate me in front of my friends? are you a lunatic?"
15363,Susan,"karl!oh, god!"
13316,Susan,"you'll love this, he said it doesn't mean anything, it was just sex."
15368,Susan,that smarts! aah!
15371,Susan,ohh!
13324,Susan,"oh, i wouldn't eat that if i were you."
13325,Susan,"i made it, trust me. hey, hey, do you have a death wish?"
15374,Susan,"okay,mike,just--it's okay.just go home."
13327,Susan,"susan mayer, i live across the street."
13328,Susan,yeah i'm very big with the under 5 set. what do you do?
15377,Susan,"oh,my god!guys,stop it.stop it,right now!"
17427,Susan,fine.
15382,Susan,"if you don't wanna be my boyfriend,fine.don't beat up the only guy who wants to volunteer for the job."
17430,Susan,"mike! uh, what's going on?"
15384,Susan,"i said something to dr. ron before the operation,and it just--devastated him."
17437,Susan,i'll explain over breakfast. did you get the paper?
13343,Susan,are you busy?
15391,Susan,try the cheese.that's the best part.
17440,Susan,"well, i do. we need a shirt that says, ""i'm a responsible citizen,"" not ""my favorite clothing store also sells bongs."""
13346,Susan,uh-- i have a clog.
15395,Susan,"her,too."
15397,Susan,no! i'm fine.the doctor said i should actually keep my blood flowing.
15402,Susan,a surprise?
13355,Susan,"oh. mrs. huber, how you doing?"
17452,Susan,"yeah. but how did you know i would like it? oh, my god."
13358,Susan,he's spending the night?
13360,Susan,edie?
13361,Susan,edie? hello..?
15408,Susan,"i know. i told her that.i said,""he always,always hates surprises."""
17456,Susan,don't touch me! or my ears! my ears are dead to you.
17457,Susan,"he has a name for it? okay. that's it. you and mike are not hanging out anymore. and this little wednesday ""potato skins and susan sex tips night""? i forbid it. did mike mention he likes having his toes sucked? oops! that just slipped out."
17458,Susan,oh. is his name mike delfino? did you room together at liars' college?
17459,Susan,"yeah, you'll drop by later--with potato skins on your breath, you miserable two-timer!"
13367,Susan,"i, i thought you were-- um. where were you?"
17461,Susan,where is he?
17462,Susan,like you don't know-- jackson.
17464,Susan,i am-- so sorry. miss? um-- could you just--please take good care of my friend?
13372,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
17469,Susan,i don't--
15422,Susan,a what now?
15425,Susan,"oh.well,why is your father keeping this?"
17474,Susan,"out, uh, doing some thinking. and i've decided that i may have gone a little overboard about you and mike. in fact, i think it's cool if you wanna hang out with my ex."
13382,Susan,the measuring cup?
13383,Susan,"hm. uh, well it's gotta be here somewhere. just keep looking."
13384,Susan,mike!
13385,Susan,"i didn't realize anyone was gonna be out here, i just sorta rolled outta bed."
15431,Susan,why?
15432,Susan,"oh. oh,no,no,no.this is not happening."
13388,Susan,do you wanna have dinner with me?
17484,Susan,ugh.
13392,Susan,oh. great.
17488,Susan,what?
13397,Susan,hey you. what're we having?
13398,Susan,"oh yeah, i love my steak."
15445,Susan,"oh,no!no,don't you dare!"
15446,Susan,you're--sick!
15447,Susan,so how you holding up?you must be exhausted.
13402,Susan,it's not like that. the more the merrier.
15457,Susan,thank you so much for helping me out.
15459,Susan,"okay,you can share my popcorn."
15460,Susan,"i'll just wait till the lights go out, and then i'll--"
15462,Susan,"orson,i'm flattered.uh,really.you--you don't wanna date me.i-i mean,my love life is just so complicated right now.well-- no,i won't bore you with the details."
13417,Susan,"that's a good idea. edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30, so i should shoot for 5."
15465,Susan,lay it on me.
15466,Susan,he lives three houses down.
17516,Susan,"well, we split up, so it's at least half my fault any way you slice it."
13421,Susan,"oh. okay. sure is beautiful, isn't it?"
17517,Susan,preparing them for what?
13425,Susan,he's a taxidermist.
13426,Susan,"uh, yes, yes he was."
13427,Susan,"no, julie, she wasn't married to xavier. that was just one of her special friends. i think we should change the subject, you know, unless you wanna keep talking about it."
15476,Susan,"wow.why did you change your mind?i mean,i hope it wasn't because of me,because i told you--"
13429,Susan,here's your dessert.
17525,Susan,"well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap? next time, be more specific."
15481,Susan,about us?i feel good.i feel happy.
17530,Susan,"you're gonna be in magazines, too?"
13438,Susan,wow. you must be so relieved.
13439,Susan,"well, it was your dog, i get it."
13440,Susan,"no, it doesn't. not at all."
15491,Susan,and i regret everything that came of it!
17540,Susan,yeah. he's been asking when you're coming. i can't wait to tell him. i know he'll be just--ah--
17541,Susan,spider. big one. gotta go!
15494,Susan,"if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her with me."
15497,Susan,"oh, my god."
17547,Susan,"come on, m.j. your daddy's waiting."
17548,Susan,"oh, honey. you know how you like to push the button when we go on the elevator, and if somebody else pushes it first, it makes you sad?"
13457,Susan,"you can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?"
13458,Susan,"uh, no, it's not!"
13459,Susan,we are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.
17555,Susan,"oh, that's just silly."
13463,Susan,"honey, stay out of this."
13465,Susan,"yeah, well you just go to hell."
15513,Susan,oh.
17562,Susan,"hey, doc. uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?"
15516,Susan,she just--spit in your wings.
17564,Susan,"okay, you know what? this is not jackson's fault. you can't give a 5-year-old a bike and expect him to wait to ride it until you have time. you know, this is what it means to be divorced. it means that sometimes you won't be there."
17565,Susan,"well, it's hard for me, too. i miss things when he's with you. and i--am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because--i have to."
17567,Susan,"yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same time."
15520,Susan,thank you.thank you for having my back.
13473,Susan,tomorrow! i'm in a towel!
15523,Susan,where'd all this food come from?
15527,Susan,me and karl?why would you think that?
13482,Susan,locked myself out. naked.
15531,Susan,"no,no,no!no,karl lied to me.he told me that he and edie had split up before--"
13485,Susan,"yeah, it's-it's casual."
15536,Susan,yes!
13493,Susan,what? when was this?
17591,Susan,i know. i'm thinking--that maybe that was a mistake.
17597,Susan,"so just to be clear, you're saying you don't want a relationship?"
15551,Susan,uh.
15552,Susan,"yes,honey!gus the mailman is here!he's using the bathroom.he'll be down in a minute.oh! darn it.guess we'll have to take a rain check,huh?"
13505,Susan,"bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?"
13506,Susan,i think we should show paul the note.
17599,Susan,"i don't want a relationship either. all i want from you is exactly what we just did. except next time, it's susan."
13511,Susan,you've got to be kidding me! she washed her car yesterday.
17607,Susan,where's karen?
17609,Susan,it means that someone forgot that we had an agreement to keep things casual.
15562,Susan,"oh, thanks. no, that's okay.we'll stay at a motel."
17611,Susan,what?
13516,Susan,god bless you!
13517,Susan,hi.
17612,Susan,poor karen. i hope she's okay.
13519,Susan,i hope it's not important.
15567,Susan,arson?
17618,Susan,"so out of nowhere, jackson says, ""let's move in together."" i-i mean, of course i was stunned. and then when i said no, he just broke up with me. i mean, does he really expect me to be in love after just five months? that's crazy."
17626,Susan,susan. jackson's girlfriend.
17629,Susan,"so we break up, and 15 minutes later you're with someone else? you got over me fast."
17631,Susan,i wanted to talk about our future.
17632,Susan,"well, i was starting to change my mind, and then i show up and find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower. i brought hot wings. you're not getting any."
15585,Susan,"um-- no, that's okay.they're fine."
13538,Susan,"no, like i told you before, we're just friends."
13539,Susan,"by the way, if i didn't make it clear yesterday, i absolutely did not do that thing that you accused me of doing."
15587,Susan,i'm sorry. did you just invite me to move in with you?
13541,Susan,"i just, ah, don't."
17635,Susan,"yeah, i have been married twice, and both times that's imploded, so really, i feel like--love is not my friend. you know, i-i wish that i could say it was just rotten luck, but--i just am thinking that--i can't do this."
13543,Susan,well th-
13544,Susan,"what exactly is it you want from me, mrs huber?"
17636,Susan,"wow--we really messed this up, didn't we?"
17638,Susan,hello?
13547,Susan,"so paul, we noticed that you're selling the house."
15597,Susan,"okay, well, then why don't you stop and go to bed?"
15598,Susan,why not?
13551,Susan,"julie? julie ,honey, wake up. we need to talk.."
15599,Susan,"okay, what are you talking about?"
15602,Susan,what?
17650,Susan,"well, it means--no sex until at least date four."
13556,Susan,"ok, let's run through it one more time."
13561,Susan,"there she goes. okay, move."
15609,Susan,bite me!
13564,Susan,oh my! whoops!
15615,Susan,"okay, i'm just gonna think that this is the meds talking,and i'll come back tomorrow."
15617,Susan,that's not true.
15621,Susan,"i know, but i can figure this out on my own.at least i'm gonna try.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for.i really am."
17672,Susan,"jackson, look at me. i'm tipsy. i'm horny. i'm easier than a 5-year-old's homework."
17673,Susan,the forehead?
15626,Susan,"oh, oh."
13579,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
15632,Susan,"oh, wow! i have a neighbor who just asked me over for coffee.i'm sorry.you must think i'm a lunatic."
15633,Susan,"oh, she is and we're gonna be so happy here. look at your new home."
13588,Susan,"dinner time. here kitty, kitty, kitty!"
15637,Susan,ohh! that's my girl!
13590,Susan,noway.
15639,Susan,"uh, no.have you tried her cell?"
13592,Susan,actually i do have a question. do you have a second?
15640,Susan,"oh, no, i'm sorry."
13594,Susan,i think this is a screwdrivert left behind by the burglar. and i didn't touch it.
17684,Susan,oh. come on. i think you know the answer to that.
15646,Susan,"oh, hi."
13599,Susan,i thought we were too. but he's been giving a lot of mixed signals.
15647,Susan,so i can't believe you caught me spraying for ants. i must look like a wreck.
15650,Susan,thanks.
15652,Susan,"well, sometimes i say things i don't mean. i blame it on my frequent exposure to ant spray."
13605,Susan,"oh!uh, you seem like a really sweet guy, in an interesting line of work. but i um i'm not really available."
17701,Susan,"why? oh, my god."
15655,Susan,mmmm.
15657,Susan,"no. no, i write children's books."
17706,Susan,"you're right. i'll stay out of it. oh, now where is the little girls' room?"
13612,Susan,"now that you've gotten your date, can you tell me what that really mean -that 907a?"
13613,Susan,well thank god for the thin blue line!
13614,Susan,"hey,mike."
13615,Susan,good.i just came by to say hello.
13616,Susan,so you member that cop from the neighbourhood watch meeting ? he agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver i found at mrs fome's house.
17709,Susan,tonight?! isn't that lovely?
13618,Susan,and i sort of said yes. i was sort of curious what you thought about that.
17718,Susan,"""ever""? w-what do you mean ""ever""?"
13624,Susan,"honey, i batted everything that wasn't nailed down. i'm telling you, nothing."
15673,Susan,"oh, my god.what? stop! that's enough. enough, enough. back up.and that ring-- that was for me, right?"
15674,Susan,"oh, my-- ohh!karl, are you okay?are you okay?let me see.oh, my god."
17720,Susan,"hey, i believe in marriage."
13628,Susan,"yes,and the flirting made me think that he was kind and trustworthy and honest and hygienic. that's how it is with me. a guy just smiles at me three times and i'm picking out wedding china. i'm a mess."
15676,Susan,oh. are you all right?
17725,Susan,jackson. jackson.
13631,Susan,i can't believe zach said that. what else did he tell you?
15679,Susan,"okay, that's ridiculous. karl doesn't have me wrapped around anything."
15681,Susan,"mike, my heart is in the exact right place."
15682,Susan,of course.okay.you don't even wanna know what my answer would have been?
17726,Susan,jackson--he's still in there. he's in the bathroom.
17729,Susan,i didn't see him.
13637,Susan,so when does our official date begin?
13638,Susan,but what if i like him?
15685,Susan,"oh, there he is."
17736,Susan,"oh, i shouldn't. they're yours."
13641,Susan,so why couldn't you just tell me that?
17737,Susan,"well, i did just give blood. oh!"
13645,Susan,excuse me. i think i'm lost.
15693,Susan,"i've got everything ready to go-- flowers, candles,elvis costello cd all cued up."
15695,Susan,then i'm gonna have to find a way to force it on my finger.
15697,Susan,but i like doing it.i think mike would want me to.oops.
13650,Susan,"oh,thank god. listen, don't ask any questions, just get somebody down here to pick me up at the corner of ninth and foster."
13651,Susan,"thank you,no, i'm on a break. hurry please!"
13652,Susan,yeah.
15699,Susan,"oh.well, how long until you can do another one?"
15703,Susan,"two, three.oh, itch, itch, itch.oh, itch, itch, itch."
15704,Susan,"oh, hey, you weren't supposed to see that."
13658,Susan,what's your favourite food?
17754,Susan,well--it's about mike.
17755,Susan,yeah. can you imagine how upset i was when i discovered he's dating a friend of mine?
13663,Susan,"i'm sorry, could you repeat that?"
15711,Susan,let me see.oh.
17762,Susan,"well, now you're not."
13668,Susan,"great. speaking of zach, i haven't seen him around lately."
13669,Susan,"oh, which ones?"
17765,Susan,"okay. well, have a nice day."
15719,Susan,jane looked cold.
15720,Susan,"all right.well, i am really hungry."
15722,Susan,"hi.um.so i need to ask you something. ian, you know, from across the hall.you met him.anyway, he sort of asked me out on a date.i know you're thrown, i was thrown too.but he's really nice and i could sort of use someone to talk to, who also talks back.the thing is i'm sort of lonely.the past six months have been really hard on me.so what i need is, i need to know if it okay with you if i go out with him.because if it's not, i won't.in fact i'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him.just wake up and tell me!wake up! please!"
13677,Susan,"yes, i think so. i learned in college. it's like riding a bike, right?"
13678,Susan,it's not big deal. it's just for a couple of hours. i let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.
17774,Susan,"uh--no, thanks. i'm really busy. i have a lot of things to do today. another time though, okay? bye."
17775,Susan,he's dating a friend of mine.
15729,Susan,"well, ah, i'm not sure that i've ever seen this shade of green before."
17777,Susan,"of course. why wouldn't it be okay? i think it's--great. really, really great."
17778,Susan,"sweetie, good news. katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you."
13684,Susan,oh!
17779,Susan,"well, she and your daddy are friends, and the more, the merrier."
13686,Susan,"i don't know, julie. you pretend to be bulimic. gag a little. come on, work with me here!"
17781,Susan,i'm sure you will.
13688,Susan,"because mary alice was a wonderful person, and now all anybody thinks about her is that she went off the deep end and did this terrible selfish thing, and i think there is more to it than that. she was my friend, julie, and i owe it to her to find out the truth."
13689,Susan,"hi, i'm susan mayer. i have an appointment to see dr. sicher."
17783,Susan,what did happen?
17788,Susan,"i mean, i could see her on the cover of ""menopause monthly."""
13696,Susan,i just have a feeling.
13697,Susan,i saw the movie. it was really good.
17793,Susan,who did you sell the ball to?
15748,Susan,dr. mayer?
13701,Susan,"i know, but i wanna look really sexy."
15749,Susan,oh please.
13703,Susan,oh my god. we are so not having this conversation.
17797,Susan,"by the way, uh, i don't think you're gonna have any problem. i had a little talk with m.j."
13706,Susan,"hey, edie!"
15755,Susan,"well, i was at my friend bree's engagement party the other night. you know when you came in and you did that whole 'orson killed his wife' thing. i was just wondering if you could elaborate."
15756,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure? do you have any proof?"
17802,Susan,"okay. it-it's a little uncomfortable, is whole situation. i mean, if m.j.'s picking up on it, how am i supposed to fix that?"
13710,Susan,old friend?
15758,Susan,the police? what did they find?
17803,Susan,"hey, everybody! are we ready to have the best time ever?"
17806,Susan,"i know. you know, that colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore."
17807,Susan,so how is katherine's foot?
13715,Susan,"oh, here it is."
13719,Susan,"i just wanted to say goodbye to mary alice's house, before somebody else moved in."
15767,Susan,"well, it's nice to see you two getting along again."
15768,Susan,really? does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
17815,Susan,i don't know. i--you don't ever think about it?
13728,Susan,and why would you root for me?
13730,Susan,"no kidding, is she here?"
17827,Susan,"hey, jackson. what? really?"
15782,Susan,"oh, ah, no, no.i should take the guest room because i am the guest."
13737,Susan,"oh, yeah, i'm here to ride the bull. check it out! okay! yeah! woo! baby! woo!"
13738,Susan,"everybody's looking at me, aren't they?"
13747,Susan,she's been in a coma ever since she came out of er. nobody knows when or even if she'll wake up.
17845,Susan,lee wouldn't do that. he loves you.
17846,Susan,"lee, um--well, there's just no graceful way to ask this, so--i'm just gonna say it straight out. when you spent the night, did we get it on?"
15799,Susan,"it's not that it's rude. it's just immaterial. i mean, it's just a number. it doesn't mean anything."
17847,Susan,oh! so--nothing happened between us?
13753,Susan,what time do you want me to be ready?
17850,Susan,yeah. now i can move in with jackson with a clear conscience.bgood. good.
15806,Susan,"to bed, alone. you know, it's something that i've always wanted to try, but i've just never gotten around to."
17854,Susan,jackson has made it pretty clear that he doesn't do good with long-distance relationships. i could lose him.
13761,Susan,i could let him in.
15809,Susan,don't push it.
15810,Susan,"oh, no, i don't mean to break the flow, but i just, um--look, i know that i'm only your second lover ever, and that, i, i know that means a lot, and i just don't want it to mean--too much."
15812,Susan,i have never had meaningless sex.
15815,Susan,"why? you know, every time we do, we just get angry."
17863,Susan,looks like the mailman switched our mail again. do you have mine?
15817,Susan,what could be more romantic?
17864,Susan,what is wrong with you?
13771,Susan,here you go. have a nice weekend.
15819,Susan,"that we work hard, and we deserve to relax."
15821,Susan,"okay, here's one--julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father."
15822,Susan,"if we keep this up, we could stay here till christmas."
17865,Susan,i'm sorry. i thought we gave your latest breakup the three seconds of shock it deserved.
17872,Susan,what are you getting at?
15828,Susan,are you serious?
17876,Susan,todd shaffer. i was 14.
17878,Susan,this is a stupid exercise. i refuse to--
15831,Susan,mmm.
17882,Susan,my grades sucked?
13788,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know because you never let me in. you know, there's this whole part of your life that you keep completely walled off."
15837,Susan,we should've been on the road ten minutes ago.
15840,Susan,i bet you'd move faster if jane were awake.
17892,Susan,"all these years, i have judged you, and--it is not your fault. oh, come here. you are the way you are because of your father."
13797,Susan,are you okay?
15845,Susan,"ian, i'm, i'm sorry. i know how you feel. it's mike. it's my mike."
13800,Susan,i think it's just that we think that it's easier to keep it all in.
17896,Susan,july?
17898,Susan,i wasn't planning to.
15852,Susan,what?
13808,Susan,"julie, what's going on?"
17905,Susan,i wonder how many people are gonna show up. mrs. mccluskey was saying he didn't have much family.
15860,Susan,"yeah! see how much fun we were? so i dragged you out onto the dance floor, and, well, you were giving me this look--sort of like the look you're giving me right now--and, um, i started to do this--and then you did this--"
13814,Susan,"you're sleeping with him, aren't you?"
13817,Susan,"yes it is. it's about me, and about every other person who was screwed over by somebody they loved. when karl ran off with brandy, you saw what a basket case i was. i was crying, i, i was tearing up his clothes, i couldn't get out of bed all day. you were right there. how could you do the same thing?"
15865,Susan,"oh, i'm just going to see mike delfino."
17914,Susan,"hey, bree, i know what you can make for the wake--that flaky-breaded-shrimp thing."
15874,Susan,what?!
17923,Susan,just leave!
13828,Susan,"i'm sorry, it wasn't my decision."
13829,Susan,what is wrong with you?
15878,Susan,"oh, this is hank, and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today for bucks an hour."
17924,Susan,"i-i-if karl's coming--change the locks, then leave."
17931,Susan,what?
15885,Susan,"okay,i know it's hard, but you gotta make an effort,and, you know, if your head is a little foggy, then don't look there. look in your heart, because i'm in there, just like you're inside mine. okay, um, this is mary alice's house, and this is where we first met. i was setting out my macaroni and cheese, and you were invited--oh! ow!"
13839,Susan,"well, yes, they were writing to each other."
17936,Susan,okay. what kind do you like-- red or white?
17937,Susan,i'm not surprised. he was a good man.
13844,Susan,"what are you, storing up for winter?"
17943,Susan,"i've been too pushy. oh, please don't take it out on m.j.. he is such a bright kid. say something in spanish."
13849,Susan,"i just, i just want it to be special."
13850,Susan,"okay. i know this sounds weird, but i just need to have my things around me."
15898,Susan,how do you sleep at night?
15900,Susan,ian! what a surprise.
17945,Susan,seriously?
13857,Susan,my oven's out.
15907,Susan,whatcha doing?
15913,Susan,don't worry. it won't last. you're just fooling yourselves!
13866,Susan,"julie, what else can i do? he can't stay here!"
15914,Susan,"oh, i just thought of something. i'm never gonna celebrate a fifty-third wedding anniversary. i'd have to live into my nineties. oh, my god. i'm gonna die."
17962,Susan,pearls or towel--you decide.
13869,Susan,thank you.
15918,Susan,i'm ida greenberg!
17964,Susan,mike said he can't afford to pay for m.j.'s private school. now i know why. he wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls when she flashes him.
13872,Susan,"i cannot believe that after everything you did, you're mad at me."
15921,Susan,"oh, i don't think that's a good idea, 'cause i, i didn't really bring my a game. is it hot?"
17970,Susan,well--at least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them.
15925,Susan,oh!
13879,Susan,thanks for your help with zach before.
15928,Susan,bless you. mmm. so what else happened?
13884,Susan,"well, i can't talk to you about everything."
15932,Susan,"oh, i didn't say that."
15934,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
13887,Susan,"well, um, he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo."
13888,Susan,thanks.
15936,Susan,what is this?
15938,Susan,did you have any?
17983,Susan,"so do i, and it's my first day at a new job. i win."
13896,Susan,we've been divorced over a year.
17995,Susan,"well, it's not better for me, especially when i'm not even told about it."
15949,Susan,"hello? yes, this is her mother. what?"
13902,Susan,you're not? what happened?
15951,Susan,"yeah, i wanna believe that, but suddenly you're having boys over, you're drinking beer--"
13908,Susan,hold on a sec.
15958,Susan,i'm sorry.
13911,Susan,"oh! well, that's great!"
15960,Susan,what?
18008,Susan,"no, we do not have any provolone."
18012,Susan,"m.j., go wait outside on the porch. i need to talk to katherine. you can take the sandwich."
15965,Susan,i would like to trade places with one of the people inside.don't-- don't you do that?
15966,Susan,"okay, you don't have to be nasty. my daughter is inside there."
13919,Susan,"okay, the analysis part of this evening is now over."
15971,Susan,"thank you. i'm sure lynette's gonna be fine, too."
13925,Susan,"yay! oh, you guys were fantastic."
13926,Susan,"okay, have fun."
15973,Susan,the last thing i said to her was that she disappointed me.
15977,Susan,they don't?
13933,Susan,okay.
15982,Susan,because you're british.
18029,Susan,thank you.
13936,Susan,i think i'll take my chances--sort of like you did--on those high notes.
13937,Susan,yeah. he's a great guy.
18032,Susan,"anyway, um, can't wait for the party. it's gonna be fun."
18034,Susan,"okay, you know what? let me show you something i think might change your mind. so katherine has a picture that i painted for mike hanging over her mantelpiece."
13941,Susan,"you're an ass, you know that?"
15989,Susan,"well, then you won't go to school. i'll home school you."
13943,Susan,"karl, don't you turn away from me. look at me! you know, what else were you doing during our marriage? how many other women were you sticking it to? as god as my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell, before i ever feel sorry for you again!"
15992,Susan,you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else.
15993,Susan,"are you crazy?! if we don't do something, those two could end up having sex!"
13946,Susan,"yeah, me too. and just so you know, i'm sorry for flipping out. i shouldn't let you get to me like that."
15995,Susan,how can you be so calm about this?
18037,Susan,it is possible.
18042,Susan,"uh, nothing."
18045,Susan,hold on. i'm sorry. but neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
13952,Susan,you want me back?
16000,Susan,yep! get him.
16001,Susan,"look, you defied my wishes, you broke my rules. did you really think i was just gonna throw in the towel? face it. i outsmarted you."
16003,Susan,how did that come up?
13956,Susan,"and, there's nothing there."
13957,Susan,"well, actually, i do, yeah. excuse me!"
13958,Susan,"mike, guess what? i love you!"
18054,Susan,"i'm missing my small candy dish. i had it last night when you guys were over for dinner, because i remember orson admiring it."
18055,Susan,"well, we don't know that for sure. i could have misplaced it."
13961,Susan,"well, i just called to say hi, and i love you!"
13962,Susan,how creepy is mrs. huber's sister!
16009,Susan,"exactly. thank you. wait, no, that does not apply to you."
16010,Susan,"your feelings? my god, you are the worst bad cop ever! go to your room. not you! get back here!"
16011,Susan,"no, i'm not!"
16012,Susan,"no, i'm good. thanks."
13967,Susan,you did? what'd you talk about?
18056,Susan,"now as you listen to the music, see what pops into your head. what shapes does it make you see? what colors are you thinking of?"
16017,Susan,so you're not gonna move to new york?
18060,Susan,who?
13971,Susan,journals?
16019,Susan,i'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
18063,Susan,"all right, everyone. grab some clay. we're making vases."
18066,Susan,"oh, well, you know, i just think that school is such a formal environment, and i thought it would be nice if we could let loose and drink a little wine, get to know each other. oh, my gosh."
13976,Susan,everything about the fire and the measuring cup is gonna be in that journal. everyone is gonna think i'm an arsonist.
18073,Susan,"oh, me, too. you know, i think we should probably keep this between us. we don't want people talking at work."
13978,Susan,are you high? edie hates me.
13980,Susan,"boy, i gotta say, i envy you."
18077,Susan,"oh, that would be way too awkward. she's my boss."
13983,Susan,"i just wanted to see how you were holding up. you know, with mrs. huber and everything."
18080,Susan,the second one?
18081,Susan,"i don't have cumin, but i probably have cinnamon."
13987,Susan,i just know mrs. huber's death's been hard on you. i want to help.
18083,Susan,"you know, i-i think you may have gotten the wrong impression. i'm not--into women."
16038,Susan,"hi, rupert! i went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while i was there, i got something for you. i thought you could wear it on your day off. do you like it?"
16042,Susan,"okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble."
16043,Susan,"no, i just, um--well, all i really needed was just a little-- little drawer, and, uh--this is just so far away and what is that smell?"
13996,Susan,me?
13998,Susan,"well, edie, you're not that bad, and, and, and believe me, i'm, i'm not that good."
16050,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i'm, i shouldn't have done that. but, rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer."
16051,Susan,"okay, you know, that is for ian to decide."
14004,Susan,"well, whatever you want to do, edie, just know that i'm sorry."
16054,Susan,i get it. as much as i have tried to pretend that it's just you and me. there's three of us in this relationship.
18104,Susan,"wow, and i was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever. mm, lucky, lucky."
14009,Susan,"well, we meet on tuesdays, and it's potluck lunch. everybody has to bring something."
16057,Susan,no.
14011,Susan,"well, edie, i, i have to clean up."
16060,Susan,"ian, you don't have to do that."
16061,Susan,you have to kiss me. it's the law.
18107,Susan,"evan, why don't you head into the classroom? i need to talk to your daddy, and i may need to use some grown-up words."
16065,Susan,"right. so, um, do you want me to make reservations at that little french place?"
14018,Susan,what is he talking about? what's happening on friday?
18114,Susan,"it's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword."
16069,Susan,is it really important that i make them a home-cooked meal?
16070,Susan,"okay, i'll give it a shot."
14023,Susan,right at my kitchen table.
16072,Susan,"so i'm cooking dinner for ian's parents tomorrow night, and it's the first time i'm meeting them, so i sort of wanna impress them."""
18118,Susan,"okay, will someone call guinness? because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence."
18122,Susan,"amy, that is very sweet. i love the colors you used. oh, danielle, that is just beautiful. evan, that is very pretty. you did the assignment just like i asked. good job!"
18126,Susan,karl--
18131,Susan,"don't worry, edie. you're gonna get through this. you're gonna be just fine."
18133,Susan,"i don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip. uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories."
18134,Susan,"okay, i was thinking of stories that put edie in a positive light."
18136,Susan,"yeah. that's what everybody thinks. but the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends."
14042,Susan,they were having a very interesting conversation.
16090,Susan,come in.
18143,Susan,funny and likes to gossip. we're gonna get along just fine.
16096,Susan,"yeah. edie dumped him. okay, i know how this looks but i just feel bad. he's just a friend now."
14049,Susan,so you and mary alice just kept this to yourselves all these years?
18145,Susan,"okay, i lied. i hate running."
16101,Susan,what are you saying? you think mike is guilty?
18156,Susan,i don't think so.
14061,Susan,"well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, and i've forbidden julie from hanging out with him."
16110,Susan,"oh. well, that's too bad. well, no harm done then, huh?"
18158,Susan,a cup? are you sure that'll be enough?
18160,Susan,"oh, i get it. so you feel i judged you, and for revenge, you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage."
16114,Susan,"no, i found evidence. look. orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year. i mean, doesn't that suggest- he's some sort of--"
14068,Susan,ooh. that place is so pretentious. i've been dying to go there.
16116,Susan,what?
18164,Susan,wow. you're just a giver.
18167,Susan,i can't help thinking about all the times edie and i sniped at each other. we could have been good friends.
14076,Susan,are you okay?
14077,Susan,"oh, um, so can i come over? i, i really need to talk to you about something."
18180,Susan,we'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
16134,Susan,"oh, well, you know, we'll figure that out later."
16135,Susan,"um, yeah, about that--it's ian. he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex."
14089,Susan,i don't believe this. you're leaving without even trying to talk me into having your baby? i mean how do you know i wouldn't cave. i always cave.
18186,Susan,"yeah, i left that casserole three days ago, and it's still there. i'm surprised the squirrels haven't gotten to it."
16140,Susan,"well, he does, and so he's pretending he didn't. that's suspicious, right?"
18188,Susan,"i'm in the classroom all day, and i have meetings after."
14095,Susan,yeah. i'm gonna go outside and let you rest for a while.
18193,Susan,sometimes it's the stove's fault.
14102,Susan,get out.
16152,Susan,i was really touched by your call. it was so big of you.
14107,Susan,"okay, call."
18203,Susan,"dave, i know that you're going through hell, but edie was my friend, so please, let me help you. just a little."
18204,Susan,you sure you don't want one? it's really good.
14111,Susan,can you hold these a sec?
18207,Susan,"okay, well--at least you're making plans for the future."
14113,Susan,"you can see boys in a couple years, just not that boy."
16161,Susan,excuse me?
14116,Susan,yeah.
18213,Susan,"okay. you have a realtor coming, right? you cannot let him see the house in this condition. so just let me clean up a little. you won't even know i'm here."
14125,Susan,"no, not really, no. so guess what? i'm your alibi. i told the police that we were together the night that mrs. huber was killed and that i could never forget that night."
16178,Susan,sex kills!
18226,Susan,"you are not fine. how could you be? you have suffered a horrible loss. and you are allowed to feel any way you want. but i know that you are not fine. okay, well, i'm sorry for ransacking your house. i'll stop bugging you."
16180,Susan,really?
18229,Susan,"a few years ago, mike and i got in a car accident. a woman and her daughter--died."
16185,Susan,"you can't say ""ooh-kay"" like that, either. julie's not like other girls. she's a straight-""a"" student."
18235,Susan,"that's what we said, but it wasn't true. he took the blame for me."
14143,Susan,"no, he didn't. he was with me and mike wouldn't kill anybody. i'm sure of that."
16192,Susan,see? it's just a tape.
16195,Susan,you got my daughter the pill?!
14148,Susan,julie? mommy needs a hug. julie?
18244,Susan,"how's it feeling, mrs. mccluskey?"
18245,Susan,"jackson, hey. you're back."
16201,Susan,"well, of course i freaked out. i'm a parent. you know, we hope that our children will wait to have sex till after we're dead."
16202,Susan,"okay, that's the other thing. that cannot happen anymore. you and i have always had an amazing relationship. let's not mess it up now."
18249,Susan,i'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.
16204,Susan,"honey, i was over at edie's today and i walked in the door and--"
14158,Susan,hi.
16206,Susan,"this is your new lawyer, alan marcus. alan, this is mike delfino."
18256,Susan,i'm fine. i just didn't want you to see me crying.
14163,Susan,i'm sure. now go.
14164,Susan,who is it?
14166,Susan,or just come on in.
14167,Susan,"i decided that my life is way too complicated, and so i'm simplifying. i am getting rid of the clutter."
16216,Susan,zach young? our zach young? how does he afford diamonds?
14169,Susan,doesn't matter anymore.
16218,Susan,"wow. so zach young is loaded, huh?"
18267,Susan,"this--i mean, this is really the only thing you can do to stay here and do your work?"
14173,Susan,why would i go anywhere with you?
14178,Susan,"i hate 'em all. look at them just leering at us. they're so damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand."
16226,Susan,oh. ian--
18276,Susan,what?
14181,Susan,"i don't know. obviously, a bad guy. somebody really awful, somebody like -- somebody like paul young."
14184,Susan,zach killed her.
14187,Susan,i don't know.
14188,Susan,"see? shifting blame onto someone else -- that's classic criminal behavior. oh, i'm telling you, he's up to no good."
16237,Susan,you've done everything you could. she knows that you love her.
14191,Susan,"martha huber was your best friend. if we could find out who really killed her, wouldn't that be worth the risk?"
16239,Susan,hey. you're back.
18287,Susan,yeah. what?
14194,Susan,i'm serious. there's something about this house that's just so cold and creepy. you couldn't tell when mary alice was alive. she just brought so much warmth and light. now there's something--i can just taste it. can't you sense it?
16243,Susan,it's not--
16244,Susan,good luck with everything.
18289,Susan,"uh, can i talk to you for a sec?"
16246,Susan,you're right. i'll keep looking.
18293,Susan,"well, look, maybe--i could talk to mike. i could see if we could work something out."
14202,Susan,i've got to get the tape.
14204,Susan,"mike, it's not a good time. i'm a little drunk and a little freaked out."
14207,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet. you killed a man.
18304,Susan,yeah. mike agreed to keep paying me alimony. he just sent me a text.
16259,Susan,"i'm not at liberty to say. under the circumstances, they'd prefer to keep it quiet. i don't believe it. if there was some bimbo in the picture, i'd have heard about it."
14212,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet!you killed the man!
14214,Susan,i know.
16262,Susan,"oh, dear god."
16264,Susan,yeah. i'll be having night terrors from now on--which i deserve.
16265,Susan,i'm so sorry i ruined jane's funeral.
14220,Susan,"no, no, i won't. i don't trust mike anymore. and without trust--no, no. i'm just gonna go in and rip it up and throw it in the trash."
18319,Susan,i'd just feel more comfortable if i'm close by.
16273,Susan,you doing okay?
18321,Susan,what are you doing? i just told you i can't go.
16276,Susan,"i just heard from andrew what happened. i had to come see you. if you want me to go, uh--"
18325,Susan,so they're sending you back? when?
14230,Susan,oh.
16280,Susan,of course. i should let you rest.
16283,Susan,it's true. he's gonna be a free man. isn't that great?
18333,Susan,"oh, you guys, i'm sorry. i gotta run."
16286,Susan,"yeah. except for orson, who fell off a roof. you know anything about that?"
16287,Susan,i heard you talking to carlos. now answer the question.
18337,Susan,did mike turn jackson in to immigration?
16290,Susan,hey. where were you off to so early this morning?
16291,Susan,"ian, oh, you can't be serious. oh, oh, that's just--too much. it's huge."
18340,Susan,"well, somebody did, because he sent me a text agreeing to keep paying me alimony."
14246,Susan,"so what then? if you can't have him, nobody can?"
16294,Susan,"oh! oh! oh, okay, nobody move. i got it."
16295,Susan,"no, it's okay. i can get it resized."
16301,Susan,"uh, yeah, i, uh, have to get this sized. it's--it's a little loose."
14254,Susan,"see now. maybe it's the word ""date"" that's throwing me off."
18353,Susan,"good. that's all i needed to hear. well, i hope that you will be very happy together."
18355,Susan,"oh, the truth is, um--well, it's complicated."
16308,Susan,yes!
18358,Susan,wow. you're getting married this weekend?
18359,Susan,"it's sweet, but--yeah, it's ridiculous. and besides, um, m.j. and i have big plans this weekend."
14265,Susan,that's not true!
18362,Susan,"well, if you do, we're gonna clean it and serve it up for dinner."
14267,Susan,"okay, mr. let's-just-have-fun-cause-i'm-the-charming-casual-contractor-man. you chased me, so own it, my friend!"
14268,Susan,i was meaning to. i guess i do invite the drama in. just a little.
18363,Susan,"okay. bye, mike. have a nice wedding."
16318,Susan,"oh, not that chair. that's the wobbler. i'm saving up for a new set. here, sit here."
18366,Susan,you do?
18369,Susan,"uh, yeah. we are in the car, singing."
16322,Susan,just adultery?
18370,Susan,this sounds really---
16324,Susan,your father's been up there for twenty minutes. are you sure he's okay?
14277,Susan,let's go inside and call the insurance company.
14278,Susan,and then the police showed me his mug shots.
18373,Susan,that sucks. how could they cancel your flight?
16328,Susan,hello!
14281,Susan,i know.
16330,Susan,just take the robe off. and whatever you have on underneath--consider that yours.
16331,Susan,"so, uh, what won't you ask me?"
18378,Susan,okay. it's no big deal.
14285,Susan,you're not tired. you took a nap. what is it?
16334,Susan,"okay, stop this. we invited you here to celebrate our engagement. now i'm divorced, and ian's disinherited?"
18381,Susan,"um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?"
14289,Susan,"oh, you can't be serious? morty?"
14290,Susan,"alright, maybe you just feel that way because every year you get older and older."
16339,Susan,"they weren't all raw. i was trying to spell ""mike,"" and the ""m"" was goopy, but the ""ike"" was delicious. you loved it."
16342,Susan,i should go 'cause ian's parents are here.
18392,Susan,"dave, please--i'm so sorry about that accident. you don't wanna hurt m.j. or me. you're a good person. i know you."
18393,Susan,"well, you won't get away with it. mike already called the cops. they're on their way."
18396,Susan,what are you gonna do to us? why did you bring us here?
14301,Susan,okay girls.
16349,Susan,thank you. i don't want your family's stuff. what am i gonna do with half a castle?
14303,Susan,usually poker is more fun than this.
16351,Susan,"well, the difference is huge. i mean, one way you're trusting me, and--and the other way, you're trying to make it official."
16353,Susan,really? i think it's about someone else. he just wanted me to help him remember something.
14306,Susan,"okay, can we focus? what i want to know is have you thought about what's going to happy if you don't go back to morty?"
16355,Susan,"okay, i'll sign it."
18404,Susan,dave! dave!
14310,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. here lean your head back."
16359,Susan,"what i'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that i need to--skirt. no issue that i won't--address. i won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy."
18406,Susan,"oh, god! are you okay?"
18409,Susan,"okay. just stop talking. john, how old are you?"
18410,Susan,what do you think?
14320,Susan,for shoving her.
14321,Susan,why was she hitting you?
16369,Susan,"oh, my god. are you okay?"
14323,Susan,"well, even so!"
18420,Susan,what are you smiling about?
16374,Susan,"okay, don't panic. just grab onto my neck, and i'll swim for the both of us."
16375,Susan,"if you stay here, you'll definitely drown. you see how my plan is better?"
16378,Susan,"and our cheese! ian, can you believe it? mike saved our cheese!"
14331,Susan,"i am - i mean, i was. it didn't work out."
18428,Susan,what the hell was that?
16382,Susan,saying what?
12289,Lynette,this is dr. dolan.
12293,Lynette,"i understand. it just seems like--at $140 an hour, we could skip straight to the part where you sit down with kayla and tell her to stop being so evil."
12295,Lynette,"oh, well, thank you. it's beautiful. thank you."
12298,Lynette,"oh, go ahead. shoot."
10253,Lynette,"guys, please--that's--all right."

10263,Lynette,"no. no, you're not gonna make him pay.you are gonna stop this now."
12313,Lynette,"we tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand what that word means, so now we're gonna be something you do understand."
12316,Lynette,"well, i know, but we're supposed to be spending time together, not going into debt. oh. how about this one?"
10269,Lynette,"so-- can this be a place of business again,ed?no more games?"

10306,Lynette,excuse me?
10315,Lynette,"look,i apologize in advance for how this is going to sound,but i have to ask. it's just gonna eat away at me.were you drinking while baby-sitting my kids?"
12364,Lynette,"okay, so at the risk of cracking these eggshells i've been walking on all week, any idea when you're gonna stop being so angry?"
10320,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
10326,Lynette,hey.
10327,Lynette,"if you really wanna do this now, shut the door.okay,sure, i was a little bitchy.but you know why? you did a half-ass job in there."
12374,Lynette,i don't care what you said. we have to fix this! or do you want to tell bree that you torpedoed her ceremony?
12379,Lynette,could you give us a second?
12380,Lynette,answer him.
10333,Lynette,"so you want me to,uh--pitch you as parents?"

10343,Lynette,"okay.so if i apologize for upsetting you at work,can we get past it and enjoy our meal?"
10358,Lynette,"i am so sorry you feel that way,but you cannot put that on me.this is your life.you wanna run it?"
12408,Lynette,"are we redefining ""cool"" to include playing trombone in the marching band?"
12411,Lynette,"i just need five seconds to bitch about tom, and then i'll-- oh, my god. your painter isn't done yet?"
12412,Lynette,"well, anyway, tom refuses to acknowledge that the twins are turning into juvenile delinquents. just the other day, i was"
12414,Lynette,"sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest."
10369,Lynette,"but,honey, it goes back and forth."
12417,Lynette,--in your father's convertible.
10373,Lynette,"word is out all over town that you're unhappy at zimms,so why not jump ship and come to parcher & murphy?i swear, veronica,you would fit in so well here."
10374,Lynette,"yeah, it sucks, but there are other perks--the expense account, the corner office--"
12421,Lynette,"tom, relax! you high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun."
12426,Lynette,"i know you love them, but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining, you forget to parent them."
12430,Lynette,got a sec?
10385,Lynette,"uh-huh.um,i'm--i'm,um-- i'm gonna have--i'm gonna call you back."
10388,Lynette,"yeah,well,we'll just ask her to keep the blinds always drawn when she nurses."
10390,Lynette,"no! no,uh,please,don't make me do it.why don't you have jerry tell her?"
12438,Lynette,"and, uh--how would somebody make that happen?"
12440,Lynette,me. i'm 16 and cute. i like graphic novels and tokyo police club.
12441,Lynette,our brooding son has a classmate who got arrested for selling drugs. i really think the end justifies the means here.

12461,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! why didn't you say something?!"
10414,Lynette,"good.because when i give my deposition,i'm goingto tell the truth."
12465,Lynette,"hi, dave."
12466,Lynette,"hey, tom?"
10420,Lynette,how can you be so sure?we have andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.and then we have bree saying it's andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.how are we supposed to know the real truth?
12473,Lynette,and i wasn't!
12475,Lynette,what?
10430,Lynette,"my kids don't wander.they scurry,like rats."
10435,Lynette,"no,you don't.in fact,i hate liars."
12483,Lynette,how in the world did that happen?
12487,Lynette,yeah. sure. come on in.
12490,Lynette,"well, sorry. but maybe you could go skateboarding with orson."
10443,Lynette,what kind of cookie?
12491,Lynette,and what makes you think you know what my husband needs?
12495,Lynette,i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family.
12496,Lynette,hey. congratulations!
12497,Lynette,"oh, and look, you signed it--""to lynette, the sweetest, most wonderful friend i've ever known."""
12498,Lynette,ha ha ha .could i see that? i'd love to read it.
10451,Lynette,"well--actually,he's kinda right. he's got the concept down."
12499,Lynette,"well, back before i consecrated my life to mozzarella, marketing was sort of what i did."
12505,Lynette,"as you can see, the graphic works just as well on a free-standing display unit. neat, huh?"
10463,Lynette,"uh,yeah. of course.no,sorry."
12518,Lynette,"hey! everyone, this is my old assistant, stu, um--"
10471,Lynette,because it's not an appropriate subject.
12520,Lynette,your company? you have a company?
10476,Lynette,what?
12528,Lynette,"yeah, mm. great."
12532,Lynette,whoop. still waiting.
12537,Lynette,"oh. i know. you've got your book and--and your big fancy award, and i'm just a housewife."
10490,Lynette,"i mean, you and fran could spice it up a bit.you know, get the old juices flowing again."
10492,Lynette,"okay!uh, well,i hope that helped.and i'm just gonna go back and finish so we can all get out of here."
10498,Lynette,"for god's sakes,it's not brain surgery.is she still online?"
12548,Lynette,penny! let's go! time for bath!
10508,Lynette,you're gonna fire me?
10514,Lynette,"no,no,you should keep it."
12562,Lynette,but it doesn't matter because you're not dying.
12563,Lynette,"okay. okay. we'll find more. just rest now, okay?"
10519,Lynette,"well,fran found out that ed didn't send them,and she blew her top.she wants the responsible party fired,and ed lied and told her--that you sent them."
12570,Lynette,"well, i might not say anything. i might just put my finger to my ear and twirl it in small circles. we can't do something like that, tom."
12571,Lynette,"okay, let me ask you one tiny question about this big adventure plan of yours who's gonna be running our restaurant while we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?"
12576,Lynette,"no, i get it. the sports car, the garage band--maybe what we need now, tom, is for you to get it."
10534,Lynette,"if this is where you want me to apologize for my husband,i'm not gonna do it.maybe he shouldn't have hit you,but you provoked him."
10535,Lynette,"no! i'm sorry,tom gets punished beuse you can't deal with your screwed-up marriage.it is pathetic,ed.if you had stood up to your wife in the first place,none of this--what?"
10545,Lynette,maybe you do.
10548,Lynette,"yeah, how, indeed?"
12597,Lynette,"tom, where are you?"
10552,Lynette,"i'm thinking, yeah, ruin it."
10553,Lynette,i am-- so happy and i'm so relieved.
10554,Lynette,no! absolutely not.
10558,Lynette,i got my boarding pass.

10573,Lynette,"yeah. hang on.i'll call you later. okay, bye."
10578,Lynette,"yeah. no, wait. actually, wait.this is perfect.you know why? because we need some impartial judges."
10583,Lynette,"i'm sorry that you saw my panic attack.i won't let it happen again, especially since this is my last pregnancy."
10588,Lynette,what's this now?
10589,Lynette,"well, we already swam.now it's time to pack.hey, hey, hey!what's going on?"
10590,Lynette,"okay! okay, okay, porter, just stop, all right? just come on inside, and we'll forget the whole thing."
12638,Lynette,i do. why do i have a sense you're gonna take it away from me?
12640,Lynette,"okay. well, your minute's up."
10593,Lynette,i've got nothing to say to you.i just called because i had to.
10596,Lynette,i don't care what her name is.
10598,Lynette,what?
12651,Lynette,"yes, i did, porter. i had to talk to anne. i didn't know that her husband was there, and he overheard us and--the doctors say she's gonna be fine. porter, wh-- where are you going? damn it!"
10604,Lynette,hey.
12284,Lynette,"oh, we gotta take him to the hospital."
12652,Lynette,"excuse me. gaby, have you seen porter?"
10616,Lynette,"sweetie, sometimes when you're at work, and i'm home alone with three young boys, i'm not so happy, and now i'm gonna be alone with four kids. each one is a blessing, yes, but i don't think i can take any more-- blessings.more blessings could make me lose my mind.do you understand?"
12668,Lynette,what about rick's restaurant? porter and his brother burned that down.
12672,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
10628,Lynette,i don't see another way to make this work.we've gotta dip into the pensions.
12676,Lynette,"i'm helping you help me. this way, you get to start a new life, and i get to not have you around while my son is going through all this."
10633,Lynette,"i know we're using up a huge chunk of our savings, but if it keeps that crazy woman out of our life,it is the best money we have ever spent.we will be okay."
12681,Lynette,"oh. listen, we need to talk."
10636,Lynette,hi. did you get the check?
12684,Lynette,"of course it wasn't. of course. then we're gonna be okay, as long as you keep telling the truth. everything's gonna be fine."
10638,Lynette,really?
10643,Lynette,"like, five minutes from here arden drive?"
12691,Lynette,wait. what's going on?
12693,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
10647,Lynette,kayla ready yet?
10648,Lynette,no problem.she's a great little girl.
12696,Lynette,the d.a. says you were spotted coming out of the storage room right before the fire started. what gives?
10650,Lynette,nora.
12697,Lynette,"you are up for manslaughter, and you're worried about being embarrassed?"
10653,Lynette,"how about, you're in the frame, bitch, move."
12701,Lynette,then this is really not an alibi. it's more a confession to another crime.
10655,Lynette,"nora, this is just for our family.i would prefer if you weren't in it."
12703,Lynette,"if edie reports this gun missing, you don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force to figure out where to start looking, and that's the last thing we need right now."
10658,Lynette,"no, that's fine.wow, white gloves.what are we having lunch in the 1880s."
10659,Lynette,what are you being so coy about?

12711,Lynette,"you're my lawyer, so anything i tell you is in confidence, right?"
10671,Lynette,"hey, nora."
12719,Lynette,"well, actually, i wanted to borrow edie's yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment."
10678,Lynette,"okay, kids.come on, come on!"
10679,Lynette,"okay, all right, everybody's in."

12741,Lynette,"i called you, like, five times."
12742,Lynette,yeah.
10696,Lynette,ah.
10699,Lynette,you haven't even met him. he could be the sweetest man in the world.
10700,Lynette,"more importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromm is never around. it has been bliss! i haven't made this face. in a week. if you ruin this, so help me, i will hurt you!"
10706,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, take a deep breath. you don't wanna break up with a guy because, in a weak moment, he calls you a whore."
10707,Lynette,"okay, but he didn't, he didn't, and you know until--"
10708,Lynette,i'm on the side of love. you guys seem like such a perfect couple.
10715,Lynette,"get a grip? i am hanging on for dear life, here. you are the one that brought this little problem into our family and the only thing i should be hearing from you is 'how can i help?' i am also putting steve hansen at her table so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy."
10716,Lynette,get a grip.
10717,Lynette,"so, he was an actual suspect?"
10722,Lynette,um. how about steve? you know what? i hear his family has money.
12770,Lynette,"tom, i know where porter is. he's hiding at my mother's."
10725,Lynette,what are they doing?
10733,Lynette,yeah? how can you be so sure?
12782,Lynette,she's so angry at me. she's never gonna tell us where he is.
12783,Lynette,no. no. it means she outsmarted her mom.
8696,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, hey!"
10744,Lynette,so?
8698,Lynette,"no, you are going to behave today. i am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood. and, just so you know how serious i am--"
12793,Lynette,"the ball game is going to end whether you like it or not. i would like to be here with you for whatever time you have left. but for that to happen, things have to change."
10748,Lynette,"allllll right. yeah.i will be there as soon as i can.god, i hate my life."
10749,Lynette,what are you doing here?
12795,Lynette,i have no idea.
8703,Lynette,hey.
8704,Lynette,please tell me you punched him.
12796,Lynette,"speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when eli's funeral is?"
12798,Lynette,oh. that's what it means.
12799,Lynette,"well, you've certainly had quite a glamorous life."
10756,Lynette,"no, my favorite game is counting all the things i'm dying to say to you but i don't. like--pipe down, you annoying nut job.' i'd never say that."
12801,Lynette,that's so nice. we were just--
10758,Lynette,"ah! oh, my god! knock it off! what is the matter with you?! what is wrong with you? what the hell do you think you're doing?"
8711,Lynette,"you three planned this?? alright, that's it. get out!"
8712,Lynette,no? i am your mother. you have to do what i say. come on.
10759,Lynette,"no, well, it wasn't funny. if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but don't take me with you."
12811,Lynette,oh. i wish you'd caught me two chardonnays ago.
10765,Lynette,"all right, now look, you've gone from crazy to stupid. this guy could be dangerous."
10769,Lynette,yeah.
10770,Lynette,excuse me? did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it?
10771,Lynette,"and you think that's easy? okay, i have a good life. yes, yes, i am very lucky, but i work twelve hours a day, and then i come home to what seems like thirty three children, and husband who refuses to get a job. and believe me, there is not a supermom out there who wouldn't trade in her cape, for a chance to read a book and get a massage by a man who has the decency to leave when it's over."
12817,Lynette,"jeffrey cuevas is retiring in september. i am the perfect person to step into his job, and that is exactly when parker starts kindergarten. the timing is like a dream."
8725,Lynette,it's the best job i've ever had.
12819,Lynette,"well, i was hoping you could cut back on your hours at work."
10775,Lynette,why would he be afraid?
10776,Lynette,how's your back?
10781,Lynette,maybe?
12830,Lynette,i got the job.
10783,Lynette,tell me something i don't know.
10786,Lynette,"well, daddy should have checked with mommy, so she could have a chance to tell him why he's wrong. hey, you're playing."
12835,Lynette,"oh, my god. oh, my god. i was on the phone. i was talking to my new boss, and i--"
10789,Lynette,"if i threw any slower, we would be bowling."
8742,Lynette,let's get this show on the road.
8745,Lynette,"that would be fun. paul, we have proof your wife killed herself over some deep dark secret. another ??"
8746,Lynette,maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.
10793,Lynette,"yeah, well, that's not the point.what kind of message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the going gets rough?"
10795,Lynette,"hey, did i tell you that, uh, burnham fox is looking for a new creative director?"
12843,Lynette,"he's inside, but between sobs, he wished you happy driving."
12847,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza and sports cars."
8754,Lynette,"and for you to stand there, and judge me."
8755,Lynette,i accept your apology.
8757,Lynette,"listen, i was just getting dinner ready."
10806,Lynette,"yeah, i heard your old man's out of work. that's gotta be tough."
12853,Lynette,"because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back, and then you stop loving them."
12854,Lynette,and so do you. and i'm gonna feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.
10809,Lynette,"yeah, well, after all those fastballs--come on, parker! you can do it!"
12857,Lynette,"it wouldn't be a loan or a gift. it would be--an investment that would buy you, say--15% of scavo's."
12859,Lynette,hi.
12860,Lynette,this will just take a sec.
8765,Lynette,"boys, i am not gonna tell you again, sit. i mean it, i am serious. you guys are gonna be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats."
8766,Lynette,"out. can't behave, you heard me, can't ride. you, out. move it."
10817,Lynette,i was trying to repair my son's shattered self-esteem.
8770,Lynette,"i know, i was just trying to scare them into behaving. did you see where they went?"
10820,Lynette,whoa. where'd that come from?
12870,Lynette,"bree, no one will notice. parmesan is the fourth cheese in a four cheese pizza. it's the ringo of these cheeses."
8775,Lynette,"well, bring 'em, we're leaving."
12871,Lynette,"oh, for pete sake. i'll be right back."
8777,Lynette,"let go of me! what's the matter with you? run, boys, run!"
8778,Lynette,"oh, crap."
8782,Lynette,i know. preston used the three of diamonds to scoop jam out of the jar.
12879,Lynette,"we all know how well you're doing, bree. you have made that very clear. but you shouldn't be lording it over everybody just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks."
10833,Lynette,"okay, well, maybe a little."
12881,Lynette,meaning that i've created my own failure?
12882,Lynette,"whoa. talk about luck. when i offered to throw you this little thank-you party, i never imagined that it would turn into an opportunity for me to learn from the great bree hodge."
8788,Lynette,i'm in.
12885,Lynette,"i know you don't, but five years ago, you would've."
8790,Lynette,"yeah, it'll be fun. bree's cooking, everyone's coming."
10838,Lynette,how the hell did he do that?
10840,Lynette,"i don't know how these rumors get started. no, parker only quit the team 'cause he hurt his ankle."
12889,Lynette,yeah--i think it's a little late for that.
8795,Lynette,so did mike say anything?
10844,Lynette,what are we celebrating?
8798,Lynette,yeah.
10849,Lynette,"no, that was a real frisbee to the head, that one."
8803,Lynette,"can't, i already cancelled the sitter."
8804,Lynette,"throw a dinner party? i don't even have time to wash my face. no, you know what? i'm gonna go to this one. you can stay home and babysit the kids."
8808,Lynette,"sweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?"
12905,Lynette,"tom, what the hell are you talking about?"
12907,Lynette,but having the kids work there?
8812,Lynette,"when tom and i were first married, things got a little out of hand on mr. toad's wild ride."
10861,Lynette,mm-hmm. yeah.
10862,Lynette,"no, not really."
12908,Lynette,really? that doesn't sound like me.
8816,Lynette,oooh. who cracked anyway?
12909,Lynette,okay. fine.
12910,Lynette,"kids, we are going to support your father by working in his restaurant."
8820,Lynette,are we happy?
8822,Lynette,by reliving your night out with the guys?
12918,Lynette,"oh, thanks. you didn't give them enough change."
12919,Lynette,"okay, you make the salads. i'll handle the register."
12920,Lynette,what's going on?
10874,Lynette,"tom, i--"
12924,Lynette,"guys, easy."
10877,Lynette,it's a dump! what are you thinking?
10880,Lynette,don't tell me. you didn't sign a lease.
12928,Lynette,i think this can all wait until morning. don't you?
10882,Lynette,you leased a building without telling me?
12929,Lynette,"what? it's a $12,000 oven."
12932,Lynette,"hey. i got $6,200 for the oven."
12934,Lynette,"well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors, give bree back the $20,000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for--45 minutes."
10887,Lynette,"yeah. a little.but that's okay.that's okay.we still love each other very much.but just like kids, sometimes grown-ups throw tantrums and need a time-out."
10889,Lynette,"it means childish, stubborn, careless with my money and your futures."
8842,Lynette,"like this mug , i love this mug. if i medicate them, are they still going to make me a mug like this?"
12938,Lynette,you--ah. hey. i think you better stop with the bargain hunting unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
10892,Lynette,i suckered mccluskey into taking the kids for a while so i could kick back and catch up with my old friend margarita. you care to join us?
8845,Lynette,"hey paul, what's up?"
8847,Lynette,troubled?
10896,Lynette,we're numbing the pain of our miserable lives.
12943,Lynette,seriously?
10899,Lynette,bite on this.
8853,Lynette,we'll talk about that later. right now i need you to take some medicine.
8858,Lynette,"here, you."
8860,Lynette,"not in so many words, but everything paul said certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic."
12958,Lynette,he's being modest. he was the best.
8864,Lynette,"go!go, go!"
10913,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't quite catch that. why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?
8866,Lynette,"that's nice of you. and since we're talking about it, there's something else nice i'd like you to do. your kids both went to barcliff academy, didn't they?"
10914,Lynette,i have been trying to stay away from you--
8868,Lynette,"yes, you can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are."
10917,Lynette,"your association with my family is over. when kayla comes to visit, you will drop her at the end of the block. you will never again see my husband, and if you try to, i will do to your spine what i just did to your front door. nod if you understand."
12961,Lynette,that sounds--amazing.
12970,Lynette,"okay, you lick. i'm going to paris."
10924,Lynette,"it was awful, as always. i saw she was in pain, and i just walked away and--"
8878,Lynette,"sorry, tom, mr lenz was trying to say something. mr lenz?"
10926,Lynette,do you think he knows mary alice shot herself in his living room?
12974,Lynette,"you know, tom, you're right. bruce does care about this job. that's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it."
8883,Lynette,boys? wake up.
8886,Lynette,c'on! i got you beat!
8890,Lynette,look at that concentration. porter loves his puzzles.
10938,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i heard she isn't well. can i ask what's wrong with her?"
8892,Lynette,"well,did you bat your eyes? you know, it doesn't work if you don't bat your eyes."
12992,Lynette,"yeah, this isn't about that. um, i wanted to say i heard about carlos' g promotion. congratulations."
8897,Lynette,"but to be fair, that is part of your charm."
10946,Lynette,"put daddy on, and i'll buy you a real robot."
12993,Lynette,absolutely. now you know i'm looking for work?
8900,Lynette,fifteen thousand.
12996,Lynette,"yes, i helped advertise what companies decided to market. it's the same thing. come on. you know i'd be great."
12999,Lynette,you think i'm a big risk?
13002,Lynette,"mr. vivinetto, i'm not obligated to answer. it's the law."
10955,Lynette,"oh, forget it! forget it! we'll work that out later."
10959,Lynette,i did not want this. don't you dare say that i wanted this.
10960,Lynette,"no, i will not shut up! what's the matter with you?!"
13007,Lynette,"it matters because i'm only 43, and i look like i'm 39."
8914,Lynette,i'm not surprised that he's playing it close to the vest. paul knows we're on to him.
8915,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i thought you were kidding."
13009,Lynette,hey.
10965,Lynette,"no, you're not. i can tell. please-- tell me what's wrong. let me save you."
8919,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. my twins just joined. they're playing oak trees.
10967,Lynette,isn't there anything i can do?
10969,Lynette,"hey.hey!oh, my gosh! you didn't have to do this!hi!"
8928,Lynette,"it's science, gabrielle.sociologists have documented this stuff."
13026,Lynette,"well, it's probably nothing. but when carlos works on his computer at home, does he take his shirt off there, too?"
8932,Lynette,"well, that's what's so great about being in a democracy. everyone is entitled to their opinion. also, everyone has a right to vote. so all in favor of the woodsman going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass--"
10981,Lynette,hey.
13029,Lynette,"because you used me! at least when i asked you for a favor, i was up-front."
13032,Lynette,do i spill my salary?
10986,Lynette,yeah. i never make cakes. this is huge.
8939,Lynette,"seriously, how, how do you cram it all in?"
10989,Lynette,he said take as much time as i want with pay.
8942,Lynette,"seriously, you're taking your kids medication?"
8945,Lynette,"uh-huh. ah, incidentally, who is 'they', as in 'they forgot to tell the printer'?"
8946,Lynette,"well, these things happen. oh, i'll be right back."
8947,Lynette,"okay, lady, that's it!"
10993,Lynette,or wherever.
8949,Lynette,let's take it outside.
10996,Lynette,she won't.
8951,Lynette,"just being practical. isn't it better to settle this once and for all, rather than endure all this alpha mom crap until our kids graduate? hmmm? come on! i'll even let you take the first shot."
13047,Lynette,no. i got a hole puncher. sorry. that's the best i could do. come on.
11001,Lynette,to the market.
13048,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers. actually, they do look like a lot of fun. if only i had the power to stop you--"
13052,Lynette,and say what?
8957,Lynette,did he say anything about his mother's suicide?
11011,Lynette,not so much them.
11013,Lynette,"hey, parker. i want you to meet our new neighbor, art. he lives in the house across the street. his sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick."
11015,Lynette,"it's okay.you can trust him,really.art is the one who saved me at the supermarket.he's sort of a superhero."
13064,Lynette,why? chemo's not until 5.
8969,Lynette,"yeah, it's good for your career. i'll pull it off."
8970,Lynette,"hey, jordana!"
11018,Lynette,shh! that's a secret. hello? hello?
13065,Lynette,been here before?
13072,Lynette,and what do you want from me?
8979,Lynette,'dana.' where did this come from?
11028,Lynette,"what are you, his lawyer? you have to admit, it's odd."
11029,Lynette,he wasn't technically home when i went inside.
13075,Lynette,she never let me forget it either. she always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
13082,Lynette,unless that's a little weird for you.
11035,Lynette,what are the blake kids doing all the way over here? pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
13084,Lynette,you bet.
11040,Lynette,bye.
8993,Lynette,"tom, i am sorry about tonight. truly, but these days, if i'm competing with anyone, it's the bree van de kamps of the world with their spotless kitchens, and their perfect kids, who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong. i try so hard to keep up, but i can't."
11046,Lynette,"hey, hey, not now, parker."
11047,Lynette,i thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
13095,Lynette,"wait. there wouldn't happen to be actual gardeners in this club, would they?"
9001,Lynette,woo. that stuff is strong!
9003,Lynette,this is awful. carlos must be just devastated.
11051,Lynette,watch her. i'll be back. i'll be right back.
11053,Lynette,i want my son.
13099,Lynette,"don't make plans on tuesday. we're having dinner at the solis' and--what's that look on your face? you didn't eat dairy again, did you?"
13100,Lynette,oh.
9008,Lynette,"you know, you're right."
9009,Lynette,"boys, i can hear you out there. now be quiet. just sit there and color."
13106,Lynette,come on!
13109,Lynette,"no, i went into carlos' bathroom, closed the door, then stripped naked and took a shower."
11063,Lynette,please don't bring up the supermarket again.
13111,Lynette,hours? it was two minutes. it's not like i'm lighting candles and putting on barry white.
11065,Lynette,"he'd gotten rid of everything--the toys, the pictures, everything was gone."
11067,Lynette,he's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister.
9026,Lynette,turn that damn thing off.
11078,Lynette,hey! how you doing?
13126,Lynette,you told her? i asked you not to.
11085,Lynette,a protest?
13134,Lynette,yes. and we shall never speak of this again. i am embarrassed enough.
9039,Lynette,then what?
9040,Lynette,"tom, our last version of normal had me popping pills. normal is a bad, bad plan."
11088,Lynette,"but, see, the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping, and the only reason they're gossiping is because of what i told mrs. mccluskey."
11089,Lynette,so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant.
9044,Lynette,"yeah, that's why i was hoping to take advantage of your expertise."
11094,Lynette,stop it! stop it! you can't do this to people! have you lost your minds?!
9048,Lynette,"i'm not twisting anyone's arm. if i make a better offer, why shouldn't a qualified person reap the benefits? so come on--where can i score some high grade nanny?"
11097,Lynette,"i heard about rebecca on the news. if there's anything i can do to help, i--with the funeral arrangements, or, uh--help you call relatives--"
11098,Lynette,"oh! of course! i feel just terrible. i mean, if you knew, if you could just know how sorry i am."
9053,Lynette,so your boss made you return her underwear?
9054,Lynette,couldn't you have just said no?
9055,Lynette,she sounds awful.
11103,Lynette,"well, the police did arrest mike. i mean, i know you think he's innocent, but surely you can understand why bree's feelings have changed."
11107,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey!"
11109,Lynette,"good.yeah, okay.so give her some room.hey,wow,look,are those presents for kayla?yes,they are."
11110,Lynette,"hey,look at that. preston gave you a harmonica. isn't that cool? oh ""harriet the spy."" sounds mysterious."
9063,Lynette,i guess he does have a sort of dorky charm.
11112,Lynette,"porter! i--you know what? i got you something, too."
13158,Lynette,"oh, they're all starting to blur. look, i worked till 3:00 a.m. last night. i'm exhausted. how about we take a rain check?"
9066,Lynette,hey.
9067,Lynette,--i took--
11114,Lynette,she didn't seem that knocked out by it.
9069,Lynette,just give me a second.
11116,Lynette,"dinner's ready. kayla, i made your favorite--tacos. here you go."
13167,Lynette,i'm sorry. i was exhausted.
9074,Lynette,how fast can you pack?
13173,Lynette,then what's wrong?
13174,Lynette,tell me.
13179,Lynette,what are you doing?
9084,Lynette,okay. you boys. come here and give mamma a three-bear hug.
9087,Lynette,"i wonder what's going on over there. i mean, claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck. do you think i should call? i should call!"
11137,Lynette,"kayla, i'm not fooling around. we--we're going."
13188,Lynette,sorry. i got nothing else. come inside and eat your pork.
11141,Lynette,"guys, how would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week?"
9095,Lynette,i gave her the afternoon off. who wants to turn pages?
9096,Lynette,"no. she's fine. i just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know, like we used to. here we go. once upon a time there was a young turtle named harvey. every day harvey would all tell the other turtles, ""one day i'm going to fly off this island and go see the world."" the other turtles laughed and said ""turtles can't fly."" oh, it's getting good now, huh?"
11143,Lynette,so you have been in canada this entire time?
9098,Lynette,"does she, now? okay. harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, so he told them,"" "" i'll show you. one day i will fly higher than the birds!"
9099,Lynette,"yeah, well, i'm just warming up. then bruno, the big bad turtle took harvey up on a cliff and threw him over, and he proclaimed,"" ""we'll see if you can fly, fly or die, fly or die!"
13193,Lynette,"okay, i went a little overboard. you know me-- two margaritas, and i need a muzzle."
13194,Lynette,"i know, right? he must take care of himself."
13196,Lynette,"uh, we live in a community property state, so half that face is mine."
9103,Lynette,they're with the new nanny.
13199,Lynette,"you don't need a face-lift. what if i went out and got a boob job and came home with big, giant sideshow boobs? how would you like that?"
13201,Lynette,i'm not getting a boob job.
11156,Lynette,so-- any idea when that might be?
13205,Lynette,what's his extension?
11160,Lynette,why not?
11161,Lynette,"ya think? 'cause i just saw a take-out menu with a six-digit phone number, and i kept that to myself."
9116,Lynette,"i don't know how she did it, but edie managed to make this all about her."
13212,Lynette,that's my point. you don't know how these things will turn out.
11166,Lynette,"oh. yeah, that's right."
13214,Lynette,because i don't want to have plastic surgery.
9120,Lynette,"well, i'm just trying to plan my day."
13215,Lynette,"tom, if you're unsatisfied with your looks, someday you're gonna be unsatisfied with mine."
13216,Lynette,"yes. you are going to look at me someday with your brand-new face and say, ""when did she get so old?"" we won't look like we belong together anymore."
9123,Lynette,did you set up the coffee maker?
13217,Lynette,"but i don't see your wrinkles, ttom. i see our whole life together. this--is you worrying about how you're going to provide for us. this is penny falling out of the tree house and breaking her arm. this is my cancer. these are the millions of laughs that got us through all those tough times. it's like a map of our marriage, and i don't want to lose it."
9125,Lynette,tom--come on.
9126,Lynette,thanks.
13226,Lynette,"i know you're discouraged, but-- letting our son make a huge mistake is not gonna help anything."
9131,Lynette,want some coffee?
11179,Lynette,every cent we have is circling the bowl and tom never said a word. why didn't he come to me?
13230,Lynette,"hey, hey, how was the campus tour?"
9135,Lynette,"it's a search and rescue, not recovery. we don't know if she's dead."
9136,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
11185,Lynette,oh!
13232,Lynette,oh.
13238,Lynette,25 years after the first time.
11192,Lynette,"harry,my husband quit his job to start this restaurant,and if we can't sell liquor,we can't make a profit."
11193,Lynette,"and whoa, whoa, whoa, harry. eyes up here."
9146,Lynette,"oh, so you are attracted to her."
13248,Lynette,"i wanna be supportive. let's go for a nice dinner, get a bottle of wine--maybe two, since we don't have to wake up early tomorrow."
9156,Lynette,"uh, lauren? i'm a mother of four. today i had to get up at five, make lunches, make breakfast, drop the twins off at school, and get across town lugging a baby and a sick child. telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings. and it's things like being told to plan ahead that make me so crazy, that yoga is the only thing that relaxes me, except i show up here, and i can't get in, and you tell me to plan ahead. it's a vicious cycle. see how that works?"
13252,Lynette,"who cares what time it is? we were celebrating a big change in your dad's life. hey, someone called."
11208,Lynette,"so tomorrow, first thing, we'll fix the plumbing, we'll call an exterminator, we'll rent some chairs and we will open on time, and it'll be a glorious success that you will have achieved with my help, okay?"
11212,Lynette,wow. your father has taught you well.
9166,Lynette,yeah. tuesday's poker day.
11216,Lynette,"oh,honey--jeez.do you really mean that,or are you manipulating mommy into feeling incredibly guilty?"
9169,Lynette,i wish i would have known earlier. i would have arranged a sitter.
11217,Lynette,yep. your father's taught you well.
11218,Lynette,your new manager? no.
13265,Lynette,come on. i know you know. it's cancer again. am i right?
13266,Lynette,"if it's cancer, and i find out you knew, i won't be dying alone."
9174,Lynette,"- sorry, we end saying and doing things which we don't normally do."
9175,Lynette,"and it's frustrating for me too, 'cause i do want to be the best mommy i can be."
13269,Lynette,are you sure it's not cancer?
9177,Lynette,we're here! woo! ten minutes early! sign me up?
11226,Lynette,my boss is waiting for me outside in his car. what am i supposed to do?
9179,Lynette,"we're, we're ten minutes early."
13280,Lynette,all right. off you go. thanks.
9185,Lynette,"hi, sorry."
13285,Lynette,i'm not the one who forgot my mitt.
9190,Lynette,"oh, really? why?"
11238,Lynette,see ya next week! thanks for understanding!
9195,Lynette,"porter, don't you dare look at me like that. i will wipe that smirk right off your face. and don't think that i won't--"
11247,Lynette,"load me up again, would ya?"
13297,Lynette,"uh-huh. is that why you didn't open the door? because of your hands? mrs mcclusky, do you have anyone who could help you out? a relative? a friend?"
9204,Lynette,"uh, yeah, sure, knock yourself out! be careful."
11253,Lynette,"like i said, really, really wrong, but if you take me back, i swear i will give you one hundred percent."
13301,Lynette,huh?what's going on?
11255,Lynette,"um, word on the street is you're looking for a manager."
11256,Lynette,here's my application.
9209,Lynette,"oh, parker, um, forgot his catcher's mitt."
11257,Lynette,he did. i told him i wasn't interested.
13304,Lynette,"oh, yeah!"
11260,Lynette,i can do that.
11261,Lynette,dinner is in an hour. you know the rules. and so do you.
11270,Lynette,austin?
9226,Lynette,"i just, i expected a bigger reaction. i've been sitting here with knots in my stomach."
9230,Lynette,i seriously doubt that.
11278,Lynette,"yeah. i just wish you'd told me before you rehired him. i mean, i am the manager."
11279,Lynette,"well, kinda."
9233,Lynette,"so here's the thing, i feel really awful about how i acted before."
11282,Lynette,okay.
9236,Lynette,"well, you knew your father was having an affair, and it didn't seem to bother you that much. and that worries me, because if you can find it in you to condone something like that, then what's gonna happen when you've been on the road for forty years?"
9237,Lynette,"i know, of course. you're not your father."
11284,Lynette,whatever you say--boss.
11287,Lynette,"hey, what are you doing?"
11289,Lynette,it's good.
9245,Lynette,so this is it! this is the secret that mary alice was trying to protect
9246,Lynette,that's a good point.
11294,Lynette,come on. we need you at your best tonight.
11298,Lynette,did you finish folding the takeout menus?
9270,Lynette,"but why do i have to apologize? why don't we just go: ""oh, now we're even"" and we'll start from scratch."
11318,Lynette,"more, but i'm tougher, and i complain less."
11319,Lynette,yeah?
11322,Lynette,"honestly, i just don't feel up to going out this year."
11328,Lynette,"okay. okay. okay. if we're doing this, i need to buy you something. what do you want?"
11331,Lynette,"i told you what i want. hot bath, bed early, but you chose not to listen."
11332,Lynette,thank you.
11335,Lynette,who could that be? here.
9288,Lynette,how was your day?
9289,Lynette,"oh, tom, i'm so sorry."
11336,Lynette,please stop apologizing.
9294,Lynette,hey! don't look so glum. you're gonna get a hit.
9295,Lynette,i forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter.
11344,Lynette,"jeez,are you crying?"
11346,Lynette,thanks. are you sure it's the right--
11348,Lynette,"oh, good point. okay, here's another good point: i hate orange."
11350,Lynette,"orange says, ""beware. something bad's gonna happen."" that's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts. also, it washes me out completely."
9303,Lynette,you called your boss a fool?
11351,Lynette,are you speaking as my husband or as my boss?
9305,Lynette,"no. no, you didn't."
11352,Lynette,as well he should be.
9310,Lynette,"so was mine, but i'm here, aren't i?"
11358,Lynette,"okay, okay. break's over, people. i'm gonna go find tom and talk. oh! good."
9312,Lynette,"yep, it's all about the window."
9314,Lynette,sure.
9316,Lynette,"yeah, he certainly did."
11365,Lynette,i'm going home.
9320,Lynette,long.
9322,Lynette,oh.
9323,Lynette,"yeah, of course."
11371,Lynette,"well, once he decides to stop hiding, i can ask him. you know what? i'm tired of waiting. i'm gonna go down there and i'm gonna talk to him. see you guys later."
11373,Lynette,tom! come on! i know you're still here. you realize what time it is? i know! you're mad. but you just--you can't avoid me all night.
11379,Lynette,three months?
9332,Lynette,hey. see you later.
9334,Lynette,"yeah, here. see? it's this little white thing. look. it looks like a --"
11383,Lynette,how much of a while?
11384,Lynette,"i have to get to the restaurant early. is there any you could come over and get the kids off to school? yeah, they are ready to go. so what do you say? oh, great! thanks. i owe you big-time. okay, bye."
9337,Lynette,what'd tammy want?
11385,Lynette,"all right, i am heading out of here. wish me luck."
9342,Lynette,#name?
11397,Lynette,"arnie, thanks for coming in. we will definitely keep you in mind."
11398,Lynette,he kept asking what we do with the food people don't eat.
9351,Lynette,"really? wow, you're good."
9352,Lynette,he played poker?
9353,Lynette,thank you.
11399,Lynette,"well, that's what we pay you, and you seem happy enough."
11402,Lynette,"great. come on over. your application"""
11406,Lynette,"well, i should probably take a look at your application first. okay, don't be afraid if you don't have a ton of experience. i realize for what we're paying, we're not exactly gonna get a--you were a sous-chef at cucina? that's a five-star restaurant."
9363,Lynette,i just wanted to tell you that the boys are now lice-free.
11411,Lynette,"yeah, i had that exact same thought. and to be honest, he has a history."
11416,Lynette,i'm sorry.
11418,Lynette,what? what? why? why? what happened?
11419,Lynette,"okay, i know that, uh, tom has been a little cranky lately."
11420,Lynette,"look, i'll talk to tom--"
11422,Lynette,"okay, everybody, go on up to bed. parker, you got the baby. yeah, that's exactly right. you know what to do."
9375,Lynette,"for god's sakes, there's gonna be a magician. tammy brennan went all out."
11426,Lynette,what?
9379,Lynette,"yeah, sure, boys. have fun."
9380,Lynette,"just so you know, i got topher a set of bongo drums. i know you'll love them as much as he will."
11432,Lynette,i will be right there!
11439,Lynette,oh? what's wrong with it?
11445,Lynette,i'm gonna be right there. here you go.
9398,Lynette,why?
9399,Lynette,didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?
11448,Lynette,"oh, this is awful. on a good night, we barely break even. tonight is gonna kill the whole week."
11449,Lynette,"oh, my god! you are a lifesaver!"
9408,Lynette,"yeah, that's great. what am i gonna do?"
11456,Lynette,two. twenty-two. two.
9413,Lynette,are you saying i'm not tactful?
11461,Lynette,"um, tom. . ."
11463,Lynette,yeah? rick learned how to make this in italy. go ahead. try it. i wanna see what you think.
9416,Lynette,that's telling him.
11471,Lynette,you seem a little mopey lately. is everything okay?
11472,Lynette,"well, parker really wanted to come visit you. i'm gonna put a little water in these."
11474,Lynette,"oh, sure!"
11479,Lynette,"oh. oh, my god. if we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear four grand."
9433,Lynette,"yes, that's not exactly what i--"
11483,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i gotcha."
11485,Lynette,"oh, well--thanks. this is delicious."
9438,Lynette,"alisa, i am so sorry if i caused a problem. i just wanted to help."
11488,Lynette,did you read our review in the paper?
11490,Lynette,sometimes.
11494,Lynette,"i don't know how she does it. hey, it's getting late. let's break out the champagne."
9449,Lynette,"you just signed 'i told you so', didn't you?"
9450,Lynette,"because i'm having drinks with friends i used to work with and they never call and if i blow them off that's it. i'm dead to them. no, i can't call patty binks, because she steals things. dammit, christy, you're thirteen years old, you've got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you. ok, ok, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i raised my voice, i'm calm. i'm starting to think this is about money so what is it that'll make it worth your while? a hundred? that's extortion, there's no way in hell that i'm gonna. hello, hello?"
11497,Lynette,okay.
9454,Lynette,"oh for god's sake bree, i'm wearing panty-hose."
9459,Lynette,you spanked my son?!
9460,Lynette,"tom and i don't believe in hitting our kids, i thought you knew that."
11509,Lynette,"oh, tom--i'm sorry. i can't come home. we're, um--doing inventory, so--it could be a while."
9462,Lynette,the hell i'm not.
9463,Lynette,she spanked my son. i'm not apologising.
9466,Lynette,"yeah, you're damned right she did. she could've tried something else, like a time out or she could have simply threatened to spank him."
9469,Lynette,-we're screwed.
9470,Lynette,"yeah, yeah, i'm coming. what is it? why aren't you guys brushing your teeth? parker, what happened?"
9471,Lynette,"no, no. i'll fish it out later, alright.? you're off the hook for tonight, but not you two so start brushing. preston did you not hear me? i said start brushing your teeth."
9472,Lynette,what are you doing? don't. you. dare.
11524,Lynette,"i stay late because there's a lot of work to do, and right now i'm the only person who can do it, and now i have to go to the grocery store because i am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm. so why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?"
11525,Lynette,"hey, hey!"
9483,Lynette,run by germans. hmm?
9484,Lynette,and you know-mrs mcclusky?
11533,Lynette,"no, i love it. it's--it's just that's a little late for me, and--"
9486,Lynette,i'll get the door.
11535,Lynette,"you know, maybe i should go. um-- it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?"
11540,Lynette,there you go.
9496,Lynette,"okay, i love you too. bye bye."
11544,Lynette,down! down! down! aah!
11547,Lynette,no! go ride the python! come on.
11556,Lynette,what?
9514,Lynette,yeah.
9519,Lynette,and you know what. i am going to take this.
9528,Lynette,were you ever going to tell me?
9534,Lynette,"talk to peterson, maybe he can get her transferred. weren't you guys talking about setting something up in belize?"
9535,Lynette,"no. i'm serious. if she stays, i will haunt your office. i will bring you lunch everyday. i will bring the kids to visit. i will change diapers on your desk. every birthday cake in the break room, every retirement party, i will be there. watching her."
11584,Lynette,"well, don't think so much. just rest and get better. that's what you need to do."
9542,Lynette,it'll be worth it. you're doing an amazing job.
11591,Lynette,thank you. this is nice.
9549,Lynette,"excuse me. i need to get in here,so i can clear the plates."
11597,Lynette,yeah.
11599,Lynette,no. that's just me. tom's always kicking the covers off the bed. he calls me his little blonde furnace.
9552,Lynette,"she is an old, old friend of your daddy's."
9556,Lynette,show?
11606,Lynette,"and he makes them with pancetta and garlic and olive oil. it's really, really good. it's gonna be our special tonight."
11607,Lynette,"yeah, i guess we were."
11608,Lynette,good night. come again.
9564,Lynette,i trust you.
9565,Lynette,"well, that's just something that wives say to their husbands."
11615,Lynette,stop! don't say it! you cannot say these things.
9568,Lynette,you hired your old girlfriend and you didn't tell me for three months?
9570,Lynette,"that's your car pool. you've got to go, never mind."
11619,Lynette,"oh, jeez. what choice do i have?"
9572,Lynette,it's just-
11622,Lynette,it was kind of dead tonight. hi.
9576,Lynette,"yeah, he's just getting his briefcase."
9581,Lynette,hi.
11629,Lynette,no. why would you think that?
9584,Lynette,"there, now you have easier access."
11634,Lynette,good.
9593,Lynette,i was thinking that our marriage was in trouble and one of us should do something to fix it.
11642,Lynette,i am not answering that. this is not a therapy session.
11645,Lynette,"really? and what do you call this, ambush therapy?"
11648,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
9601,Lynette,tucked in tight.
11650,Lynette,"i think her point--and again, i wish she'd express herself a little more tactfully-- was that marriage is unpredictable. we can't know what it'll be until we're in it."
11651,Lynette,"speaking of carlos, i hear he got evicted."
9606,Lynette,"you know, i kinda like it."
11654,Lynette,and what would that have to do with me?
9614,Lynette,huh. speak of the devil. and i mean that.
9617,Lynette,she said she might be a little late. they already started moving a few of mike's things over to her house.
9618,Lynette,"yeah, it's nice to see susan so happy again."
11665,Lynette,thank you.
11675,Lynette,is one of them cancer?
11676,Lynette,"not yet, sweetheart. you go back to sleep now."
9629,Lynette,"geez, nat, you make me feel like some kind of shark. ah, okay. you know, actually, if that's the kind of exec you're looking for--"
9631,Lynette,hello?
9632,Lynette,so how are you doing?
9633,Lynette,"yeah, and he's so young, he's gonna bounce right back."
11681,Lynette,bree!
11683,Lynette,"hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids? i'm trying to talk to your aunt lucy! thank you!"
11684,Lynette,"anyway, i know i said that we would come and visit you this june, but i'll be a little woozy and--bald from the chemo, so--thanks for understanding. oh, one more thing--our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and i was wondering if maybe you and dave might be able to--oh, really? no, i am not asking mom. she doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay? we'll be fine. i love you. bye."
11687,Lynette,"but, honey--"
9640,Lynette,"well, it's the middle of the day, and shouldn't you be at work?"
9641,Lynette,you did not.
11690,Lynette,mom--
11691,Lynette,"it's been five years, mom. they don't remember you."
9648,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
11701,Lynette,"tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us. she would get drunk and smack us around. she would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids."
9661,Lynette,"aah! no! no! no, nobody touches mommy, okay? i love you, i love your finger painting, but if you touch me with those messy hands, i will cut them off."
11711,Lynette,"well, i don't know how you did it. the kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched."
11714,Lynette,how did you-
11716,Lynette,"nothing happened between me and rick. yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, i controlled myself."
9671,Lynette,"aw, sweetie."
11723,Lynette,mom.
11727,Lynette,"i know it's her wedding night,but do you think we should call gaby?"
9683,Lynette,"don't do this to me. i don't have time to make a phone call, and i promised that woman i would not let the kids interfere with this job."
9684,Lynette,"remember that time when you were away in tucson, and i had a 104 fever, but i still managed to take the kids trick-or-treating?"
11731,Lynette,"hey,i'm coming!hey,don't just lie there like a lump!come on! help me look!"
11732,Lynette,i found it.
9701,Lynette,not until i change her diaper. could you just give me two minutes?
9703,Lynette,"here's how i see it. you guys run a really good shop, but if you want your agency to go to the next level, you have to focus on two things. first, you've gotta win some awards. do some p.s.a.s, pro bono stuff, whatever it takes, because whether they admit it or not, clients care about what's in your trophy case. two, your web site. it's the first thing a client's gonna look at, and it's hard to navigate. there's no site map. it just wasn't built for people who grew up without computers. there. and third, i don't have a third. yeah, so that's it."
9705,Lynette,"well, all right!"
9708,Lynette,"oh, my god. i mean, i knew mary alice had killed herself over something big, but wow. can you imagine living with that guilt?"
9714,Lynette,and why have i never seen the sparkling part?
9715,Lynette,"see, that's what i would call a flaw in the system."
9718,Lynette,"please, don't take this the wrong way. i think you are doing a terrific job, but let's be clear. when you came home, it was to clutter. i mean, come on, this is more than that."
11767,Lynette,you're doing it again.
11768,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens."
9722,Lynette,what in the world?
9725,Lynette,"no, i can't respect that, and do you know why? it's stupid. i'm gonna get new sheets."
9728,Lynette,why are you fighting so hard to sleep on baby vomit?
11776,Lynette,please let me help. i feel so guilty just sitting here.
11778,Lynette,i don't mind.
9731,Lynette,"no, you come on! just get up! get up!"
11781,Lynette,"oh! my god, you guys. i'm so touched you're all willing to do this."
9734,Lynette,okay. welcome to the promised land. go on! there! good job!
9735,Lynette,hi. hi.
9736,Lynette,i'm sorry. am i interrupting?
9737,Lynette,"i saw you walk in, and i've been meaning to call since the service, but work's been so crazy so--how are you doing?"
9746,Lynette,honey?
11795,Lynette,"yeah, you told me, but, jeez, gaby,don't you care enough to make an effort?"
9749,Lynette,"it was good, but, more importantly, how was yours?"
9750,Lynette,yep.
11799,Lynette,you're not gonna lose me.
9755,Lynette,"hey, guys!"
11807,Lynette,i don't know. you came out with some interesting things before you swore off the sauce.
11819,Lynette,12. and that's my point. i'm undefeated. why spoil my winning streak by playing when i'm not up to it?
9773,Lynette,"parker, honey, can you hear me? tom, why isn't he talking?"
9776,Lynette,"honey, i'm gonna be right back."
9777,Lynette,right back.
11827,Lynette,who do you think you're talking to?
11829,Lynette,"i know. just, this is a really hard one."
9787,Lynette,"and that's why we packed you extra cookies so you could share with all your new friends, remember?"
9793,Lynette,is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?
11842,Lynette,i get it. but if you ever pull something like this again--
9795,Lynette,and you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny made her appearance right at the time i went back to work?
11849,Lynette,"okay, so here are your options. ""a,"" we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or ""b,"" go straight to the--"
9802,Lynette,okay.
9805,Lynette,"well, parker, we don't have time."
11855,Lynette,it's 9:30.
9811,Lynette,"no! i'm not going to get the damn umbrella! i'm so sorry, sweetie. i am not mad at you."
9814,Lynette,"so, what did parker do?"
9815,Lynette,yes. we've met.
11865,Lynette,tom? the kids are asleep. are you coming to bed anytime soon?
9818,Lynette,no. no. why?
11868,Lynette,"you said ""no shower. but look around--men. so technically, it's a party, not a shower."
9822,Lynette,"tom, he attacked a teacher with an umbrella."
9823,Lynette,i don't know. maybe i shouldn't be working.
11871,Lynette,"i do, and i'm up for that."
11880,Lynette,"yeah, because i'm bald. and i know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, i can't help it."
11881,Lynette,"escape from me, you mean?"
9834,Lynette,parker.
9840,Lynette,"until there's a body, there's no evidence of a crime."
9842,Lynette,oh.
11896,Lynette,me? why would she do that?
9851,Lynette,"so, go over there."
11901,Lynette,uh-huh. and what if they don't?
9855,Lynette,wow.
11904,Lynette,"no, actually, i'm nominating myself. i am now running for president--against you."
9857,Lynette,are those the same clothes you were wearing last night in the bar?
11905,Lynette,"tom, i don't want your opinion, just your vote."
11907,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't catch that.
11908,Lynette,"look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain. this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in. do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?"
9869,Lynette,"oh, fun, but i can't go tonight because i promised the twins that i would help them finish their science project."
11919,Lynette,"katherine, what are you up to?"
9872,Lynette,nina.
9875,Lynette,yeah.
9877,Lynette,"well, you guys have fun. this is the fifth night in a row i haven't been home to tuck in my kids, so i'm gonna go."
9882,Lynette,it's crazy here tonight. don't you want to dance?
11932,Lynette,"oh, jeez. get over here."
9885,Lynette,"great, great, no problem."
11936,Lynette,it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
9890,Lynette,what's wrong with the blue suit?
9894,Lynette,"you see? you see how it, how it moves with me? that's where the magic is."
9898,Lynette,"whoa, hold on a sec."
9904,Lynette,oh. thanks.
11954,Lynette,perfect. where can i get one?
11959,Lynette,"no way. he's here, tom. i can tell."
9913,Lynette,"see? that's where i think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake."
9915,Lynette,carbon--fiber--shafts.
11969,Lynette,hey.
11970,Lynette,"we need to talk about this stan thing. oh, is that his name? stan?"
11972,Lynette,"no, it was a big deal. you have taken amazing care of me. but i know you have so many things you wanna get back to."
9925,Lynette,don't worry.
11974,Lynette,it's not just that. it's the smoking and the swearing and the teaching the kids how to make a whiskey sour.
9927,Lynette,"hey, guys. we got snacks!"
11976,Lynette,"you have money, right? i mean, you loaned us that $10,000."
9934,Lynette,"yeah, okay, enough of that."
11982,Lynette,what? what? we're having lunch.
9936,Lynette,"oh, norma. norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened."
11984,Lynette,what have you got there? are you reading from something?
9941,Lynette,norma--
11990,Lynette,"hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
9944,Lynette,"hi. sorry for just showing up unannounced, but, um, could we talk to you for a minute?"
11994,Lynette,"i also had cancer for four months, and if i could've asked one of them to leave, i'm not sure which i would've picked."
9948,Lynette,"oh, no!"
9952,Lynette,not a one.
9955,Lynette,"look, mcclusky, i am as worried as everybody else in this neighborhood, but i just don't think that we-"
12005,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest of my life. you drove him away."
12007,Lynette,she's broke and old and rude. that is not a winning combination on the street.
12008,Lynette,"lucy, lydia and i fought over who had to take her. she was right outside. god only knows what she heard us say."
12009,Lynette,"it is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there, maybe lying facedown in an alley--"
9963,Lynette,i'm home. could you come here a sec?
12015,Lynette,"oh, god. only three decades give or take a year, but who cares? oh, gosh. you look great."
12018,Lynette,i didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
9973,Lynette,oh.
9974,Lynette,can i ask a question?
12021,Lynette,"oh, well, good. at least she's not living like a hobo. oh, my god. i'm so glad to see you again."
12022,Lynette,"once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money. then ask her to walk you back to the car. i'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk--"
12026,Lynette,"hey, i'm not complaining."
9980,Lynette,"hey, stu. you busy?"
12029,Lynette,"okay, enough with the drama. i want you to come home with me."
12033,Lynette,oh. he seems nice.
12037,Lynette,i don't think that's how it works.
12038,Lynette,are you kidding? it would've changed everything.
12042,Lynette,but where will you live?
12044,Lynette,it does. it really does.
9998,Lynette,"all right. this is my last hand, then i gotta go."
12048,Lynette,"hi. did you hear they declared a tornado watch? scary, huh?"
10007,Lynette,"tsk, tsk, tsk. having sex with the support staff. that's a big no-no. ed's been known to fire people for that sort of thing."
10008,Lynette,my demands are simple. i want you to be nicer.
12056,Lynette,i am asking you as a friend. please?
10011,Lynette,great!
10015,Lynette,"oh. well, welcome. what happened to stu?"
10019,Lynette,you threatening me?
10021,Lynette,great.
10022,Lynette,oh course i noticed! you are one of my favorites and i thought it was really unfair how it all went down.
12071,Lynette,"karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?"
10024,Lynette,word got out that you and nina were-
12072,Lynette,of course.
12075,Lynette,"hey, hold it! hold it! you can't go out there!"
12076,Lynette,karen!
10035,Lynette,"okay. i get nina, but why are you firing everybody else?"
12083,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
12084,Lynette,why is it taking so long? they should be going faster.
10044,Lynette,"we have day care, ed, day care. do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and i have barely left the building? my kids are forgetting who i am."
12093,Lynette,what's all this baseball stuff? there's a mitt and a jersey. was this her husband's?
12095,Lynette,no.
10049,Lynette,"oh, well, come on in my office."
12098,Lynette,"you realize we're cleaning, right? we're not eating candy."
12099,Lynette,what do you mean?
10056,Lynette,yeah.
10059,Lynette,"i bet. make no mistake, i'm a good mother."
12111,Lynette,here you go.
12117,Lynette,"oh, my goodness."
12119,Lynette,"damn it, karen. i'm running out of ida."
10072,Lynette,"pat, can you see here i'm holding a baby hostage? i will call back!"
12123,Lynette,then why don't i feel better?
12128,Lynette,"katherine, we didn't come here to upset you."
12134,Lynette,"so i'm clear, you can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul because the pistons have no defense?"
10087,Lynette,that's all i'm saying.
12135,Lynette,"well, i haven't. i have some questions i would like answered. and i don't know anything about god or jesus, and our kids don't either."
12138,Lynette,"okay. well, i'll be right back. oh, this is so exciting. i'm going to church. by the way, what am i now?"
10095,Lynette,i am stunned.who was it with?
12144,Lynette,"the reason i ask is, there are wars all over the world, and it seems like every month, some dumb-ass walks into a school and starts shooting children. so i'm thinking, god's love? not so sure."
12148,Lynette,"yeah, and i'm breaking her in tonight. nothing like that new bible smell."
10102,Lynette,not at all.
10103,Lynette,"yeah, they were out."
12152,Lynette,i'm sorry. did i embarrass you on sunday?
12153,Lynette,"well, what if i need to? what if that's the kind of church i'm looking for?"
12156,Lynette,weren't you the one who said i should explore other churches?
10112,Lynette,you're an attractive man.there is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.my initial impulse was justified.
10113,Lynette,i don't know.
12161,Lynette,"oh, then you won't get what you want?"
12165,Lynette,really? okay. how?
10118,Lynette,"oh, yeah."
10120,Lynette,shut up and go to sleep.
10125,Lynette,"anyway, tom's probably got dinner ready by now.so i should get goin'."
10126,Lynette,bye!mwah!
10127,Lynette,"you know what the 1% is, right?"
12181,Lynette,that's you?
10135,Lynette,"oh, well,i'm not surprised,and i really, really hope you can work it out."
10137,Lynette,oh?
10139,Lynette,i-- don't.i really don't.
10140,Lynette,mm-hmm?
10147,Lynette,what's wrong? pat said you told her it was an emergency!
12195,Lynette,what?
10150,Lynette,not to us.
10151,Lynette,"well,you never told me that."
10152,Lynette,"well,tom,somebody's gotta take care of our kids."
10154,Lynette,"oh,you've gotta be kidding!i have to get back to work!"
10156,Lynette,okay.
12207,Lynette,"hi, andrew. guess what? your mom just won the founder's award."
12210,Lynette,"okay, i-i'm gonna--i'll call you back in about five. bye."
12212,Lynette,need a little caffeine fix?
10169,Lynette,"yeah,well,why don't you have your second wife make you lunch,okay? oops!"
10170,Lynette,"i don't want you to have options,tom.if i die,i wanna hear your life would be over.i want you to spend the rest of your life screaming,""it should've been me on that plane!"""
10171,Lynette,i'm assuming there was a crash.it could've been something else.
12217,Lynette,"right, right. it's just--if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy if you could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?"
12218,Lynette,no.
10176,Lynette,"oh,i know! i know!but it is what married people do.they go out of their way to calm each other's irrational fears.oh,come on,tom.i really need you to do this."
10178,Lynette,hey.
10180,Lynette,what happened?
12231,Lynette,"rick, look. you know me. if tom had done something like this, do you really think i would protect him?"
10184,Lynette,are you saying you're unhappy?
10186,Lynette,"well, can't we just--"
12234,Lynette,"well, it wouldn't be the first time. you lied about the brick, and you were pretty smooth, too. hell, i bought it."
12237,Lynette,"okay, you are angry, so i'm gonna let that one pass, and i'm gonna say this for e very last time. nothing happened between me and rick."
12238,Lynette,"hey, you guys know you're not supposed to be out of bed."
12242,Lynette,mm-hmm?
10195,Lynette,"hey,i got great news!we just landed the black's frozen yogurt account!"
12246,Lynette,how are they doing?
10199,Lynette,"uh, well,the pitch was running long,so we cut a few things."
12254,Lynette,"i need to ask you something, and i want you to tell me the truth, okay? did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?"
10207,Lynette,tom? tom what?
12256,Lynette,"no, the twins did, but they say it was your idea."
10216,Lynette,thank you. bye.
10217,Lynette,"well, honestly,i wasn't blown away."
12264,Lynette,"no, you're missing my point."
12271,Lynette,good.
10224,Lynette,tom--
10226,Lynette,"uh, just let your rsum speak for itself?"
10227,Lynette,okay!
12274,Lynette,"actually, i think we're okay. we--resolved our problems just sitting in your waiting room. boy, you're good. 'kay. so we're gonna go."
12279,Lynette,you're burying your head in the sand.
10232,Lynette,oh.
10236,Lynette,"well--um, let me just call in a few references before we make anything official."
4096,Bree,i had nothing to do with that.
4099,Bree,what were you thinking?
4100,Bree,don't be glib. did you hire someone to attack orson?
2054,Bree,"andrew, please, can't we just talk about this? i'm your mother, for god sakes! you're my son."
4103,Bree,"my beef is that from the minute i walked into this office, you have pulled me deeper and deeper into your moral cesspool. that is not why i hired you."
8,Bree,"susan? susan. i was just saying paul wants us to go over on friday. he needs us to go through mary alice's closet, and help pack up her things. he says he can't face doing it by himself."
4105,Bree,"no, i haven't."
10,Bree,"danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree."
11,Bree,"first of all, your father can't eat onions, he's deadly allergic. and i won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion. so. how's the osso bucco?"
4109,Bree,"andrew, this is your mother. i am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you. where are you? are you at a bar? andrew? andrew?"
16,Bree,that certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.
4113,Bree,george!
4114,Bree,"you know what i really truly want? revenge. i mean, if somehow we could level the playing field, then, um, maybe i could find a way to come back."
20,Bree,"i know that you think i'm angry about coming here, but i'm not. i mean, the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun. i get it. probably will want something healthier tomorrow night though, i'm thinking about chicken?"
2069,Bree,drama camp. a very prestigious drama camp.
22,Bree,"okay, well, i got you the honey mustard dressing; the ranch looked just a little bit suspect."
23,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled ""chicks"" and ""dudes "", you're out of your mind."
24,Bree,what do you mean what's in this? it's salad.
2070,Bree,what were you and andrew talking about today at the fair?
2073,Bree,"oh, good. i mean, i'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all."
4121,Bree,no.
4125,Bree,"uh, she needs me to get something for her. i will be right back."
30,Bree,"susan, are you alright? you look awful."
34,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
35,Bree,"well, we could do it gently. we could tell him about it over coffee and pastry."
36,Bree,"well if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste."
2082,Bree,"i'm not telling who it is. i'm just asking the question. if you know a husband has been unfaithful, do you tell the wife?"
2083,Bree,"okay, that's what i was thinking."
41,Bree,"you're gonna cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're gonna find ourselves a marriage counsellor."
2090,Bree,because i thought you'd want to know.
2092,Bree,"i'm sorry. i just felt that if it were me, i"
47,Bree,"um, doc,um?"
49,Bree,"oh, i.."
2097,Bree,don't you dare leave this house!
51,Bree,"oh. well, i wish he had called me."
2100,Bree,why?
2104,Bree,mr. faladi--
2105,Bree,"good afternoon. i'm, uh, bree hodge, and you are?"
2109,Bree,"oh, gus, i don't plan anything unpleasant. i'm simply going to inform mr. faladi what repercussions he faces if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason."
62,Bree,bye.
64,Bree,"rex, rex! you need to get up!"
65,Bree,"please hurry, if the kids see you sleeping down here, they're gonna start asking questions."
2112,Bree,"well, that hardly bolsters his suitability. danielle, please, eat something."
67,Bree,"oh rex, you look so tired."
2121,Bree,of course. we'll get her all the help she needs.
75,Bree,"well, good, because i have some new flatbread that i've just been dying to show off."
76,Bree,i'll make braised lamb shanks.
2131,Bree,"when i saw you in that tub, it was the worst moment of my life.the thought of losing you is more than i can bear."
84,Bree,"private sessions? i don't understand, why do we need private sessions?"
2132,Bree,powerful?
90,Bree,"oh. well, i'm sorry it's such late notice, but well, we weren't sure whether you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet. but, well, we're, we're sort of throwing it in your mother's honour."
2141,Bree,"mr. faladi, if you want to break my daughter's heart, i can't stop you, but i will not be an accomplice. you'll tell her yourself."
2143,Bree,"oh, and one more thing--"
96,Bree,if everybody would please take your seats. dinner is served.
2145,Bree,"oh, danielle, i thought you'd be with mr. faladi tonight."
103,Bree,"rex. in college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us. we were the golden couple. everybody knew we were gonna have this wonderful life. why is this happening?"
2152,Bree,"well, i can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you. apology accepted."
2155,Bree,two lemonades for the victors.
109,Bree,"dr. goldfine, please?"
2157,Bree,did you see that? she just deliberately snubbed me.
2162,Bree,"oh, you don't believe any of that nonsense, do you? do you?"
2165,Bree,"oh! do you two know each other? well, that saves me an introduction.uh, tish, you know, i was wondering if you need any help with the christmas gala. last year, i was on the decorating committee--"
2166,Bree,that would be lovely. thanks.
127,Bree,"lynette, you are a great mother. but let's face it, your kids are a challenge."
2175,Bree,"hey, is that the new neighbor?"
2185,Bree,harvey cheated?
140,Bree,"so andrew, shall we?"
2189,Bree,"well, i guess that makes us neighbors."
2190,Bree,it means you should stop worrying about my marriage and start worrying about your own.
144,Bree,that's someone's little girl. and that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.
2192,Bree,"coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den. orson, greta needs a coaster."
151,Bree,"andrew, i know you blame me for what's happening with your father, but it's not entirely my fault and i need you to understand that."
2201,Bree,"i'm sure she'll be back soon. why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?"
2202,Bree,i'm sure she won't mind. come on. let's go. come on.
155,Bree,"but, wait, what about the tape? she did say that her name was angela."
156,Bree,"well, my father was a prosecutor and he always said that the simplest explanation was usually the right one."
2204,Bree,i'm starting my cards early this year. it puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.
159,Bree,yes.
2207,Bree,"oh, by the way, orson, i need your mother's address at the nursing home."
2208,Bree,"oh,don't be silly.i'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.i can certainly send one to your mother."
2210,Bree,"orson, what's the big deal? it's just an address."
163,Bree,"well,i had hoped someday to get my grandchildren into barcliff. but i suppose that doesn't matter to you, does it?"
166,Bree,almost. thanks again for driving them to the bus.
2214,Bree,hi.
168,Bree,"well,that doesn't make it any less frightening. i mean, he could have been a sexual predator."
2216,Bree,"oh, i'm--i'm so sorry. the nurse pointed me over here. i'm looking for gloria hodge."
171,Bree,"rex, the truth is, with the kids gone i'll be all by myself in this house for the first time in seventeen years."
2219,Bree,"well, how does he disappoint you?"
177,Bree,is your father here? we were scheduled to do a patrol today.
2227,Bree,"well, thank you! it did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cook-off."
181,Bree,oh.
184,Bree,i adore the holidays. i never get depressed if there's a beautifully decorated tree to look at.
185,Bree,"oh,zach. you know, my mother died when i was young. she was hit by a car."
2234,Bree,"well, i didn't mean it literally, but okay. we'll, um, we'll sit together. and we'll talk."
189,Bree,"yes,you're probably right."
2238,Bree,how can you be so cold?
2240,Bree,"orson, if there's something i should know."
195,Bree,"zachery, it's alright!"
2244,Bree,"well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet. eight meals this week, eight times i've told you the same thing. so, who would like to say grace?"
197,Bree,"oh, i tried. but he was so nervous he actually started shaking and then he just left."
206,Bree,uh?
2256,Bree,are you insane? she obviously can't be on her own.
2257,Bree,and what if you weren't? what if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours? you are coming home with us.
2258,Bree,and i will not hear another word on the subject.
2261,Bree,"oh, no, i'd rather do it myself. i wanna talk to her."
216,Bree,"zach, why did you do this?"
217,Bree,"zach said mary alice killed herself because of something that he had done, something bad. is there anyone else who'd know what he was talking about?"
2270,Bree,we saw that woman at the morgue--on our wedding night. you pretended not to know her.
2274,Bree,monique polier?
2275,Bree,"mother hodge, i have your breakfast."""
229,Bree,"just one. how much longer is your midlife crisis going to last, because it is really starting to tick me off!"
230,Bree,"so how is it going with mike, susan?"
231,Bree,"oh, i take it you've met maisy gibbons."
2278,Bree,we also have cable.
2279,Bree,decided?
234,Bree,you play poker?
2291,Bree,"orson, it's me again. please call. we need to talk."""
244,Bree,"it's a little chilly out here, do you mind if we discuss this inside?"
2295,Bree,"they found monique's blood on the wrench that mike was trying to dispose of. i mean, that hardly screams innocence."
248,Bree,"oh, rex, oh baby, stop, i just need a minute."
2297,Bree,at his office. and what did you think you'd find there anyway?
250,Bree,"sorry. i just - ah, come on, are you going to make a big deal about this?"
2299,Bree,good. let me know if there are any survivors.
252,Bree,because i think it is better to fix what you already have.
2307,Bree,"well, you could've left her."
260,Bree,"rex, whatever you want, i'll go there with you. i will go there with you, you just have to say it out loud. tell me, what do you want? what do you need?"
261,Bree,why?
2308,Bree,so why couldn't you tell me this?
2316,Bree,so you're alma. where have you been all this time?
270,Bree,"if andrew is angry about you moving out of the house, then perhaps he should shove your head into a locker!"
2320,Bree,so why have you come back?
273,Bree,you went to an attorney?
2321,Bree,"um, actually,we have a guest."
276,Bree,go ahead sweetheart. ask whatever you want.
2324,Bree,thank you for clearing things up.
279,Bree,"rex, what's this about?"
2329,Bree,good. i'll see you at eight o'clock.
292,Bree,"oh, no? that's mr. conlan, the locksmith. he's been very helpful today. of course, i could give you the new keys, which would mean you'd have to adhere to my rules, which would include giving back your father's gifts."
2342,Bree,"oh, well, i'm afraid he's not here, but i will be happy to tell him that you came by."
307,Bree,"i had just been--thinking about the kids. they sure grew up quickly, didn't they?"
2356,Bree,"no! i mean--i mean, no, alma, you can't buy this house."
310,Bree,we could have been better parents.
328,Bree,because i need to know that you're not a monster!
329,Bree,yeah.
2378,Bree,fishy? it couldn't be more obvious. alma killed monique. that's why she disappeared. and i bet she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her dentist husband.
2381,Bree,i don't care!i am not sleeping in a bed that had your dead mistress' teeth in it!let's just take them to the police.
339,Bree,you put a woman into a coma.surely that arouses some kind of emotion.
340,Bree,"so, why isn't mrs. huber here?"
2390,Bree,what the hell is this?!
343,Bree,i think we should make him quit the swim team.
2393,Bree,he's not sleeping. he's out cold.
2395,Bree,baby?!
2408,Bree,"please don't touch me.all this time,you've said you wanted the truth.that's before i knew what it was."
362,Bree,you are strung out!
363,Bree,"excuse me,"
2411,Bree,"and this, after he'd been in a coma because some lunatic ran him over."
366,Bree,"i think andrew has been smoking marijuana, so i want you to take this and get it tested right away."
367,Bree,because i want you to pull him from the swim team and i don't think you'll allow it without proof.
2417,Bree,aah!
372,Bree,the same thing you just did to every memory i have of our marriage.
374,Bree,"oh, susan, you look so gorgeous."" ""doesn't she, edie?"
2426,Bree,"no, no. come in."
2429,Bree,i can't tell you right now. you're just gonna have to trust me. can you do that?
385,Bree,"options! i'm not a mutual fund, rex!"
2435,Bree,alma?
390,Bree,"you know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera."
391,Bree,yeah. people do terrible things when they think no one is watching them.
2441,Bree,yes.
2442,Bree,"oh, darling, i don't deserve you."
2444,Bree,"i have missed you, sweetheart!"
2448,Bree,"well, i am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about common courtesy, and i'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning. well, we should go. i've got to get that bracelet to gaby before the wedding."
2451,Bree,"so we're in zurich, and i was sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row. and i thought to myself, dear god, i hope i have not developed an allergy to chocolate brioche. life just wouldn't be worth living."
2452,Bree,"oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me. this is your day--you and victor--who, by the way, i have not met yet."
410,Bree,"oh, i don't hate you, maisy. i pity you."
2460,Bree,"well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle."
2463,Bree,"oh, don't remind me."
2467,Bree,"well,not if we're careful."
2468,Bree,"look,this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.i mean,first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer,then your sister takes up with her history teacher,and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.we might as well sit on the porch and play banjos."
426,Bree,"oh, i don't need your gratitude. you're only here because your children are master extortionists."
2475,Bree,excuse me?
428,Bree,"yes, it is. the doctor said you could be here for weeks."
429,Bree,"yes, it would--if i still felt anything for you. but as it stands, the place you used to occupy in my heart is very much empty now."
2483,Bree,why must old ladies always do that?
437,Bree,george? would you go out to dinner with me?
2485,Bree,that was danielle.now she wants us to send a dvd player for her room.
2486,Bree,"you're missing the point! it's a convent,not the four seasons.you have mustard on your chin."
2487,Bree,"i mean,it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. it's another thing to reward it.there are consequences for her mistakes."
441,Bree,can we talk about something else - something less depressing?
2492,Bree,ohh.
445,Bree,"oh, right on time!"
2494,Bree,he's such a scamp.
2495,Bree,we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
448,Bree,"oh! come on in. george, you remember rex?"
463,Bree,the only reason he is still in the house is because you insisted i care for him.
2511,Bree,"do not move. we want to pamper you, so please let us."
465,Bree,"because i don't commit adultery like your father."" ""that's right. your father had an affair. i found out about it, and i'm just trying to move on with my life."
473,Bree,"george, hi, it's me, bree. i was wondering, are you free next saturday?"
476,Bree,thank you. i did too.
478,Bree,"yeah, and i would rather cut off my hand than hurt his feelings."
487,Bree,"i was so afraid when i suggested a picnic, that you'd make fun of me, but i just think it's such a lovely, old-fashioned way to spend an afternoon."
489,Bree,"you know, your lunch hour is almost up. we should probably be getting you back to the pharmacy."
2537,Bree,"i was doing a little baking, and i was wondering if i could borrow something."
492,Bree,this is a 9-mm luger po8!
2541,Bree,"well, i stopped by katherine's last night just to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what i overheard."
2547,Bree,of course! i love your charades parties. and i hope you're inviting that delightful katherine mayfair.
501,Bree,"two, high hand grasp. three, hard grip. four, front sight. five, release the safety, and then squeeze the trigger slowly."
2550,Bree,"hey, susan! what's up?"
2551,Bree,i thought you were using dr. mayfair.
507,Bree," okay, now all you have to do is take a deep breath--"
2559,Bree,"oh! sorry, probably just allergies, but, you know, you don't want to take any chances."
2561,Bree,you're 8 1/2 months pregnant! what in heaven's name were you doing roller-blading?
523,Bree,were you with a woman?
525,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
527,Bree,i'm not speaking to you.
2576,Bree,i can't tell you.
2579,Bree,two mules for sister sara!
534,Bree,would that hurt you rex? if i slept with another man?
535,Bree,here you go.
536,Bree,rex. time to take your medicine.
543,Bree,"oh, i should not have done that. i am--"
547,Bree,"aside from the adultery, yes."
2595,Bree,"yeah, everything's fine, but, uh, there was just a time where i thought i might lose it."
2596,Bree,"no, you're pregnant, too. i'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you."
2600,Bree,mm.
553,Bree,"well, it must've been some sort of accident. i mean little boys don't just kill their baby sisters."
556,Bree,yeah.
2609,Bree,reverend sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
2610,Bree,"well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it."
2615,Bree,i really don't want a shower.
568,Bree,valentine's day is tomorrow.
2618,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i've got them, mr. knievel."
578,Bree,"rex, please, i want to understand."
2627,Bree,"she's, uh, at boarding school--in switzerland."
580,Bree,"well, come on, this just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma."
2631,Bree,you hated your mother.
2634,Bree,and--and you told her?!
590,Bree,"um, how about boise?"
2641,Bree,parenting tips from you? that's rich.
2648,Bree,why would you say that?
2649,Bree,"hi. uh, we were just talking about your sculpture."
2653,Bree,"those stupid nuns at the convent let danielle's grandmother kidnap her. she claimed i'd given her permission for a weekend visit. phyllis! it's me. you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble. i know where you live, and i am coming for you."
606,Bree,"well, you know what? if he is innocent, this should be a simple matter to clear up."
608,Bree,"well, not recently, and i'd prefer not to tie up the line."
609,Bree,what is wrong with nice invitations?
2659,Bree,buy a dictionary.
622,Bree,"oh, sweetheart, just because you give a boy sex doesn't mean you'll get love in return."
2677,Bree,"i know you're lonely, phyllis, but i can't give up this child just to make you feel better."
2678,Bree,"orson and i go to our club almost every saturday night, if you're-- interested in babysitting."
2681,Bree,hello.
635,Bree,"i know my daughter. she's very determined, and unless you're really firm with her, she's going to continue to think that there's hope."
2690,Bree,"well, you certainly don't seem happy here, and i thought maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls."
2692,Bree,"well, you say that now, but once you've held your child and felt that rush of love, well--it can change you."
653,Bree,continue to be discreet.
2701,Bree,"try, um, gun city on route 6 by the baptist church. tell them i sent ya, and they'll give you a nice discount."
2704,Bree,"oh, it's just a quick visit. she's driving back tomorrow."
670,Bree,"so, what are you having? the veal looks good."
672,Bree,"well, it's just that you've been acting kind of odd lately."
2721,Bree,"uh, yeah, and he promised that no one would ever know what happened here tonight."
675,Bree,"yes, and, and to tell you the truth, i'm a little insulted. i am a good friend. why would you feel like you have to hide that from me?"
685,Bree,they're brochures for youth detention centers.
2733,Bree,circumcision's not mutilation. it's a simple surgery meant to promote lifelong masculine hygiene.
2734,Bree,we know what it is.
2738,Bree,"oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?"
2741,Bree,"susan? hi. it's, uh, bree. i'm glad you're home. uh, listen, i-i thought i might stop by for a little visit."
2743,Bree,what do you mean you can't help me?
2749,Bree,what is wrong with that? i thought we liked conformity.
2751,Bree,let me show you something. you see this breadmaker? this is where i hid a bottle of chardonnay after i told everyone i'd stopped drinking.
705,Bree,"all right, people. we're going to follow the body. this way please."
2754,Bree,what a lovely ceremony. i'm deborah's friend bree. i have what may strike you as a very odd request.
709,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessey. it's designed for teenagers like yourself who have lost their way and--
2760,Bree,"well, he's out of town, and--our benjamin is 8 days old today. and if i don't do this, my grandma--tzeitel--will never forgive me, may she rest in peace."
713,Bree,"stop it. honey, no matter what you say or do, i will always love you."
2761,Bree,i swear to you before god that this child will be as devout a jew as i am.
715,Bree,"you don't know what it means to me, rex. it's been a long time since i felt i had a real partner. and it really helps, especially on a horrible morning like this."
720,Bree,"well, i'm making him this care package. i mean he'll know i'm thinking about him."
2768,Bree,"i know how much you love benjamin. i guess--i guess i just have to remember that it's love that makes us a family and not blood. your son would like you to hold him. by the way, his hebrew name is simcha. i'll explain later."
722,Bree,"fine, i won't send them but i think it's a stupid rule."
2771,Bree,"he's fine, but i've been doing so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better next to their parents. it's called the ""family bed""."
2772,Bree,partly. what's your point?
2774,Bree,"darling, sex is the last thing women want right after they've given birth."
2776,Bree,don't.
731,Bree,you know pictures are prettier if you colour inside the lines.
733,Bree,"porter, what did i tell you?"
2781,Bree,"no, and i wish we had. if we did, he mightn't have turned out so--"
736,Bree,really?!
739,Bree,those cookies were made from scratch. your fate is sealed. come here.
742,Bree,"oh, i had to spank him. alright i will re-raise."
2791,Bree,"again, not to pry, but--"
746,Bree,if you will excuse me.
2796,Bree,"mmm, yes, you do. i'm mrs. zimmerman."
750,Bree,"that is what makes a good mother. someone who knows their child inside and out, so that if they get into trouble they'll know what to do. i don't know him well enough."
752,Bree,"green. i'll go with green, everybody loves green."
754,Bree,no.
2802,Bree,i'm sorry. i don't--i don't understand. why are you doing this?
2804,Bree,just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your stairwell. may i come in?
759,Bree,what?
762,Bree,i would love to.
2814,Bree,okay. now i--i really am gonna cry.
773,Bree,"andrew, you remember reverend sykes, don't you?"
774,Bree,"reverend, why don't you have a seat and i will get some refreshments."
2826,Bree,"hi there. i- i don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?"
779,Bree,so?
780,Bree,how you can sit there and be so casual is beyond me?
781,Bree,"well, at least i'm trying to be proactive."
2830,Bree,"so, um, why on earth would katherine treat you so dreadfully?"
783,Bree,your father is into s&m.
784,Bree,he makes me beat him with a riding crop and i let him. it's no wonder you're perverted. look at who your parents are.
788,Bree,"andrew, please just go and talk to reverend sykes."
2841,Bree,i saw her weeping. i wanted to help.
2842,Bree,i can't help having a sympathetic face.
2853,Bree,i can only imagine. i had to listen to her babble for an hour.
2856,Bree,um-- a snake. what's the difference? he doesn't have one.
813,Bree,"george, as it turns out i won't be able to go with you to the bonsai expo."
2862,Bree,"oh, and, uh, listen. bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
817,Bree,ginger? the stock girl?
818,Bree,why didn't you tell me?
2865,Bree,what?
2871,Bree,"well, then you just have to fix him up with someone, give him back his will to work."
824,Bree,see? you were worried for nothing.
2876,Bree,"oh, thank you so much for letting us take over your dining room."
2879,Bree,"yes, and a nice home-cooked meal. trust me, there are absolutely no tricks up our sleeve."
833,Bree,i don't know. but anything that good has got to be sinful.
2881,Bree,andrew is also an out-and-proud homosexual.
2885,Bree,"yes, but he's also-- he's got a great sense of--okay, do you know how hard it is to get a good contractor?"
2887,Bree,and windows. and i am not pimping you out. i'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.
846,Bree,i beg your pardon?
847,Bree,"okay, this is exactly what i was afraid of. george and i are just friends."
2901,Bree,why? i-i thought you'd want your house back.
854,Bree,what's the matter? you've been mopy all day.
856,Bree,"no, not at all. i think that we should talk about it. in fact i think maybe we don't talk enough."
2906,Bree,susan!
859,Bree,sort of? don't you remember the glorious food and the gorgeous scenery?
860,Bree,it doesn't matter. you decide.
2908,Bree,"i understand, but whatever you do, don't keep your feelings bottled up. you've got to let'em out."
2914,Bree,"oh, lynette. hi. you look pretty. what are you all dressed up for?"
867,Bree,"come on, take your best -"
869,Bree,what on earth?
871,Bree,you have got to get rid of it. there are children present.
2924,Bree,"wow, you bought a bible."
877,Bree,what is that supposed to mean?
2926,Bree,"lynette, i-i realize you don't have much experience with churches, so this really isn't your fault."
880,Bree,"yeah, good point."
2932,Bree,"yes, i'm gonna run some errands, and orson's gonna take benjamin to the park."
887,Bree,i could walk across a street tomorrow and be hit by a car.
2936,Bree,delightful? i thought she annoyed you.
2938,Bree,"thank you, reverend, and i'm--i'm sure the scavos will be here soon."
2940,Bree,psst! not you. lynette.
2941,Bree,i was gonna ask the same of you. why are you in a catholic church?
2942,Bree,"oh, please. mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt doesn't make you catholic. you're presbyterian now. come on. let's go."
897,Bree,"well, thank you for telling me, but i think, um, i've got to go."
2948,Bree,"and i am-- up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary, and reverend sykes was so impressed that i brought a new family into church, so--if you don't come back, then--"
2950,Bree,lynette! you were the one who came to me. you sought me out.
911,Bree,i know. i'm gonna take him to the hospital.
914,Bree,there. now we can go.
2964,Bree,"oh, gaby, i'm so glad you're here. i was just about to tell everyone to keep an eye out for their invitation to the founder's ball."
917,Bree,"we were having a fight when he had the heart attack, and i'm just feeling really guilty, because i should have gotten him here sooner and -"
2968,Bree,"i acknowledge that katherine and i have had our differences, but we have all been through a lot recently."
921,Bree,"oh, i was just, um, thinking that i need to start, uh, spring cleaning."
2970,Bree,"oh, i think i know what's going on. somebody had a naughty dream."
2981,Bree,katherine--
935,Bree,"yes, of course you did. thank you very much for calling."
939,Bree,"oh, i'm just waiting for, uh, rex's mother. she's gonna be here any second."
2987,Bree,"oh, it's dip. the caterer just said that--"
946,Bree,"phyllis, that's an orange tie."
2996,Bree,"""i was honored when you--"" myeah, myeah, myeah, myeah."
953,Bree,bye.
957,Bree,"he's going to do more than mention it. that's the part he'll focus on. in fact, i think three anecdotes from rex's childhood is more than enough."
3005,Bree,who knew you were so insightful?
963,Bree,"reverend, if you don't back me up on this, so help me, i will pull the funeral out of your church."
3018,Bree,i think it's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you.
971,Bree,wait!
3022,Bree,that is a cherished recipe from my grandmother.
980,Bree,that's very sweet of you. thank you.
981,Bree,"well, mr. pashmutti -"
3030,Bree,i think it's admirable that you wanna forgive orson--because i can't.
3032,Bree,"you adored it, as i recall. that's why i'm giving you the choice. and what about that hummel from your aunt? it's ugly as sin, but she insists that it's valuable."
989,Bree,i'm saying that even italians take a break now and again.
991,Bree,"people want to know how i'm doing, but the minute they ask, you, you jump into the spotlight, and they forget all about me. i need consoling, too, phyllis. have you ever thought of that?"
992,Bree,thank you.
3040,Bree,"orson, what are you doing here?"
3045,Bree,"edie, would you do me a favor and take orson back to his apartment? i have to let my sitter go home."
999,Bree,"hi. oh, hi, lynette."
3050,Bree,"oh, i-i-i think you know."
1006,Bree,"so, uh, are we ready to order, or do you need a little more time?"
3054,Bree,"actually, karen, when i'm done here, i could go try to find toby for you."
3056,Bree,"oh, hello, dylan. you look lovely."
1010,Bree,"um, thank you, but i just couldn't."
3064,Bree,so are you thinking of moving onto the lane?
3066,Bree,may i help you?
1019,Bree,"yes, let's."
3067,Bree,it's not really a good time.
3069,Bree,"yes, eventually, with a big, dopey grin on your face."
3070,Bree,"i don't think so. i'd hate for him to be around when you had another attack of delayed morality, either with edie or behind the wheel of your car."
3072,Bree,"strictly speaking, you're not even related to him. i mean, it was fine for you to masquerade as his father when we were together, but now that we're not--"
1026,Bree,"an autopsy? detective, rex died of a heart attack."
1036,Bree,"you want a statement? fine, i'll give you a statement."
3089,Bree,"really? so i just happen to run into you at the dry cleaner, the greengrocer,the post office?"
1046,Bree,i'll waive all that. my only stipulation is that i want my children to be able to see me answer the questions.
3097,Bree,"it's funny how having a man in the house can make you feel safer, no matter how retiring or easily spooked he might be."
1050,Bree,yes.
3099,Bree,so it's been two days now. did you and mike finally land on a name?
3101,Bree,"well, then appeal to his sense of reason, because the name ""maynard"" doesn't go with the name of ""delfino"". one is german and the other is italian, and we all know what happens when those folks get together."
1058,Bree,"well, for starters, you can help me prove to the police that we didn't conspire to kill my husband."
1061,Bree,"sort of. well, i think the police now have a different theory, which is if i wasn't poisoning rex on my own, then maybe you were helping me."
3112,Bree,what does that mean?
1068,Bree,"i think perhaps the machine picked up on something, something that i wasn't aware of."
3117,Bree,oh! aah! oh.
1074,Bree,andrew. what are you doing?
3122,Bree,i have no idea. now if you'll please excuse me.
1078,Bree,"andrew, that wasn't a hint."
3128,Bree,"no, you don't."
1089,Bree,"honey, the feelings that you're having are perfectly normal, but george isn't trying to take your father's place. he's, well, he's just a friend."
3137,Bree,"and dancing, roll out the cake, you leave for your honeymoon, and i will collapse in a tasteful heap."
1091,Bree,i'll be serving dinner tomorrow at seven. please don't be late.
3142,Bree,don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills in my face when you know i'm at a low point. now go! and stop following me.
3148,Bree,"andrew--look, i'm on my way back, but it's imperative that you--andrew?"
3150,Bree,aah! help me! help!
1103,Bree,i'm still recovering from mike is zach's real father.
1105,Bree,"but, zach is mary alice's son. he grew up playing in our yards. if he has any hope of surviving, i have to believe he's better off here than on the street."
3156,Bree,"but that's just it, orson. if i forgive you, then i'm forgiving what you did to mike. i can't do that. and-- and you wouldn't want me to. i mean, be honest with yourself. if i took you back now, i wouldn't be the woman you love."
1110,Bree,"i just think if i spend a lot of time with him, it'll really help."
3158,Bree,well--so here we are.
1112,Bree,"oh george, really?"
3161,Bree,katherine? it's bree. we need to talk now!
1117,Bree,i love it. thank you.
3169,Bree,why am i surprised?
1134,Bree,that's all right. i'll wait.
3188,Bree,never heard anything so absurd.
3190,Bree,we are. that's why your name is on the dedication page.
3192,Bree,"katherine, i'm blushing."
1148,Bree,to rex's grave site.
3196,Bree,the secret to spinning sugar is this special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
3200,Bree,"oh, i'm glad you're enjoying yourself."
3205,Bree,the cooking show agreed to redo my segment. i wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
1158,Bree,my husband died thinking that i murdered him.
1159,Bree,hi. the kids are gone. we have the house all to ourselves tonight.
1160,Bree,"i thought the duck turned out well. although the sauce was a little bit thick, but judging by how many helpings you had, i think i got away with it. what are you thinking about?"
3213,Bree,"see? the ship has already sailed. oh, don't be hurt. it's my professional name. in this house, i will always be mrs. hodge. now-- would it help if mrs. hodge cooked you your favorite pot roast tonight?"
1167,Bree,"no, no, no, it wasn't your kiss. i felt something weird on my neck."
3216,Bree,"well, um, michelle downing asked me to speak to you. i don't know if you heard, but i'm catering her birthday party"
3218,Bree,it's not personal. you know how carlos just started at the club?
1172,Bree,"i'm sorry, george, but you have to go."
3223,Bree,"oh, you know michelle?"
1181,Bree,"well, susan did say that he murdered mrs. huber, so my vote would be yes."
3229,Bree,"katherine, it is not too late to change tonight's menu. if linda flanagan likes my food, she might give me a quote for the book jacket. i have to knock her socks off, and i am not betting the farm on haddock. argue with me all you like. i just bought 40 pounds of pork, so get your tushie over here."
3231,Bree,isn't it amazing?
1184,Bree,"hi, it's bree."
3234,Bree,"orson, i have 6 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people. we're not having this discussion now."
3235,Bree,should i be proud? do you want me to go on the radio and boast that my husband served time for running someone over?
1188,Bree,"george, i can't."
1196,Bree,"you know what, george? we're gonna have a great time, because there's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex."
1198,Bree,"george, you won't believe it. i just stopped itching."
3248,Bree,"yes, and he appears to be checking the guest list."
3251,Bree,"orson, you're still up. oh, i wish you could've been there. linda flanagan loved my food. she said i was ""god's gift to the table"" and that i could quote her on the book jacket. are you all right?"
1205,Bree,"well, you're the pharmacist. if you think it's okay--"
3254,Bree,now?
1208,Bree,did i do anything embarrassing? sometimes i snore.
3259,Bree,"i'm aware of what's at stake, orson."
3262,Bree,"now we have you for the whole weekend, right?"
1221,Bree,"okay, i'm starting to get the feeling that we are not going to a yard sale."
3270,Bree,this isn't about dinner. this is about her nutty liberal politics getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.
3271,Bree,"well, this isn't just about nutrition. do you want him to be teased at school every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?"
1228,Bree,"george, rex hasn't even been dead for two months."
3277,Bree,that's your mom way back when she was your age.
3282,Bree,oh. well--in that case--
1237,Bree,"yes, we saw aida last week and we both cried buckets. it was fun. george loves art, poetry, and music. it would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world like i do. i don't know. that's why i'm here. i don't know what to do, dr. goldfine."
1238,Bree,"no. true love is great, but at this point in my life, i think i'd rather just go to the opera."
3286,Bree,"isn't this nice? for the first time in years, my family is all here under the same roof."
1240,Bree,"uh, no, i, i guess not."
1246,Bree,"george, i'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement."
3297,Bree,"i was on my knees. i was sobbing. she said ""no"" and then ripped him out of my arms. you have no right to say that to me."
1253,Bree,really?
3301,Bree,here's my cookbook.
1255,Bree,"oh, dear. what's wrong?"
3303,Bree,we don't have to read them out loud.
1257,Bree,"horse manure. i have it delivered. susan makes fun of me, but the proof is in the pudding."
3310,Bree,why?
3311,Bree,"oh, right! of course. i would, uh, love to hear your thoughts."
3319,Bree,where are you?
1275,Bree,huh?
1276,Bree,"hi, honey."
3324,Bree,"orson, we're partners. we share everything. any success i have is just as much yours as it is mine."
3329,Bree,you wanna work here?
3330,Bree,"well, that's certainly an intriguing notion. but wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?"
3332,Bree,just give me a sec.
3333,Bree,i don't think we need to do that.
3334,Bree,"oh, well, i think the irises and the lilies could work together."
1287,Bree,the ring?
1288,Bree,it's in my purse.
1289,Bree,but if people see it--
3336,Bree,"orson, you really don't wanna work with me. i mean, you only see me at home. but at work, when the pressure's on, i can be a bit of a handful. katherine's seen how i get."
3340,Bree,"um, i think ""understated"" was what they were going for."
3341,Bree,let mrs. van de kamp turn your oven into a time machine.
3342,Bree,"do you? because i see children crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs."
1295,Bree,yes.
3344,Bree,no.
1298,Bree,i think it's time for you to leave.
3346,Bree,"well, you're--entitled to think so, but i don't."
3354,Bree,"um ,this is"
1308,Bree,"yeah, of course we are."
3358,Bree,"oh, honey. everybody's asking about you. i want you to be here. it's my big day."
1311,Bree,"oh, um, the, the stone is loose. so i'm gonna take it to the jewelers. but don't worry, it's safe."
1312,Bree,"no. no. it's like i told you, the stone could just pop off at any second."
3359,Bree,coupons?
1314,Bree,"well, i'm sorry, but i'm not going to."
1315,Bree,"because i don't feel like it. and this is the last time we're gonna talk about this, okay?"
3363,Bree,i never said that.
1318,Bree,"ty, would you like to dance?"
3366,Bree,i'm not angry with you. i'm just sorry that you felt so--
3370,Bree,thanks.
1324,Bree,"please, you should go."
1325,Bree,dr. goldfine has concerns about us being together and i'm starting to thinking he's right
3372,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
1330,Bree,george! i have guests! what do you think you are doing?
1332,Bree,"i am not kidding. if you do not knock it off, i'm going to call the police!"
3380,Bree,it's-- complicated.
1336,Bree,"i do know that, but i'm just not sure you're a good one, either."
1338,Bree,you know this gainful employment thing is really starting to cut into our social life.
1341,Bree,"dr. goldfine, do you ever really cure people, i mean, even though they're really crazy?"
1342,Bree,"well, when i broke up with george, i saw something in his eyes. it was a kind of malevolence, and it just didn't seem to me to be the sort of thing you could cure."
3390,Bree,"oh, katherine, please."
1344,Bree,did you say a blue bike?
3391,Bree,he's gonna be so ashamed of me.
1348,Bree,"hello, detective barton. this is bree van de kamp. i need to talk to you about george williams."
3400,Bree,"orson, stop throwing jail in my face. you cellmate was a crooked c.p.a., who helped you form a bridge club. it wasn't exactly attica."
3404,Bree,"you know that--brunch we had for you right before you left for prison? i was very tense, and i was very unhappy. so i had--a glass of champagne."
3408,Bree,"orson! you are amazing! one week on the job, and he's already bringing in huge accounts."
3409,Bree,"oh. well, it looks like we're all set until the morning then. hey, why don't you, uh, take the afternoon off?"
3410,Bree,"i don't know--read, relax, give yourself a pedicure."
1363,Bree,''where did you find them?''
3412,Bree,"no, it doesn't. and besides, i gave you the day off. now go home."
3417,Bree,come in.
3420,Bree,have a seat.
3423,Bree,"well, let's talk about food. with a new client, what i usually do is discuss possible menus, and then i have my very best chef prepare a sample dinner."
3426,Bree,he came while orson was out. i let him record a message on my phone.
1379,Bree,justin? is he a friend of yours from school or church? what kind of friend is he?
1380,Bree,"andrew, it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over. you just got home."
1383,Bree,"well, the good news is he's, he's dead."
3435,Bree,"peter's a felon? but he's so refined, so handsome."
1390,Bree,what'd you play?
3439,Bree,that is not funny! i have to go warn katherine.
3440,Bree,"katherine, hi! is everything all right over there?"
3443,Bree,"oh, i just really wish you'd taken things more slowly."
1398,Bree,"this is not a joke,andrew.what if the neighbors had seen you?"
3447,Bree,you will.
1401,Bree,"oh, i just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast."
1402,Bree,"to be honest, i don't think i would've liked it, either."
3449,Bree,you can't just move because of one bad date.
3450,Bree,"and i'm not family? katherine, all my life, i wanted a sister. and now i feel like i finally have one."
1405,Bree,you didn't know?
1406,Bree,"i thought everybody knew.oh, i feel awful.oh, ida greenberg's behind you."
1409,Bree,"no, no, not him.helen rowland's son, john."
3460,Bree,can you believe it? a thief and a pothead!
3461,Bree,"me, too. you go first."
1414,Bree,"i am serious, andrew.you tell him to get out of here this second or i will call the police, and i will have him removed!"
3465,Bree,"i have to admit, i had some reservations about us working together, but this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams."
1423,Bree,"if you wanna lie to the police,go right ahead.but please know that i will sue you."
1424,Bree,"oh, don't worry.i won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18."
3471,Bree,"i don't see why not. i mean, everything's, uh, pretty much done here. you can go now if you like."
3473,Bree,what?
1433,Bree,"oh,it was no trouble at all."
3482,Bree,"orson, don't cramp the boy's style."
1437,Bree,"oh,you mean your having suspected me of murdering my husband?detective,that is all water under the bridge now."
1440,Bree,"yeah,they're secretive and watchful.and there was a dead body found in front of their house."
1441,Bree,"yeah,why?"
3488,Bree,"oh, dear god. i can't look. really, andrew."
3490,Bree,katherine!
3491,Bree,"hello, katherine. um, i thought you might want this videota--from our surveillance camera."
1445,Bree,"all right,we'll split it."
1447,Bree,i had two glasses of wine.
3498,Bree,"because she's your friend, and we're women. we don't do that to each other."
1451,Bree,"oh,you can't be serious."
1454,Bree,i'd rather you didn't.
1456,Bree,i beg your pardon?
3505,Bree,"any minute. oh, my gosh, andrew. don't you look sharp today?"
1458,Bree,"look,i'm--$5,000."
3510,Bree,"and this is my own little kitchen. i'm pretty sure my husband's here somewhere. orson, dear, are you decent?"
3511,Bree,why would i pay someone to do work that gives me such joy? now who wants a little snack?
3512,Bree,you say that like it's a bad thing. i think that decade had a lot to recommend it.
1466,Bree,"well,that's good to hear,because most people on this street couldn't keep a secret if their lives depended on it."
3519,Bree,why?
1472,Bree,"andrew,give me one good reason why shouldn't call the police."
1480,Bree,"oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault.there's no way i could've predicted how betty would react."
1485,Bree,"danielle,i don't feel much like cooking tonight.i'm thinking of ordering a pizza."
1486,Bree,all right.
3534,Bree,"orson, dear, because of the way your nose was broken during the fire, you now snore."
1489,Bree,"well, my fear is that if we keep them apart,they'll try that much harder to be together.i mean, you know how teenagers can be,and, well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks."
3539,Bree,"this is absolutely necessary. i am going through a very stressful time. i have interviews, that cooking demonstration at the mall. if i don't get my rest, it could affect the launch of my book."
1494,Bree,"no, i'm not.and i forbid you to go over there."
1495,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree.uh, listen,call me when you get this message,and please come to poker tonight.i have some big news about the applewhites."
1497,Bree,"uh, now is actually not a good time for me."
3548,Bree,and how exactly are you gonna stop snoring?
3550,Bree,whatever.
3551,Bree,"all right, but i think i'll be too tired to finish it. that pill i took really kicked in fast."
1504,Bree,"well, perhaps i got more excited than i should have,but i recently found out that betty applewhite is quite the poker player,and so, uh, i have invited her to join our weekly game."
1505,Bree,i'll raise you.
1508,Bree,i have the same recipe for english plum pudding.it takes six hours to prepare.how would she have time to make all of this and everything else that we ate today?this is not the pudding of an honest woman.
1512,Bree,excuse me?
3561,Bree,"of course i can. you are such a nervous nellie, rex."
3562,Bree,thank you for having me to your lovely home.
1515,Bree,"when it comes to betty applewhite,i know what i'm doing,and you two are just gonna have to trust me.and if you can't do that,then perhaps i've overestimated the depth of our friendship.now,if you'll excuse me--"
3563,Bree,"yes, my book is about food and families and how food brings families together when they make food. it's mothers teaching daughters how to cook. so i'm gonna cook pancakes with my daughter, only she's not here because she grew up and stole my baby. so--who wants to be my daughter?"
3566,Bree,"well, fridays are when orson plays golf. so friday's perfect. right, orson?"
3570,Bree,"you will. come along, orson."
3571,Bree,my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.
3573,Bree,leaving the man a thank-you card.
3575,Bree,you're living with the man? since when?
3576,Bree,"why the secrecy? did you think i'd disapprove? the man's a doctor, for heaven sakes. you've done better than i did."
3578,Bree,of course i have.
1531,Bree,did your mother make you wear those?
3581,Bree,"yes. if he's a part of your life, i want to get to know him. i think i'll serve fish."
3582,Bree,nice try. tell alex we dress for dinner.
1535,Bree,"come on in, betty.get you a drink?"
1536,Bree,"caleb and i had, uh,a very lovely chat. yes."
3585,Bree,"gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball."
1539,Bree,your crime?
3587,Bree,"well, i just want you to know, if you need to scootch, alex, i am okay with scootching and--the rest of it."
1541,Bree,"well,i didn't wanna come here because i was afraid it would drudge up memories of my husband.you know,this was our place.rex passed away recently.he was,um,murdered by our pharmacist."
1542,Bree,i didn't have to.he committed suicide.
3593,Bree,you are so sweet.
3595,Bree,"oh, my goodness, are you two--"
3596,Bree,i am gonna handle everything for this wedding.
1550,Bree,boys--can you just keep it down just a little bit?because i have a very--special type of grown-up headache.
3598,Bree,"all right, you two, what is going on?"
3600,Bree,"the man is going to marry my son. if there is something about him i should know, i want to hear it now, please."
3601,Bree,"by ""adult,"" you mean complex and sophisticated?"
1557,Bree,"mrs. mccluskey,hi.have you seen the scavo boys?"
1558,Bree,i have something to tell them.
3609,Bree,so--he's the one?
1563,Bree,"well,you know how boys are at the age.they're escape artists."
3611,Bree,yes.
1565,Bree,"you know,i think,um,i must have been cleaning the kitchen,and i-i just didn't hear them because of the noise from the dishwasher."
3614,Bree,"oh, my goodness. are you two--"
1572,Bree,oh. good for you.did lynette mention the little tiff we had?
3620,Bree,"wait, wait, wait. this is not how we decide family get-togethers."
3623,Bree,i am not bidding on time with my son.
1577,Bree,"oh,i wasn't hiding anything.i was simply--enjoying the day.what you want?"
3625,Bree,fine! i call easter.
3627,Bree,"oh, andrew thought it would be nice to have a formal dinner tomorrow night."
1582,Bree,"because,sweetheart,it is my job to teach you about responsibility,setting goals,delayed gratification."
3636,Bree,i'm sure they could. it's too bad your practice is all the way down here.
3639,Bree,"uh, no help needed. certainly nothing that would require your thumb."
1594,Bree,so that's what this is about--your trust fund?
1601,Bree,"if i really thought that,i'd get a gun right now and kill us both."
3650,Bree,"oh, and i love you, too. orson, dear, would you pour melina another glass of wine?"
1605,Bree,"perception is reality, andrew."
1608,Bree,"hi.before coming to these meetings,i never realized how messy substance abusers can be."
3658,Bree,you think you're excited? just imagine the salesman who overcharged you.
1611,Bree,now why would you say that?
1612,Bree,"okay, you got me.i'm not really an alcoholic."
1615,Bree,"i know you think i'm kidding myself,but i'm not.i'm nothing like you people.i just don't have a compulsive personality."
1620,Bree,hello there!i thought you and your friend might like some snacks.
1631,Bree,you can't be serious.
3682,Bree,"oh, good. you're back. can we talk?"
1635,Bree,i would rather not discuss it right now.
1636,Bree,i'd prefer if you--didn't.
1637,Bree,you sound like you're impressed.
1641,Bree,really?because i don't.
1642,Bree,"i'm curious,peter.what is the easiest way to overcome addiction?"
3693,Bree,"no, we don't."
1649,Bree,so how are you doing?
3708,Bree,"since i started writing my own cookbook. remember how you told me i should start making my own money? well, i've been going through all my old recipes, and i've got this great idea for a real home-style american cookbook."
1662,Bree,"of course not.i just want you to understand something.andrew is making accusations--false accusations,saying that i abused him,all because i wouldn't let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.i mean,can you blame me for wanting to know if i have your support?"
3711,Bree,i'll learn. and i want it to be more than just a cookbook. i want to talk about traditional values and give helpful hints about homemaking.
1665,Bree,hi.
1666,Bree,"i,um,i don't want a new sponsor.i'm-- i'm very comfortable working with you."
1667,Bree,"peter,all we did was kiss."
3718,Bree,wait. i wanted to fix something for eli for a change.
3719,Bree,here's my cookbook.
1672,Bree,"um,donna--i-i really appreciate everything that you've been doing for me,but i think i was really making some progress with peter as my sponsor.and i was thinking--"
3721,Bree,"hello, ladies. what do you think?"
3723,Bree,so how do you like my new car?
3724,Bree,"look, there's even a refrigerator. the lexus dealer said there's just enough room for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses. and the best thing is, it's a hybrid so you can barely hear it. let me show you."
1678,Bree,"well,you're not my sponsor anymore,so i assume this is allowable.i mean,it's just a casual get-together."
3727,Bree,"and here i am, rubbing my fabulous new car in her face. i feel awful."
1682,Bree,i don't need donna.i need you.
3730,Bree,a check. i understand you and tom are going through some rough times.
1689,Bree,"yeah.okay,bye."
3737,Bree,"well, that's an intriguing offer."
3738,Bree,we most certainly do--partner.
1692,Bree,"fine!yes,um--so,um,who goes first?"
3739,Bree,"lynette, hi. oh, i wish i had time for a chat, but i'm on my way to a meeting. i might design my own line of bakeware. can you imagine?"
1695,Bree,"andrew,i find your concern ironic,given how tanked you were when you ran over our neighbor's mother with your car."
1696,Bree,she's dead!
3745,Bree,"well, don't thank me. it was your idea."
3747,Bree,certainly.
3749,Bree,they are?
1704,Bree,no.i resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
3752,Bree,but that's commercial parmesan.
3754,Bree,"oh, perhaps you do, but my recipe specifies fresh grated."
1709,Bree,oh.why?
1712,Bree,"you know,justin,if you would be willing to help,i'm pretty sure that i could find a way to keep andrew from moving.what do you say?"
3771,Bree,what's that?
3772,Bree,"oh, lynette, don't be silly. it's just the bumper. you don't need to do that."
1732,Bree,yes?
1733,Bree,"i'm sorry, peter,but, uh, who is this?"
3795,Bree,who told you that?
1749,Bree,"if a citizen,an ordinary citizen like myself,knew of someone holding a significant amount of drugs,what would my responsibilities be,you know, under the law?"
3797,Bree,andrew has been with me since i launched the company. he runs every aspect of the business. he deserves what he's making.
1752,Bree,"well,cravings are cravings,and all you really need is a friend to call when you start having inappropriate thoughts,and i can be that friend."
1755,Bree,"yes, and in that time,i've come to learn that you're good and kind and smart.and, yes,you have a little problem that you need some help with,but i'm willing to be there for you.so what's the big deal?"
3808,Bree,no.
1761,Bree,"yes,i'm aware of that."
3809,Bree,really?
3811,Bree,don't be ridiculous. tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal. return it immediately.
1766,Bree,"well, that's not your life anymore."
3814,Bree,how's tom holding up?
1768,Bree,"rex said he'd always be faithful.george said he'd never hurt me.and as it turned out,they were both liars.so as long as you're honest with me,you'd be amazed at what i can put up with.now let's go home."
1779,Bree,"gaby,you can't promise her that."
1780,Bree,"andrew,i am having peter over for dinner tomorrow night,and i was wondering if you would like to invite justin?"
1781,Bree,out of the question.
1782,Bree,"until they lock caleb up,i don't want you anywhere near that family."
3827,Bree,"lynette, tom, hi. i'd like you to meet my publisher, bruce."
3830,Bree,"well, we're on pins and needles. how's it going?"
1785,Bree,"peter,i don't think i'm being unreasonable here."
3833,Bree,"now, now. he's been very good to me."
3836,Bree,i'll get your coat.
1789,Bree,"honey,what are you wearing?"
1790,Bree,"yes,i just--i'm worried you might be a little cold."
1791,Bree,"right. good. um,sorry.everybody,dig in."
1793,Bree,"oh,my god,are you okay?"
1795,Bree,what a shame.i really wanted him to have a chance to get to know you guys.
3844,Bree,do you know how embarrassed i would have bee if bruce had seen you take it?
1797,Bree,"andrew?honey,what are you doing in my bed?"
3846,Bree,and you hope to earn it back through larceny?
1801,Bree,"every child deserves to be loved unconditionally,and i thought that was the kind of love that i had for you.maybe if i had,it would've been different."
1806,Bree,"well,good for you."
3855,Bree,a thrill? stealing a ceramic duck gives you a thrill?
3856,Bree,"well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable talking to a professional."
3860,Bree,"yes, that would be lovely."
3862,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i'll just go to the store."
3863,Bree,"i don't know, but it's awfully cute."
1816,Bree,"but, sweetheart, this is--this is his room."
1817,Bree,"honey, where am i gonna put all of his things?and, you know, he might come back at some point."
1818,Bree,surprise!
1820,Bree,"yeah. i just wasn't tired.oh, i wanna show you what else i've planned.i think you're gonna love it."
1821,Bree,"no, relax.he's a very hip juggler.he only performs to beatles songs,and i saw the video,and it's absolutely thrilling."
1822,Bree,"danielle, i just want you to have the best party you have ever had in your entire life."
3868,Bree,"juanita! whenever my children stole, i sent them to bed without any supper. just a thought."
3873,Bree,"you're telling me you own a mug with a picture of bernadette peters in ""gypsy""?"
1828,Bree,i'm fine. why?
3877,Bree,"well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional."
1834,Bree,all righty.
1835,Bree,who touched this?
3882,Bree,you wanna help? why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin? i'm gonna need it. i don't deserve this. i have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail. i even gave you a job.
3883,Bree,"so you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft? for god sakes, orson, i'm your wife."
1841,Bree,open your mouth.i wanna smell your breath.
1846,Bree,"oh, that's okay.i can't sleep anyway."
3896,Bree,"well, i have a new idea. i'd like to wait."
1849,Bree,"oh, no, i'm fine.i'm just tired, that's all.i just need a long rest,and then i'm gonna be as good as new."
3902,Bree,"orson, please come upstairs. i know what that couch does to your back."
3909,Bree,nice try.
3915,Bree,"oh, not, uh, just yet. it's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available. i bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for."
1868,Bree,oh. i'm so sorry.i didn't recognize you.
3916,Bree,"to be honest, i-i'm not feeling up to this. i'm gonna have to come back another day.female guard: fine. he's got another visitor scheduled anyway, so i don't even have to tell him you were here."
1870,Bree,what are you doing here?
3917,Bree,another visitor? who?
1876,Bree,"you know that, um, that woman in the wheelchair?what's her story?"
3925,Bree,so you're not--trying to start up something?
3926,Bree,thank you for--checking in on him and for answering my question.
1879,Bree,"honestly, i was hoping that you'd medicate the hell out of me."
1888,Bree,"um, but we could come back later."
1890,Bree,hello?
3941,Bree,"still, she was your mother."
1894,Bree,"okay, there's no camp. that was a fib on my part.i found out that she ran away with a boy and the boy is a murderer."
3944,Bree,"lynette, thank you again for driving."
1897,Bree,"if anything happens to my daughter, so help me, god--"
3946,Bree,"this was a wonderful idea, karen."
3947,Bree,shouldn't we say something first?
1906,Bree,excuse me.do you have the time?
3955,Bree,do you really mean that?
1919,Bree,do you?
1921,Bree,"my children were my life.they were the reason that i got up in the morning, so to have failed them as a parent--"
1922,Bree,"well, my son is a sociopath, and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home. i'm certainly not gonna get ""mother of the year"" anytime soon."
3969,Bree,"oh, dear."
3971,Bree,a bat?
1925,Bree,i'm calling the police.
3974,Bree,"well, it's wonderful to have you home. how's your head?"
3975,Bree,"well, that'll teach you to go out walking in the middle of the night. you know, i still don't know why you were out so late."
1928,Bree,"no.i gave up on your brother, and i'm not gonna make that mistake with you."
1934,Bree,do it.
1935,Bree,"it's okay, baby."
3984,Bree,"well, i like to think of myself as a good person."
3989,Bree,split the pot.
1942,Bree,"ah.this is a little sudden, isn't it?"
1943,Bree,"no, no, um, i do.it just that i, um, can't help being cautious, since rex i haven't been exactly lucky in love."
1951,Bree,orson and i are engaged.
4004,Bree,how would i go about doing that?
1959,Bree,does that change our core values?
4009,Bree,invite evan mayer to your sleepover.
1963,Bree,"i just can't help it.i like telling people.makes me feel, i don't know.makes me feel like i'm starting over.feels good."
1967,Bree,did you lose something?
4017,Bree,i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.
1973,Bree,i have to go.
4023,Bree,"you are repugnant, and this conversation is over."
1977,Bree,sort of.
1983,Bree,"yes, and you are?"
4032,Bree,fine! but do you have to do it with such relish?
1988,Bree,so are you still married?
4039,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed!"
1992,Bree,so what do you think?
4040,Bree,"they're robbers, dear. not personal shoppers."
4044,Bree,was it florence?
2000,Bree,there'll be two hundred people staring at us.
4049,Bree,"oh, really?"
4051,Bree,i doubt that.
4052,Bree,in the ballpark.
2005,Bree,"that was close. the florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet. but not to worry, crisis averted."
2010,Bree,none whatsoever.
4059,Bree,"give me that. i'm so glad this divorce is almost over. an obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will orson."
2012,Bree,i just need a moment.
2015,Bree,is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
4063,Bree,"thanks, karl. i'm not even divorced yet, and once i am, i don't think you'd be my first choice as a matchmaker."
4071,Bree,"yes, but i'm tired of all the lying and the sneaking around, so i will inform him you can have whatever you like."
2025,Bree,he's kind and decent and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again. now please go.
4075,Bree,what are you doing?
2028,Bree,"yes, mr. hodge."
2029,Bree,"i don't need to be any happier than i am at this very second. oh, my goodness, there's only fifteen minutes before our plane.if you want that latte you should go now."
2030,Bree,oh my god.
4078,Bree,excuse me?
4080,Bree,"well, if you're referring to the financial settlement, i already told you, i don't care anymore."
4082,Bree,"ah, but i never filed insurance crime."
2036,Bree,fine!
2038,Bree,you know you could show a little compassion.your brother is out there on the streets struggling to survive!
4091,Bree,a little? the man put chives in my parisian salad! he should be in a straightjacket!
4094,Bree,are you all right? what happened to your shirt?
8193,Gabrielle,"ah, yeah. times are good. not for her. her, mrs. mccluskey said something about you losing 5 pounds in one day. how'd you do that?"
8195,Gabrielle,that's perfect. i'm trying to fit in an old dress. i need intense.
8197,Gabrielle,"oh, you're just afraid i'm gonna look better than you!"
6150,Gabrielle,yes! yes!
8204,Gabrielle,"it's an exercise class. why would anyone say ""doughnut""?"
8208,Gabrielle,okay. we need to talk.
6161,Gabrielle,shut up.
6172,Gabrielle,so you're not laying on anything in this house until you take a shower.
8229,Gabrielle,"jean, wait."
8230,Gabrielle,"no, no. it's perfect. i just want to tell you how helpful you've been to me over the years, and i'm really grateful. thank you."
4133,Gabrielle,why don't i just pin the receipt to my chest?
8235,Gabrielle,"but do you know how much overtime carlos has pulled? how many trips he's taken? he's killed himself. for god sakes, don't do this to my jeweler."
6189,Gabrielle,not what i was gonna say.what i was gonna say is with all his conniving and trickery i still love carlos.
4143,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass."
8241,Gabrielle,"carlos, get in here! i got a real shockeroo for you! you are not gonna believe this! brad! hi. uh, what's going on?"
6194,Gabrielle,"so go to ian! tell him you made the wrong choice, and he's the one you wanna be with. what have you got to lose?"
8243,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i know the kind. so, brad--what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
4147,Gabrielle,is your finger ok?
6196,Gabrielle,"go, ida!"
4150,Gabrielle,absolutely.
8247,Gabrielle,"you're right. i'm sorry. it's just--i really wanted to buy this bracelet i saw today downtown in this little jewelry shop. you know the place, honey. it's right next to the, lexington hotel."
8248,Gabrielle,"absolutely. now if you'll excuse me, i'll leave you two to business. all this negotiating just goes right over my head."
4151,Gabrielle,what?
4152,Gabrielle,"well, he promised to give me everything i've ever wanted."
8251,Gabrielle,so--what's going on? i'm gonna buy a golf club. a baseball bat would be cheaper. maybe i should let you finish.
4156,Gabrielle,because i don't wanna wake up some morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
8253,Gabrielle,"well, don't spend too much. why don't you just get him a card?"
6199,Gabrielle,"oh,thanks.i'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.but my zipper's stuck.can you help me?"
6203,Gabrielle,really? it seems like yesterday to me.
8257,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i think they do.
6209,Gabrielle,"well, what? what's so funny?"
4164,Gabrielle,you see that man who just walked away? can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long.
6213,Gabrielle,your terms?
4168,Gabrielle,to mary alice.
4171,Gabrielle,"it's open, what's the big deal?"
4176,Gabrielle,what's that?
6225,Gabrielle,how dare you! that is a vicious lie.
8276,Gabrielle,"well, what are friends for?"
4181,Gabrielle,"go, go!"
4183,Gabrielle,"i, uh, i just finished a workout."
4184,Gabrielle,john?
4186,Gabrielle,we could always call the police.
6234,Gabrielle,"carlos, have you lost your mind?!"
4189,Gabrielle,"nope. no, no, no, no. you're not gonna buy your way outta this one."
8286,Gabrielle,you painted that? you're good.
8287,Gabrielle,katherine hung one of mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out susan painted it. then she took it down.
6237,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
8290,Gabrielle,"yes, he wants me to take maria shopping tomorrow."
4195,Gabrielle,"it's not exciting anymore, carlos."
4196,Gabrielle,"i don't know. be the way you used to be, surprise me, take my breath away."
6242,Gabrielle,"i don't know what i'm capable of anymore. this divorce has turned me into this-- bitter, hateful person, and i don't like her."
8296,Gabrielle,you didn't.
8299,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll tell you. i have been having an affair with a married man, and it's come to that point where i can't even look at myself in the mirror. so i want a new style that says i'm not a giant turd of sin."
4209,Gabrielle,i can't believe she wormed her way in. how did you let her do that?
6257,Gabrielle,"you look amazing, younger than ever!"
4212,Gabrielle,okay.
6261,Gabrielle,"look, marcella, i'm back. and we made such a great team before, and i think we can be again."
6262,Gabrielle,"well, i just wanna work."
6263,Gabrielle,"are you serious? well, i can't tell because your face doesn't move anymore."
4216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. carlos, what have you done?"
8316,Gabrielle,you know what? you're right. i'm out.
4221,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early."
6272,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. is just, this outfit is hideous!"
4227,Gabrielle,"no, you promise to be home every night this week."
6275,Gabrielle,"oh, i made it work. i'm hot mom."
6276,Gabrielle,"marcella, look, i don't know what they told you, but all i'm asking for is a simple costume change."
4232,Gabrielle,if you would. please.
4233,Gabrielle,"mum, it's no big deal. carlos and i will drive in for the baptism. problem solved. hi, how was school?"
6280,Gabrielle,"oh, it was fine."
8333,Gabrielle,he sure will. the man has a plane to catch.
6285,Gabrielle,"what, i slam one dress, and you quit on me?"
6288,Gabrielle,"don't call me a bi*ch, and stop tracking my cycle. i told you that freaks me out."
8338,Gabrielle,s-so what kind of kiss are we talking about?
6290,Gabrielle,i'm not doing it.
4245,Gabrielle,"what? well, then why did you ask for one?"
4247,Gabrielle,"don't look at your feet. don't look at your feet, look at the road. look at the road. ow. uh, okay, find your balance. find your balance. okay, it's all you. it's all you, you're doing great! okay, stay to the right. watch the car. watch the car. watch the car! are you okay?"
6295,Gabrielle,yes! what am i supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
6296,Gabrielle,"good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs."
4251,Gabrielle,"yeah, that thought did cross my mind."
6305,Gabrielle,"well, you guys earned it. but eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and i want to introduce you to your new best friend, mr. spray tan."
8356,Gabrielle,"i'm not jealous. it's just--you can't hire her. i'm mrs. president, and i get a vote."
4261,Gabrielle,yes!
6308,Gabrielle,"yeah, every day's a parade."
4268,Gabrielle,the cable guy fell. he hit his head on the tub. he may have a concussion.
4270,Gabrielle,hi.
6318,Gabrielle,really?
6321,Gabrielle,"okay,look, we have to do damage control. i get it. next session, i'll apologize to all the moms."
4274,Gabrielle,see? socks. she uses them as rags.
4276,Gabrielle,"remember when you asked us to pack her things? well, when we did we found a note."
6324,Gabrielle,can't you give me a second chance?
4280,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
4281,Gabrielle,imagine what you would lose if carlos finds out you're trimming more than the hedges.why are all your friends staring at me? did you tell them about us?
6328,Gabrielle,"come on, you guys. let's go!"
4284,Gabrielle,really?
6333,Gabrielle,"pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster. you know, we can't afford to bounce every nose-picking no-talent, but we can definitely lose the one who's dragging us down, and that's amy."
6337,Gabrielle,do not wimp out on me here. we gotta do what's best for the business.
8386,Gabrielle,"so did you get a good office? were the people nice? oh, what about lucy? do you like her?"
4292,Gabrielle,so why weren't you sitting with mike tonight? i thought you two were becoming an item.
8389,Gabrielle,that son of a--i'm gonna kill him!
8390,Gabrielle,"how dare you! and, yes, i did!"
4293,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed signals, was that sexy officer thompson.he was staring at you all night."
8394,Gabrielle,"fine. we're a couple of users. the big question is, are we still friends?"
8395,Gabrielle,will you still be my spy?
8396,Gabrielle,i talked to carlos. you're in!
4298,Gabrielle,does carlos know you are coming?
8399,Gabrielle,how about a quickie?
6352,Gabrielle,i know what you mean.
4305,Gabrielle,yeah.so?
8402,Gabrielle,"yeah, we did, years ago. don't you remember?"
6355,Gabrielle,you got it.
8408,Gabrielle,"you know, i should get back."
8409,Gabrielle,okay. we'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
4313,Gabrielle,it's not my fault. juanita hasn't let me out of her sight since she got here.
8411,Gabrielle,"well, we've never had a drought like this. it's been almost two weeks."
4315,Gabrielle,come on! i said i was sorry.
6364,Gabrielle,"i think i do. you miss your mommy, and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice to somebody else. but believe me, i'm not trying to replace your mom."
6366,Gabrielle,sherri from class?
4321,Gabrielle,dammit! the virgin gave it up already?
8418,Gabrielle,i couldn't sleep. i was a little hot. that's better. you look a little warm yourself.
4322,Gabrielle,tomorrow. meet me at the front entrance of the mall after school.
8420,Gabrielle,"i'm releasing the horny teen inside of you. now come on. two boobs, no waiting."
4324,Gabrielle,coming!
8422,Gabrielle,"now listen up, the pair of you. i haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health. you're putting out. that's more like it!"
6372,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you two were practically sisters."
8425,Gabrielle,"carlos, where you going?"
4330,Gabrielle,"mama solis, how're you doing in there?"
6379,Gabrielle,i'm so disappointed in her.
4334,Gabrielle,"no,no, i'll just be a minute."
4339,Gabrielle,carlos.
6389,Gabrielle,what do you mean you live there? since when?
8438,Gabrielle,"say what you want about edie, she really understood men."
4351,Gabrielle,"well, since, i'm gonna have to be doing the cooking, and the cleaning, and all the shopping, like the other wives--"
6401,Gabrielle,"nice try, carlos."
4354,Gabrielle,"well, he did break into your house. i mean, the kid is obviously troubled in some way."
8451,Gabrielle,lynette's beautiful.
6404,Gabrielle,"oh, you care.first,you move across the street.and then, earlier today,i catch you spying on me--"
4357,Gabrielle,i wasn't aware you two were friends.
6405,Gabrielle,"you need to move on, carlos."
8459,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, come on. when you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs."
4367,Gabrielle,"oh, no, john, please don't say that. i have everything under control."
8465,Gabrielle,"well, i guess i could do that. or i could do this. i should make some kind of speech. but think it's enough. we both know i crushed you, right? now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet."
4370,Gabrielle,"no, lynette, i'm sorry, juanita's taking a bath. well, how much did she win from you? jeez,"" ""yeah, i guess she'll take a check. okay. all right. bye."
8467,Gabrielle,why? don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
8468,Gabrielle,what is?
4373,Gabrielle,was this before we were married?
4376,Gabrielle,"oh, i thought we would stop here for lunch first. this place has the best buffet in town. all you can eat crab legs. oh no!"
8473,Gabrielle,"well, you know what? i have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong. it tells me that 50 years from now, you and i will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks."
6426,Gabrielle,"well, you've won."
4379,Gabrielle,hi john. motel. ten minutes. be there.
6427,Gabrielle,bill and i split up.
8478,Gabrielle,"uh, i'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days."
6430,Gabrielle,"i hate that you know me so well, and it took so long for that to happen. now i have to start over again with somebody else."
4385,Gabrielle,oh.
8483,Gabrielle,"actually, that's my leg. get your hand off."
4388,Gabrielle,"oh, that is overstating it -- a little. the bottom line is, no matter how much i dislike you, i love carlos more. if carlos finds out about the money, he'll be devastated. i don't want to see him hurt. you don't have to believe i'm a good person, but at least believe i care about my husband."
6437,Gabrielle,okay.
4390,Gabrielle,"mama juanita, i'm going to the store. do you need anything?"
8487,Gabrielle,"okay, i got one. i'll go first. edie britt was sexy."
6441,Gabrielle,"honestly, did you think i was gonna sleep with you?"
8490,Gabrielle,dave? hello? dave? he didn't answer.
6442,Gabrielle,"carlos, this isn't funny. i am scared to death of this maniac."
4400,Gabrielle,"well, as it turns out, pershing modeling academy has an opening for their summer program. would you like me to sponsor you?"
8498,Gabrielle,"oh. well, this edna has got to be stopped."
4404,Gabrielle,i just wanted to help out.
6453,Gabrielle,"carlos, be careful! he might have a gun!"
8502,Gabrielle,"mm. all right, so they have six, and we have six. we're gonna need a tiebreaker. hey, uh, are men allowed to join the group?"
6458,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're trying to be romantic, but if you keep this up, i'm gonna be forced--"
4411,Gabrielle,"john, please, what we had was so special. i think it deserves a proper goodbye."
4413,Gabrielle,it's not those kind of cramps.
8511,Gabrielle,"""oh, tom, what big arms you have""--that kind of talking?"
4416,Gabrielle,"well, that's it then."
8513,Gabrielle,"hey, tom."
6464,Gabrielle,"but you have to promise to stop buying me these expensive gifts. because i'm not that kind of girl. well, for that many karats, yes, i could be that kind of girl. um, i gotta go. i'll talk to you tomorrow! oh, how about that? and here i was, thinking some guy wants to murder me in my sleep."
6465,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
6468,Gabrielle,"wait, wait, wait. first rule of ransackingremember where everything goes."
4421,Gabrielle,you can't go on like this. you have to take care of yourself.
4422,Gabrielle,don't say that! we need to stay positive.
8519,Gabrielle,i trump your mother. i am garden club president.
4428,Gabrielle,"not really. they'll be able to determine the make and model of the car, but without any eye witnesses, no one seems very optimistic."
8525,Gabrielle,"lynette was taking a shower and carlos came by to drive her to work. she slipped and fell, and he helped her."
4429,Gabrielle,no change. all we can do is wait and hope for the best.
8527,Gabrielle,exactly.
8529,Gabrielle,"if you have a shower at the office, how can you come home smelling so bad?"
4433,Gabrielle,"in case you've forgotten, before we got married, we made a deal. no kids."
4434,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
8533,Gabrielle,"no. i get it. when we first moved here, carlos was working round the clock, and he'd come home and barely say hello to me."
8535,Gabrielle,"so when he didn't see me, i found someone who did."
8536,Gabrielle,i never thought i'd do it to carlos.
6488,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i just can't.
6490,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, zach! don't hijack a ferrari if you don't know how to drive!"
8539,Gabrielle,"yeah. there's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife."
8543,Gabrielle,"hello? oh, hi, principal hardy. what's up? she's wearing what?"
6495,Gabrielle,"all right, off my porch."
4449,Gabrielle,"okay. you can stop condemning me with your eyes. right now. i know you know, about the affair. but you know nothing about my life. look, it's not even an issue anymore. john and i are finished."
4450,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you just a ball of fun. so, if i confess, it'll clean the slate, right?"
6497,Gabrielle,i mind. we're divorced. i can't keep running to you every time i get scared. i want to be the kind of woman who can take care of herself.
6503,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, why don't you support me from the lobby? i have some networking to do. my girl just won the pageant."
8553,Gabrielle,are you a lunatic? i am not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.
6505,Gabrielle,you bribed the judges?
6509,Gabrielle,you wouldn't even let your own daughter go out with him. you said he was a psycho.
4464,Gabrielle,how's the dress fitting?
6514,Gabrielle,"gee, well--not as wild as what i'm about to say. you can take me to dinner."
8565,Gabrielle,"fine. but just so we're clear, you're also latino jerk of the year."
4470,Gabrielle,vaguely.
8571,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. i'm as healthy as a horse."
6523,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm stuffed. i can't believe you talked me into that crme brle."
8575,Gabrielle,thank you.
4479,Gabrielle,really?
8577,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you think being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right now, but believe me, it's not."
8580,Gabrielle,we're rich again! hallelujah!
6534,Gabrielle,"wait, zach. zach, i'm not mad!"
8585,Gabrielle,"you know, i should really get you tested."
8586,Gabrielle,did you have a fun playdate with heather?
4491,Gabrielle,"thank god, tom could fill in at the last minute."
4494,Gabrielle,"edie, what did you do to that dress?"
4495,Gabrielle,yes!
8593,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? this conversation is over. go to your room! you, too, bobblehead."
8595,Gabrielle,"well, i want juanita to work with the poor. i want to teach her to be grateful for how good she has it."
8601,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
8602,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
8603,Gabrielle,thank you.
6553,Gabrielle,"oh, that'll happen a lot faster if you just hop on board."
4510,Gabrielle,"but helen, you have to believe me. it's over now."
6558,Gabrielle,"works for me, too."
6560,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet, but i, uh--"
8610,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. there has to be some reason. you don't fall that far that fast without making some really stupid choices."
8612,Gabrielle,"oh, relax. i already ate dinner at home--in my box under the bridge. fran? oh, god. i was afraid i wouldn't find you here."
4517,Gabrielle,"carlos, wait!"
4518,Gabrielle,they took him away in handcuffs.
6567,Gabrielle,it's okay. do you want some coffee?
6569,Gabrielle,"uh, go ahead. i'm gonna open some more wine."
4523,Gabrielle,"yao lin, don't be stupid. people don't become poor overnight."
8623,Gabrielle,"well, if your idea of a good time is sitting on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway eating lard in the shape of chicken, then yeah! it's gonna be a blast."
6576,Gabrielle,"what is with you?! an hour ago, you we really into me, and now you can't get out fast enough."
8626,Gabrielle,"oh, no, sweetie. we have to go. they're family."
4531,Gabrielle,"my china. i know how you've always loved it, and i thought you might want to borrow it for a while."
8628,Gabrielle,"the first time a man did something stupid, and a woman pointed it out."
6578,Gabrielle,what?
8631,Gabrielle,"wow, this place is looking worse than ever."
8632,Gabrielle,say no more.
6586,Gabrielle,zach? you're-- in your underwear.
6587,Gabrielle,you've been here all night?
8640,Gabrielle,"well, you know--we're still gonna be family tomorrow, so i think we should think about it overnight and search our hearts, and try to figure out which one of your homes is best for ana."
8642,Gabrielle,"what's there to talk about? you won't even let the girls get a golden retriever, and now you wanna take in a teenager?"
4547,Gabrielle,but they won't release him on bail until they get the passport.
6598,Gabrielle,"no, i don't remember anything! i just woke up, and he was in bed next to me."
4555,Gabrielle,"it, uh, it has an excellently crafted interior, peaceful quiet tuning, and ultrasonic rear parking assist. observe the remote activation feature."
6603,Gabrielle,would you excuse me a second?
6604,Gabrielle,"i am in hell.i just tried to break up with zach,and the little twerp played the dead mommy card."
8654,Gabrielle,this teenager thing isn't so bad.
6606,Gabrielle,"you know, intimidate him. do the whole jealous, latin ex-husband thing you do. tell him if you can't have me, nobody can."
6607,Gabrielle,"hey,i am looking out for zach,too.if i dump him,it'll destroy him emotionally.better to scare him off. please?"
4561,Gabrielle,"you know, with their perfectly crafted interior, and peaceful, quiet tuning."
8658,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just kidding. it was a joke."
4564,Gabrielle,mr. hartley. it's gabrielle solis. i need you to start working on releasing carlos on bail. mm hmm. i just remembered where i put his passport.
6620,Gabrielle,"okay, i'll take my chances."
8669,Gabrielle,"well, how did you get everything down so quickly?"
8670,Gabrielle,"okay, boys, thanks for your hard work, but maybe it's time to go home and take a shower--preferably a cold one."
8673,Gabrielle,"uh, okay, juanita, go to your room. and don't come out until you're 18."
6626,Gabrielle,look what you did!
6627,Gabrielle,"well, your driver's an idiot!"
6629,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad you like it, 'cause you're gonna pay to fix this."
6633,Gabrielle,not exactly.
8682,Gabrielle,hey.
4587,Gabrielle,mmm.
4588,Gabrielle,"mmm, it's perfect! oh, mm, crispy and burnt on the outside but nice and steamy on the inside."
6634,Gabrielle,it would be your treat. i'm a hot date. what's in it for me?
6636,Gabrielle,"well, a girl's gotta eat."
8687,Gabrielle,so let me get this straight. you play tennis. you know wine. and you speak mandarin. does every other man in the world want you dead?
6638,Gabrielle,"no, thank you. i'm stuffed."
6639,Gabrielle,"victor, you are so full of crap."
6641,Gabrielle,"uh,for the same reason you forgot to sign the check.you've been working me since the second we met,and i've been on to you every step of the way.what?what's so funny?i just called you a manipulative jerk."
6642,Gabrielle,there is no relationship. this is our last date.
8692,Gabrielle,"god, no!"
6643,Gabrielle,"it was okay. you know, you told a few good jokes. you're sorta charming. you're not bad-looking. i just think i can do better."
6646,Gabrielle,"i have noticed,and i'm throwing you back."
6648,Gabrielle,"in a slump, huh? how long's it been?"
6651,Gabrielle,"no. god, no. as a matter of fact, i think i'm dumping him after dinner tonight."
6652,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's just too arrogant. he acts like i'm some trophy he's already won. it's infuriating.
4605,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i, i'm so sorry, i just can't handle this right now. i have my own personal things going on. my life is falling apart."
4606,Gabrielle,i'll see what i can do.
6656,Gabrielle,no!
4615,Gabrielle,what?
6664,Gabrielle,"sweater, now."
4624,Gabrielle,how? you're barely making minimum wage!
6674,Gabrielle,you and i are gonna be so happy together.
4629,Gabrielle,so paul said that zachary killed dana?
6679,Gabrielle,thanks.
4632,Gabrielle,"no, mikki, you're wrong. i wasn't acting like a diva. i left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me. it's not my fault."
6680,Gabrielle,"yeah, couture."
6684,Gabrielle,"okay, let's be reasonable. you can't wear two dresses to one lunch. it's not like i have a spare in the car."
4639,Gabrielle,fine. please.
6690,Gabrielle,why don't you just tell tom to pick another color?
6691,Gabrielle,you mean quit?
4645,Gabrielle,"well, then what did you hire me for?"
6694,Gabrielle,"what? over a dress? god, what a bi*ch."
4650,Gabrielle,"oh no, no, no, wait, wait."
6699,Gabrielle,i'd love to. although what am i gonna wear now?
6703,Gabrielle,"not tonight, thanks."
6705,Gabrielle,"half the fun? oh, honey, if i ever do say yes--you're gonna adjust that percentage way down."
4659,Gabrielle,"john, you're a toy.you and me -- no future."
6711,Gabrielle,i don't care! he can find two lousy minutes for me.
4665,Gabrielle,"really, why?"
4666,Gabrielle,what kind of favor?
6715,Gabrielle,we had sex yesterday in his limo.
4671,Gabrielle,did i mention why my husband's home a lot? he's under house arrest.
4674,Gabrielle,how? how are you handling it?
4678,Gabrielle,what is that?
4679,Gabrielle,carlos--
6728,Gabrielle,look. no gloves.
6731,Gabrielle,"no, wait! this is the first time i've had you to myself all night."
6734,Gabrielle,i know. that's what makes it so exciting--the risk.
4687,Gabrielle,i am here to talk to your roommate.
6735,Gabrielle,"it's an elevator, silly. it has an emergency stop button. i don't."
4690,Gabrielle,think he'll get violent?
6738,Gabrielle,"oh, man, i was just starting to get into it."
6740,Gabrielle,i made you waffles! eat 'em while they're hot. what?
6741,Gabrielle,they're just toaster waffles.
4697,Gabrielle,"yeah, but why me? you're a good looking kid. why don't you test drive someone your own age?"
4698,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way."
6746,Gabrielle,"well, if you can choke down that lousy waffle i made you, that'd be a start."
4700,Gabrielle,i should probably go.
6747,Gabrielle,hi! can i help you?
4702,Gabrielle,definitely gay.
4703,Gabrielle,"carlos, we can't afford to live here anymore."
6756,Gabrielle,"that miserable cockroach. well, if you wanna smack him around a little, i can go inside and turn up the radio."
4711,Gabrielle,how will you work?
6761,Gabrielle,"look, i know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead."
4714,Gabrielle,what?
6764,Gabrielle,that does it.
4717,Gabrielle,"okay, well, we'll let you know."
6769,Gabrielle,i said yes. i would be thrilled to be mrs. victor lang.
4722,Gabrielle,ahem. sorry.
6770,Gabrielle,"in fact, i was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator, i seized the moment to express my joy."
4724,Gabrielle,i'm all in.
4725,Gabrielle,"god, i have to go to the bathroom again."
4729,Gabrielle,because it's your fault.
6779,Gabrielle,a poem?
4733,Gabrielle,ta-da!
4738,Gabrielle,sure. why?
6787,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, edie. come on. it would make me happy to know who's making you happy."
6789,Gabrielle,who?
6794,Gabrielle,would you guys excuse me?
6795,Gabrielle,"hey, edie!"
4752,Gabrielle,but i thought you said they offered a plea bargain.
6803,Gabrielle,then be prepared to suffer the consequences.
4756,Gabrielle,"what? no, this is her daughter-in-law."
6804,Gabrielle,you're about to find out.
6806,Gabrielle,"i mean, we as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so you're gonna support me because that's what friends do."
6808,Gabrielle,"really? because i wasn't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with patty monroe over the backyard fence line, but i did."
6811,Gabrielle,"no, no! not cold, frozen! i want icicles hanging from that bi*ch's ears!"
4764,Gabrielle,"she treated me like trash!"" ""god rest her soul."
6812,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette, it's gaby. victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter. so i'm free for lunch.you wanna go with? i tried susan but she's not home, which is weird because her car's in the driveway and--so is yours. where is everybody?"
6813,Gabrielle,lynette! susan!
4767,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so thoughtful of you, but actually no."
6818,Gabrielle,"i am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me, our friendship is over."
6819,Gabrielle,"oh! no, i mean it."
6820,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop! put me down! what are you doing?!"
4775,Gabrielle,being poor? a little.
6823,Gabrielle,i'll tell you what's ridiculous. you not having the guts to tell me you were dating edie.
6825,Gabrielle,i didn't plan it that way. it was spur of the moment.
6826,Gabrielle,"yes, deeply."
4784,Gabrielle,"yeah! you did the crime, why should i have to pay the price? just suck it up, be a man, and do the time."
6832,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then i'm gone."
6833,Gabrielle,"oh, vern, i can't wait for you to meet him. he's everything i've ever wanted in a man--sensitive and kind--"
4788,Gabrielle,why?
6836,Gabrielle,"oh, give me a break. i was standing right there. you could've said something."
6838,Gabrielle,forty dollars? you think i'm gonna pay that?
4791,Gabrielle,yeah. of course.
4793,Gabrielle,i love you.
6842,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
6843,Gabrielle,keep talking.
4798,Gabrielle,apparently.
4799,Gabrielle,monetary compensation? you're trying to buy us off?
6850,Gabrielle,thank you. now what you're about to see may astound you.
6851,Gabrielle,"you could try, but you might not want to. see, i'm engaged to victor lang. ring a bell? the mayor? your new boss?"
4804,Gabrielle,"i'm so lucky to have you,"
4805,Gabrielle,because i don't want to have kids and you do.
4807,Gabrielle,honey. it's not going to happen.
6855,Gabrielle,no!
6856,Gabrielle,"ow, you're hurting me!"
4812,Gabrielle,"wait, just let me explain."
6864,Gabrielle,"i was just joking around, being me. i thought you liked that."
4818,Gabrielle,"you know once you calm down, you're going to realise i did the right thing and when that happens, i'd appreciate an apology."
6868,Gabrielle,i think so.
4824,Gabrielle,"so what do you expect to happen right now, carlos? i sign the papers and jump into your arms."
4827,Gabrielle,worse. i read them.
4830,Gabrielle,"no, but i could. hey, isn't that why the prosecution didn't have a case against you? they couldn't find the profits you made. so if i were you, carlos, i wouldn't mention the words divorce, trust or post- nup ever again. you don't wanna piss me off."
4841,Gabrielle,are your roommates here?
6892,Gabrielle,"well, you can't have it. and if you ask me, i am doing you a really big favor."
4850,Gabrielle,"stop, you're hurting me."
6898,Gabrielle,"just so you know, i changed all my flowers."
4852,Gabrielle,"well, you might want to try a motel, because you're not coming back in here."
4856,Gabrielle,"well, then have fun at the motel."
4860,Gabrielle,"one more thing. if you ever hurt me again, i will kill you."
4861,Gabrielle,i feel trapped.
4864,Gabrielle,"i'm unhappy. carlos and my marriage. i don't have options and it's driving me crazy. every time something went south in my life, i always had a plan b. now i feel like i have nothing."
4866,Gabrielle,thank you.
6918,Gabrielle,so we're kind stuck.
4878,Gabrielle,because i'm in a lovely restaurant having a lovely meal that i now can't pay for!
6926,Gabrielle,hey!
4883,Gabrielle,uh??
4884,Gabrielle,ha ha. i don't know. i'd watch your back.
4885,Gabrielle,"well, sam, to tell the truth, i'm kind of in a relationship right now. i just wanted to be honest."
6931,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go. i'm gonna meet francois."
4889,Gabrielle,sorry.
6939,Gabrielle,"god, it is ten after, and bree is never late! where can she be? all right, that's it. after i finish ""tszujing"" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime. i can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started."
6940,Gabrielle,is that bree? she better not have come empty-handed!
6941,Gabrielle,holy crap!
6944,Gabrielle,why not?
6945,Gabrielle,"okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't."
6947,Gabrielle,"which is why i have to show people that i'm okay with it. please, just consider it my wedding gift."
4903,Gabrielle,"i am so sorry, it just hit me out of nowhere. it is so weird, smells have been making me nauseous lately."
6953,Gabrielle,"you gotta be kidding, right? i mean, we just finished a campaign. you're not about to put me through another one."
6960,Gabrielle,is this about running for governor? because i told you how i feel about that.
6962,Gabrielle,"victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and i'm sick of it."
4922,Gabrielle,thanks.
4923,Gabrielle,i don't know who the father is.
6971,Gabrielle,why?
4925,Gabrielle,yeah.
4926,Gabrielle,"no, i know, susan. i don't know what i'm going to do."
4929,Gabrielle,"oh, really?!"
6980,Gabrielle,"oh, my gosh, that's right. okay, you stay here. i'm gonna go grab him."
4935,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
6985,Gabrielle,holy crap!
6989,Gabrielle,"i can't dump him on our wedding day.that's a horrible thing to do,even to victor."
4943,Gabrielle,"um, carlos? your parents? john, something like this could ruin your life. that's why you have to keep quiet about our affair. there's no point in this catastrophe taking both of us down."
6999,Gabrielle,"okay,you know,running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.but runnin' away to be alone is insane!"
4956,Gabrielle,yeah. you see pregnant women have very strong urges.
4961,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
7009,Gabrielle,do you think this is them?
4963,Gabrielle,what the hell are you????
7011,Gabrielle,so i hear congratulations are in order.edie just announced you're getting married.best wishes!
4965,Gabrielle,oh my god!
4967,Gabrielle,really? i've been finding it so bland.
4969,Gabrielle,"because carlos can provide, john! he can give this baby everything. piano lessons and summer camp and the best colleges. he can raise this child the way it deserves to be raised, you can't."
4970,Gabrielle,"if you want what's best for the baby, you will help me. help me make sure this baby doesn't grow up poor like i did."
4973,Gabrielle,"hey, i thought you might be thirsty."
4982,Gabrielle,"yeah, we could do that."
7030,Gabrielle,"generally speaking, women don't leave their husbands for guys who have girlfriends. just boot the bi*ch. what are you afraid of?"
7033,Gabrielle,edie! what brings you here?
7037,Gabrielle,so?
7043,Gabrielle,"uh, susan."
4997,Gabrielle,"well, obviously."
5003,Gabrielle,danielle called.
5020,Gabrielle,stop it!
5023,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pregnant, you jackass!"
7073,Gabrielle,you leaving already?
7077,Gabrielle,a bracelet's always nice. for edie's sister.
5034,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i don't need to take a test. i am just trying to reassure my husband of what i know is true in my heart. so if you could just slip me someone else's test results, i could make my own. i got photoshop for christmas. oh, come on. you look like a fun-loving girl. i am sure you've been in a couple hairy situations of your own."
7082,Gabrielle,excuse me.
5040,Gabrielle,"what, you want a father's day card?"
7088,Gabrielle,"you think victor's my only option? well,igot news for you, carlos. i can have any guy i want, because this--waits for no man."
5042,Gabrielle,damn straight. what you did was worse.
7090,Gabrielle,i think i got a chill. now let me see if i can give you one.
5046,Gabrielle,"this is ridiculous, you know that?"
5047,Gabrielle,don't you think i have better things to do than to bring you checks every day? checks that i could be signing at home?
5049,Gabrielle,do you know how long it takes me to schlep out here to this hellhole?
5053,Gabrielle,why are all rich men jerks?
5054,Gabrielle,"sure, baby."
7103,Gabrielle,"oh, here. let me get that."
7104,Gabrielle,okay.
5058,Gabrielle,really? how?
5060,Gabrielle,seven thousand dollars?!
5063,Gabrielle,he's actually willing to take a check?
5066,Gabrielle,oh.
5067,Gabrielle,excuse me. i'm looking for rita rivara.
5070,Gabrielle,"oh, i see. well, uh, your boyfriend asked my husband to give this to you. it's a sort of favor. it's all there. seven thousand dollars."
7119,Gabrielle,"night, carlos."
7120,Gabrielle,"well, i bought you an expensive gift, and i'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous i am."
7125,Gabrielle,why'd you take your wig off?
7127,Gabrielle,"interesting. question--when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, ""hey, check out the soul on that girl""?"
7129,Gabrielle,"but you could be, which brings me to my second point--men like variety. tonight you're a redhead. tomorrow--you are--helga, the sexy milkmaid. or--amber, the lonely runaway. or--jeff, the friendly guy from work. what? i don't know what tom is into."
5083,Gabrielle,is that what richie said?
5086,Gabrielle,"so, her boobs are fine. and, honestly, what he's doing to her self-esteem is just cruel. i feel sorry for her."
7134,Gabrielle,"yeah, if i didn't, he would think something is going on. what is your excuse for doing it with edie?"
5088,Gabrielle,i just realized rita and i have a lot in common.
5092,Gabrielle,"see, i was thinking i'd be writing the checks."
7140,Gabrielle,"it's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel. do you like it?"
5097,Gabrielle,"uh, our anniversary."
5098,Gabrielle,how could you forget our anniversary? you sit in a cell all day long staring at a calendar.
5099,Gabrielle,"oh, we're not doing this again."
5100,Gabrielle,"yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries, so i guess we're even."
7145,Gabrielle,"well, don't just stand there. come in. we have lots of food and fun and surprises."
5104,Gabrielle,"a woman does need to be loved, and since you didn't give it to me, i had to find it elsewhere."
5105,Gabrielle,"say what you want, but john rowland loved me like no one ever has. not as a trophy or as a possession, but for me. he loved me."
5106,Gabrielle,"no, he really did."
7157,Gabrielle,"good work, boys, but i have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage. hello?"
7163,Gabrielle,"as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn."
5119,Gabrielle,"yeah, like five minutes ago! haven't you ever heard of a mourning period?"
7168,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, so i married the mayor. kooky, huh?"
5121,Gabrielle,"no. oh, no, no. it's me. i am beyond stupid."
5122,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i am. yesterday, i was still fantasizing that it could work with you, that a one-bedroom apartment might be cozy."
7171,Gabrielle,"sorry about that. a complete shock. i mean, of all people to run into."
5124,Gabrielle,"that's okay, sweetie. i'm good."
5125,Gabrielle,"actually, john, given how stupid both of us have been, this an entirely appropriate ending."
5130,Gabrielle,"but, i don't think i can wait that long."
5132,Gabrielle,"okay, look, all we need is twenty minutes."
7180,Gabrielle,awfully pregnant.
7190,Gabrielle,you deserved it. all you cared about back then was work.
7193,Gabrielle,"is it, mr. man in the closet? yeah, you heard me. who's john rowland now?"
5146,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that was a jealously thing. the man that my husband was trying to kill in court is not the least bit gay. trust me."
7195,Gabrielle,you serious?
7200,Gabrielle,this kiss has to last six months. you better make it good.
7206,Gabrielle,"oh, great. now i have to break up with him all over again."
7208,Gabrielle,"milton, there is no amount of money that is-- wow!"
5161,Gabrielle,like you said. i want what i want when i want it.
7210,Gabrielle,and isn't there an election around that time?
7211,Gabrielle,"and you're going to make sure he goes straight to the top, aren't you?"
5165,Gabrielle,i'm ready whenever you-
5170,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
7221,Gabrielle,which also means you had it when we got divorced.
5174,Gabrielle,i wonder where david is. he should have been here by now.
5176,Gabrielle,"oh, david."
5181,Gabrielle,shaky at best.
5183,Gabrielle,"why not? he's experienced, he's intelligent, he's successful."
7231,Gabrielle,"victor, i know you're only doing this because a divorce would hurt your run for governor."
5186,Gabrielle,"one more word out of you, lisa, and i will back hand you myself."
5189,Gabrielle,no!
7237,Gabrielle,it's bree.
7240,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, victor. a month in rio sounds like heaven, doesn't it?"
7241,Gabrielle,that's so romantic. i love that.
5194,Gabrielle,"david, we're not here to drink wine, okay? this is business. now you have to convince carlos that he can trust you."
5195,Gabrielle,i don't know. tell him you're happily married or gay!
7244,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
5199,Gabrielle,really. what are you gonna say?
7250,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, carlos, am i gonna have to change this number?"
7254,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
7256,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
7258,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, just in case, we should run back to shore so i can grab a jacket."
5212,Gabrielle,what?
5213,Gabrielle,are you okay?
7262,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, thank god you're here."
7263,Gabrielle,"well, i-i clubbed him and knocked him overboard."
5217,Gabrielle,has she seen paul yet?
5218,Gabrielle,we know what you did to mrs. huber.
7269,Gabrielle,here. sit him here.
5223,Gabrielle,"dear david, who knew you could actually bleed? sincerely, your stunned co-workers."
5227,Gabrielle,for what?
7276,Gabrielle,victor! victor!
5230,Gabrielle,you can't just quit in the middle of a hearing.
7279,Gabrielle,maybe they won't.
7280,Gabrielle,"no one but you knows i was with victor. i'll say he went out alone. i told him i was leaving him, and he was depressed, suicidal even."
5235,Gabrielle,"i feel terrible. how was i supposed to know that he would take a bullet and suddenly realize he's in love with me? okay, look, i know i pushed you into hiring that creep, but i promise i will do anything i can to fix this."
5241,Gabrielle,"not an option. i'm catholic, hence the guilt."
7296,Gabrielle,"okay, this is no time for name-calling. a man is missing."
5251,Gabrielle,not unless we make some.
7299,Gabrielle,they don't know that someone else was us.
5256,Gabrielle,because some of my model friends are coming down from new york on friday so i have to look better than ever. i can't have them thinking i moved to the suburbs and i shop at strip malls.
7309,Gabrielle,carlos? that's crazy. where'd you hear that?
7314,Gabrielle,"well, you can stop feeling guilty. victor's alive, and we're screwed."
7325,Gabrielle,carlos and i are back together.
5278,Gabrielle,hi!
5280,Gabrielle,"hi. my, uh, friends just left, and i was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing."
5281,Gabrielle,"it was, um, weird."
7331,Gabrielle,"look, we'll be back-- someday. we just have to wait till this all blows over."
7333,Gabrielle,"um, go. you guys go."
7335,Gabrielle,i can't deal with that right now. i'm packing.
5294,Gabrielle,"i just, i have so many errands to run and a million thing to return."
7344,Gabrielle,"give me the damn folder, edie!"
7346,Gabrielle,give me my money!
5301,Gabrielle,"oh, well, it was a little soon for that, don't you think? i mean, how can you name something the size of a walnut?"
5302,Gabrielle,do you like it? i picked it up on the way here.
5307,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
7355,Gabrielle,can i say something?
7356,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry carlos and i lied to you. i know we hurt you, and i wish it didn't happen the way it did, and i-i just want you to know that."
5311,Gabrielle,i'm gonna call the police!
5313,Gabrielle,"no! no, you can't come in!"
7363,Gabrielle,is it? i'd forgotten.
7367,Gabrielle,go? you can't kick me out of my husband's funeral.
7368,Gabrielle,go to hell.
5325,Gabrielle,"why is everyone on my back about this? i will deal with my loss my way, okay?"
7377,Gabrielle,i'm texting someone.
7378,Gabrielle,"carlos, just calm down, okay? i'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some super nerd way to get back into the account, okay? i know we can fix this."
7387,Gabrielle,which is--
5342,Gabrielle,this is stupid. i didn't even want this baby.
7391,Gabrielle,"so when i finally came clean, his wife told me she shredded anything that had to do with offshore accounts. she was protecting al."
5346,Gabrielle,thank you.
7396,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. did i miss mass? was it at 9:00?"
7397,Gabrielle,"oh, that's good to know. uh, father, can i talk to you?"
5351,Gabrielle,he what?
7400,Gabrielle,"okay, this may come as a little shock to you--but guess who's getting married again? and i was thinking, maybe you could perform the ceremony. is tuesday good for you?"
7402,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no. it's carlos."
5358,Gabrielle,wow. that biting thing at the end totally blew my mind. please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.
7409,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i wanted it to be a surprise, but we're getting married! father, hit it."
7410,Gabrielle,"i don't know. just after everything we've been through, there's nothing in our way now. we can finally be together. and i really need that. i need a happy ending, carlos. so what do you say? will you marry me?"
5363,Gabrielle,a new path?
7411,Gabrielle,holy matrimony. bring it on.
5365,Gabrielle,"how do you ease into, 'hi, i'm your illegitimate daughter'?"
5367,Gabrielle,you're up early.
7416,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, it wasn't a competition, but, yeah, i guess i did."
5369,Gabrielle,but it's not even sunday.
5372,Gabrielle,"so, she's hot! she's a hot nun!"
5373,Gabrielle,you mean to tell me that this miraculous conversion of yours has nothing to do with fact that the woman standing outside is a knock-out?
5377,Gabrielle,"oh, i get it. sort of like, today's convict is tomorrow's convert."
5378,Gabrielle,currently? no.
5381,Gabrielle,you are a hypocrite. the money you spent to buy your sports car could buy a mud hut for every peasant in ecuador.
5383,Gabrielle,share? what if you have the car and i need to go shopping?
5385,Gabrielle,carlos!
5387,Gabrielle,"i'm not here to talk you out of anything. check in this drawer. carlos, i wanna apologize for the way i've been acting. i mean, here you are trying to turn your life around, and all i can think about are my stupid jealousy issues."
5398,Gabrielle,i know what you said. i'm wondering why you said it.
5399,Gabrielle,"well, i guess he should have thought of that before he married me."
5401,Gabrielle,"you listen to me, you little bitch. you do not want to start a war with me."
5403,Gabrielle,who's sister mary bernard?
5406,Gabrielle,"god, and he's our pharmacist. it's enough to turn you holistic."
5412,Gabrielle,that's your excuse? we missed side-by-side water massages. i had to book them weeks in advance.
7460,Gabrielle,"oh, don't play victim with me. i have to walk in heels all day long. you get to sit in a chair and roll."
7463,Gabrielle,no! you started it. hang it up!
5416,Gabrielle,she wants us fighting. she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
5419,Gabrielle,i'm concerned about the drought in kenya.
7468,Gabrielle,come on. you've been cooped up in this house since you got home from the hospital. let's go out and have some fun!
5422,Gabrielle,sister mary was going on the trip?
7471,Gabrielle,just picking up some vitamins. i'll be quicker if i do it myself.
5425,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. i'm really gonna miss you."
7473,Gabrielle,"thank you. sorry, babe. that took a little longer than i--carlos? carlos? carlos? carlos! carlos! oh, there you are."
5430,Gabrielle,"i may be a catholic, but i am so not above slapping a nun."
7479,Gabrielle,"to answer your earlier question, yes, i got a manicure. i'm sorry. are we good?"
5432,Gabrielle,"yes, right. she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor and there's perfectly good poor right here. for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy."
7480,Gabrielle,that's a really mean way to put it.
7481,Gabrielle,"well, why shouldn't i get something out of this? you know, the blindness didn't just happen to you."
7485,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
5440,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos."
7488,Gabrielle,how do you know that?
5445,Gabrielle,poor baby.i would've kissed you.
7495,Gabrielle,"okay, hypothetical situation - carlos and i are sitting on the couch. i'm doing my nails. he's whining for the remote. how do i get roxy to fetch it for him?"
5450,Gabrielle,you're not serious.
5451,Gabrielle,okay.
7502,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, when she learns how to make granite sparkle, she can have more."
5455,Gabrielle,you make it sound like--i was making a pass at your husband.and that's just a little bit insulting.
7509,Gabrielle,"oh, so now i can't hit my own husband in my own house?"
5463,Gabrielle,"tom, i need to wipe up.do you have a towel?"
7514,Gabrielle,"you're right, baby. i'm sorry. let me try it this way. you listen to me, you blind son of a bitch. if you don't get this mangy, 6- nippled, cujo wannabe off my satin sheets, you won't just need a dog to get around. you'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue."
5467,Gabrielle,really? because i sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. am i wrong?
7515,Gabrielle,"carlos, i mean it. who's it gonna be - me or the dog?"
7517,Gabrielle,"oh. yes. okay, let's go. let's go, roxy. let's go, roxy. let's go. let's go in the car."
5471,Gabrielle,what does that mean?
7520,Gabrielle,"shame, isn't it? i mean, i personally adored the little angel, but she and carlos just did not get along."
5473,Gabrielle,"oh.so i know susan mayer would never tell.it must've been helen rowland.she probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.and ida greenberg goes to that salon.so if ida knows,the whole town knows.and we're just gonna have to move. that's all there is to it.carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?"
5474,Gabrielle,it was a harmless little kiss!why is everybody making a big deal about this?
7522,Gabrielle,"oh, well, actually, we found one."
5476,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna let you even the score.carlos,go have an affair."
5477,Gabrielle,i had my little indiscretion.so you go have you.get it out of your system.i know you want to.
7527,Gabrielle,where do you think i've been? there's no sign of her anywhere.
5480,Gabrielle,"actually,i'm right in the middle of something,and i don't know when i'll be done."
7530,Gabrielle,"come on, you stupid mutt."
7531,Gabrielle,"yeah, still no sign of roxy. but don't worry. i'm on the case."
7533,Gabrielle,"don't judge me. you don't know this hound from hell. i raise my voice a teensy bit, and she barks, or i give carlos a little smack, and she growls."
5487,Gabrielle,"no.i kissed tom,and it was a harmless joke.i think if i had kissed anybody else's husband,they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later."
7537,Gabrielle,"are you done with your armchair analysis, 3- divorce annie?"
7543,Gabrielle,that wasn't his biceps. why do you think he rushed out of here?
7544,Gabrielle,"you're right, ellie. my husband was totally inappropriate. so a class? are you a teacher?"
5499,Gabrielle,ralph!make your point.
7547,Gabrielle,"honey, i can't find my nail file. have you seen it?"
7550,Gabrielle,"hey, uh--oh, i'm sorry. i didn't know you were--entertaining. hi, i'm gaby solis."
5503,Gabrielle,"baby,what you're about to see will most likely shock and upset you."
7553,Gabrielle,"earlier tonight, i saw a guy coming out of ellie's room, so i assumed it was her boyfriend, but just now i caught her in there with another guy."
5507,Gabrielle,it was supposed to be funny--a naughty little christmas gift for my boyfriend.
5508,Gabrielle,"i know,i was freakishly flexible back then.i'm sorry!look,what are we gonna do about this?"
7555,Gabrielle,"oh, it sounds like he's leaving. i hope it's not 'cause of me. maybe i should go apologize."
5510,Gabrielle,"not necessarily.see,here's what i'm thinking--scott's a coward,so you could totally put the scare into him.all you gotta do is go and rough him up,and he'll take my pictures off the web site like that."
7556,Gabrielle,"okay, there may be two tramps in this house, but only one of 'em is getting paid."
5518,Gabrielle,why? you either care if men leer at me or not.and you made it clear that you don't.so what's the point?
7566,Gabrielle,"ellie, what are you doing?"
5520,Gabrielle,"okay,go get him,tiger."
5522,Gabrielle,you promised!
5524,Gabrielle,you used to go crazy when men would so much as look at me the wrong way--and that's when i had clothes on.
5528,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
5532,Gabrielle,knock it off.
7582,Gabrielle,"oh, hey, guys! you were up there a while. can i see it?"
5539,Gabrielle,"because i can't say that i'm gonna wake up tomorrow and suddenly wanna do something that i swore my entire life.i would never do. ""maybe"" is a very big step for me."
5540,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to accept it.there's nothing else you can do."
7587,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
7590,Gabrielle,"okay, look, maybe i was wrong. maybe it was flour. maybe she's a pastry chef."
5543,Gabrielle,the only promise i am making you is that this is so not over.
5546,Gabrielle,"yeah.look,i need you to do something for me.i need you to get rid of sister mary bernard."
7594,Gabrielle,it's one of ellie's customers.
5548,Gabrielle,"yes!at first it started with the love letters while he was in prison,and the next thing i know,they're spending day and night together--sneaking off to private bible study,and one-on-one spiritual consultation."
7598,Gabrielle,you were only doing it because you're the devil.
7600,Gabrielle,ellie? brunch is almost ready! this is gonna be so hard.
7602,Gabrielle,what's this?
5555,Gabrielle,"oh, well, maybe you should go lie down.i'm gonna be out for a while."
7603,Gabrielle,oh.
7606,Gabrielle,and--she's gone.
5559,Gabrielle,maybe not--but you certainly are.you missed a spot.
5561,Gabrielle,there.i think we're all done here.
5564,Gabrielle,"uh, depends.what have you heard?"
7613,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie! hey!"
7615,Gabrielle,"well, we needed some privacy. see, roy and i are lovers."
5569,Gabrielle,"and i need to know i'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with,not just some uterus in high heels."
7618,Gabrielle,that's for using your tongue.
5573,Gabrielle,so is that all she said?
5574,Gabrielle,"oh, bree,come on, dish already!"
5575,Gabrielle,hello. what's going on?
5576,Gabrielle,"oh, the slave.wow. looks well-fed."
7621,Gabrielle,"uh, you know, he's a handyman. he knows how to--get in there--and make stuff work."
5578,Gabrielle,are you nuts?!
7625,Gabrielle,"yeah, think about your son. people live up to the names they're given. if my parents hadn't named me ""gabrielle"", who knows if i'd be this pretty?"
7627,Gabrielle,"hey, sweetie."
5582,Gabrielle,"oh,hi.do you have to sit around all day?i mean,shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization while you have the chance?what are you doing?"
7636,Gabrielle,oh.
7639,Gabrielle,okay. bye.
7640,Gabrielle,the cops are coming. go.
5594,Gabrielle,mnh-mnh.hmm.
5598,Gabrielle,it's okay.glad you like it.you can brush my hair.
7647,Gabrielle,hello?
5600,Gabrielle,oh!
5603,Gabrielle,"oh, really?oh, of course you can stay!oh!"
5604,Gabrielle,"carlos,she thinks of us as family."
7656,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, we're never gonna have kids. shoes are my kids. let me be the mother i was meant to be."
5611,Gabrielle,"yeah,we're just sick about it."
5614,Gabrielle,"okay,mom,put these away!"
7664,Gabrielle,"carlos, are you almost ready? carlos? did you hear me?"
7668,Gabrielle,"well ,not as dangerous as poverty!"
7670,Gabrielle,that's the closet!
7676,Gabrielle,look at this mess! you are lucky i got in here before you touched my dresses!
7677,Gabrielle,my vera wang?!
7679,Gabrielle,"oh, i think we're gonna need the next size up."
7680,Gabrielle,she's only 4 1/2.
5633,Gabrielle,generous?don't you see the strings attached?
7682,Gabrielle,"juanita, take off the dress! we're going."
5636,Gabrielle,it wouldn't have done any good.
5638,Gabrielle,"because if i did,then she, we--because--there was a chance she wouldn't have believed me,and--and that would've hurt a lot worse than anything he ever did to me."
5640,Gabrielle,so? how did it go?
5641,Gabrielle,ah.
5647,Gabrielle,she barely mentioned it.
5648,Gabrielle,"oh,bree, she didn't trash you. honest."
5662,Gabrielle,"well,then we'll just have to find someone who can do it for us."
5664,Gabrielle,"keeping that in mind,would it also be okay if we were your kids' godparents?"
5665,Gabrielle,"great,and can we take some fake pictures to document it?"
5666,Gabrielle,"well,as long as they don't make me play guitar,i think we're home free."
5667,Gabrielle,mm-hmm. yes.
7712,Gabrielle,"he's got a bum hip. he's also missing a testicle. carlos, how much more of this am i supposed to take?"
7713,Gabrielle,no! that's only part of the problem. have you checked our bank balance lately?
7714,Gabrielle,why not? you'd be massaging rich people. they tip better and they tend to flake less.
7715,Gabrielle,"carlos, i don't need to spend lots of time with you. and frankly, the kids are on the fence."
7721,Gabrielle,"she called us ""staff""?"
7722,Gabrielle,"no! it's not just one party! it's the kickoff to the whole social season. if people see we're off michelle's list, then we'll be off everyone's. and then it's gonna be the start of our slow slide from gowns and galas to flip-flops and keggers! okay, if carlos working at the club is the problem, then tell her he just quit."
5677,Gabrielle,"$20,000.is that proof enough for you?"
7726,Gabrielle,"bree! shouldn't you be in the kitchen? don't move, honey. the press is taking your photo."
5679,Gabrielle,"$20,000.00"
5680,Gabrielle,"carlos, come on!they're here!"
7735,Gabrielle,"that was the matre d', wasn't it?"
7737,Gabrielle,right.
5695,Gabrielle,"oh, it's actually pronounced solis."
7745,Gabrielle,are you serious?
5700,Gabrielle,why?i thought they always annoyedthe heck out of each other.
5701,Gabrielle,what is it?
7748,Gabrielle,"okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds. by the time someone says, ""wow, a ding,"" you're in the next county."
7754,Gabrielle,"okay, just let me handle this."
7755,Gabrielle,"i don't know, andrew. i mean--we like it. we don't love it."
7757,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what. since your mom and i are dear friends, i'll take it off your hands if you knock off $ 300."
7758,Gabrielle,"andrew! unless you lower this price, we're walking--right now."
5712,Gabrielle,you like jewelry?
5714,Gabrielle,"honey,the one in the center is 3 karats."
7762,Gabrielle,wh--will you at least have it washed?
5716,Gabrielle,"well,like they say,there's no such thing as a free lunch."
5719,Gabrielle,"you never gave a crap that we were mexican,did you?"
7773,Gabrielle,wow. i'm sorry. i'll talk to her.
5734,Gabrielle,"there is nothing to work out.if frank is not on board with this,it's over."
5736,Gabrielle,you think this is funny?
7785,Gabrielle,you attacked my child and then me. why should i even listen to you?
7787,Gabrielle,"well, what do you expect?"
7793,Gabrielle,today doesn't count. today i was mad.
7795,Gabrielle,to susan mayer--good mom.
7796,Gabrielle,so?! there's waffles in the freezer! and get mommy some ice!
7798,Gabrielle,"that's it? no compassion? no, ""hey, let's split the bill and call it even""?"
5752,Gabrielle,"wait,what is she saying?"
7801,Gabrielle,"i am tired of being a victim, andrew. and trust me, that is no bluff."
5754,Gabrielle,taking our baby home.
7802,Gabrielle,"luckily, i'm insured. oh, wait. our policy lapsed. hope you've got good coverage."
7806,Gabrielle,you have a marketing plan. you wanna see my marketing plan?
5760,Gabrielle,here.we're good to go.give me the baby.
7809,Gabrielle,that little weirdo is the key to you and i having more sex.
7812,Gabrielle,"wake up! playdates were invented by mothers for this exact purpose. shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--playdates make all these things possible."
7814,Gabrielle,"okay, i dropped off celia at preschool, and juanita's at her playdate. drop trou."
7815,Gabrielle,"can i ask why? i mean, you can't see it."
5771,Gabrielle,put down the burrito.what is all this crap about me not getting help?
5773,Gabrielle,"and that's what put her in an early grave!well,that and the hit-and-run thing."
5775,Gabrielle,what about my sleep?
7823,Gabrielle,we were wrestling. wrestling.
7828,Gabrielle,"carlos, if she was standing there any longer than five minutes, there was nothing natural about what she saw."
5782,Gabrielle,"ahh.oh,and xiao-mei,mr. solis does not need to know about this,okay?"
5784,Gabrielle,"yeah,honey,can you take that downstairs?thank you."
5785,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?
7838,Gabrielle,not if she wants to see her favorite dolly alive.
7840,Gabrielle,so--next playdate's monday at 1:00?
5793,Gabrielle,"ooh,i'll have a drink.anything with an umbrella."
7841,Gabrielle,"yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign. your martini was as dry as the ad campaign. let it go."
5798,Gabrielle,"lily?lily,mommy's coming!"
5799,Gabrielle,"oh,thank god!oh,honey,i'm so sorry.i'm never gonna leave you again. oh!yes. yes."
5804,Gabrielle,"look, i think we all know that karl is a dog.mm.i mean, but let's face it--if these tramps weren't laying out the buffet,he wouldn't be chowing down."
5815,Gabrielle,"okay, no, no!wait, what about a car?or college?tuition's a killer these days.i could help you out."
5823,Gabrielle,"oh, yes."
7875,Gabrielle,you know what's gonna tear me apart? another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.
7877,Gabrielle,"whoo-hoo! halle-damn-lujah, i got my period! oh, was she surprised?"
7878,Gabrielle,i don't know. but you would have if i hadn't started my period. how could you have done this?
5831,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, ma'am,you don't understand.you don't understand,this is our baby!"
7883,Gabrielle,"i'm about to go get groceries. where are your tips? oh, my god! how did you get so much?"
5842,Gabrielle,"oh,my--this can't be happening."
5846,Gabrielle,"uh,xiao-mei?we spoke to homeland security,and we have good news!"
5848,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
5852,Gabrielle,"okay,uh-- well--okay,it's like this--the three of us are making your famous szechuan dumplings,and i'm the dough,and carlos is the pork,and you're the oven."
5858,Gabrielle,wait.are you a virgin?
7906,Gabrielle,"i am gabrielle solis. perhaps you know my husband? he ""rubs"" your boss. where are they?"
7907,Gabrielle,"fine. when the cops bust up this brothel, i'm gonna tell them you're the madame."
7909,Gabrielle,"i know about--the big ""o."""
5862,Gabrielle,"honey,why aren't you dressed yet?we have to be at the fertility clinic in 40 minutes!"
7911,Gabrielle,maybe a little too much.
7913,Gabrielle,lucky you.
5867,Gabrielle,yeah. i wouldn't just slam her for no reason.
5869,Gabrielle,susan?we've all been talking.we've decided you and julie should stay with bree.
7917,Gabrielle,"oh, lap of luxury, how i've missed sitting in you."
7921,Gabrielle,"carlos, just nod your head, 'cause i ain't leaving this pool."
5877,Gabrielle,absolutely. you have nothing to worry about here.
5881,Gabrielle,"oh, well,i'm sorry to hear that.so, uh, did you move my beauty products?they're not in the bathroom."
7929,Gabrielle,"no, we're good."
7934,Gabrielle,"gee, i don't know. i can't really see the screen anymore."
5887,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, what are you doing in our bed?"
7935,Gabrielle,"oh, that's okay."
5893,Gabrielle,ow! stop kicking me.
5894,Gabrielle,"yeah, in a twin?good luck.god, i want my bed back."
7942,Gabrielle,"yeah, and that's why we're leaving."
5897,Gabrielle,"oven, carlos. the oven.a well-cared-for,well-paid oven."
7948,Gabrielle,"well, she's a little busy with her friends right now, so just give it to me, and i'll make sure she gets it."
5902,Gabrielle,"from the second xiao-mei got pregnant,you have found a million and one ways to tell me that that baby is more important to you than me."
5904,Gabrielle,"honey, look. i bought us matching golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow."
7953,Gabrielle,in three days. that's the creepy part.
7954,Gabrielle,"yeah, too generous. it's like you're trying to buy us or something. well, we're not for sale, so just back off!"
5910,Gabrielle,that is so true.
7960,Gabrielle,"family?! lady, you had carlos fired."
5913,Gabrielle,"carlos is dead, xiao-mei."
7962,Gabrielle,"save your breath, carlos. there is no way we're letting grandma screw-loose back into our lives."
5916,Gabrielle,"honey, they didn't know all the details, but a witness said that they saw you run into the carpool lane to pick up a lawn chair that had fallen off some truck, and then a bus hit you right in front of the road crew.why aren't you at the road crew?"
7964,Gabrielle,i don't care.
7967,Gabrielle,"okay, girls, mommy's leaving. i love you!"
5923,Gabrielle,"honey, uh, i think it's time to unpack the pants."
7973,Gabrielle,don't talk like that. you want a cheeseburger or something?
5926,Gabrielle,you don't wanna have sex with me?you always wanna have sex with me.you wanted to have sex with me an hour after your hernia operation.
7975,Gabrielle,"virginia, they're happy where they are. they love fairview. besides, greenbrier's, like, an hour away."
5929,Gabrielle,"i know.it's just you said, ""kill,"" not ""dead."" and i'd have to do be pretty angry to kill someone, so i guess my question is, do i have a reason to be angry at mr. solis?"
5934,Gabrielle,"carlos, you promised you'd come home today.well, i don't care what tanaka wants!rattling around this stupid house all by myself is not what i signed up for!no, no, no, don't hang up on me.i'm not done yelling at you!"
7984,Gabrielle,"come on. let's get you out of here. let's go. hey, since i'm saving your life and all, you wanna think about maybe keeping us in your will?"
5941,Gabrielle,"the only reason i did this was because i was angry at carlos.now, thanks to you, i'm not angry anymore."
5942,Gabrielle,oh. i seriously doubt that.
7989,Gabrielle,that's fantastic!
7990,Gabrielle,oh!
7996,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, do you think i could pull this off?"
7997,Gabrielle,you gonna start that crap again?
5950,Gabrielle,are you done with my husband?
8000,Gabrielle,"yes. not all fish is shaped like a stick. now i know you're not used to it, but give it a try. you're gonna love it. mmm. yummy."
8004,Gabrielle,you got a lot of nerve. part of the reason i'm on this diet is because carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat! and you with the head-- you ruined me! so this is how it's gonna go down. you're going to eat this with mommy and you're gonna like it. got it? thank you.
8006,Gabrielle,huh. huh.
5968,Gabrielle,"what's the occasion?bree: oh, um, no occasion.just a little get together."
8017,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i know you're really excited to see christmas decorations again, but--i just want you to be prepared because--well, some of those lights may have lost their luster."
8019,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's when you thought you were gonna be blind forever. but if this operation works, i just don't want you to be disappointed."
8020,Gabrielle,first time you saw me on the runway.
8021,Gabrielle,"mmm, i remember that place."
5976,Gabrielle,hey!quick question.have you by any chance seen xiao mei?
8024,Gabrielle,that's it?
8026,Gabrielle,"carlos, that's the doctor. i'm right here."
5981,Gabrielle,"it was banter!i mean, has this country come to the point where you can't joke with the help?"
8031,Gabrielle,"uh, carlos, i think it's time to put your eyedrops in. why don't you go do that?"
5984,Gabrielle,"i'm just dropping off carlos now and i'll be by to pick her up.okay, thanks edie. xiao mei's fine.crisis averted, no harm, no foul."
8033,Gabrielle,"the car needed tires. how was i supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back? i mean, of all the rotten luck."
5987,Gabrielle,xiao mei is going to be fine!once that baby comes her slate is going to be wiped clean.she's going to walk away and live her american dream!me?i'm going to be stuck!a single mother raising a child alone.haggling with lawyers over who gets the kid at christmas.my american dream is officially dead.
8038,Gabrielle,what? what's he saying?
6000,Gabrielle,you know what the doctor said. you should see his cholesterol. this man bleeds bacon grease.
6002,Gabrielle,hey. you are supposed to be on bed rest!
6003,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants? that should kill a couple of hours."
8056,Gabrielle,it's beautiful. where'd it come from?
6009,Gabrielle,yeah. that's our wedding present to bree.
6010,Gabrielle,"well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?"
8058,Gabrielle,you were blind and depressed. i didn't wanna add to it.
6012,Gabrielle,"oh my god, what are we going to do?"
8060,Gabrielle,that's wonderful! oh!
8061,Gabrielle,wow! neat! why don't you guys go wash your hands for lunch?
6015,Gabrielle,"she's got glaucoma. to her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur. let me fix your tie."
8069,Gabrielle,"good, good. i don't know if you heard-carlos got his sight back."
6022,Gabrielle,"okay, here's the drill. my ex is here and i want to piss him off so just act like you're all hot for me and there's a hundred buck tip in it for you."
8072,Gabrielle,i don't know. i-i can't speak for carlos.
6026,Gabrielle,who the hell are you anyway? and why the hell are you at this wedding?
6033,Gabrielle,now look what you've done!
8086,Gabrielle,was it lou?
6039,Gabrielle,lynette! carlos will never be fair game! you know the rules!
6043,Gabrielle,"because some marriages were built to last. and some aren't. trust me, i know the difference."
6044,Gabrielle,it's time! i can't believe this is happening!
6050,Gabrielle,well.
8099,Gabrielle,"um, honey, bradley's right. you could take this job and do your charity work in your free time."
6052,Gabrielle,what's that?
6058,Gabrielle,yeah?
6065,Gabrielle,"what is this, freakin' noah's ark?!"
8113,Gabrielle,"juanita, it's time for your bath."
6075,Gabrielle,"ooh, i like rich john!"
6081,Gabrielle,"no, i'm not going anywhere. in fact, i wanna meet the blushing bride."
8131,Gabrielle,"well, unfortunately, they're not afraid of me."
6084,Gabrielle,"me, too.do you wanna sit down? you know, you're pretty hard to stay mad at."
8136,Gabrielle,if you wouldn't mind.
8139,Gabrielle,really?
8140,Gabrielle,"well, i wouldn't have to if you would do it."
8143,Gabrielle,"wow! jimmy choo! oh, carlos! these aren't even in the states yet. what's the catch?"
6104,Gabrielle,no! but i would hire someone to beat the crap out of him.
8159,Gabrielle,"no, no, it's cute. it's cute. i get that. it's just-- i was a top-tier fashion model, and i guess i'm just gonna have to get used to the fact that the best part of my life is behind me. good-bye doi vod shots with kate moss, and hello to sipping international coffee with you girls. full house."
8164,Gabrielle,what?
6123,Gabrielle,"that's too bad, because i don't love you."
6124,Gabrielle,i don't. and i haven't for a very long time.
8177,Gabrielle,hey. you coming back in?
8178,Gabrielle,eli would've liked it.
8182,Gabrielle,"yikes. that's, like, a half a step away from selling your eggs on the internet."
8184,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's great! oh, why didn't you tell me this when you were begging for sex this morning? you would've closed that deal, too. we're rich again! hallelujah!"
8186,Gabrielle,have you not noticed me working my butt off? i'm almost back to the weight i was when we got married!
8188,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't get it! i'm only a few pounds away from my runway weight."
6141,Gabrielle,"thank you. carlos. carlos, this is my new friend phil lopez."
8191,Gabrielle,"now don't forget, the clasp is broken."
