14517,Susan,"i haven't heard back, and i was getting a little concerned. the girls and i were talking, and, we think that maybe paul young killed mrs. huber, and if he did, then maybe he killed your old girlfriend, too, so we should really talk about this, so call me. i love you. bye."
14492,Susan,"i appreciate what you guys are trying to do, i really do. um, i'm not gonna change my mind. in my life, i've been hurt a lot, karl, and uh, well, it's just taught me to be cynical, and to expect the absolute worst from people, and i don't want to live like that anymore, and when mike asked me to move in with him, i was just happy, just ridiculously happy. i mean, i still am and i want to go with that feeling. i love him and i love him! so i'm gonna expect the best from mike, and i know that he is gonna deliver that in return. okay?"
14300,Susan,"wow, i'm just dragging today, shall we put on another pot of coffee?"

16067,Susan,i wish. my cooking is not good.
18295,Susan,"hey, katherine, is mike here?"

15103,Susan,it's my mental health.my mental health!you took an oath.
14566,Susan,"we're not. it's a deterrent in case zach comes back. i told mike i didn't sleep last night, so he got me this sign. that guy is so supportive. you know he's out right now in a ride-along with the police searching for zach?"
17695,Susan,i don't believe so. although i may have blacked out after she told me you were 40. so how does a man your age get married and divorced three times?
15836,Susan,"ian, can you please hurry?"
17883,Susan,"hey, i was single for several months after karl and after mike."
15234,Susan,karl--
14081,Susan,i am so sorry! is everyone okay?
17884,Susan,"have you ever looked in your mirror, edie? you're famous for the number of men you've conquered."

15236,Susan,what are we gonna do about edie?
15911,Susan,"oh, right. oh, i wish paul young was still around. he'd know what to do."
13780,Susan,"well, you see, this bird, um, flew in your bathroom window, and, i, tried to save it, but, uh, it died."

14255,Susan,"okay, i'll go out with you."
14598,Susan,"so naturally you'll be wanting to have a relationship with him, and that, that takes time, a lot of time."
14309,Susan,are you alright?
15032,Susan,"well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth."
15488,Susan,"get out of my house,you miserable son of a bitch!"
15172,Susan,"well, neither am i.i've got 35 years on that cow."
17825,Susan,oh!
16420,Susan,mike?
17977,Susan,"look, i know i said that m.j. was a star student, but the truth is, he's one of those kids that needs extra attention. the classes at his school are way too big, and i see him getting lost in the shuffle. and if he gets lost now--my ex-husband is doing everything that he can, and i need to know that i am, too. i will serve lunches. i will be a janitor. anything. but i am not walking out on my son's future."
14422,Susan,yes! that's my house!
17034,Susan,"well, i don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back later tonight."
13356,Susan,it's upset?

17010,Susan,i knew it. i'm so happy.
18149,Susan,yeah?
17128,Susan,"oh, no, don't get me wrong. i mean, i think it's great. you should grab love wherever you can find it. who cares if your friends think that you're paying for it?"
14925,Susan,you won?
17568,Susan,hi.
13371,Susan,what does this mean?
16028,Susan,is the coast clear? i don't wanna flash the help again.

18285,Susan,"well, uh, we wanted you two to be the first to know, and we should probably get going. got a few more neighbors to shock."
15549,Susan,gus? are you okay up there?
18281,Susan,not that lonely.
16031,Susan,"well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning."
17191,Susan,"it wasn't a claim. he was sitting right here without a stitch of clothing on, and i couldn't have cake."
14484,Susan,"um, i say, oh! hold that thought. edie, edie stop! stop! hang on."
18151,Susan,ed is married.
14914,Susan,why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?
17236,Susan,"no, i'm not finished with it. it's a lamaze class. i guarantee you i will not be the only woman in there holding a chimichanga. wow, it's all couples. i wish mike didn't have that rehab thing tonight."
17543,Susan,yeah. you know what i learned? mike is on his way over here to teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
15955,Susan,"i'm sorry. i know, julie picked a lousy time to rebel. i just can't fly off and ignore it."
18415,Susan,"oh, you did it again!"
17503,Susan,so your solution was to push him down? do you think that's nice? how would you feel if someone did that to you?
16691,Susan,"oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit."
17167,Susan,"no, katherine, i know what you've been going through emotionally, so you don't have to apologize. and by the way, your boob is out."
17211,Susan,"oh, i just can't control myself like that."
17603,Susan,um--no.
15618,Susan,hi.
16520,Susan,who was?

17257,Susan,did you have to tell karl about rehab?
16857,Susan,"okay, go."
13377,Susan,"no, this was serious, i know it was. we gotta find out what was going on."
15229,Susan,i didn't get married.
15764,Susan,this is your day. you can push the ceremony back an hour. now get that detective on the phone and talk things out with orson.
17759,Susan,"all things we can discuss when i knock her teeth out with a pool cue. you know, it's sad when you can't trust a friend. or maybe the lesson here is that she wasn't really a friend to begin with then."
14069,Susan,"oh, poor lynette. she doesn't get a new nanny soon, she's gonna implode."
17874,Susan,i don't know. i'm not sure. what are you doing?
14283,Susan,"yeah, you know, it's the third time around for both of you, and you're really clicking. it gives me hope."

13349,Susan,"well, i've got one."
13665,Susan,"hey, paul."
17816,Susan,no. i'm good.
17250,Susan,"cause i knew you'd make us switch to another class. last time i was here, karl kept throwing his perfect life in my face, and i just wanted to come back here and--"
15401,Susan,"hey,edie.what's all this stuff for?"
14359,Susan,"mom, i'm sorry. i'm just not in the mood to hang out these days."
14618,Susan,"what do you mean, you know?"
13671,Susan,"no, but i can tell you this much. he's not staying with relatives."
18183,Susan,i need four words.
15996,Susan,mike--you're out of the hospital.
16999,Susan,"oh, honey. you'd be surprised how fast the best schools fill up. and only the best for our kid, right?"
16776,Susan,why?
16366,Susan,oh. okay.
14519,Susan,"i am so sorry for that last phone call. um, let's just say it was the worry talking. i just really need to talk to you, and-"
13704,Susan,are you finished?
15076,Susan,"oh, sorry!are you okay?"
15158,Susan,oh. so why are we dating?
16063,Susan,"absolutely. so, i assume this means they know about me?"
16756,Susan,"oh, yum."
13815,Susan,"gabrielle, he's in high school, and, it's illegal, and you're married. if carlos found out, this would kill him."
15339,Susan,i don't even know a mike.
13376,Susan,"it doesn't matter, she was his wife. he deserves to have all the facts."
16575,Susan,"oh. hey--mike. um, listen, i know your cell phone's off, but i--i wanted you to know that i followed you up to the hot springs, and--now i'm lost. you know, in the off chance that i get devoured by a mountain lion, i--i just wanted you to know that, um--i love you. i've always loved you. and i don't want any more drama. and if you take me back, i promise there won't be. unless i get eaten by a mountain lion, and, you know, that'll be dramatic, but it won't be my fault. anyway, um--i hope it's not too late, but if it is, i just--i just want you to know that i am so, so--"
13712,Susan,could you give it a shot?
16184,Susan,"don't say ""uh-huh"" like that.julie wouldn't lie to me.if she says she's not having sex,then she's not having sex."
14800,Susan,you should have just come clean.
16973,Susan,"great. uh, diabetes?"
15330,Susan,super-duper.how you feeling?
16235,Susan,hi.
18283,Susan,monday.
17173,Susan,"i don't want to hear this. i'm done with both of you. if anybody needs me, i'll be at the mall--buying sheets."
16320,Susan,"no, karl's alive and kicking, sadly."
14252,Susan,"bill, um, i have my reasons."
13757,Susan,"of course, of course, yes. so, maybe we should make reservations, you know, just in case."
13897,Susan,"well, please. just come on in. uh, mike, i don't think you've officially met my ex, karl mayer."
17734,Susan,how you feeling? i just gave blood.
17814,Susan,did we?
14639,Susan,"uh, betty? betty? oh, betty, can i ask you a question?"
13321,Susan,"sure, that's fine."
14375,Susan,yes! it is!
18383,Susan,keys. keys--
16897,Susan,do you like wine?
17502,Susan,never mind. what did you do to m.j.?
15029,Susan,"okay, i didn't exactly love what i found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge."
14294,Susan,"okay, look; i'm just saying i don't think morty cheated on you."
15215,Susan,"i need health insurance,um, 'cause i've got this wandering spleen and--that sounds funny,""spleen wandering,"" but--actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things--so i need health insurance,so i'm getting married tomorrow.and you probably think i'm crazy, right?"
18273,Susan,"oh, just leave the toilet seat up, and the immigration people will totally think we're married."
15894,Susan,"damn straight! you lie, you cheat, you scheme! you ruin people's relationships! i mean, how do you sleep at night?"
17407,Susan,not here. go home. i'll call you.
16544,Susan,"come on. just for my peace of mind, i have to know he's okay."
17472,Susan,"well, those last few months we were together, i--the things i said to you, the way i acted--i mean, i'm not proud of the person i became."
13822,Susan,because he has money. a lot of it.
16870,Susan,"yeah! i-i wanted to scream. you know, are you nuts? do you just wanna jinx it?"
18128,Susan,why?
17023,Susan,yeah.
18043,Susan,i didn't. i didn't.
17584,Susan,"oh, please. telling me i smell good? i'm not even wearing deodorant."
17109,Susan,"oh, yeah. every cup needs a coaster. every coaster needs a doily. every doily needs daily laundering. this woman is gonna drive me out of my freakin' hey, roomies. you need help?"
15088,Susan,"so i swerved to avoid hitting his car,and i hit this parked car instead,and that's when the trunk popped open,and when we got out, we found this dead body and--"
18161,Susan,"you know, karl would never cheat, and the woman he was with-- brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday."
14333,Susan,absolutely.
17620,Susan,"not so much. frank, how can i call him? he's the one that ended it with me."
18044,Susan,"hey, katherine."
16332,Susan,you mean a prenup?
15152,Susan,yeah.sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous.
16087,Susan,what?
14368,Susan,you've been married four times.
14298,Susan,ante up.
16894,Susan,i'm not seeing any nuts.
14790,Susan,where's jeannie?
17358,Susan,mm. maynard. let's hope he's worthy.
18299,Susan,"and then i realized that i would lose my alimony. so unless mike will keep paying me, i can't get married."
13323,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
16176,Susan,why were you two talking about condoms?
17479,Susan,and your shirt is ripped. that's the second time this week. is someone picking on you? who is it?
17921,Susan,what--do--you--know?
16102,Susan,her teeth were pulled. you don't think that's worth telling the cops she was messing around with a dentist?
18258,Susan,finish what?
13553,Susan,"and when i realised i couldn't put out the fire, i ran. i must have dropped the measuring jug in the process."
16032,Susan,"oh, no, don't do that. that'll just make it worse. i get it. he loved jane. he doesn't know me. you know, i'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little."
16826,Susan,aw! you have to come. you're the best charades player i know.
14067,Susan,so we still on for tomorrow night?
15189,Susan,edie!
17214,Susan,since when?
13994,Susan,are you okay?
17748,Susan,you are still beautiful. so you've gained a little weight. who hasn't? don't go by me. i have a weird metabolism.
13922,Susan,what?
15750,Susan,"that's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?"
14439,Susan,did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?
13510,Susan,"oh, maybe until noon. then i'm going to have to run over there and beg him to love me ."
16648,Susan,you do?
13387,Susan,"no, it's fine, i get it."
13656,Susan,i'm not mad at you. i mean i'm not just mad at you-i'm mostly mad at myself.
17224,Susan,you are never to come near my family ever again! do you understand?
17951,Susan,"well, we've gotta do something. my editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves. could you pick up some extra shifts?"
16122,Susan,i am not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
16117,Susan,you would do that for mike?
18274,Susan,"actually, i did think of one way you could repay me."
14115,Susan,"well, i'm adorable crazy, and he's rampage crazy."
17903,Susan,"uh, no, nothing's wrong. just--we need to talk about this move."
16108,Susan,"and if you take orson back, you do the same."
14896,Susan,"you're, like, the first fourteen chapters."
15406,Susan,edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
16232,Susan,jane cheated on ian? when was this?
14974,Susan,why?
17907,Susan,so--is she in?
16889,Susan,"well, maybe."
18239,Susan,"yeah, and a total shark. the worst thing about our divorce was that i couldn't hire him to represent me."
14165,Susan,"oh, edie, not now. i'm kind of busy."
16270,Susan,"i hadn't really thought a lot about this moment,but when i did--the table we were at didn't have a blood gutter."
16714,Susan,"listen,um.maybe this isn't-"
14387,Susan,"well, you just threw rocks in her mother's face. how's that for a start?"
15375,Susan,okay.
16742,Susan,"adam,i have no idea what you're talking about."
17097,Susan,"no. there's no tomorrow. it's now. you will quit this now. you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you. i will take this baby, and i will leave you."
15033,Susan,"oh, so you want me to catch it for you? i mean, you, yourself, said she's crazy. i don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed."
17624,Susan,are we ok?
15910,Susan,ahh. that's nice. so where were we?
14046,Susan,"oh, of course. i assumed as much."
17121,Susan,"that is not enough time. she just started stenciling the kitchen, and i didn't want to tell you this, but there is talk of an herb garden. i've gotta stop her."
17506,Susan,"okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked."
18300,Susan,canada.
17454,Susan,so you just happened to stumble across my secret turn-on the same night that you and mike became b.f.f.s?
14458,Susan,i don't believe it.
16491,Susan,"yeah, and i'm about to do this on purpose, too."
14293,Susan,"well, that's because you tell people that."
13805,Susan,"julie, you'll never guess who you got a letter from. zach. isn't that weird, him writing you?"
14595,Susan,"so it occurred to me that i was really rude at the morgue. when you told me about zach, i was so busy freaking out, i never actually congratulated you."
14425,Susan,"don't worry, we will be."
14660,Susan,"edie, for god's sake. why would i care if you end up with a man i despise?"
17089,Susan,"mike, stop!"
14033,Susan,what's paul doing here?
15221,Susan,cancer?
17711,Susan,"oh, i just love this song. and jackson doesn't like to dance, so--isn't this fun?"
16104,Susan,"if you're so sure that orson is innocent, why don't we go through his things? where's his desk?"
16635,Susan,right. yeah.
18021,Susan,"oh, yeah. i'm so excited. you got my rsvp, right?"
15600,Susan,"hey.you know,i am not even tired.so-- why don't i stay up and help you?"
14419,Susan,so you mean you and john have still been?
18236,Susan,"oh, not necessarily. i hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly."
17652,Susan,what's my least favorite word?
16513,Susan,what? i thought you said she was with victor.
13357,Susan,oh.
13676,Susan,just for a couple of hours.
14560,Susan,okay.
14140,Susan,no.
17289,Susan,what are you gonna do?
14675,Susan,"well, i have a court order. it's out of my hands."
15568,Susan,who would wanna burn down my house?
17910,Susan,we're getting a wreath for eli's funeral. are you in?
13456,Susan,what cabin?
18399,Susan,try not to scare m.j. when you bring him here.
16123,Susan,bree let orson move back in.
17085,Susan,it's okay.
17029,Susan,"i did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced? and if you do, you're grounded."
14518,Susan,"i thought the whole point of having a cell phone was so someone could reach you when they needed to talk. how can we move forward as a couple if you won't communicate with me? mike, i need you to call me back! i mean it! love you. bye."
13462,Susan,no.
17993,Susan,yeah. come on in.
16023,Susan,who are you?
17669,Susan,right! what time is it?
16750,Susan,"oh, my god. katherine."
15366,Susan,ah! ooh!
15489,Susan,"no,just get out!get out!"
18346,Susan,"well, don't be mad at katherine. we all know that she just can't-- keep a secret."
15740,Susan,did i squeeze too hard?
16462,Susan,no. it--it was days ago.
17817,Susan,"i'm sorry. if you're interested, i have dirt on bree."
17505,Susan,"i'm sorry. juanita, i just wanted you to see how it felt. are you okay?"
16786,Susan,"can you believe it? ugh! let it go. you know, mike and i decided--no party, and that's final."
15509,Susan,"uh-- well, um--then i should just go and let you get started with that."
17922,Susan,i didn't.
16370,Susan,i can feel the car sinking. we're gonna have to get to shore.
16170,Susan,"well, i'm saying it now.i love you. do you have a problem with that? no, ma'am."
18275,Susan,"uh, no. not like that. no, i was thinking that after our quickie courthouse ceremony, you could buy me a cake. i love wedding cake. it's the one part of marriage that never lets you down."
16667,Susan,"mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features. now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top."
16625,Susan,i got you a blender for christmas.
18003,Susan,but we can make brownies at home.
13945,Susan,"oh, well, in that case, come on in. i'm not doing anything."
15440,Susan,a little?ugh--the helium hasn't even gone out of the balloons from your engagement party.
15123,Susan,i should switch to juice.i know the best juice place.you would love it.do you drink juice?
15848,Susan,"oh, god! it's so wonderful to hear your voice again."
15902,Susan,"oh, uh, they're moving along. it's a process."
17445,Susan,"he could take me to court, and the judge can make me choose between you and my son. and i'm sorry. you will lose."
18166,Susan,"three weeks later, i found brandi's bra in karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest."
17849,Susan,"'cause you were mad at bob, and i told you about how i sometimes sabotage my relationships."
17044,Susan,"oh, please, call me ""mom"". uh, because--that's what all the kids call me."
14006,Susan,thank you.
14735,Susan,what?
14737,Susan,"whoa. no, no no. no, no no, oh. don't, don't, don't. don't, don't, zach, don't run away. wait! come on, just, would you just get back here? come on really, just, let's just talk."
15045,Susan,"well, let me see. painting in the rain or letting the whole world think i'm a whore? i don't know. what do you think?"
16659,Susan,"gaby, bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet."
15037,Susan,"no, wait! wait! it's not what you think!"
14512,Susan,bree.
15651,Susan,"oh, did i say that?"
15969,Susan,"let julie go and take me instead. repeat, take me. i will be a model hostage. if we have a deal, signal by sending julie to the--"
16282,Susan,"ian! ian, you're not gonna believe this. bree just told me she can prove mike's innocent."
14489,Susan,"look, i feel really bad about deirdre, and i know that you must want to find out who killed her, but if we're gonna move in together, we can't have this stuff hanging over us. you've gotta get rid of it. all of it: the file, the map, the gun, especially the gun and leave this to the police. they're the professionals."
14769,Susan,who else is using that word?
18322,Susan,he'll be fine.
15355,Susan,what?
13496,Susan,"okay, you have got to know that i only get that angry around karl. he just treated me so badly at the end, i-i haven't been able to get past it."
16844,Susan,"gaby! sorry i'm late. oh, my god! you made it. that is such a beautiful dress. we're gonna have so much fun. you--come with me."
18315,Susan,"hey, dave. i was gonna call you."
17494,Susan,thank you.
16473,Susan,"oh, i saw the curtain move. i think i saw a hand."
15433,Susan,"oh,karl!oh! will you--are you crazy?!"
13558,Susan,"hey, that's right."
17428,Susan,it's not really a good time.
13769,Susan,why do you care so much?
15468,Susan,karl--uh-oh!
14190,Susan,"no, edie, this is our chance. we should just go in for ten minutes."
13625,Susan,so what's going on there?
17789,Susan,the whole thing's like a miracle.
15439,Susan,"oh,no!you don't mean that."
15574,Susan,letter? what letter?
14883,Susan,"oh. well, come on in."
16738,Susan,is that all you see in our eyes?
16494,Susan,say it!
17583,Susan,"i was not born yesterday, pal. you're coming on to me."
16880,Susan,"oh, you're partners. what kind of business? you know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house. they're so not cool."
16381,Susan,i don't think you can really thank somebody too many times for saving your life.
14988,Susan,hello!
17536,Susan,he does not love jackson more than you. he knows who his father is.
13563,Susan,"alright, back up a little more. there you go. wooo! alright, here we go."
14026,Susan,"well, i want to know that i am not the only one who is worried about this, and i want to know that if the two of them are over here, that they are going to be supervised, and i really want you to stop looking at me like i'm crazy."
16138,Susan,"detective ridley, my name is susan mayer, and i'm calling to ""drop a dime"" on someone. that's the expression, right?"
14958,Susan,"of course i am. i'm not gonna pretend like i'm not still a little freaked out. i am. but i did a lot of thinking about it this morning, and i, i think i understand. you wanted to protect me, and you thought i needed a hero. i had one. you."
16985,Susan,"i don't know. it just bothers me. i mean-- my god, mike. he's your dad."
17352,Susan,is that what it said?
16303,Susan,thanks.
17115,Susan,"oh, my god! i want to eat that."
16292,Susan,"oh, no. no one's saying smaller. no, that's crazy talk. rock me."
13582,Susan,"you're a piece of work , you know that?"
18124,Susan,"yeah, ""aw, hell."" you got a problem here, karl. your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on."
17152,Susan,"julie, dylan's here! study time! i'm-- sorry. that was probably a little louder than it needed to be."
17434,Susan,"oh, well, first off, um, m.j. was at a sleep over last night. and, in fact, jackson and he haven't even met, so, uh, there's really no need for you to be hanging--or checking."
18084,Susan,"i thought it was gonna rain. okay, um--i'm not gay."
14244,Susan,he just wants to buy me a burrito.
15127,Susan,i got high marks in math and science.
13932,Susan,you want to hear me sing?
14828,Susan,"no, don't come near me."
13913,Susan,"you're not mad, are you?"
16745,Susan,i'm pregnant?
15301,Susan,as opposed to the 12 i wasted on you?why are we talking about this?i don't recall asking you your opinion.
18218,Susan,right. i know that. i just was worried about a friend so i forgot. i'm sorry.
16722,Susan,"okay,before we go any further,can i check those diplomas?'cause i would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the philippines."
15964,Susan,"excuse me, my name is susan mayer."
14701,Susan,i'm busy now.
17101,Susan,"yes, yes, i do. i do. so i want you to go over to those paramedics, and i want you to let them look at these cuts. because you don't want to be all bloody when they pull your kids out of there, do you?"
15772,Susan,ian?
17314,Susan,"no, no, no, i love where this is going."
16203,Susan,"yeah, um--about that--god, i wish there was a pill you could take to protect your heart."
17343,Susan,"oh. uh--okay. i'm just gonna level with you. my husband picked the name, and i think it's horrible, and i know over time, he's gonna agree."
15584,Susan,"oh, okay."
17212,Susan,thanks. i'm gonna try that. so you don't think i act like a lady?
16171,Susan,you--you--you can't kiss me now. i'm yelling at you.
16746,Susan,he said i'm pregnant.
16815,Susan,please tell me this isn't gonna be one of those things where you leave me and i go screaming down the street.
15122,Susan,"yeah,but now that i think about it,i bet it's just all the coffee i drink.i drink way too much coffee.do you like to drink coffee?"
15167,Susan,"so this whole splenectomy thing--you feel good about it, huh?"
17362,Susan,"oh, my god. oh, my god! i'm so proud of you! okay, i am going to need a bumper sticker right away so i can start annoying all the other parents!"
14450,Susan,go.
17247,Susan,"oh, no, no, no, th-those are not the legs of a law professor."
17475,Susan,what are you doing here?
14912,Susan,we should not have done what we did.
13981,Susan,"well, you get to build your dream house, for free. i mean, in a weird way, your house burning down was really a good thing."
13606,Susan,yeah.sort of.
17210,Susan,really? not even when you heard an acoustic guitar?
15985,Susan,"yes, and i am grateful, but i found a way to say thank you without taking my top off."
17253,Susan,"hey, guys. mike, you remember karl? and this is karl's wife marisa."
17972,Susan,i didn't know they were fake.
16443,Susan,"you need to move on, okay?"
17544,Susan,i had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
13478,Susan,while you were married to someone else!
17111,Susan,sounds good to me!
14494,Susan,"okay, i'll keep it warm for you."
17154,Susan,mm. hmm. mm. tim! where's that milk?
14235,Susan,i was just wondering how you'd feel if i went out with bill.
16830,Susan,"honey, you know, i'm still in my first trimester. um, don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?"
14936,Susan,why?
17971,Susan,"okay, okay. point made. move along."
17606,Susan,"well, you really went all out."
13735,Susan,and i came here to ride the bull!
17643,Susan,sounds great. pick me up at 7:00.
17270,Susan,"oh, well, good. thank you."
13748,Susan,i hope she wakes soon. maybe she can tell us who was driving that car.
14540,Susan,what'd she say?
14040,Susan,i have a little confession to make.
13874,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
17414,Susan,"you know what, jackson? you're not gonna say anything i haven't already heard a million times. i-i only told you because i--i just want you to understand why i can't let you in my life."
17276,Susan,don't do that--mama.
14034,Susan,really?
15804,Susan,"okay, just so you know eleven is not a lot for a woman my age."
14074,Susan,"oh, i can't tell him. this could be a deal breaker. julie, i really love him. i don't want to lose him."
16763,Susan,"you know, the one that you left so suddenly for."
15671,Susan,"uh, mike, about that ring--"
17056,Susan,yeah. why?
16408,Susan,"well, you don't have to trust mike! you have to trust me, and you don't! that's what going to england's about, isn't it? you're just trying to get me away from mike. well, you know what? screw it. i'm not going. and if you ever bring up his name again, we're over. got it? over!"
17203,Susan,"well, if you insist--"
15019,Susan,uh-huh. what's up?
14527,Susan,"okay. hurry, though. i just have a feeling that paul young is in the middle of all of this."
13863,Susan,"i'm so sorry, i thought there was someone in the house."
16787,Susan,wait for it. wait for it. ta-da.
15340,Susan,"yes, everyone does know a mike.actually, you're right. i did know a mike in college.we did this play together, ""pippin."" it wasn't very good.anyways, i never thought of him,so you shouldn't be accusing me.i was probably just hallucinating."
14759,Susan,lonnie. what are you doing here?
13955,Susan,"oh god, no. karl, um, no, what i meant by wonderful was that i wondered inside if i still had feelings for you, if deep down i still loved you--"
14562,Susan,"oh, my god. so when can we see bree?"
16979,Susan,i just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.
17334,Susan,maynard.
16598,Susan,"yep! i promised people a wedding, and they are getting one."
17444,Susan,"jackson, please take this seriously."
14966,Susan,what do you mean?
17860,Susan,"i know it's sudden, but i feel really good about this. and it's only two hours away, so it'll still be like we're practically next door."
15791,Susan,"me, too. so was that, uh, okay?"
13783,Susan,"what? oh, i can explain."
18130,Susan,"i used to hope that one day, you would know what this feel like, and now that you do--i'm so sorry."
15392,Susan,yeah-- congratulations.what happened to waiting six months?
16636,Susan,what?
14879,Susan,"look, are you sure this is what you want to do? i mean, i understand that you don't want our relationship to continue, you have made that clear. but i sort of thought down the long corridors of time, maybe you and i could be friends, and if you keep acting like this--"
17228,Susan,"and the worst part--all this time, you pretended to be our friend."
15607,Susan,what?no!
15923,Susan,"but first, i think i should use the powder room."
14307,Susan,"well, you don't have a place to live. you don't like to work. i mean, you didn't want to marry morty, so he doesn't have to pay you alimony. i- i- it's just if you don't go back to this man who allegedly shoved you once in five years, what are your options?"
15065,Susan,i thought you'd be happy about it.i thought that's what you wanted.
15890,Susan,"yeah, now. look, you gotta understand. the doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up, and i just needed somebody to talk to.mike: and that's what you were doing in the country, talking?"
17708,Susan,no. why?
17439,Susan,"ah, no."
14515,Susan,"oh, i know. uh, i found mrs. huber's journal in some of mike's stuff, and i think she knew mary alice's secret and was blackmailing her."
15098,Susan,it was an accident.
13330,Susan,i can't believe you went over there.
18153,Susan,i can't forget something like this. helen is my very good friend.
17504,Susan,"oh, really? you don't think it would hurt?"
17435,Susan,"hey, hold on. you don't get to just decide these things by yourself."
16352,Susan,"ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like--i'm on probation?"
13488,Susan,pretty much.
13501,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not packing heat. hi."
15421,Susan,"no. no,of course not.and anything i can do to help--uh,you know,i would--i could help with the engagement party.how's that?"
17332,Susan,you sure? it's worth a phone call.
14460,Susan,"oh, hi. i'm looking for kendra taylor-"
15778,Susan,"so that's my number and if there's any change in mike's condition, i'm going to the mountains with a friend. and, ah, just in case you were wondering, it's strictly platonic."
17422,Susan,"it's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people."
13881,Susan,not well. she accused me of not being a good mother.
15281,Susan,have you seen bree since?
14378,Susan,what was that?
14869,Susan,"actually, i think i'm starting to feel pretty zen about the whole thing."
15471,Susan,i remember.i also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
14871,Susan,"over the past couple of days, i gave myself a long hard look in the mirror and i did not like what i saw."
14533,Susan,i'm just gonna go get some water.
15056,Susan,"i like 'em, very nice."
13882,Susan,"well, she was sort of right. after my divorce, i really leaned on her a lot."
17625,Susan,good. so who the hell are you?
14823,Susan,"i was just wondering if, if there's a ball park of how long i will have to wait. a week, a month, after lunch?"
14541,Susan,"can i at least get you something to eat, zach?"
13601,Susan,it's a shame. they used to be such a happy family.
17246,Susan,the only work i've had done was getting 185 pounds of ugly fat sucked out of my house.
14396,Susan,i won't . i promise.
17106,Susan,"come on, tom."
14678,Susan,i'm sorry. what?
14075,Susan,what if he doesn't?
17730,Susan,someone's coming!
15248,Susan,the night you abandoned me.
16279,Susan,"oh, my god. does this have something to do with orson's accident?"
16610,Susan,i wanna see those flowers.
17112,Susan,"well, i drove all the way out there, and i waited for hours and then they wouldn't let me see him. uh, no. they just said that i should--i should call you. listen, i know it's a 30-day rehab. i'm not trying to break him out. i'm just trying to see him. you know what? could you just call me when you know? thank you."
18154,Susan,"she is annoying, and i hide when she knocks on my door, she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage."
14611,Susan,you are forbidden from ever seeing her again. do you hear me? forbidden!
17826,Susan,"oh, i'll have what you're having."
13575,Susan,no! it's not like that.
15198,Susan,"well, what? i'm desperate here.do you have any other ideas?"
17861,Susan,edie!
14496,Susan,"no, no, i got it. um, i got it. so, if you've got a plumbing emergency, shouldn't you get going?"
16261,Susan,i'm the bimbo. he's my meat. all righty. i just wanted to clear that up. and now i'm going to go find myself a seat with a--better view.
17919,Susan,what do you mean?
16727,Susan,"i know.and you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who's.dry and dusty."
14969,Susan,oh?
16401,Susan,i don't want sell my house. everybody i love is on this street.
13683,Susan,pull up a chair.
15942,Susan,"well, a simple no, i didn't drink any beer' would've sufficed."
14363,Susan,"yeah, it can be rewarding."
18169,Susan,"oh, not now. we have a flat."
16593,Susan,you can't invite people to a wedding on the phone. you have to send a proper invitation. you want people to think i'm a complete flake?
14132,Susan,are you sure?
17009,Susan,"oh, thank god! you have no idea where my mind went."
16075,Susan,oh?
13526,Susan,"actually, i just had dinner."
13581,Susan,"again, i don't know what you're talking about. but- yeah, i did."
16340,Susan,"actually, no, it was gross. but you were really sweet. you just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry, i'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause--"
15403,Susan,"oh,cool. but that's not the surprise."
18316,Susan,"yeah, um. did you say something to m.j. about going on that fishing trip?"
15018,Susan,"actually, it was--fine."
15151,Susan,"oh, um, well, uh,julie's staying at her father's house,and, um, i'm all alone here."
15565,Susan,"oh, it's nice to meet you."
13655,Susan,i don't want to talk about it.
14721,Susan,"mike, wait!"
16825,Susan,sure is. can you come?
14845,Susan,come in!
14853,Susan,why don't we both stop getting divorced? that would be a nice family tradition.
18425,Susan,"well, i went over mike's to feed the dog."
18069,Susan,he decided to shack up with my best friend. and people wonder why i'm through with men.
13953,Susan,wow. just so we're clear. you want to move back in here and be faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?
15429,Susan,"no,no,no,no! it's not about what i want you to say.you have to want to say that you want to marry edie."
13407,Susan,zach? is your dad home? i need to talk to him.
15346,Susan,sure.
13584,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
15981,Susan,"wait, wait, wait, wait! are you kidding?! that's lobster! okay, i thought the restaurant was fantastic, and you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please."
17470,Susan,i'm just not comfortable with you and jackson getting that close.
16142,Susan,hello?
16238,Susan,"i'm gonna put the phone up to jane's ear, and you can tell her whatever you need to, okay?"
16505,Susan,"okay, fine, i loved him. i still love him, and i love ian. so i am totally, hopelessly in love with two men."
16719,Susan,"yeah.you know,one month off,two months on.that happens,right?"
13816,Susan,how can you call something like this harmless? after everything you know about what i went through with karl?
15741,Susan,"oh, oh, wow. oh, is this going to be awkward?"
16376,Susan,"look, there's somebody on the shore! it's mike! he's here."
18305,Susan,and unbelievably generous. i'm gonna send him a thank-you right now.
14437,Susan,"bye, morty."
18254,Susan,what is it?
14554,Susan,"uh, hello! uh, he was waiting there for you to come home so he could kill you."
14311,Susan,"no, no it's just banged a little."
17241,Susan,"he got his skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?"
17382,Susan,thanks. now i want you to have that phone on you at all times--because i'm still not sure how to work the dishwasher.
14176,Susan,okay. all right. give me a minute. i'll go change my clothes.
13320,Susan,"i don't know. i'm sorry you guys, i just-- i just don't know how i'm going to survive this."
18221,Susan,you're gonna feel really silly when you hear what it is.
15672,Susan,"stop it! oh, my--what are you--just stop it!oh, that's enough!just get off! get off! go! go!"
14201,Susan,you said he was going to be gone.
16144,Susan,it's orson's wife. she can't know i called you.
17013,Susan,"oh, but this isn't the same thing. mike wouldn't lie to me about this."
13770,Susan,"oh, of course."
15975,Susan,"we are. we're just gonna miss you, that's all."
14417,Susan,all i'm saying is that maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
17122,Susan,"i don't know, but i've had a taste of ironed pillowcases, and i am not going back."
13335,Susan,really?
17419,Susan,i meant a mechanic--not you.
14593,Susan,i see.
15526,Susan,how you doing?
17103,Susan,i'm just trying to comfort her.
14055,Susan,really.
16501,Susan,"can you imagine? i mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game. i mean, how demeaning is that?"
16439,Susan,"well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?"
17279,Susan,don't even know what they are.
15616,Susan,"okay, edie,i'm in trouble here."
17319,Susan,i am not naming my son after a quarterback.
15777,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in the mood to. thank you."
14058,Susan,no?
15972,Susan,right.
16657,Susan,yeah. i feel really good about this.
17138,Susan,i told them you weren't into jam.
16887,Susan,"well, yeah. i don't bake. catch up."
14144,Susan,"oh, god, you scared me."
16053,Susan,jane has some beautiful things.
13868,Susan,"listen, if paul sees zach and freaks out--"
15829,Susan,"oh, ian, i just took a week off. i couldn't possibly justify taking another."
17011,Susan,oh!
16487,Susan,"yes, and do you know who i blame? i blame karl and mike. why isn't anybody mad at them? i mean, let's face it. the men-- they get away with murder. they're scum!"
16222,Susan,"okay, i deserve the pimping remark, but let's not pretend that, you know, we're above teenagers. gaby, you're all i've got."
16708,Susan,"oh,my god.this is not little dylan.i'm susan,julie's mom.she is gonna be so excited to see you."
17915,Susan,"yard sale! good. you're here. how are you, eli?"
16274,Susan,"andrew, what are you doing at the hospital?"
15559,Susan,"i would've never even gone there if i had thought there was a chance with us.you just closed the door so completely,i--ugh,can we just not talk about him?have some more pie.i know you like pie.i know you like me.listen--i'm not asking for us to get back together.i just want us to be friends."
14238,Susan,"no. no, i wanted to check with you first."
17658,Susan,wow. so now you're painting--my bathroom?
13345,Susan,edie. what are you--?
15059,Susan,what kiss?
16617,Susan,excuse me?
15030,Susan,"oh, hi, alberta. how are you? were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets? i was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies. or i'll just borrow one from somebody else. thanks."
14523,Susan,"yes. let's call it stressed out. uh, so how did you get martha huber's journal?"
15418,Susan,"he's right.we behaved like children--naughty,stupid children."
18253,Susan,"i've only been working there two months, but i love it. and the kids are so cute. and i get to see m.j. during the day, which is nice. uh, you know, uh, for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you--you seem awfully far away."
16166,Susan,"well, that's just crazy! why are you acting like a crazy person?"
17731,Susan,hi!
13920,Susan,"well, you know what? you're going to come to julie's party tomorrow night, and you're gonna see karl and i together, and you're going to understand once and for all that i have no feelings for him whatsoever."
17215,Susan,"you could say ""au gratin"" when you were 3?"
14783,Susan,i don't know. what would you do if this happened to you?
14744,Susan,but-
17264,Susan,"oh, really? you guys live one day at a time? is your first thought when she's late that maybe she's out using again or maybe she's dead? it just seems like everything is so fragile right now, which is not the way you want it to be when you're about to have a baby."
17689,Susan,"you know, when your 24-year-old daughter calls you and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college, you sort of expect it to be, well, a boy."
18016,Susan,"no, not evil. devious. well, you know, i hate to tell you, but your big plan is not gonna work, 'cause from now on, m.j. is either at my house or mike's. he is no longer allowed to be here."
13583,Susan,"i will keep my lawn looking nice. and i will make sure that my music isn't playing too loud and if i get some of your mail. heck, i'll run it right over, because that's what good neighbours do. but from now on, when i run into you on the street and i say ""good morning, mrs huber"" or ""how are you, mrs huber"" just know that inside i am quietly but decidedly hating your guts."
13609,Susan,i'm sorry.
16215,Susan,what?
18106,Susan,"and now i'm ignoring you and moving on to evan. hello, evan."
17256,Susan,i know.
14826,Susan,"oh, my god. paul."
18170,Susan,we don't have time for this. anybody know how to change a tire?
17571,Susan,"yeah. it's great. uh, we'll be like--one big, happy, divorced family."
15558,Susan,"all right,you go ahead and be coy. fine.i'll be the one to break the ice.i've never stopped caring about you."
16229,Susan,"so, erika, you were fighting with that guy when i came in. have you had a lot of those organ donor people around today?"
14420,Susan,gabby!
15645,Susan,wow.
17255,Susan,just bananas.
14199,Susan,"we heard it on this tape that bree stole from her therapist's office. it's a long story. i'll tell you later. oh, we got to put this in."
17986,Susan,"i gotta go. you get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids, okay?"
13523,Susan,i love old movies!!
14372,Susan,"tim, can you just stay out of this?"
14990,Susan,"oh, okay."
14179,Susan,"maybe fifteen years ago. not anymore. now we're just lonely and desperate, and they know it, and they just sit there, ready to pounce, waiting for us to take any crumb they're willing to throw our way. i don't want crumbs. i want mike."
14536,Susan,why?
18030,Susan,i painted it. it was a gift for him.
13762,Susan,"no, it's fine, just give me the key. i'll be around all day."
14756,Susan,do you know what i think? i think you were right. i think you should try to find your father first.
17657,Susan,seriously?
14510,Susan,"oh, mary alice, what did you do?"
17633,Susan,"sorry, bad time. i have the mailman upstairs in my tub."
14987,Susan,mr. prudy. hello.
17309,Susan,"well, it happens."
15698,Susan,so you got the results of his latest mri yet?
13525,Susan,"oh, wow. why?"
14157,Susan,"i'm such an idiot! and you're such a liar! oh, and apparently a killer!"
15790,Susan,your heart is beating even faster than mine.
17795,Susan,hi.
16919,Susan,oh. i just wanted them to like me.
15583,Susan,mm.
17831,Susan,"well--i wanna be with him, so--i think i have to."
14247,Susan,"i can't believe edie. she doesn't have dibs on every man on the planet. if i want to go out with bill, i should be able to."
17823,Susan,come on.
18360,Susan,"hey, dave. glad i caught you. is your friend's boat still available this weekend?"
13567,Susan,"uh, yeah. um. julie and i are just out tossing the frisbee around and it flew off into mrs. huber's back yard."
17113,Susan,don't talk. i'm smelling. what is that?
15394,Susan,it was hysterical.i thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
14399,Susan,"aside from you nearly blinding me. several weeks ago you freaked out in my house: you screamed, you threw furniture around."
17792,Susan,"oh, looky there. lou gehrig."
15354,Susan,"because i panicked,okay?dr. ron hadn't come into see me since the operation and i was feeling insecure and--yes,go ahead.you may resume laughing."
14822,Susan,well. then i can wait. i can wait. i'm a good waiter.
15518,Susan,"oh, it's still a little red,but i think i got all the hot sauce out."
13927,Susan,what the hell is she doing here?
18297,Susan,"uh, well--okay, you know what? mike's probably gonna tell you anyway, so just don't tell anyone else, okay?"
16778,Susan,what are friends for?
17455,Susan,"this is-- i mean, i'm just--i have been violated."
17981,Susan,"m.j., why aren't you dressed? we're gonna be late for our first day of school."
17075,Susan,"fine. but you know, if i find out that you have given mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain i will inflict on you."
17201,Susan,"well, maybe it's because you just saw him. he must be on your mind."
13545,Susan,ring it up.
15691,Susan,"i know.but if you really do-- love me, you'll let me go."
15590,Susan,"yeah, he just heard about the fire and came over to help.we're friends."
14889,Susan,you finally saw her without her makeup?
15507,Susan,"oh.well, um, why don't we get you out of here?let's go see a feel-good movie."
17351,Susan,because my husband is terrified of balloons. he was once molested by a clown.
13504,Susan,thank you.
13695,Susan,i don't think that's a good idea either.
13898,Susan,"yeah, he is. so what do you want me to sign? oh, i see."
13871,Susan,here's the candles i borrowed. thanks.
14959,Susan,"well, i am screwed up, but it wasn't your fault. entirely."
18200,Susan,"you, too."
17676,Susan,"okay, i just ran into your house half-naked. the only thing you should be doing is me. what is on your face? is that paint? are you painting again?"
14793,Susan,i'm gonna ask you a question and i want you to tell me the truth. did you steal from me?
15628,Susan,but don't cross the street!just tell the neighbor that your mommy's stuck in a big truck!
15887,Susan,"well, yeah, i've been known to take a spill or two, but, you know, my doctor says it's an inner ear--wait, you remember that?"
13509,Susan,i'm trying a new strategy. i'm playing hard to get.
17794,Susan,or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months as most people do in a lifetime. ever think of that?
14583,Susan,you never asked me why zach wanted to shoot you. aren't you curious?
15814,Susan,get out!
14558,Susan,thanks.
13436,Susan,"oh, that's great."
13419,Susan,that is a beautiful rose. where did you get it?
17681,Susan,"that look on my face--i've seen before--in the mirror, when i'm feeling--how do you know about that look?"
17619,Susan,"it's susan. and he was the first one to say he didn't want to get serious, which is why i was happy. we were just having fun."
18419,Susan,is that blood?
15380,Susan,"well,he wasn't!and nowmy boyfriend is gone.thank you very much."
15223,Susan,is there a problem?
16284,Susan,here. i'm gonna go get bree some flowers. i'll be right back.
16572,Susan,you don't even know me. how dare you talk to me like that?
14122,Susan,how did you know?
14367,Susan,"mom! hold it! you are not getting in a car with those two, you hardly know them."
15775,Susan,i can't 'cause i have bridesmaid stuff.
16498,Susan,a very bad day.
14012,Susan,on my front lawn?
16984,Susan,"well, that's my point. when good people snap, they feel bad about it. your dad doesn't."
16407,Susan,"you're not actually--okay. that's it--i've had it. really, i can't have this conversation one more time. i've done nothing but prove my love to you for the last year and you cannot shut up about mike."
18095,Susan,"jessie, i-i am so sorry."
16055,Susan,"no, please, listen--the last couple of months, i thought we've gotten really close, and i have been loving that. i just feel like lately--there's this limit to how far you'll let me in."
17869,Susan,"please, help! please! i'm getting a really unpleasant picture of what you're like in the ol' sackarooni."
14784,Susan,will you stop judging and help me?
16165,Susan,but you had to know that i would go one more time to just explain everything.
16363,Susan,i saw you watching us.we were just talking.
17162,Susan,i've gotta go.
14304,Susan,"my pleasure. so i was thinking maybe you should call morty- you know, get a start working things out."
18189,Susan,hot shirtless gardeners with great abs and learner's permits?
17780,Susan,"oh, don't forget his coat."
17674,Susan,jackson?
17237,Susan,"oh, no, that's okay. i'll be fine."
15566,Susan,"no. no, it isn't.so when am i gonna get the check?'cause i have a lot of rebuilding to do.i need to get started."
16647,Susan,no. i'm screwed. i cannot get out of this without hurting her feelings.
13336,Susan,"oh, i'm late for an appointment anyway."
13837,Susan,what did you expect-a hug?
13341,Susan,oh god.
14150,Susan,julie alexandra mayer!
15456,Susan,"good.oh!god,i--i'm being so rude.um,mike,i-i want you to meet--"
17855,Susan,i'm not good alone. i need a man in my life.
15515,Susan,you know what?it is her.
18024,Susan,"well, yes, i was upset at first. but, you know, mike was gonna be with someone eventually, and i consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend."
14999,Susan,my name's susan. i was buying some horse feed when mr. prudy had an attack behind the counter. i gave him cpr and called nine-one-one.
18109,Susan,"karl, i'm serious. don't mess with me. i have a yardstick, and i'm not afraid to use it."
14681,Susan,i play the piano. you know that.
15398,Susan,okay--
17928,Susan,"actually, um--jackson and i split up."
17912,Susan,i thought that was clear.
17836,Susan,oh! jazz!
15073,Susan,"yeah, i can't believe i'm about to say this,but i feel sorry for him.it's like he's so fragile."
17766,Susan,you knew about katherine and mike?
17065,Susan,"hey, actually, um, since you're here, i was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell orson about mike's, you know--drug problem."
18352,Susan,just answer the question.
17749,Susan,gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find her attractive after he gets his sight back.
16325,Susan,i set your mother on fire.
18421,Susan,"if he's not gone in five minutes, then i'm going to go out there and tell him how old you really are."
17950,Susan,"okay, you know the problems they're having at his school. and now with all the budget cutbacks--i mean, this place is fabulous."
17699,Susan,shut up.
15472,Susan,"okay,you want the truth?i don't knowhow i feel about you,but i keep looking at you,trying to see if you've changed,if you've grown up.you know what i see?i see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago."
18135,Susan,"the woman is dead, people. let's honor her memory."
15356,Susan,"yeah,well,believe me,behind all the laughs,there's still plenty of bitterness and resentment."
16690,Susan,yeah.
15961,Susan,"excuse me, what's going-- what's going on?"
14778,Susan,"well, it's possible because i have faith in people. i mean, lonnie knows he messed up and he's sorry. he's making restitution. what, you don't believe people deserve second chances?"
16800,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm not a stripper."
15336,Susan,great.i'm about to be released.
18301,Susan,that would be great. just tell him i need an answer quickly 'cause the wedding is monday.
13950,Susan,news flash! i hated all of that!
14282,Susan,i think i would have given up entirely if it weren't for you and morty.
16213,Susan,"what? no, ian, we have to talk about this."
13855,Susan,"damn, karl, i'm not even married to him anymore and he's still keeping me from having sex."
14529,Susan,it's funny you should mention sin. i think adultery still falls in that category.
16346,Susan,we got it. just go.
17938,Susan,"well, let's just make sure we remember him."
16418,Susan,"no, no, i got it. oh, wait. here we go."
13751,Susan,you're a mess.
14445,Susan,what about dana?
14983,Susan,oh! i'm your daughter!
17290,Susan,"it's not like all the other times, edie. we're done."
14942,Susan,"oh. oh. i was just researching my book and i, i found the strangest thing. no one with my father's name was ever a merchant marine."
13627,Susan,"aw,maybe it's my fault. maybe i just imagined an entire relationship with this man that didn't exist."
15850,Susan,i was in the country. but i'm back now.
17956,Susan,"oh, those. oh, they're stunning."
14389,Susan,thanks.
13885,Susan,what if i want to talk about the big crush i have on the plumber that lives across the street?
18168,Susan,"lynette, don't look at edie."
16437,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. no, i'm not pregnant. no, i just know know what i want, which is ian. so i'm just eager to you know, no- not get it over with, per se, but just to get to the good part, which is the marriage to ian."
14894,Susan,yeah.
14314,Susan,it's not that i'm not excited?
14232,Susan,sorry.
14013,Susan,i don't think so.
16621,Susan,no. they're my flowers! enjoy your stolen wedding!
13524,Susan,mrs huber.
17521,Susan,this is nice. we should rumble all the time.
18407,Susan,mike. mike!
17586,Susan,you said you liked it.
15331,Susan,"aw,thank you.i love mike."
15563,Susan,i don't deserve friends like you.
16157,Susan,"did you seriously think i could sit on information that would exonerate mike? i mean, if you had seen his face in jail the other day--"
16086,Susan,i want to.
15341,Susan,damn that nurse hisel!
17251,Susan,"""hence."" that's classy. say a lot of ""hence"" when we see him."
15367,Susan,oh!
16992,Susan,"well, he's just a little piece of heaven."
18053,Susan,"no, we've already covered you."
14335,Susan,**sigh**
15242,Susan,"so we shouldn't expect a wedding gift,huh?"
16797,Susan,"no, no, you've, uh, worked all day. you stay here. i'll go to the store."
18356,Susan,well--i realized that i never properly congratulated you on getting married.
13992,Susan,"so, what are you waiting for?"
16901,Susan,"leave him with me. i need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket."
16467,Susan,"you, too. i've had it with both of you. you're tugging at me like i'm some kind of wishbone."
15715,Susan,a date?ahhhh.
16081,Susan,what?!
17946,Susan,fantastic!
14079,Susan,"oh yeah, this dress is just riding up as it is. if i walk any faster it'll be happy valentine's day for everyone."
14470,Susan,what?
15903,Susan,"uh, edie? oh, she's just a neighbor. she visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments."
13452,Susan,lynette?
13546,Susan,"we talked to paul, told him we need to show him something."
14836,Susan,"mike, what are you doing?"
17478,Susan,"ugh. hey. hon. how was the park? wait. hold on. mommy just found her first gray hair. i need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again. oh. look at your face. it's scratched. what happened?"
15201,Susan,the surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow.what other choice do i have?
14432,Susan,"ah, morty. i just don't think it's going to happen. she's moved on. why don't you sit down, i'll call you a cab."
16315,Susan,"no, it is. it's vittles. so, can i get you something to drink?"
15024,Susan,i'm sorry. how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
16006,Susan,i don't know! it's complicated.
17819,Susan,thank you. can i go clubbing with you tonight?
17761,Susan,"yes, i am. you're perfectly right."
15677,Susan,"oh, oh, you know, you should, um, call my friend orson.he's a dentist.i'm sure he'll see you right away."
16395,Susan,"i think if you really like this guy, you should just be honest. you should tell him that you feel a little hurt--"
14592,Susan,how long have you known?
16661,Susan,"okay, it's your big day, so i'm gonna let that slide."
15337,Susan,why do you ask?
18345,Susan,"yes, sure. why not?"
15919,Susan,"of course i came. oh! oh, i just love your house. it always smells like you. oh, my gosh! what, is the thing, is that tonight?"
17281,Susan,"he told you that? well, we're getting past it."
15159,Susan,okay.
15183,Susan,wow.i wouldn't want you to hate yourself.
18093,Susan,"that is not true, and i think we are dangerously close to no longer speaking in metaphor."
18089,Susan,"okay, class, let's see how our animals of africa drawings are going. oh, emma, this is beautiful. emma drew a gazelle. isn't she pretty? zachary, is that a rhinoceros? he looks so big and strong. i love rhinos."
15533,Susan,"hey! hey,you,wait,wait,wait. um--okay,you cannot tell edie about this.whatever she's paying you,i'll pay you double."
16972,Susan,"um, yes, the, uh, genetic counselor, um, wanted to know a couple of things. um, i-is there any cancer in your family?"
16021,Susan,oops!
18108,Susan,"listen, it's bad enough that i've got one ex-husband running around the halls. i don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that i have two. so not a word about us having been married. no more wisecracks. no susie q's. i am miss susan, art teacher."
14114,Susan,i don't hate zach. i just think he's sort of crazy.
15705,Susan,"oh, i would love to but i think i'm in a rush here.i'm supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.is it 1:00 yet?"
13375,Susan,i think we should give it to paul.
16747,Susan,"well,now i believe you."
15787,Susan,right.
18132,Susan,here's a thought. why don't we talk about edie?
13749,Susan,"wow, that's quite a pitching arm you've got there."
16538,Susan,"well, that doesn't make sense. mike wouldn't leave without saying good-bye."
16991,Susan,"well, you're wrong. he's happy. he's got a good job and a wife who loves him and a baby on the way."
17767,Susan,why didn't you tell me?
13901,Susan,give my best to brandi.
13674,Susan,i need those back.
16946,Susan,"did i? well, that's obviously wrong."
15305,Susan,"oh.okay. ow,ow. that's actually starting to be painful."
15851,Susan,"is something wrong? you, you don't seem happy to see me."
14584,Susan,zach said you kidnapped his father so you could kill him.
17553,Susan,"oh! of what? you're 3 inches off the ground. you're completely padded. so just do what i say--wobble, wobble. ""daddy, look at me!"" crash."
14718,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister. i mean, you bought me ribs. i have gratitude to express."
16275,Susan,hey.
16788,Susan,"so it's not my imagination. they're bigger, right?"
13531,Susan,"um, sure. as a friend."
14715,Susan,"you come within 10 feet of her,i will have you arrested.now get out."
15477,Susan,no?
15547,Susan,"are you sure?uh,i mean,you have such a long route,and that ice tea's gonna go right through ya.it's better here than mrs. mccluskey's hydrangeas."
17218,Susan,"maternity lingerie - ah, right. why don't they just call it what it really is? a pup tent to hide your stretch marks."
15498,Susan,really?did he say who it was?
14356,Susan,"mom, i don't hate you."
17026,Susan,can we talk? this will just take a second. did you kiss that boy?
16662,Susan,yeah. i'm calling her cell. it's ringing.
16145,Susan,"right. sorry. uh, i'm just new to this whole snitch thing. hold on, okay?"
17441,Susan,"absolutely. put this on. now--let's talk about acceptable topics of conversation. you like sports, right?"
16733,Susan,i don't want you to be fine.i want you to be happy.
13718,Susan,paul young's garage sale.
15224,Susan,oh! uh--
15000,Susan,"well, i'm gonna get out of here. mr. prudy, i want you to hurry up and get back on your feet."
16548,Susan,that's why i have to go. i have to make amends and heal his broken heart.
17969,Susan,what?
16699,Susan,"aw,that's sweet.i don't believe you."
17090,Susan,the doctor said the baby's fine.
15350,Susan,"well,for starters,because you banged your secretary,and you owe me for the rest of your life."
17386,Susan,"i knew wayne was the reason she moved away, and the second she moved back, he started stalking her again."
14097,Susan,what's wrong?
15554,Susan,"hi. i made you a thank-you pie,and by ""made,""i mean ""bought."""
17812,Susan,because we have never said it.
14404,Susan,uh!
15014,Susan,"no, addison, i'm a chicken. see? those are feathers hanging around."
14727,Susan,"oh, sorry. i'm helping mike find zach. you know, so we can all rest easy at night."
18191,Susan,in the kitchen.
14508,Susan,"yeah, part of it. why?"
17338,Susan,you're right. my son's future is at stake. i have to do something.
18123,Susan,"okay, just so you know, should be bringing this to the psychologist. but i didn't, because this kind of ""self-expression"" usually gets a kid expelled."
16419,Susan,"well, at least it'll keep me from stabbing myself while i look."
13571,Susan,you are so sweet. i would love to go.
13969,Susan,hi. mrs. mayer. i saw you from across the street. i thought you might need a hand.
18165,Susan,you should leave now.
14231,Susan,"yeah. i just got out of this relationship with this guy, mike, and it's kind of complicated. anyway, i'm just not even sure where i am right now emotionally, i'm just all jumbled up and i don't think i could leap right into something new, relationship wise, you know, at the moment."
17202,Susan,you can't. your house isn't finished yet.
16627,Susan,you don't have to.
16558,Susan,cool. how do i get one of those?
15957,Susan,"oh, that's responsible parenting. stealing whiskey? that's it, young lady. i'm taking you to paris.'"
17703,Susan,"uh-huh, she's a grown woman with stars in her eyes who's in love with a 3-times loser."
16266,Susan,"yes, i did. it's just--"
17683,Susan,really?
16563,Susan,"no, seriously, i was asking. what would you have done?"
17055,Susan,"julie, it's not like it was heroin or crack. it was just pain pills for his shoulder, but we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them."
14461,Susan,"oh, oh, you don't understand. i can't just drive away."
13428,Susan,"so, you know what? i am gonna go get dessert."
13893,Susan,"so, i had a really good time."
14906,Susan,"oh, uh, julie, uh oh, julie, uh--"
14362,Susan,yeah.
14877,Susan,"oh. well, i mean when two people split up, normally they don't give things back like valentine's day cards. if, if, you can throw it away. just please don't give it back to me, it's tacky."
17534,Susan,"yes, i see. and here, mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday. crazy mommy."
15351,Susan,"okay,will you shut up?it's not funny. i was drugged."
17791,Susan,"uh, yeah. it's--round."
15754,Susan,"hi, my name's susan mayer. your neighbor told me i could find you here."
15889,Susan,"mike, i don't know what edie's been telling you, but ian and i, we're just friends."
16039,Susan,"that was good. you. i wanna party with you. hey, i was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer."
18208,Susan,"uh, well, i should probably--put these away before i finish them off. are you sure there's nothing i can do to help you? a load of laundry?"
16188,Susan,"uh, it's small. it's got a plaid cover. oh, and when you find it, you have to read it because i promised her that i would always respect her privacy. now help me flip this mattress."
13649,Susan,"oh,yeah, sure, go ahead. do what you've got to do."
17594,Susan,uh-- it--it looks good.
13743,Susan,"well, you sort of interrupted our first date. but up until then, smoking hot tension. sounds pathetic, i know."
13834,Susan,why not?
14655,Susan,"okay, karl asked me to get back together the day after julie's birthday. i said no, which i'm guessing is the reason for the now legendary tequila bra-popping incident. please let go."
17064,Susan,"wow. tape, batteries, a radio. how'd you know i need this stuff?"
16766,Susan,is it about matt's party?
14131,Susan,"uh, let me get my purse."
18341,Susan,are you insane? why would you do something--
14429,Susan,now?! are you drunk?
14837,Susan,we need to talk.
17431,Susan,oh. thanks. so i guess you met jackson.
14218,Susan,i just can't.
15396,Susan,"oh,wait! why don't you let me walk with you?"
15108,Susan,i just know those two have something to do with that dead body.
17186,Susan,"pajamas--that's something you could do. okay, you're right. you're a guest in my housea completely naked guest in my house. i should leave."
14967,Susan,"oh, i'm not. julie, the man abandoned me before i was born. i don't have a desire to have a relationship with him."
13635,Susan,"how tragic! by which i mean, yay?"
15545,Susan,really?it seems like forever.let me top you off.
14528,Susan,"oh, thanks. i'll go do that now."
15483,Susan,"hello?oh,hi,edie.uh--yeah,he's here.hold on. how does she know you're here?"
17932,Susan,you can't retire. i break too many things.
14542,Susan,"i gotta say, i think you're making a mistake. mike couldn't kill anybody. i mean, this could just be a misunderstanding."
16683,Susan,"okay, i got you some appetizers to tide you over. we have mini quiches and beef satay and something called crystal coast shrimp with grits, but it's mostly just grits 'cause i ate all the shrimp on my way over. mike?"
14946,Susan,there what is?
15757,Susan,"my friend is marrying that man in two hours. please? okay, i need, um, ten dollars in unrolled pennies and i need to see you count it. 'cause last time you stiffed me.'"
15539,Susan,hi. sorry.i'm just on the lookout for edie.
15081,Susan,"zach,i'm glad you could make it."
14587,Susan,"oh, my god."
16910,Susan,"nothing, huh?"
16969,Susan,"well, he's your father. i should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor said we should gather data about your family's history. maybe you dad knows something you don't. i mean, i should meet him for the sake of our baby."
16472,Susan,for ten years? it's crazy. has anybody talked to her?
18232,Susan,"karl, what are you doing here?"
17005,Susan,so i'm thinking that it would be better if you could get her to research somebody else in her family.
16650,Susan,hey!
16105,Susan,"i don't know. a blackmail letter, a necklace made of teeth?"
13413,Susan,sorry if i upset you.
18048,Susan,"uh, you do. i am here to take my painting back."
18384,Susan,"m.j., run!"
14128,Susan,okay.
13847,Susan,"oh great, our romantic weekend is off."
14155,Susan,"oh, i, okay, i'm, i'm sorry. uh, i'll just, i'm just gonna leave those right there."
14498,Susan,"well, that's before i found mrs. huber's journal in his truck."
16652,Susan,"listen.we need to talk. i spoke to mike, and, uh, he's just not really into the whole double wedding thing."
15079,Susan,"mike, i'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.i just want a chance to make things right."
16338,Susan,yeah. that was the first night that we spent together. i wanted to surprise you.
15324,Susan,"do i,though? i mean,i do.but i don't trust it anymore.you know,those relationships turned out to be disasters.maybe i should stick it out with dr. ron,and i should try heading down a road that's growing and slower into a sort of kind of love that would sustain itself for 50 years. right?stability,comfort,endurance--i deserve that."
16832,Susan,"mm. um, bree's home. i'll be right back."
16220,Susan,it's one little date.
17207,Susan,"well, before you go, i just want to say that, um--having you here these last few weeks-"
14027,Susan,really!
15912,Susan,it was spur-of-the-moment.
16131,Susan,down to the jailhouse to talk to mike.
14815,Susan,how much money do you think you need to get to utah?
18292,Susan,"it's canada, not iran. it's like america with free health insurance. okay, i know this is important to you, but i depend on that check every month."
13907,Susan,"oh, well--"" ""i am the best, aren't i."
13580,Susan,"i don't know what you're talking about, mrs huber."
14127,Susan,sure. when?
16040,Susan,"well, let me help you, and we can talk. there is so much i wanna know about you. who is rupert cavanaugh? what makes him tick?"
14924,Susan,why are you giving it to me?
16951,Susan,lynette!
13930,Susan,only when i'm alone.
16726,Susan,no.i'm sorry.i'm just a little--you know what? forget it.let's eat.
17610,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
17613,Susan,"we should probably talk now, huh?"
15596,Susan,"bree, i'm worried about you.do--do you think that you should see someone?"
16689,Susan,"well, i don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing. one day, i want white roses, and then i want lilies, and first, i want a harpist, and then a string quartet. only one thing stays constant--and i'm looking at him. why would i need anything else to make my wedding perfect?"
14937,Susan,are you sure? that's what my mom said.
18014,Susan,"yeah, 'cause you make it like disneyland over here, with your paninis and your blackjack. you're trying to do everything you can to make him think that you're the other mommy."
13537,Susan,mrs huber .
16245,Susan,what do you think of this one?
17680,Susan,that's me.
13693,Susan,"okay, gimme a break here. i'm just grasping at straws."
16468,Susan,"no, i am beyond upset. you two want a decision? well, here's what i decide. there will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!"
15400,Susan,"okay,yes,i am closer to your father than i have been in the past.the bitter hatred's now settled into a respectful disgust.that's the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about."
13989,Susan,"okay. look, uh, i, i just haven't always treated you well, and i want to make amends."
18205,Susan,so--have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
14139,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know about that."
15084,Susan,"we don't hate you, zach.you had an incredibly hard year.and you shouldn't have done what you did,but we just wanna help you move on."
15783,Susan,yeah.and i think i have yours.
17598,Susan,"no, uh-- it's fantastic."
14986,Susan,mr. prudy!
17418,Susan,i told you the brakes were squeaking. i asked you to get them checked.
16947,Susan,katherine.
16049,Susan,"okay, you are not allowed to call me that."
17844,Susan,"uh, bob--uh, lee did stay here last night. he slept on the couch--in the guest room. so you have nothing to worry about."
16169,Susan,"yes, i have."
13947,Susan,what?
17136,Susan,the jam was bree's idea.
17686,Susan,"oh, not yet. i wanna give her new boyfriend the once-over. wow. he's as cute as she said-- nice smile, and look at that hair. don't you just wanna run your fingers through it?"
17834,Susan,"lee, that is not what i'm doing. is jackson perfect? no. but i don't think there is such a thing, and i have a history of sabotaging relationships. no, i'm doing this. i'm moving."
17621,Susan,how much am i paying you?
13960,Susan,did i come at a bad time?
16483,Susan,what?
14032,Susan,"so if you had a problem, or some sort of secret was weighing on you--"
17662,Susan,"and so that's when i got caught stuffing at the pep rally. and six months later--kaboom. i was voted prom queen. nice work, girls. stop that right now."
13979,Susan,"hey, edie!"
15713,Susan,hi jane.
16182,Susan,yes. that's right. a condom alone will not protect you.
16438,Susan,"oh, so you're not seeing anyone?"
13759,Susan,"oh, never mind! we'll just find them ourselves. we'll go find them ourselves."
14694,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure i don't have talent?"
18397,Susan,"mike should be here any minute. dave, please. don't hurt mike. it wasn't his fault."
14949,Susan,"mom, don't walk away from me."
13968,Susan,"i'm just, you know, busy. stuff."
13892,Susan,"oh no, i'm sure she's fine. we're talking about mrs. huber. she's like a roach!"
18116,Susan,i told the class to draw something that made them happy. all the other kids drew kittens and rainbows. your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
16772,Susan,missy taylor?
17467,Susan,"well, i was pretty ticked off that you told jackson about the ear thing."
14549,Susan,"uh! ow! oh! bongo, no! bongo! bongo! oh!"
15922,Susan,"nothing. i just had a few drinks with my girlfriends, and thank god, because it gave me the courage to come over here and tell you really in my heart."
18020,Susan,"hey, guys. what are we talking about?"
14617,Susan,"hi, ida."" ""can we talk about this later? i just found out my ex is dating my neighbor, and i'm really ticked off."
18197,Susan,i know what you meant. i'll stop by tomorrow and see him.
16200,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not gonna get mad. just sit down. you know what upset me the most? that you didn't trust me enough to tell me the truth."
15534,Susan,"$2,000?jeez! i gotta get into real estate.okay,i don't have that kind of cash."
16168,Susan,yeah? so?
16112,Susan,"uh, bree and i sort of had a fight. look, i'm awfully sorry that i'm late. i had an emergency."
15917,Susan,"but, you know, with ian, everything was always easy. you know, that's the kind of guy i could see myself living into my nineties with."
15761,Susan,he was the only suspect.
15118,Susan,younger than me.
14888,Susan,did she cheat?
16794,Susan,what?
17007,Susan,"bree thinks you're doing drugs. she found this on her kitchen floor, and it's not aspirin."
18223,Susan,"oh, yes, sir!"
14511,Susan,hello?
13585,Susan,he actually said mary alice was crazy?
15266,Susan,"well,karl is a lawyer,and it could just be a prenup for another client."
17982,Susan,he's sick. i'm late. thanks for helping.
17989,Susan,"oh, hey, baby. how's my boy? i missed you so much. are you feeling better?"
14951,Susan,"morty? morty, have you seen my mom?"
14641,Susan,"well, uh, i work at home, so i'm home a lot working. and i just keep hearing these noises lately. uh, it's hard to concentrate."
14825,Susan,mom.
16435,Susan,"no. no, i'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas. well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done."
15300,Susan,"well,that's a big word.we just started dating,and we have a connection,and i'm gonna follow it through and see where it goes."
14082,Susan,don't even think about it.
15484,Susan,are you getting juice for her?
15021,Susan,solicitation? you were arrested for solicitation?
14864,Susan,"no, mike, mike! come back! come back!"
14948,Susan,"well, you've been married four times. i think you got it down."
16846,Susan,that is not the point! why would you send me to somebody who is obviously not your doctor?
18266,Susan,"i don't. this isn't about you. not really. and besides, you moved on."
13790,Susan,"well, maybe we shouldn't be dating."
16269,Susan,"well, well, uh, before you say another word--take a look around."
13416,Susan,"i don't know, i was gonna take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast."
16860,Susan,"okay. well, i think it's time for a break."
17715,Susan,"uh, no. no. no, no. no! no, no, no! oh, all right! but no matter what he asks you, promise me you'll say ""no."""
14260,Susan,"no, we didn't. you know i just said what you wanted to hear because you guilted me into it."
16566,Susan,"oh, it's a face mask. it's lavender and honey. you want some?"
15692,Susan,"oh, shut up."
15283,Susan,i'm checking myself into the hospital.i'm finally gonna get that surgery.
15102,Susan,"that man is the most obnoxious,offensive,annoying human being.and you're looking at me like i'm crazy right now,but i will be if i spend one more second with him.so you gotta help me.you gotta do something."
15714,Susan,"um, you mean like outside the hospital?"
15069,Susan,zach.
16151,Susan,hi. i brought you a bundt cake. don't worry.i didn't make it.
15665,Susan,"hey, it's susan.just wanted you to know i let the electrician in your house.i hope you're having a great time at the spa."
17143,Susan,"oh, tim."
14772,Susan,"you know what? this is one of those times when you find out who your real friends are, so yeah."
14472,Susan,i knew he was good. i just knew it.
17312,Susan,um--sorry. go on.
16459,Susan,it's not just a cake. it's a major decision!
17569,Susan,"har har. uh, actually, he's at juanita's watching a dvd. do you want me to call him?"
14195,Susan,"no, something happened in this house, something so awful we can't even imagine it."
14672,Susan,you walked out on me.
13838,Susan,"honey, what's going on?"
14720,Susan,"no, no, it's not. we're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating. we'll just see each other occasionally. you know, until we get this zach thing resolved. you know, we'll just be easy about it. no commitments. except, of course, neither of us is allowed to date anybody else."
16707,Susan,how's your aunt?katherine used to live here with mrs.sims.
15176,Susan,what? you want me to put my life on the line to service your ego?
13568,Susan,"no! no, no, no. julie's got it."
16632,Susan,"well, you know, when i married him, karl wasn't karl. and i think that's why i got so mad at you. because ninety-nine percent of me is sure that we're gonna be totally happy. but then what you said--it just stirred up that pesky one percent."
16088,Susan,i don't have to. i know you didn't.
13487,Susan,"okay. i know what just happened is funny, in theory, but i am nowhere near ready to laugh about it. so please, no jokes."
17066,Susan,you did? when?
18405,Susan,mike! mike! mike! stop! no! m.j.! m.j.!
13549,Susan,"you can see from the postmark, mary alice probably got it the day she died."
16628,Susan,thank you. i was just bringing you this.
14340,Susan,what are you doing?!
15746,Susan,"oh, good. um, i'm, um, well, then let's get technical."
17829,Susan,"i just--jackson called earlier, and, um--you know, he went to riverton to visit his old art professor, and she offered him a job."
14704,Susan,"oh, don't even joke like that."
15862,Susan,"okay, mike, i-i am not doing this to upset you. i'm doing this to help."
17576,Susan,"well, just please change your shirt."
16808,Susan,"okay, i admit that there's a certain lack of consistency there."
14161,Susan,"well, i also loved junk food, and i gave that up, and i survived."
15038,Susan,"carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, i'll explain!"
17663,Susan,the sex music. turn it off.
16018,Susan,"oh, thank god! we were all so worried we were losing you. okay, now i'm hugging you. oh, it's amazing. your life is such an adventure. can't wait to see what you do next."
18379,Susan,"okay, sweetie. do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?"
18243,Susan,is it working?
15116,Susan,"oh,no,i can't do that."
14821,Susan,"he's right, mom. oh, i want it to be just like you do. you know on your own terms and you get down on one knee and the whole production."
13876,Susan,"yeah, but--"
13938,Susan,"thanks for your concern, karl, i'm fine."
15141,Susan,really?you were up all night?
17590,Susan,"once we sign these papers, there's no going back."
16107,Susan,fine. i'll cook myself.
14087,Susan,what?
14038,Susan,yeah.
15144,Susan,the one who called in the mri room?
15802,Susan,nine lovers is not a lot! nine lovers does not make me a slut!
15326,Susan,"mike!oh,wait,stop! go back!stop! stop a second.hey!what are you doing here?"
17732,Susan,"uh, he's fine, just getting some stitches. oh. how's--wait, who are you here to see?"
15125,Susan,yeah?
14360,Susan,"of course you can, just call them up and tell them not to come over."
13725,Susan,i'm going to the bathroom and i'm going home. i don't want mike to catch me here.
16603,Susan,"gaby, did you really think i would want to spend what would've been my wedding day watching someone else get married?"
15635,Susan,"okay, now i know it's a little more cramped than we're used to, but we can't stay at bree's forever.she's gonna be coming back from that spa vacation soon.besides, it's gonna be fun."
17501,Susan,"juanita solis, don't you move! you are in big trouble!"
16470,Susan,"get out. there will be no kissing,and there will be no wedding."
18040,Susan,"yeah, that's what she told me, too, only, uh, it didn't."
17886,Susan,that is not much of a distinction.
15800,Susan,ian!
14708,Susan,"well, i hope it wasn't as ugly as me and karl."
18422,Susan,what have you done?
16111,Susan,but they're not here.
17822,Susan,"you, bob, andrew."
17837,Susan,i don't know. i was drunk.
18219,Susan,"uh, what? you don't want the license?"
14124,Susan,"mike! mike, are you okay?"
16358,Susan,"i mean it. i am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest. there'll be no secrets with ian. i'll tell him everything."
17360,Susan,"random chitchat, nothing specific."
15454,Susan,"my ex-boyfriend's here.if he sees me alone,i'll die.i'm begging you,please,act like you know me."
13832,Susan,i thought that--
15049,Susan,you don't have to do this.
15935,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
16836,Susan,"oh, well, we could schedule our appointments together and carpool. you know--pregnant gals on the road."
17627,Susan,"well, when guys go slut hunting, they tend not to play the girlfriend card."
15191,Susan,"bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting betty to hang out with us.we just-- wondered if you could clue us in a little."
15801,Susan,nine.
14680,Susan,"no. no. i mean, i'm a little surprised that you didn't ask me to accompany you first."
15541,Susan,what did you say?
14424,Susan,"that's not possible, we don't burn candles during the day."
15187,Susan,"yeah, that."
17728,Susan,yeah! he went in there to find you.
18286,Susan,"aw, how sweet. and heavy. score."
16162,Susan,bree!
14625,Susan,the one at the piano bar?
14223,Susan,i think this is yours.
16212,Susan,i have told you i love you a thousand times. where is all this jealousy coming from?
15544,Susan,"and you know why? because we're all so busy and detached from each other.you're at my house every day,and sure,we wave and we say hello,but we barely even know each other.how long have you been delivering my mail,for god's sake?"
18255,Susan,i have to go upstairs.
14985,Susan,"mr. prudy, i'm sorry. i didn't want to spring it on you like this. where are you going? you see when i found out you were alive, and, and that we both lived in the same city, i just wanted to meet you."
14216,Susan,that it explains everything.
15496,Susan,what's going on?
13787,Susan,"hold on a minute, now. i started snooping around because i found all that money by accident. and, and then, i found a gun. are you a drug dealer or something?"
14064,Susan,we've never answered why mary alice referred to herself as angela in that therapy session.
18308,Susan,sweet! let's get to the car wash on our way to the courthouse.
13597,Susan,great.
17801,Susan,"what do you mean, the way i act?"
17405,Susan,i'm sorry. i can't give that to you.
15706,Susan,"oh, wow.um, um, i can't accept this.this is too extravagant."
13977,Susan,"what, you think there's a chance mrs. huber didn't write about it in the journal?"
15334,Susan,"aw, thank you."
16371,Susan,deep enough. come on! let's move!
13966,Susan,"well, if anyone can go the distance, he can. i should know."
17015,Susan,"i'm thinking that you're a drug addict and a liar, so say something that's not that."
18195,Susan,at you? why?
13626,Susan,wow.
18159,Susan,really?
16288,Susan,it always is with you.
15857,Susan,"well, you know, let me set the scene. um, we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to--cappy's. do you remember cappy's? okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever--"
14440,Susan,i don't suppose she told you he was a drug dealer?
15630,Susan,oh hi.i have a normal baby.
15666,Susan,careful with those.the last of the crystal.okay.
15393,Susan,it poured.i could have murdered that weatherman.
15487,Susan,"so if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her-- with me!you made me the other woman!"
16642,Susan,"and she kept saying, please, let me make it up to you!"
18097,Susan,"look, i need this job. but even if i didn't, i would still like you as a person."
16253,Susan,"okay, that's enough."
14753,Susan,"well, i can't tell you. you know, you messed up a lot of people's lives. you can't run away from that."
16154,Susan,it may be a little late for that.
14138,Susan,"he dropped his gun, cleaning it."
14394,Susan,"well, i was planning on doing that anyway."
17491,Susan,ah! couple of wusses. i'll handle it myself.
15970,Susan,"no, take your hands off me! carolyn, carolyn! call my cell! it's 572--"
14817,Susan,since when?
14880,Susan,"well, i'll say one thing for us. even with all our problems we're not acting like that."
15742,Susan,susan mayer.
17193,Susan,"i know when i'm dreaming, and this really happened. why else would i be sponging butt prints off my stool?"
16793,Susan,mm-hmm?
17721,Susan,"oh, julie, you're way too young to be this cynical."
15386,Susan,oh?i need to take this.
17682,Susan,"i can't believe i ever thought you didn't know me. well, i guess i should let you finish this. i'm sort of missing hands."
17180,Susan,"bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
17634,Susan,i don't?
13570,Susan,"no. no, no, not at all."
13433,Susan,how's bongo doing?
17570,Susan,you're moving again? how far are you gonna be away now? the hudson house?
14147,Susan,"stop! stop mike, just stop. if you keep talking, you're gonna work your way into my heart and i just don't want you anywhere near my heart. ever."
14248,Susan,"well, neither is she. and if she's not into him, why can't i not be into him."
16380,Susan,it's a thank-you gift for mike.
14972,Susan,soon. i don't wanna ambush him. i'm gonna ease into it.
14037,Susan,paul.
17069,Susan,"orson, we need to talk."
16524,Susan,"i'm sorry, mike."
17495,Susan,hear what?
18376,Susan,"gosh, it feels like we've been driving forever. maybe we should stretch our legs."
13806,Susan,"well, open! open, open, open! he could have said something about dana!"
17707,Susan,"hey, why did that guy hand you a cd?"
16936,Susan,"ida, again, the issue is not bob and lee being gay. it's the fountain."
16240,Susan,maybe a little.
18192,Susan,"i was cooking, all right?"
17901,Susan,thanks.
17671,Susan,what?!
13552,Susan,i think i'm being blackmailed.
14786,Susan,"well, how can i not? i feel so guilty, i can barely look him in the eye when he talks about zach."
15927,Susan,"please, keep the food references to a minimum."
15952,Susan,"listen, i have somebody in the car who's late for a plane. can you give me two minutes?"
15561,Susan,my whole house is-- on fire!
16761,Susan,"katherine, hi. oh, uh, i brought you that salad bowl."
14668,Susan,are you in love with her?
17750,Susan,edie!
15694,Susan,he does.
16713,Susan,"i-i didn't know you were,this kind of doctor."
15255,Susan,"oh,i have a wedding that day."
13431,Susan,is there anything i can do?
15788,Susan,"so-- brandy, a roaring fire, what could be more romantic?"
16045,Susan,why do you have to be this way?
16415,Susan,don't panic.
17088,Susan,these people are bleeding. i can absolutely wait.
17156,Susan,"mm, well, maybe you won't mind doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week."
17050,Susan,"yeah, your friend. i told you last night he was coming by again."
16871,Susan,"it's just gonna get worse. do you know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like--"
17798,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
14547,Susan,no!
16263,Susan,hey.
17421,Susan,"they were a mother and a child. she was a mother, just like me--with a child just like ours. and if it weren't for us, they would still be alive."
16361,Susan,"mike,it wasn't a movie.that was us."
15184,Susan,and i am so sorry about that-- snap thing.i was just trying to be theatrical.
17164,Susan,"yeah, you're going to college soon, and i want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs. scare her straight, mike."
15683,Susan,mike still hasn't seen the invitation.
14005,Susan,you're not?
15759,Susan,and that's bad why?
18115,Susan,it's not my fault. i showed this to the school psychologist. she gave it to the principal. my hands were tied.
14430,Susan,are you crazy? it's one o'clock in the morning. she's sleeping.
15012,Susan,that was my first halloween. i was two. what do you think i am?
15294,Susan,oh. um--okay.there's more on the back.
17785,Susan,i'm sorry. the--the image in my mind is probably way funnier than what actually happened. why did m.j. do that?
15493,Susan,don't bother!i won't pick up.
14872,Susan,"i just think if i start acting like an adult for once, maybe, who knows, somewhere down the line, mike and i at least can be friends."
15280,Susan,thanks.i owe you one.
17563,Susan,"i'm sorry. m.j. was excited about the bike, so jackson took off the training wheels and taught him. he didn't know."
14084,Susan,"here's the thing, i don't think i'm ready to have another baby. i think we need to have a serious conversation."
14226,Susan,"all right, i promise."
17172,Susan,"shame on you! his mother trusted me to take care of him, and you swoop in like some swooping, sex-craved--oh, for god sakes, tim! pull up the blanket!"
16914,Susan,what?
15210,Susan,so what changed?
15010,Susan,"that was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that i am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail."
14348,Susan,argh!
17696,Susan,did someone throw rice at you?
16833,Susan,"i need a favor. um, i remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician. can i get his number?"
13909,Susan,"okay, now i'm good."
14981,Susan,what? who's carol?
14050,Susan,sure.
14767,Susan,you had to move money? what does that mean?
15066,Susan,and he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
14261,Susan,edie!
15502,Susan,like an angel.
13498,Susan,"listen, mike, i-about the whole seeing me naked thing. i don't know, i just, i wanna thank you for being such a-perfect gentleman."
16721,Susan,"okay,whoa.i'm gonna stop you right there.i am way too young for that.please refer to your chart."
15320,Susan,because he's a gem.and apparently he loves me.
18033,Susan,katherine and i told you guys we were taking the high road. why won't you believe us?
14911,Susan,"oh, now i feel really awful."
15855,Susan,okay.
17117,Susan,i hope you don't mind that i'm going to kiss you.
16260,Susan,"okay, it's me."
16250,Susan,sold.
15744,Susan,what an excellent question.
16429,Susan,"he wants to thank you for saving us, and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you. how's that for irony?"
15138,Susan,i am so sorry.but i'm not sick.
15580,Susan,"uh, no. no, i was up."
14258,Susan,i don't mean to be babbling. it's just really complicated and there is so much about mike you don't even know.
14525,Susan,really?
14334,Susan,"you don't have to sell me. go, just go talk to her. now."
14463,Susan,you see the thing is. this is probably the last chance for me to find out if i can be with the man i love.
14174,Susan,wow.
16254,Susan,i sure as hell do.
16971,Susan,"uh, no. thank you, nick."
17704,Susan,aren't i?
17522,Susan,to gabrielle solis--another good mom.
15905,Susan,you have--
13520,Susan,oh.
18433,Susan,that's my daughter.get dressed!
17947,Susan,"yeah. that's quite a tad. but we're starting in the middle of the year, so we'd only pay half, right?"
17700,Susan,"well, that's true."
16735,Susan,"oh,my gosh. she's out of the clinic."
17549,Susan,"just listen. daddy really wanted to be the one to teach you to ride your bike, and if you can already do it, it's gonna make him sad. so just let daddy push the button. understand?"
14493,Susan,"so, what do you think we should do for dinner?"
13779,Susan,mike? i'm upstairs. sorta.
14257,Susan,"i mean obviously i am not going to read the letter. at some point you just gotta let it go, right?"
18228,Susan,"you can't think that way. i mean, what happened is bad enough. y-- you can't blame yourself for it, too. if you do that, you will destroy everything you have left that's good. trust me. i know."
17197,Susan,"orson, you're staying at my house! there you go."
17958,Susan,hi. you at home?
15530,Susan,i know that this looks bad--
14831,Susan,"oh, i think i do. you're a cold-blooded murderer."
15095,Susan,how old do you think i am?
14206,Susan,you lied to me.
17166,Susan,what the hell is going on here?
16077,Susan,"his wife goes missing, then his mistress turns up dead. what is there to think about?"
14395,Susan,"mike, i know why i was planning to stay away from him, but why do you want me to stay away from him?"
15895,Susan,see? evil! evil!
17047,Susan,"yeah, he said that you owed him money for some--plumbing job that he helped you on."
14895,Susan,nope. this one's for adults about all my failed relationships.
13642,Susan,"well,if you'd only lied to me about it once, it wouldn't be."
16801,Susan,i'm pregnant.
16709,Susan,so you're back.how fun.i should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
18227,Susan,"oh, dave--that does not make it your fault."
17645,Susan,okay.
13424,Susan,"mm, that's mr. mullin. and just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets."
17617,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
14415,Susan,i'm so sorry.
17848,Susan,"oh, thank god. you know, when i woke up next to you yesterday, i just didn't know what to think."
13910,Susan,what?
14485,Susan,"oh, i was just rude back there gloating and everything and i apologize."
16790,Susan,"well, i'd better warn you. i may have to work the shoulders. ba-boom, ba-boom, mmm."
15669,Susan,"to be fair, you just had a spare room, and this is a whole house."
17364,Susan,"next week? w-well, that is a big--no."
14938,Susan,"oh. well, clearly i have more research to do. so, what do you think? my life story, would you rush out and buy a copy?"
13515,Susan,what's that?
16484,Susan,don't soft-pedal it. let 'em know i mean business.
14961,Susan,is that him?
13713,Susan,thanks.
15582,Susan,i need edie to spill her guts.what do you know about wearing a wire?
13934,Susan,"new york, new york."
13776,Susan,what is wrong with you? lassie would have had a fire truck here by now! stupid dog.
14036,Susan,maybe.
17244,Susan,what does that mean?
13890,Susan,has anybody talked to bree? how's rex doing?
17175,Susan,"okay, so i have to ask. this thing that happened with you and katherine 12 years ago--was it an ongoing affair?"
14652,Susan,"actually, i'm glad that you shared that, because here's a tidbit for you. karl said he's still in love with me."
16481,Susan,they bet me in a game of poker. they made decisions about my life over a hand of five-card stud. wrong does not even begin to cover it.
16365,Susan,really?
14993,Susan,"it's, it's susan. my name is susan. and, no, that's not good enough."
17574,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
14228,Susan,are you asking me out on a date?
15258,Susan,"thanks,hon.that really helps.okay,now i want you to go over and slip this ring to your father.and just so you know,if edie catches you,i'm expecting you to swallow it."
13603,Susan,okay.
16221,Susan,he's matured-- to the tune of a billion dollars. please do this--for mike.
14847,Susan,"well, that's 'cause i assumed you were someone i would let in my house. what do you want?"
17322,Susan,"oh, give me that. well, we need new inspiration. ooh. riley."
16442,Susan,"hi. um, mike, i want you to meet maggie gilroy."
17234,Susan,"and he's right. i have to find a way to make peace with all of this. but you need to understand, it's gonna be one of the hardest things i've ever done. and like most things in my life, i probably won't do it with much elegance or grace. so if i don't come over to your house for coffee--if i don't smile when the two of you walk by, just please know that i still love you. and for forgiving orson--just be patient. i'll get there."
15710,Susan,so you asked us to a meal to announce another meal?that's so bree of you.
14159,Susan,"no, no, no. now, i know how much you were looking forward to this weekend with your dad. i'm fine."
16129,Susan,cherry berry?
16499,Susan,work is great. you could just sign that paper and tell the judge i'm fine.
14537,Susan,she was?
14807,Susan,not like that!
14892,Susan,"no, i made the plumber furious. that is definitely over. so there will be no gloating from me."
17678,Susan,"so you've broken through your creative logjam? congratulations! ooh, why not celebrate by ripping off my clothes with your teeth?"
14347,Susan,mom!
15876,Susan,"julie, there you are. i think i found a way to get through to mike."
15604,Susan,"well, see, you were chewing,and so i didn't really hear what you said.could you just say it again?"
16367,Susan,to london? permanently?
14855,Susan,"oh, no, mom, stop! what is it?"
14931,Susan,"hey, mike. so my mom's wedding is in a couple days, and i know you sent back that little card saying you were coming and that you preferred beef, which, actually i changed to fish for you 'cause i tasted the beef. anyways, i know that was before we, you know--"
17284,Susan,"you know, i think, actually, i might have those dough hooks somewhere."
16923,Susan,"yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it."
16471,Susan,"testing. one, two, three, testing."
18102,Susan,"hey, karl."
16736,Susan,well. we just all love ya.
14044,Susan,yes.
14686,Susan,"oh. oh, okay."
16189,Susan,you found it?
17471,Susan,it's just--i don't want him to see me through your eyes.
13734,Susan,"no, you give me a break! i did not follow you here, and even if i had followed you here, it's because you've been so secretive about kendra."
17067,Susan,"i'm sorry, so--orson already knows about mike?"
15416,Susan,hi. what's going on?
15601,Susan,"no, edie, wait.um, i don't wanna fight.i know that we've had our differences,but, you know, we had a friendship going there,and i just think we owe it to ourselves to talk about what happened."
14465,Susan,"it's not my fault, you don't have love in your heart."
14103,Susan,is that blood?
16458,Susan,"no, i know what they taste like. i'm just torn, okay?"
14346,Susan,you just broke up with morty two weeks ago. don't you think you could at least pretend to mourn the relationship.
14805,Susan,of course. you're my lonnie.
14551,Susan,"uh, and i turned around, and there was zach young - and that's zach with an ""h"" - pointing a gun at me."
17713,Susan,right! right. you mind easing away so i can dance with my daughter?
14351,Susan,"alright, we get it. she looks young."
16821,Susan,"okay, once the light starts blinking, we've got three seconds,. so, everybody, say, ""cheese"" and hold it. one, two, three."
13445,Susan,"hello, sorry i'm late."
15470,Susan,that was not a coincidence.
13692,Susan,did it sound like a relative?
14642,Susan,"really? well, it sounds like it's coming from your house. you know, it's like a clanging, clanging."
14374,Susan,will you stop acting like tonight was all about helping me? you wanted to go out and have fun and lamont needed a date.
15155,Susan,do i just repulse you?
14117,Susan,is the seventh important?
14219,Susan,yes. what if it just a bunch of far-fetched stories.
17165,Susan,ugh! get off that poor girl right now!
13646,Susan,"oh!uh, yes, and a lovely corner it is too. i hate to bother you while you're working but i was just wondering if you could point me in the direction of a pay phone. oh, and if you had some change for this five , preferably quarters?."
13685,Susan,i checked upon this silvercrest place. it's a treatment center for troubled kids. who's gonna notice one more? i create the distraction. you blend in and find zach.
15106,Susan,"thank you so much,dr. ron."
13559,Susan,technically we have nothing to be ashamed about.
13954,Susan,oh my god. this is so wonderful!
13835,Susan,so what? you obviously don't love him.
15479,Susan,"now i wish i hadn't torched our wedding photos.who would've thought, after everything that's happened,that we would've ended up back here again?"
15292,Susan,wow.wow.
13636,Susan,"well,time flies when you're on a stakeout in crack town."
14773,Susan,you must be so relieved.
14059,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
17746,Susan,i don't understand. carlos might get his sight back. you should be thrilled.
15696,Susan,"hey, it's just me again. um-- when you got the invitation, i thought that you gave me the thumbs up, but i guess if that was actually-- some other type of finger gesture, uh-- well, i apologize for leaving you all these messages and wasting your time."
17291,Susan,"we're not inviting you to poker. we're not talking to you. we're not even gonna wave when you jog by. from now on, you are invisible."
15984,Susan,who cares? go!
16954,Susan,"oh, my god. that's great!"
13412,Susan,why she did it. oh! let me help you.
16198,Susan,you do not get to decide this for her! what were you thinking?!
17468,Susan,apology accepted.
16504,Susan,how we doing on time?
15093,Susan,i don't know.
17030,Susan,"if the cover has holes in it, the book is no good."
16085,Susan,oh.
15026,Susan,"oh, my god. stop. right now. i'm gonna go pay this thing."
15929,Susan,mm.
15348,Susan,"um, we'll just be a second.just wheel me.be right back."
13512,Susan,"oh, no, she did not!"
16587,Susan,"oh, mike."
14273,Susan,"yeah, you really did. so let's go call the insurance company."
16167,Susan,things are different now! i-i love you! you--you don't have to worry about that anymore. if we're gonna make this relationship work then you have to trust me and why are you smiling at me?
14713,Susan,poor julie.
13739,Susan,"oh god, why couldn't i have just have been knocked unconscious?"
17131,Susan,"well, yeah, sure, someday, but right now i just love having you take care of me. all the cooking and the cleaning and the alphabetizing--it's helping me feel like i'm not just about to fall apart."
17337,Susan,"well, i'm not sure that the world war ii argument is gonna fly."
14795,Susan,i'm sorry. i just can't trust you anymore.
13716,Susan,"you shelled your own crabs? okay, i don't want to butt in, but are you doing too much? because you look exhausted."
15074,Susan,"i think he should spend some time with decent role model,don't you?"
14189,Susan,"oh, my god, yes. we should do that."
15311,Susan,"ow,nurse hisel!ugh! nurse--oh!"
15979,Susan,"yeah, it's been a week. i'm getting on her nerves."
17258,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to go blurting all our deepest, darkest secrets."
15594,Susan,are you-- okay?
17948,Susan,fantastic.
13905,Susan,"uh, try ripping up old photos. it helps."
13535,Susan,what's that?
16959,Susan,"what do you mean, ""it's fine now""? he's dead."
13764,Susan,"well, what? realistically, i've known this guy a few weeks. i mean, he could be a hit man for the mob!"
14177,Susan,not my type.
18100,Susan,"well, okay, it's not, because i'm alone but i'm not lonely 'cause i have friends. love doesn't happen for everyone. you know what? i don't even know if it's gonna happen for me anymore. but my friends are there for me no matter what, and that helps. so at the very least, you know, let me be there for you--as a friend."
18076,Susan,"okay, i'm probably just blowing this out of proportion. i mean, she never even said anything about being gay."
15776,Susan,"no, i'm good."
15680,Susan,"he's karl.he's playing me. but that house is gonna be a great place for my daughter to live.and when he makes his move, he's gonna realize that i was really playing him.so-- about that ring--"
16020,Susan,"oh, it's also a disaster area. i didn't get a chance to clean it today."
16956,Susan,i was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling. i didn't have to do that with my last baby.
17739,Susan,yeah. but what friend? wait. is this a woman friend?
17752,Susan,"of course, even though i still think you're beautiful just the way you are."
14975,Susan,thank you.
16527,Susan,i know.
17832,Susan,yeah. sure. why not?
13793,Susan,"lynette, it's just, this really isn't the time--"
13895,Susan,for you? of course it is.
17073,Susan,"by giving pills to an addict? does that sound helpful to you, mrs. kowalsky?"
15687,Susan,"karl, we've been through a lot together.we will always be connected by julie, but-- i know why you bought me that house, and i'm not moving into it."
17515,Susan,"yeah, sure, on alternate weekends. that's fine--until-- m.j. needs his daddy, and his daddy's not there."
16452,Susan,i don't wanna talk about it.
16136,Susan,"i remember, and i guess that's enough for him. i'm sorry."
15399,Susan,"wait a second,we're--we're not flirting."
15436,Susan,i just saw edie drive off.how long is she gonna be gone?
15291,Susan,oh.
18013,Susan,you think i don't feed my kid?
15216,Susan,no. it can't wait.
17274,Susan,"the one she won't be helping me with--please tell me it's ""whore."""
15897,Susan,this should never have happened!
16637,Susan,"you and me? oh! well, i-i'm beyond flattered. i-i find you to be an incredibly attractive woman. i just--"
15622,Susan,you know what would be nice?why don't you just stop over for coffee sometime?
17727,Susan,jackson. thank god. where's mike?
17722,Susan,"well, putting a wall around your heart doesn't protect you. it just keeps people out. i learned that the hard way. now with jackson--i remember that i like feeling hopeful. i like believing in ""happily ever after."" i really wish that you felt that way, too."
17058,Susan,yeah.
18328,Susan,mike? you think mike did this?
18190,Susan,"remember to tell him ""annoying and persistent."" and i can make another casserole."
15051,Susan,really?
15319,Susan,i think i have to break up with dr. ron.
14970,Susan,"oh, oh, no. that's okay, you don't have to give me anything, really."
14065,Susan,ooh. valentine's day card. it's pretty.
14833,Susan,"uh, he's my boyfriend, and, and he told me that paul confessed everything to him. oh, and mike has martha's journals, which clearly prove that paul had a motive."
14256,Susan,"i mean, one minute we're making out in his truck and the next thing i know, we're at the hospital and the doctor's digging a bullet out of him. it's just that when i started dating mike, he seemed like such a normal guy, you know?"
17889,Susan,really?
17833,Susan,what does that mean?
13474,Susan,"i'm not really ready for this, i was gonna have a whole speech prepared."
18377,Susan,"aren't you hungry, though? maybe there's a restaurant up ahead."
15638,Susan,"no! no. it's all good. oh! but you should know that your bed doubles as the dining table, and the toilet's in the shower."
13522,Susan,so i guess i'll just head back home.. bye.
15124,Susan,"oh,oh,not that often.i probably just need a good massage."
17510,Susan,"you know what? we've both been incredibly childish here, and it is time one of us took the high road, so i am now going to walk away. please take note of this conflict resolution and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter."
14728,Susan,you know?
14650,Susan,circumstances beyond your control. i get it. so if you'll excuse me.
15987,Susan,"julie,that boy drinks,he steals,and now i find him mauling you on my couch?that's it.i forbid you to see him."
15896,Susan,no! you--you--mike? you don't even want him! you're just doing this to hurt me.
14435,Susan,us too. the house will seem just empty without you
18234,Susan,mike and i got in a car accident.
15370,Susan,"please,please let me explain."
15267,Susan,"oh,no,edie--"
14658,Susan,"not if you're sucking my exhaust, you won't."
13758,Susan,"hey, bongo, come here. you want a treat? hey, mike, where do you keep the dog biscuits?"
14742,Susan,"i should have told mike i saw zach. i'm a horrible person, right?"
13489,Susan,"hey, are you okay?"
15939,Susan,"oh,i cannot believe your timing.i'm about to fly off to paris,and you're inviting boys over for oktoberfest."
17295,Susan,"well, you could see how i, as the nude, snoring whore, would think so."
17960,Susan,"exactly. and so even though i was already halfway to the airport, i turned around and i came home, and, yep, i had left the garbage disposal on. so ever since then, i always check."
13904,Susan,uh--
17871,Susan,so now me wanting to be with the man i love is stupid?
16748,Susan,hey!is something wrong?
16400,Susan,"not mine, okay? that way, we can use it when we visit."
16845,Susan,"and the whole time, i just kept thinking, this is bree's doctor. bree recommended him. he must be the best. so i didn't worry when it was between a needle exchange. and the area's only transvestite bookstore. and i ignored that my shoes stuck to the floor. and there was a cigarette machine in the waiting room. but when i saw the ant traps on his speculum tray, i thought that you and i should have a talk."
14706,Susan,"if you think edie britt cares about anybody other than herself, you are living in a fool's paradise. you don't know her the way i do, and the only reason she's interested in julie is to mess with my head."
17589,Susan,are we doing the right thing here?
16774,Susan,"oh, my god. bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
13974,Susan,that's good to hear.
17987,Susan,"oh, i know, honey. but mommy has a job now. come on. we talked about this. you understand, right? don't be sad. i am gonna pick you both up at 6:00."
14664,Susan,"oh, my god."
17899,Susan,i won't.
16791,Susan,mm-hmm?
14954,Susan,"morty, can, can we just move this along?"
13389,Susan,"heh, well, and julie. uh, it's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighbourhood, we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. sort of a tradition."
15028,Susan,"thursday, coffee at two. be on time."
13714,Susan,mike had to reschedule.
14856,Susan,what?
16987,Susan,"because i am carrying a baby that has your genes. if my doctor told me that there was something wrong with this baby--something physical, i could handle that. i would probably even love it more. but if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul, i don't know what i would do."
14989,Susan,i just wanted to see if you were okay.
15473,Susan,i don't think so.so i think you should probably stay with edie.and the band is good.you should hire 'em.
13497,Susan,what do you mean?
16423,Susan,"well, ian, you've tasted my cooking. it's not a thank-you. it's revenge."
16125,Susan,"well, mine haven't, and i know something that bree probably doesn't. when orson was seventeen, he spent time in a mental institution."
14209,Susan,"see? now that's a lie, too, because there were plenty of right moments."
15022,Susan,but you were with a prostitute.
17782,Susan,you're home kind of early. is everything okay?
18303,Susan,good news. looks like we're getting fake married after all.
15061,Susan,uh--oh!
18284,Susan,yeah. he was on board when he found out there was cake.
17595,Susan,thanks. do you like scotch?
16615,Susan,gaby--
13867,Susan,"he's right. sorry, guys!"
15318,Susan,"oh,yeah,i'll be surprised.so i guess we have the whole insurance thing worked out."
17409,Susan,is it? i can't tell. ooh! excuse me.
16094,Susan,mike was arrested for murder.
15194,Susan,"after the embezzlement,lonny let the policy lapse.and now he's in jail,and i'm gonna die."
16364,Susan,you've been awfully quiet since we left the market. is everything okay?
18141,Susan,"so is it just you, or do you have a family?"
14734,Susan,oh. do you mind keeping those and pass them out when people get their ice cream?
15866,Susan,"uh, that's my macaroni and cheese. i-i was hoping it would trigger mike's memory. i made it the first time we met two years ago."
16507,Susan,"it's devastating! if i go with mike, ian's heart will be broken, and ian does not deserve that. but how can i reject mike after all he's been through?"
14910,Susan,"oh, julie."
15361,Susan,where's he going?
16344,Susan,how do you think tom's gonna feel about that?
16477,Susan,who is it this time?
15415,Susan,oh! get out! get--
18057,Susan,"well, i wanted to do something more free. it's an imagination-building exercise."
16737,Susan,"damn it,lynette. what did we say after mary alice.after edie? why didn't they tell us?"
14709,Susan,"i'll be right back."" ""oh, um, i'm just gonna need a couple of seconds, so feel free to pray."
16955,Susan,thanks for everything. thank you.
14063,Susan,"well, we've all been in their house. have you ever seen a picture of another kid there? i mean, why keep dana's baby blanket and throw out all the photos?"
15373,Susan,i'm fine!
17808,Susan,"sweetie, if you're worried that i don't like your daddy spending time with katherine, don't be. i think it's great."
15448,Susan,"well,you guys are busy.we should go."
15721,Susan,"oh, um, you might want to give jane a sponge bath cause she had a little accident."
18431,Susan,"karl,just stop."
17615,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
17531,Susan,wow! isn't it fantastic?
14827,Susan,why--are you doing here?
13766,Susan,"yeah, and he retired. i try not to take that personally."
13727,Susan,"good night, edie."
14354,Susan,i've been plenty supportive.
16532,Susan,that's not true. i will get over him.
16121,Susan,"well, okay then. you know, mike barely remembers me. what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again?"
16743,Susan,really? that's fantastic!
17426,Susan,"well, i've sort of start seeing someone. so i might do something with him."
14370,Susan,"oh, i'm embarrassing you."
13432,Susan,hey.
14926,Susan,"believe me, i don't feel superior."
18137,Susan,"no, it's okay. it landed on the detergent box."
17080,Susan,"you might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse--and with a baby on the way."
13339,Susan,tell me again why i fought for custody of you?
14279,Susan,yes! mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter
16029,Susan,how long has rupert worked for you?
14716,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
18424,Susan,"i'm having trouble with the family across the street. i think one of them may have set a fire in my house, and i don't know why, but i feel like it might have something to do with my friend who killed herself. i called the police, but they didn't take me seriously. this family has a secret, a bad secret. i think i'm in over my head. i need you to find out everything you can about paul young and his family. do you think you can help me?"
15595,Susan,"yeah, when you flip out in front of the pep squad,word travels fast."
16066,Susan,"okay, i guess it's time we have the conversation. ian, haven't you ever wondered why i've never cooked for you?"
16886,Susan,"oh, look, i made a terrible first impression, so i thought i'd make them some of my home-baked goodness."
15586,Susan,"yeah. i'm sort of up against the wall.the insurance company needs proof fast,and things are sort of weird at bree's.i don't wanna over stay my welcome."
15443,Susan,are-- are you saying--that you're gonna go through with this wedding--unless i tell you not to?
17375,Susan,i want to be able to reach you this summer when you're doing that internship.
15738,Susan,oh my god!
14933,Susan,"of course. yeah, i see that."
18354,Susan,"yeah, well, i don't know if that's gonna happen."
13499,Susan,oh. goodnight.
15737,Susan,in that case i'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles. is that okay?
17006,Susan,"oh, sure. i'll--i'll bring up a tray."
15064,Susan,"well, that's great,isn't it?"
16428,Susan,"look, ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday, and you are not--i repeat--not going to accept."
17447,Susan,"you guys were insulting each other. that's good, right?"
17185,Susan,"then you came down here and you couldn't remember what it was. that happens to me all the time. well, the baby is insisting that i eat the last piece of"
17692,Susan,before that.
14835,Susan,"mike, paul young is back. look."
15700,Susan,"look, i know it's been six months but he could still come out of it, right?i saw on the news there was this woman in peru, she woke up after ten years."
16133,Susan,"yeah, and he is fantastic. you cannot believe the scum he has gotten off. not that you're scum. but, you know, if you were, you'd be sitting pretty."
18357,Susan,really.
14066,Susan,and meticulously hand painted. whoever sent you that must really love you.
16557,Susan,"can't? there's no ""can't"" in love. there's a man on that mountain that i intend to spend the rest of my life with, and nothing is gonna keep me from him-- not fate, not destiny and definitely not you."
18367,Susan,"oh, my god. i--i-i had no idea. i'm so sorry."
15842,Susan,what?
17751,Susan,fine. you're a pig.
15214,Susan,"no! no. ha!no, to-- to a gay guy.how did you know about the doctor?"
17188,Susan,all right. we don't need to talk about it. just promise me it won't happen again.
17851,Susan,because--he loves me.
13492,Susan,today. right before the party.
16827,Susan,so you were paid a very nice compliment today.
16414,Susan,"hi. ian, about what i said--"
18389,Susan,m.j.! don't come out!
14284,Susan,what's wrong?
18079,Susan,i don't remember.
17227,Susan,"trying to protect your mother? i know. who cares? you drove the car, you ran him over, and you left him for dead!"
14003,Susan,"i've been thinking about this for the last ninety miles and you don't have to forgive me. you can go to the police, kick me, you can burn my house down. you just have to know that i am so racked with guilt, i don't think it's possible for me to suffer any more than i'm already suffering."
14275,Susan,let's go.
14029,Susan,mrs. van de kamp needed volunteers. she begged me.
18092,Susan,no. and--as on the softball team.
13536,Susan,"well, that's not-"
17438,Susan,"oh, hey!"
18209,Susan,how about a pot of coffee? or i could just--straighten up in here?
17523,Susan,"well, i sort of started seeing someone."
16137,Susan,"take care of yourself, mike."
13437,Susan,"uh, i'm gonna say no."
16681,Susan,and--break!
13702,Susan,hmm. how about midnight?
17976,Susan,"yes. right. no, wrong."
18251,Susan,um--how about dinner tomorrow night?
16307,Susan,how was the game?
15020,Susan,yeah.
15353,Susan,i am aware of that.
14376,Susan,"yeah, i do and that's what makes me so crazy. the difference between you and i, that you could be heartbroken and you can just move on and i am just broken."
15004,Susan,i just want a chance to get to know you.
16837,Susan,"oh, i can talk him into it. what's his name?"
15112,Susan,"well,somebody has to do something,'cause i'm losing sleep."
17042,Susan,"yeah, good-looking and smart. only problem is, where is she gonna find someone else like that?"
15830,Susan,"well, okay. you gotta promise me we'll actually leave the hotel room."
13843,Susan,"paul, my daughter doesn't lie."
14080,Susan,thank you.
13964,Susan,"hello, anybody home?"
15540,Susan,why?
17655,Susan,mm. now you tell me something i don't know about you.
18334,Susan,hey. i need to talk to mike.
17918,Susan,"oh, well, on one hand, i got dumped for a pair of headlights named brandy. on the other, i reported karl's credit cards stolen, and cut the pockets out of all of his pants. so a little from column ""a,"" a little from column ""b."" sorry."
17906,Susan,i'm in. how much are we talking?
14679,Susan,"so you and edie are, are gonna be an act."
17499,Susan,"oh! wait. your forgot your whistle. okay, sweetie. this is just to be on the safe side. if juanita comes around, you just blow it. i'll be right there."
16036,Susan,wow! your timing's perfect.
15548,Susan,"great! oh,the one down here is broken.why don't you use the one upstairs?it's right off my bedroom."
13785,Susan,"i just came over to say i'm sorry, and i'll pay for all the damage."
16177,Susan,"don't change the subject. are you two having sex? because i thought that i raised you to be smarter than that. don't you realize that sex is not fun and games? it's dangerous. every time you turn around, there's a new disease. do you want it to burn when you pee?"
16561,Susan,"little help. so anyway, the whole situation with mike--it just seemed hopeless and that's when i decided to take a chance with ian."
17518,Susan,"well, i don't see any kid of yours being a victim. you're the strongest person i know."
14411,Susan,alright then.
15295,Susan,what are you doing here?
15238,Susan,i know.i was listening to you.
13598,Susan,bye.
17341,Susan,"delfino, maynard."
16444,Susan,"well, i'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight, point those lips at maggie."
18038,Susan,"all right, you guys think what you want. i'm gonna choose to believe her."
15712,Susan,the coffee machines was broken so i got us a couple of smoothies.they had strawberry and strawberry.
13811,Susan,"oh, that's okay. i've got it."
18323,Susan,hello?
13986,Susan,"well, you know high school. thank god we leave that behind!"
16181,Susan,"oh, thank god. if you're not having sex, why were you talking about condoms?"
17466,Susan,i am such a jackass.
13795,Susan,i hope the kids aren't too much for danielle to handle.
14927,Susan,you're right. he made his choice.
16686,Susan,i hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
13435,Susan,"oh no, it's okay."
18000,Susan,"yes, and imagine my surprise, 'cause the last time i talked to mike, he promised me he was picking up m.j. from school."
14996,Susan,"well, i wasn't consulted on that little arrangement."
15233,Susan,but-- we were actually married.
14136,Susan,no.
16299,Susan,"mike, what are you doing here?"
17994,Susan,"really? i thought we were using katherine for all sorts of things--sending messages, raising our kid."
16671,Susan,what?
15773,Susan,hmm? so what are you really doing here?
17176,Susan,so you didn't go back?
16813,Susan,"no, no, we can salvage this. just work with me."
14239,Susan,"so, can i?"
16267,Susan,"i thought after we got through this really--painful day, things would start to get better. i thought i could be more a part of your world. now all your friends and family are just gonna think of me as the crazy lady from jane's funeral. oh, god. oh, ian. okay, this is not supposed to be about me. you should be upstairs--saying good-bye. i'm just gonna hide out here with the departed until everybody leaves."
17392,Susan,"well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep."
17881,Susan,this is not proof of anything.
16730,Susan,"no,you said you did."
18176,Susan,"look, travers, we're all moms here. we've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us."
17512,Susan,i brought booze.
17148,Susan,"katherine, dylan, hi. what's up?"
16980,Susan,"you know, i expected to meet a guy that was racked with remorse, and instead, i'm looking across the table at this--"
15990,Susan,"yes, and you will be poorly educated, and you won't get into college, and you will work for minimum wage for the rest of your life, all because of that boy! i hope you're happy!"
16560,Susan,"no, no. i'm invigorated. this fresh mountain air is--aah!"
15378,Susan,"no,ron,don't go!"
16770,Susan,"well, it sounds like this party could be on the wild side, and it is starting very late."
16903,Susan,"well, long enough for them to worry. you know, the more they worry, the more i'm a hero. get it?"
16056,Susan,you don't have to push jane out to let me in.
17852,Susan,i'm getting there.
18206,Susan,you're kidding. so soon?
14287,Susan,morty? no!!
17508,Susan,i was trying to teach her not to be a bully--something she should have learned from her mother.
13824,Susan,sorry i'm late.
16196,Susan,don't you walk away from me!
16629,Susan,oh! well--
17424,Susan,"oh, good. mmm. okay, you have fun, sweetie."
17799,Susan,what? i don't do that.
13621,Susan,you don't have to explain.
16715,Susan,okay.
14548,Susan,"not so tough now, are you?"
14210,Susan,"every time we went out for pizza, you could have said, ""oh, and by the way, i once killed a man."" or when you said, ""hey, let's go jogging,"" you could have said, ""well, by the way, i once killed a man."" every time we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy, you could have turned to me and said, ""oh, and by the way, i did that once."" you didn't."
16224,Susan,"oh, 'cause he's a great kid, and he's gonna want to help mike--and you're not gonna be wearing a bra when you ask him out."
14196,Susan,are you okay?
17240,Susan,my god.
15044,Susan,"believe me, i didn't want to hurt anyone. i just wanted to find my dad."
17094,Susan,"you keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse."
14172,Susan,why?
14998,Susan,"do you want to tell her, or should i? i'm your husband's guardian angel."
14711,Susan,"well, like i said, i'm sorry. i wish it could be you up there."
13577,Susan,"yeah. yeah, that's okay ,isn't it, mike?"
17843,Susan,never mind her. she was just leaving.
18240,Susan,"oh, not with karl. by the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing left to split."
16660,Susan,"oh, i have an idea. i just got a lipstick yesterday. you could wear that."
17199,Susan,"clearly. you know, when you were out on the lawn, you said something about mike."
17485,Susan,"you know what, boys? not in the house. oh, my god!"
16588,Susan,will you marry me?
14841,Susan,"well, okay--"
16839,Susan,"bree, just get me the number."
14483,Susan,"well, i can't have doughnuts and juice. it's unnatural."
13434,Susan,"oh, god. uh, i-stopped and i got this, uh. i am just so sorry for this."
17306,Susan,"i'm sorry. i panicked. your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks, and you said nothing. i had to come up with a plan."
16823,Susan,"hi, gaby. it's me. i'm throwing a party saturday night. guess what kind?"
16639,Susan,together!
17140,Susan,are you always this sarcastic with your clients?
16843,Susan,"a friend of mine recommended this place. it's not exactly what i expected. must be one heck of a doctor, though, huh?"
14816,Susan,"mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?"
15450,Susan,what?
18246,Susan,why didn't you call?
16907,Susan,"oh. well, would you like me to help you look for him?"
17231,Susan,"how can you do that? he put you in a coma. i sat there day after day, wondering if you were gonna live. as far as i'm concerned, orson can go to hell."
17953,Susan,"yeah, well, if we were still married, you'd--probably would've waited until i finished my sentence."
14386,Susan,how? are you going to give me your corneas?
16383,Susan,you?
13450,Susan,i think we should go through with it.
16674,Susan,"okay, well, that's crazy. you can't work round the clock. it's not healthy."
15114,Susan,he needs to see me or he wants to see me?
14539,Susan,why?
14361,Susan,tim!
17853,Susan,mike and i will never get back together. i know that now. and i really need to move on with my life.
14829,Susan,i don't want my pie filling.
14259,Susan,you tracked us down?
15308,Susan,i am not!
13648,Susan,"oh,thank you so much! you're saving my life!!"
14647,Susan,what?
17542,Susan,"i know! you did great! jackson, can i see you a sec?"
13803,Susan,give me the dress.
15883,Susan,"ouch, that hurts.um, okay, remember this spot?this is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss."
16333,Susan,"well, who's getting divorced? i'm in this for keeps."
14185,Susan,"paul. you know, he said it was an accident,but i'm telling you, i think that's why mary alice was being blackmailed."
14100,Susan,"what, what does this mean?"
18119,Susan,"this is nothing, mr. hobson. we were just having a difference of opinion."
16597,Susan,so forget what julie told you about the wedding being off. it's back on.
16033,Susan,"great. nine o'clock in the morning, and i have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress. hey, here's an idea. you keep some things in a drawer at my house. would it be okay if i had one here?"
17142,Susan,"yeah, i was sorry to hear about your job. you know, ever since n.a.f.t.a., corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the american worker. is that right? i heard somebody say that on n.p.r., and i just keep repeating it to people."
13833,Susan,"okay, you want me to talk? you're going to find helen rowland, and you're going to tell her the truth, before everyone in this neighborhood thinks that i'm the one sleeping with an underage boy."
14024,Susan,"well, i'm glad you can laugh about this."
15455,Susan,"mike,hi! what a surprise."
17992,Susan,"we already thanked her, buddy. let's not make her uncomfortable."
14017,Susan,you think?
18391,Susan,what are you gonna do to us?
18201,Susan,"hey. i'm on my way to work, but i just wanted to bring you these. uh, chicken salad sandwiches, which i did not make. i bought. i learned my lesson from the casserole."
14486,Susan,"and on a completely unrelated topic, mike and i are moving in together. see ya."
16569,Susan,"well, then. we'll just be happy."
16469,Susan,you bet me in a game of poker?
16387,Susan,i guess we're gonna cut right to the--
14605,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
13514,Susan,"what am i supposed to say to mike, ""i saw you half naked so i thought i'd drop by?"""
16631,Susan,"i think so, too. but, you know, then i remember, that's what i thought about me and karl."
15231,Susan,i still don't have insurance.i need to get that operation.i'm--i'm really screwed.
16522,Susan,"about that, uh, obviously, have been very confused. i finally saw a therapist. actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing.anyway--well, i need to talk to you."
13903,Susan,"no, no really, i'm, i'm sorry you had to go through that. i am."
13619,Susan,"no.no. i just uh, was wondering your opinion."
17546,Susan,damn it.
18120,Susan,"shut up, karl."
16219,Susan,"oh, come on. mike needs a great lawyer. zach can afford a great lawyer."
16805,Susan,"well, believe it. we're going. you, too, dylan. come on."
18338,Susan,i don't know. jealousy? jackson thinks mike is still hung up on me.
14035,Susan,"well, the other day he could have cared less about julie and zach dating, and now, all of a sudden, he shows up at the dance?"
16416,Susan,yeah.
14056,Susan,"zach, um, julie is only fourteen years old, and sometimes girls, when they're that age they just don't always make the right decisions. and, um, as her mother, it is my responsibiliity to protect her."
17342,Susan,"oh. working. busy, busy, busy. uh, but he told me to tell you that he's totally cool with it."
16251,Susan,so how are you holding up?
15148,Susan,a what?
13765,Susan,i never get out of the house.
13840,Susan,"julie, in the letters, did zach say anything about running away?"
13340,Susan,"oh, that're right."
14944,Susan,"well, i'm sorry to upset you, mom, i just, don't you think that's weird?"
15875,Susan,"no, what are you-- oh, this is ridiculous! i mean, who am i disturbing? it's a coma ward! don't you want them to wake up?!"
16392,Susan,move away from that topic.
18174,Susan,"what do you mean, you two were the hottest chic?"
13477,Susan,what does that mean?
13315,Susan,sorry i'm late.
15825,Susan,i love this music. what's it about?
17326,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. i know how much you loved him."
15211,Susan,"oh. oh,so by marrying me--"
16759,Susan,"oh, whoa. no, hang on. let me just run and get julie so she can say good-bye to dylan."
17123,Susan,"hey, everybody. i'm sorry to interrupt, but the smell of that apple pie just made my mouth water."
14129,Susan,hi.
13856,Susan,mike.
16601,Susan,what?
16441,Susan,"oh, uh--he's just a neighbor."
17477,Susan,get out.
16949,Susan,"hey, lynette."
15055,Susan,"hey, what happened to the applewhites?i thought you were gonna invite them."
17283,Susan,children's books pay.
14922,Susan,"i'm sorry, what?"
15042,Susan,"oh, carol, you don't have to clean that up. they have clerks for that."
15519,Susan,"yeah,i kind of figured that."
14643,Susan,"there! there, that was it. did you hear it?"
16004,Susan,"big picture, karl. his hand up our daughter's shirt."
18320,Susan,i'm sorry. we'll go fishing another time.
16191,Susan,to watch movies.
13666,Susan,"i got to say, i was a little surprised to see mary alice's award for sale. she got it for doing charity work, from the chamber of commerce."
13865,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry, are you okay?"
14865,Susan,"no, no, no."
14725,Susan,yeah?
15217,Susan,"oh, yeah.no, i'm sorry.l-- that was really-- it."
17147,Susan,these receipts are self-explanatory. i'd even know why i'm here.
14041,Susan,i've been so concerned about julie lately that i sort of eavesdropped on her the other day when she was having a phone conversation with zach.
16970,Susan,thank you.
13750,Susan,"knock, knock!"
18022,Susan,absolutely. anything else you need?
16692,Susan,"and just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers."
18067,Susan,look at you. you're like that schoolmarm in the movies who lets down her hair and va-va-va-voom.
14318,Susan,mom. i brought her over.
17307,Susan,i didn't say it was a good plan. do you see the effect she has on me? i just thank god i wasn't drinking coffee. i could've hurt myself.
15774,Susan,ian.
15784,Susan,hide pathetically in your room?
16541,Susan,"oh, my god. what--where is he now?"
16816,Susan,"i'm sorry. you gotta understand, for so long, it's just been julie and me, and i've made all the decisions alone. you felt so strongly."
15538,Susan,who is it?
13755,Susan,"sounds great. um, you do know that it's like a two-hour drive up there. and isn't that kind of late to be coming back?"
16037,Susan,"yeah, rupe, i hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me."
16175,Susan,"oh! i found it. austin, i would like to talk to my daughter privately."
17321,Susan,like the deodorant?
16432,Susan,"mike, i am marrying ian. we have hired a caterer. we are going with the salmon, so just back off!"
15891,Susan,"oh, but you--i was just trying to help him remember.tell her, mike.we were-- we were making progress."
14121,Susan,julie!
15765,Susan,"bree, we are just doing this because we love you. but, if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt--"
15924,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry that you had to see that."
13826,Susan,"oh no, isn't helen rowland going last?"
17155,Susan,i'm having a baby. i can't give birth with brittle bones. go!
15078,Susan,"no, and we're not planning on telling him."
16676,Susan,is this about the wedding?
13644,Susan,"i'd rather take my chances on the street, thank you very much."
16016,Susan,bree said you got a job on the first day. you're such a star! i want details.
14130,Susan,"now? well, i'm, i'm sorry, my daughter and i were going to go see a movie tonight."
16938,Susan,"i would love to, but--"
15893,Susan,"no, no, no, no! no, no, this--this is not how this ends. no, evil does not triumph over good."
16064,Susan,"and they know about me as in ""mum, dad, bloody good news. i've got myself a smashing new girlfriend."""
18263,Susan,maximum allowance exceeded.
14119,Susan,"oh. oh, my god, yes. yes, yes, i was with mike that night."
18327,Susan,so--did the immigration people tell you how they found out about you?
16741,Susan,"no problem.um,what's up?"
17963,Susan,i have been naked on this street. it would be nice to take the heat off that story.
14288,Susan,why would he shove you?
15499,Susan,"yes, like you wouldn't believe."
14272,Susan,"mom, mike and i aren't together anymore."
17623,Susan,jackson? it's me. hello? that'll work.
16777,Susan,count me in.
17894,Susan,and i was just trying to be nice and give you a free pass for being such a big slut! edie!
15813,Susan,"don't judge me, mr. virgin--plus one!"
14955,Susan,"okay, again, what does this have to do with my father?"
14630,Susan,so how have you been doing?
18349,Susan,"yeah. that and, uh--i don't know. it d-did kind of come out of nowhere."
14217,Susan,i haven't read it.
15978,Susan,wait. julie's gonna know we came home early from the restaurant to check up on her. i don't want her to think i'm overprotective and clingy.
14271,Susan,what happened?
17369,Susan,"well, yes, but don't forget--it is a huge honor."
14615,Susan,"oh, now is not a good time, danny."
16099,Susan,so did you tell the police that you think orson killed monique?
16568,Susan,"well. i'm going to apologize, and then i'm gonna tell him that i made a huge mistake--"
15937,Susan,edie's nephew? since when are you friends with him?
16710,Susan,"oh,you don't need to do that."
14813,Susan,what?
13630,Susan,i dunno. what does that mean anyway? my life is complicated?
14098,Susan,i'm so sorry.
17999,Susan,"no, sweetie. we are just trying to figure out what is best for you. aren't we?"
16223,Susan,thank you! this is a noble thing you're doing.
16526,Susan,"oh, i'm gonna lock up down here. why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?"
17647,Susan,mm.
16248,Susan,"okay, yes, it'll be weird. but it's not about me. this is about jane and ian. what if i wore this one?"
15873,Susan,"girlfriend?! okay, you know what? i want marcy's number in honolulu, and i want it right now."
17867,Susan,nothing. it's locked. do you have a key?
14393,Susan,"well, yeah, we did. we were just looking. it doesn't matter, it was dumb."
16884,Susan,"come on, bree. you have to let us do this."
15276,Susan,"well,that's a little extreme."
15886,Susan,"i'm good. finally, a smile."
13467,Susan,"no, but god, you should've seen the look on his face."
16614,Susan,"gaby, i spent months planning that wedding."
18222,Susan,okay.
17268,Susan,it's nice to meet you.
18041,Susan,i don't know. she seemed to love the painting--until i told her that i painted it.
14264,Susan,what does that mean?
13997,Susan,"well, it's, it's really no, no big deal."
14887,Susan,"karl, did you cheat again?"
18217,Susan,"oh, okay. uh, what did i do?"
15623,Susan,"i mean, that is after i get running water and electricity again--and a coffeemaker."
17465,Susan,he said that?
14091,Susan,"oh, okay. thanks."
17078,Susan,"what's the problem? let's see. you lied to me. uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter. you lied to me some more, and then i find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills."
14752,Susan,because there are still people at home who care about you and there's things that you need to know.
17920,Susan,brandy's not a redhead. she's blonde.
17561,Susan,jason taught him to ride the bike.
15627,Susan,"oh, help!can anybody hear me? julie?i, i need you to try to unlock the door. oh, what am i saying?okay , i need you to unbuckle yourself and try to find a neighbor."
14818,Susan,mom!
17116,Susan,this has just replaced your birth as the best day of my life.
18247,Susan,"well, you did."
17483,Susan,he's only 5. i don't want him fighting.
15762,Susan,"well, you know what we have to do."
13364,Susan,oh..
14126,Susan,"no, no, of course not. i could never think you killed anybody, even i wasn't your alibi, which i am."
15823,Susan,what? what were you gonna say?
17100,Susan,"okay, lynette, listen to me. they are all going to be fine. i know it."
14629,Susan,"oh, it's fine. they're in the garage."
14250,Susan,"thank you. i know, i'm going to. it's on the top of my list."
13982,Susan,"okay, here's the deal, edie. i, i -"
17738,Susan,"mm, i hate macadamia nuts. you think they're white chocolate chips until it's too late. stupid hawaii. who made 'em?"
14697,Susan,"she did not pick you. it just didn't occur to her that i would agree to do it. well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again, she'd pick me."
17649,Susan,"yes. we're starting completely over, so this time, we're gonna do things right."
17520,Susan,maybe you need to get mad more often.
18262,Susan,"thanks, but i've reached my maximum allowance for humiliation this week."
16150,Susan,it's me again. you should also know that orson spent a year in an asylum.
15940,Susan,"the last time i checked, i was the parent."
14904,Susan,karl. it'd be so weird.
15863,Susan,"okay, well, i'll go, but i am not giving up on you. you know, you are going to remember the night that we danced to ""car wash,"" and not just because it was fun, but because later that night, we did some things that, trust me, are worth remembering."
16847,Susan,why not?
14053,Susan,what?
15733,Susan,"well, i'm sorry i cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch bree make the worst mistake of her life!"
15387,Susan,"no.no,not really. um--what's the point?"
14045,Susan,everything.
13587,Susan,mr whiskars.
16073,Susan,"well, that's the thing. uh, so i was hoping, you know, if you're not too busy--"
15824,Susan,shh. do you mind? you're kind of drowning out the bells.
15247,Susan,i threw it out my car window somewhere on route 7.
16876,Susan,"hey, neighbor!"
14626,Susan,"oh, um, your father just came over that day and told me some stuff. you know, some stuff that i haven't and can't tell you."
16896,Susan,"hey, i would've made them myself if i knew how. honestly, i'm a good neighbor."
17037,Susan,"gosh, you're studying to be a doctor. that must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or--a girlfriend."
17685,Susan,"oh! look at my little girl. isn't she adorable? oh, i missed her so much."
15881,Susan,punch it!
17913,Susan,all right.
16941,Susan,"okay. if i vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?"
16427,Susan,"yeah. yeah, why not? sure. you know what? do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?"
17616,Susan,we had an agreement to keep things casual.
18390,Susan,now keep the volume really high. you don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.
14019,Susan,"oh, no he's not."
14627,Susan,"um, actually, i think what we're known for is sharing clothes. yeah. i think that's our thing."
16336,Susan,i should probably get these inside.
17667,Susan,thank you--for a wonderful third date. and i'm glad that you're back on board with our plan.
16306,Susan,"oh! oh, s-sorry."
15868,Susan,"uh, yeah. what is she doing here?"
16888,Susan,"mike, they live 15 feet from us. if we have a fire, i wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1."
16547,Susan,"yes. if i don't find mike before he's off that mountain, i may never see him again."
15771,Susan,what are you doing here?
13366,Susan,mike!
13490,Susan,"well, you're probably not wearing the right shoes."
15593,Susan,"you know, it's late.why don't you, uh,go to bed and, you know,let julie and i help you with that in the morning?"
14890,Susan,i'm sorry. are you okay?
14941,Susan,"mom, can i ask you a question?"
17220,Susan,you just don't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow.
14684,Susan,hmm.
15634,Susan,"of course not, but when you see it for the first time, i want you to get the whole impact. ta-da!"
16828,Susan,"yes. i am hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went out their way to insist i invite you."
17756,Susan,it's gotta be lisa wallace.
13593,Susan,"well,i'm the one who discovered the break in and i think i found some evidence."
13792,Susan,"well, i hope that, your, you know, little secret keeps you warm at night because you're throwing something really great away to protect it!"
16819,Susan,oh.
17998,Susan,"no, she's a peach, but she's not the one that dragged me to court to hammer out some custody agreement. now if you'd like, we can go back, and the judge can explain to you the difference between you and your girlfriend."
15407,Susan,she's planned this whole secret wedding.it's a surprise.
16829,Susan,hey. what's this?
14920,Susan,"uh, the big news?"
18211,Susan,do you know what is a great cure for the blues? cribbage. do you have a cribbage set?
17784,Susan,seriously? that's terrible. is she okay?
14820,Susan,"yeah, it did."
16518,Susan,"no, gaby, be reasonable."
17204,Susan,"okay, but in the meantime, um, i do have a teenage daughter, so if you could--"
15514,Susan,yeah.
17417,Susan,"yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you."
16514,Susan,ugh. i wish she'd hurry. i'm terrified of snakes.
18065,Susan,"oh, well, keep looking, 'cause i don't cook, and shanghai panda delivers."
14854,Susan,hey!
18430,Susan,just a second?
15553,Susan,"tu-tuesday?no,no,tuesday's not good,'cause tuesday's the day i,um--become a lesbian."
14555,Susan,"okay, that's because i was wrestling it away from zach so that he wouldn't shoot you."
15915,Susan,ah.
17747,Susan,"gaby, please. most women would kill to look like you."
16389,Susan,all right. we won't talk about it. want some cheese?
18250,Susan,"okay. i just had my car detailed, so i should probably go."
16700,Susan,"i watch you sometimes,and you seem very, disconnected,like something's missing."
17373,Susan,"well, i'm sure she's just upset, and she'll come home after she cools off."
14329,Susan,because she wants to move in with me.
13775,Susan,"bongo? oh, oh! don't do that! bongo!"
16565,Susan,bug.
16840,Susan,i'm so excited. pregnant gals sharing a doctor!
16268,Susan,"ian, are you proposing to me?"
18343,Susan,"okay, katherine, that is--it's totally unfair to mike. i mean, he needs to know the truth."
15807,Susan,i'm with a client. take a number.
18224,Susan,it's just your belts and ties. the police kept the rest.
16945,Susan,"yeah, i'm sorry. you know, tired people aren't witty."
15780,Susan,"yep, scenery's great.so, um, maybe i should unpack.where should i do that?"
17036,Susan,pre-med? really?
13972,Susan,"oh. so, she must have written a lot of things in them?"
16862,Susan,what do you think you're doing? you can't leave yet.
15358,Susan,"no,no. i got it,i got it."
17460,Susan,"nothing. just, the answering machine lied to mommy."
17052,Susan,what?
17087,Susan,are you sure that's all it is?
18335,Susan,"oh, no need, i will wait."
14048,Susan,"paul, i am so sorry."
17745,Susan,"i'm not, but now you have to tell me who she is. fine. have it your way. oh, if he ever needs a transfusion, you are not allowed to give him my blood."
16849,Susan,"okay, everybody, let the games begin. um, okay. i will be team captain one. who wants to be captain number two?"
13861,Susan,mike?
15853,Susan,oh. but you're gonna be all right. and i'm gonna help you remember.
15557,Susan,"you're always worried about julie and me,and you beat up my new boyfriend.and now you're protecting me from edie.do you know what all that means?"
16390,Susan,"well, he's busy. isn't he debating the mayor tonight?"
16247,Susan,"no, it'll be fine. ian wants me there."
13410,Susan,"i just wanted to come by and say hello, you know, see how you guys are doing."
14020,Susan,"don't tell me to chill, i have no intentions of chilling."
14579,Susan,"he held a gun to my face, so i'm thinking, good."
16649,Susan,so this is what marriage is about? having someone to hide behind?
16409,Susan,this is from me and ian.
13900,Susan,here you are.
18039,Susan,"uh, look at what i found-- my beach painting."
15312,Susan,"nurse hisel,i can explain."
18025,Susan,hey.
16835,Susan,"well, that's because i don't blush when orson says, ""open wide""."
14008,Susan,our poker games?
15686,Susan,we're in.
14099,Susan,so?
18364,Susan,"oh, sweetie. you just had one, and we don't want to have to stop ten times so you can go to the bathroom."
17260,Susan,and karl made his happy monkey face. did you notice that?
14469,Susan,right. i appreciate you talking to me.
17293,Susan,"well, that's gonna change real soon."
15994,Susan,"oh, my god. you don't--"
17677,Susan,i thought you were blocked.
13396,Susan,but only i'm going. because you're gonna come down with something semi-serious that requires bed-rest and fluids.
16851,Susan,i pick lynette. where's lynette?
17383,Susan,"my god! bree,are you all right?"
15505,Susan,"she's a slutty, slutty whore.absolutely."
17091,Susan,yeah.
16179,Susan,what?
15859,Susan,"at the car wash, whoa, whoa--"
13447,Susan,so when is this shindig?
16447,Susan,but he was cleared. all charges dropped. here. eat this.
16718,Susan,sorry.
14083,Susan,"oh, that's so wonderful what you wrote, thank you. okay, i'm not gonna be any kind of company until i get something off my chest. do you remember the other day when you said that you wanted to have kids?"
13381,Susan,shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?
16118,Susan,why?
16917,Susan,"$2,000?"
17961,Susan,"oh, you know what? i'm actually still worried about the side door. do you think you could check that, too?"
17698,Susan,"yeah. only twice. two. small number. much smaller than three. and my first cheated on me, so that doesn't even count."
14723,Susan,"zach's your son, and, and i have julie and you're totally accepted her. i mean, granted, she's been the model child, so far, but she's almost fifteen. she's gonna turn on me any minute. you better be there to help me when it gets ugly."
15135,Susan,"oh,are you sure?um,because i would look a lot better over the phone right now."
14661,Susan,"edie, come back here! we're not finished yet!"
14160,Susan,well--i'm a little sad. mike and i were just a fling. and not even a full fling. sort of a borderline fling.
14597,Susan,"obviously, um, it was quite a shock, but it's good news any way you slice it."
16448,Susan,sorry.
14434,Susan,really???!!!!
13338,Susan,"you're right. so, is that your project for school? you know in 5th grade i made the white house out of sugar cubes."
14971,Susan,i have a dad! he's great! he gave me a hat!
13566,Susan,mike!
14270,Susan,hey mom.
18046,Susan,"why not? i mean, you loved that painting until you found out that i did it, and then you acted totally petty."
13322,Susan,"yeah. i'm just so angry. if mary alice was having problems, she should have come to us; she should have let us help her."
15906,Susan,mike? it's me. are you decent?
16890,Susan,"that's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please."
18101,Susan,my boots.
14600,Susan,"but i am so happy for you. really, you have a child, and that is good for you."
17161,Susan,really? cause it sounded like a girl.
18417,Susan,"thank you, zach. you have just made this really easy for me. you are now forbidden from seeing or talking my daughter ever again! and if you come within ten feet of her, i will call the police, and i will have you arrested! now get out!"
17702,Susan,that has got to stop. i'm gonna do something.
13379,Susan,shut up.
13823,Susan,exactly. you are not mature enough to have a realistic perspective on this relationship. you would be so much happier with a girl your own age.
16740,Susan,i'm in here.
13595,Susan,"i tried! but they sort of laughed at me, because apparently nothing was taken from mrs fome's house."
17519,Susan,"well, i thought i had you beaten today, and next think i knew, i was eating grass."
16362,Susan,that was the first night that we spent together.
16466,Susan,get out!
14755,Susan,"yeah, well, julie's a really special girl."
16695,Susan,i can't believe this is happening.it's like mary alice all over again.
13378,Susan,"well, isn't it worse to be in the dark, imagining she did all these horrible things?"
16030,Susan,"so you're that close, and you never told him about me?"
17714,Susan,i'm--just movin' to the music.
14619,Susan,"what are you saying, that your father actually told you he was gonna be having a one night stand with edie britt?"
13660,Susan,favourite band?
14724,Susan,good night.
15892,Susan,"oh, uh, mike!"
14043,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
17710,Susan,"hey, you two. what's going on?"
16605,Susan,"oh, right! i have to cancel my wedding--again!"
14635,Susan,"uh, well, i, i don't, i don't think there's anything wrong with us seeing a movie once in awhile."
17423,Susan,hey. did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
13533,Susan,what?! i am not desperate.
14796,Susan,"no, i can't."
16858,Susan,"okay, 22 seconds. lynette, you're up."
14662,Susan,"it was an accident, karl. edie knows it was an accident, right?"
17027,Susan,"oh, well, you're gonna thank me. do you know that he has his tongue pierced?"
14646,Susan,"hey, edie."
18098,Susan,"you know, i don't get why people say that. i-i love pity. pity means someone is trying to understand what you're going through, that they sympathize, and i do."
16817,Susan,thanks.
17895,Susan,"aw, come on, edie. i said i was sorry."
15174,Susan,thank you.
15307,Susan,what the hell are you doing?
17716,Susan,"lloyd, i'm sorry. i can't help i i don't want my daughter to be someone's fourth wife."
14110,Susan,"uh, dinner, tonight?"
16199,Susan,"oh, you know what? it wasn't till your rotten nephew came to town that julie was a perfect kid, and now she's lying and scheming and having casual sex! she's just a boob job away from being you!"
13449,Susan,how could we have all forgotten about this?
13461,Susan,"i could, but she's the one who threw it."
14227,Susan,lunch?
18074,Susan,it's a date.
17988,Susan,"okay, sure. uh, where's m.j.?"
14406,Susan,huh?
15383,Susan,"i deserved it,believe me.after what i did--god,this is such a mess.he won't even return my phone calls."
14373,Susan,"let's go back inside?! lamont, give it up, you're not getting any!"
15113,Susan,super.
15950,Susan,you told me you weren't even friends with him. now you're shoplifting together?
13723,Susan,where did you say they were going tonight?
13694,Susan,"honey, it's up to his father."
17578,Susan,moving in? here?
14345,Susan,do you need a reason beyond the fact he's the ice cream man?
16211,Susan,my feelings for him? are we gonna do this again?
18220,Susan,"oh! you think that i'm dangerous. no, i totally have an explanation for those."
15717,Susan,"yeah, ah."
17346,Susan,griselda--that must have been a tough name to take out on the playground.
14900,Susan,what was it?
16309,Susan,"god, i'm so nervous."
14326,Susan,why?
16531,Susan,"well, ian, i made my choice."
13929,Susan,"uh, edie, it's not his birthday."
16424,Susan,"well, let's not bother him tonight. you know, i don't really even need a flashlight. my eyes have totally adjusted to the dark."
18403,Susan,what if your daughter could see you now? is this how you'd want her to see you? as a monster who could murder an innocent child?
15409,Susan,that's great.
17675,Susan,"hi. i am declaring this our official fourth date, okay? the rules have been followed, and you may begin disrobing--now."
17942,Susan,"well, you wouldn't have to worry about that with m.j.. he's so well-behaved."
17137,Susan,"i wanted to bring flowers, and i was shot down. that's all i'm saying."
17660,Susan,"well, i'm sorry things aren't going well. but i'm glad you told me. see? we're getting to know each other. and we wouldn't have if we'd spent the whole night in bed."
16998,Susan,and how does danielle like her baby brother?
17514,Susan,"he's a boy. that's my point! i know nothing about raising boys. and i think m.j. has figured this out, so he goes straight to mike whenever there's a problem."
16327,Susan,let me get you a towel.
13859,Susan,"oh, candles, candles!"
14380,Susan,oh! oh! how did you get down there? that's not funny.
13415,Susan,"yeah, well, if edie's gonna be there, i'm gonna need emotional support."
18277,Susan,"okay. yeah, i guess that could be fun. while our friends are toasting to our everlasting happiness, we can yell, ""surprise! it's all a sham! thanks for the crock-pot!"""
17954,Susan,what's going on?
16803,Susan,i am taking you home. this party is out of control.
15328,Susan,"oh,it means a lot to me that you came."
17300,Susan,"no, no, no, you should take a cab home and start packing. this one feels like a crier."
15058,Susan,"well, that's not what we're saying."
14982,Susan,i don't know what you're talking about. i just came in to get a job.
18271,Susan,"oh, my god. we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of--getting married."
16993,Susan,did you hear something?
15716,Susan,"sorry.ah, well, that sounds, ah, just, ah, that sounds great."
17733,Susan,"oh. crap! i didn't get anyone gifts. but i did give blood, so i'll just remind everybody that i did that."
14802,Susan,wow.
17551,Susan,"no. he was absolutely waiting for you, you know, i think i'm gonna go check his helmet."
13802,Susan,you just told me everything i need to know.
15452,Susan,"okay,don't ""uh-huh"" me. you're not old enough to do that."
13845,Susan,"oh, how awful!"
17941,Susan,"yeah. he bit his teacher, huh? they had that problem with their older boy, toby. it's a family of biters."
17497,Susan,"gaby, juanita's fat for your age."
14325,Susan,"yeah, i understand. so could you, uh, just go out and apologise?"
17008,Susan,really?
18413,Susan,i love him. you can write that in your little book.
15636,Susan,"honey, i am trying my hardest to stand on my own two feet. all right, i've got six book proposals in the works.i'm gonna try to supervise the rebuilding of this house, but you know, i can't do it without your support. and i want you to be proud of me."
18317,Susan,"i wish i could, but i can't. i'm worried about jackson."
16207,Susan,don't you love this guy? what's the strategy?
16583,Susan,i thought you were gonna propose tonight.
16258,Susan,"look, just to save you the embarrassment, ian's seeing someone."
17940,Susan,so i heard through the grapevine that there might be an opening for another student?
16720,Susan,"um,sometimes.but mike's a big spooner.he's like sleeping with a hibachi."
16596,Susan,we got engaged last night. we're getting married!
15731,Susan,here's a job. how about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
15649,Susan,"they're just ants, and they're tiny.of course, they do outnumber me."
13742,Susan,"me, too."
13944,Susan,"what is it? i'm really, really busy."
13873,Susan,"yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not, i've got a birth certificate that says i'm your mother."
14193,Susan,"do you believe in evil, edie?"
17206,Susan,"well, if you forgot something, you can just come back for it, or-- you could just not leave."
16398,Susan,"yes. i wanna spend time in your world. i wanna play cricket, and i wanna eat crumpets, and i want to use the word ghastly."
14806,Susan,oh! what the hell are - is wrong with you?!
15879,Susan,"uh, just a little jaunt down memory lane."
14789,Susan,"well, i just came over to give you the contract. your door was open."
15170,Susan,"okay, red flag! see, i didn't go to medical school,but i'm thinking--not all the same."
15909,Susan,"oh, you know, what the hell? she's sixteen.if she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now, i've failed."
18365,Susan,"oh, the joys of being a parent."
17496,Susan,well--a girl.
15662,Susan,you bought us a house?
14137,Susan,"yes, on valentine's day."
15428,Susan,"yeah?okay,then,repeat after me.""our marriage is fake,""and i'm going to marry the woman i really love--edie britt."""
14561,Susan,i thought they were gonna operate. what happened?
14952,Susan,i need to you tell me the truth about my father.
14839,Susan,"yes, definitely. i mean, i can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped paul. i mean, that definitely looks bad."
13622,Susan,it's complicated. i get it.
14112,Susan,i said no.
16106,Susan,"well, i am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband."
15770,Susan,ian!
17028,Susan,i checked out his web page.
17535,Susan,"oh, my god. this is about m.j.'s drawing, isn't it?"
17490,Susan,"that is sexi. if feminism means anything, it's that it's okay for a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked. you, teach him one of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things."
14794,Susan,please don't lie. just tell me.
17537,Susan,so you're totally fine with that drawing?
15546,Susan,"well,you probably wanna use the bathroom before you leave,huh?"
15285,Susan,i sure did.
18280,Susan,"no, no. it's okay. i wanna do this. truth is--i miss you, and the house has been kinda lonely since you left."
13411,Susan,i can only imagine. not knowing why mary alice?
15659,Susan,"julie, what are you doing?i'm trying to sleep."
18023,Susan,why would we do that?
15871,Susan,"oh, that's my mac and cheese. don't change the subject. what have you been telling him about me?"
18059,Susan,"an evaluation? well, that is when someone judges your work and gives you a grade on it. but don't worry. i'm not doing that today."
17661,Susan,"and so there i was in ninth grade, and my boobs had not made an appearance. i was desperate."
18049,Susan,"well, now i'm ungiving it. try to keep up."
15675,Susan,can you sit up?
16230,Susan,no. what about them?
15660,Susan,karl! what are you doing?
17493,Susan,really. it's not the first time. juanita's been bullying him.
13441,Susan,"this is for you. no, for bongo. you give it to him."
14316,Susan,"mom, don't go. mom, come back. i need to. we're good, right?"
17870,Susan,gotta get out. i'm supposed to be meeting the moving company. what?
18051,Susan,"yep. i'm complicated like that. aren't you glad you divorced me? if you two want a painting so bad, paint your own."
14385,Susan,ow ow.
15841,Susan,i'll pick up my bags later.
14499,Susan,"it's not about what's in it, it's about the fact that he had it at all. i would bet you anything he is not going on a plumbing job and we're gonna find out."
15052,Susan,"okay, one more."
16665,Susan,"yeah, but you have to give people a choice. don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?"
15811,Susan,"i mean, the last time you did this, it turned into a lifetime commitment, and i'm just, i'm not ready for that."
17182,Susan,especially when you get your big moment in the spotlight. bree gets to present an award to somebody who's done something extraordinary for the community.
16388,Susan,don't worry. happens to everybody. maybe it would help to talk about it.
17398,Susan,i think i'll have it done right now.
18150,Susan,doing what?
15070,Susan,okay.
16316,Susan,"um, guys? don't worry. she's all right."
14401,Susan,"zach, julie does not think of you as her boyfriend. in fact i don't think she wants anything to do with you."
14369,Susan,mother!
13720,Susan,i beg your pardon?
13365,Susan,i'm fine. i'm fine. i just feel really bad for edie.
14213,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say,ever again."
14070,Susan,pretty impressive.
16521,Susan,"probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?"
15605,Susan,"so, uh, y-you then a-admit burning down my house on purpose?"
16164,Susan,"ian, please, i just lost one of my best friends. i can't lose you, too."
13812,Susan,ow! oh!
17813,Susan,we've never looked each other in the eye and said that there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
16586,Susan,"oh, my god. i can't believe that you did this."
18155,Susan,home.
16208,Susan,pleading guilty? what kind of a strategy is that?
17396,Susan,i'm back. you want something cold?
17911,Susan,"you know, if we're gonna have a get-together after the funeral, we should start thinking about food."
13629,Susan,that's what happened with carl. i only dated him a couple of months. i filled in the blanks; i married him. it was a disaster!
16975,Susan,uh-huh. okay.
18429,Susan,"hi. hi, yeah, i'm here."
16811,Susan,"well, you're right. i'm an adult, and i need to be honest about these things, and i will be--starting tomorrow."
16529,Susan,to england? what's wrong?
17315,Susan,"no, i'm not trying to-- aah!"
18375,Susan,"well, i hope you get there soon."
16089,Susan,"there's an explanation for this, and we're gonna figure it out. don't worry about a thing."
14809,Susan,"oh, my god!"
16623,Susan,she said that i would make mike wish he was back in a coma.
14381,Susan,i am so sorry. how did i forget you?
15260,Susan,what?
16976,Susan,so you killed him?
14421,Susan,"oh my god! oh my god, that's my house!"
13940,Susan,what?
14203,Susan,oh! oh! oh!
14676,Susan,"oh, i'm being nice. i could have him arrested. i mean, don't get me wrong. i am all for julie spending time with karl. he is still her dad, and she loves him."
18309,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. you--you can't take him now."
16488,Susan,"oh, gaby, that's not fair. nobody really liked patty to begin with."
18178,Susan,we thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
17550,Susan,yeah. i think it's just beginner's luck. uh-huh.
16921,Susan,"i know. uh, maybe if i"
14628,Susan,"yeah, i know. come on in."
15161,Susan,"oh, well, okay.i mean,i guess-- i guess you guys probably have all sorts of new, exciting techniques where you don't even cut open the body."
18387,Susan,i'm fine.
18230,Susan,"that's what we said--but it wasn't true. after the crash, i couldn't find my license. i had switched purses that night, and i had left it at home, and so--mike--told them that he was driving. he took the blame for me. so--i understand guilt. and i want you to understand that edie's death was an awful tragedy. it was not your fault."
15321,Susan,"lynette,he is everything i could possibly want in a boyfriend,and i just don't know if i feel that--spark."
17979,Susan,congratulations on getting me out of your office.
15486,Susan,she doesn't know?
15163,Susan,you?
14799,Susan,what are you doing? are you trying to take me down with you?
17350,Susan,get them out of here now.
16059,Susan,"no, not just yet."
17967,Susan,"damn right, ""oh"".what happened to ""i'm broke and can't afford to send m.j. to private school""?"
15517,Susan,uh-- sure.
16233,Susan,"i'm just stunned. so i guess they worked it out, right?"
14086,Susan,"oh god, you're not taking this well. oh i was afraid of this."
14328,Susan,"yeah, i sympathise, i really do. but you have to take her back."
14575,Susan,it wasn't like that.
14145,Susan,"it went just peachy, and humiliating, and shocking."
16684,Susan,"reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony. really, just heartfelt and moving--the whole package."
14898,Susan,"oh no, no wait, no wait, no wait. four glasses is my limit."
16697,Susan,"well,we've just been so happy the last four weeks,i thought we should celebrate."
16014,Susan,relationships have nothing to do with good judgment. it doesn't matter how smart you are. you can still get hurt. you do your homework. i'm gonna finish the laundry. okay.
13672,Susan,no. that's why we have to find him. it's the only way we'll know the truth.
14689,Susan,"really? oh, i thought it made it sound more professional."
17665,Susan,"okay, do you know how sad it makes me to know that you only braised it to boink me? you're supposed to be asking me questions. the point of all this was to get to know each other better."
13921,Susan,"actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow. and that's the end of it."
16865,Susan,"it's okay. i just wanna know what's going on. ever since you've been pregnant, there's been this wall between us. it's like something's changed, and i don't know why. did i do something to offend you?"
16820,Susan,yeah. got it.
17934,Susan,"um, i think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life. you're so stable and reliable, and i just--always thought you'd be around. which is funny, because i don't really know anything about you."
18005,Susan,"well, i don't need you to do me any favors. what i need is for everyone to just stick the plan. monday, wednesday, friday--mike watches his son. he doesn't pawn him off on his girlfriend."
14249,Susan,hey!
14994,Susan,"it's not like i want an invitation to thanksgiving. i just wanna have coffee, or a lunch now and then."
14520,Susan,can you hang on? i got another call. hello?
15202,Susan,hi!
16530,Susan,"what? but just ten minutes ago, we were making plans, and you were saying how great we were gonna be together."
16762,Susan,"no problem. hey, you know, i was meaning to ask you, how did that job in chicago work out?"
15120,Susan,"you mean,i'm not gonna see dr. ron?"
15417,Susan,exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
14444,Susan,"oh god, really?"
14413,Susan,are you okay?
16960,Susan,'cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.
17239,Susan,yeah.
13334,Susan,"hi mike. i brought you a little housewarming gift. i probably should've brought something by earlier, but--"
14622,Susan,"no! i have not even begun ripping into edie britt yet. oh, that peroxide vulture! i just know as sure as i am standing here that she went after your father just to tick me off."
15485,Susan,you ripped the woman's heart out.why would she want juice from you?
13891,Susan,"well, i don't know how he had a heart attack. he was so young."
13484,Susan,it's a date.
14051,Susan,she's in the shower.
14312,Susan,"mom, can we talk about this later?"
16895,Susan,"okay, here's the thing. i'm a really crappy baker. to give you something that i made myself would be like an insult, so "
16958,Susan,"okay. my aunt ella has arthritis. i have two cousins with webbed feet, and there's a whole lot of third nipples on my dad's side."
16989,Susan,i should go.
13916,Susan,big insight. the postman knows that.
17017,Susan,"well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this! i mean, my god, mike, we have a baby on the way!"
18144,Susan,wait. stop. could we just rest for a second?
18294,Susan,"yeah, i'll try. don't think he's not gonna want his gift back. and it's really heavy, too."
18272,Susan,we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of getting married.
13661,Susan,that's a guy not a band.
15769,Susan,"wow, is that shrimp?"
15104,Susan,"oh,sorry."
13500,Susan,just a sec.
14014,Susan,what is going on here? were you just kissing my daughter?
16386,Susan,emasculated? who said emasculated? and why are you not kissing me now?
13528,Susan,i don't know that people really say that anymore.
17630,Susan,stay out of this.
17205,Susan,yes. thanks.
17933,Susan,"hey, i am happy for you. it's just, uh--this is gonna sound crazy."
17102,Susan,what?
16512,Susan,"lynette, what is wrong with you?"
14582,Susan,"mike, he wanted to kill you."
16875,Susan,"i got it, i got it. oh, one more. here you go."
15178,Susan,we need to talk.
16015,Susan,"hey, you're back! i'd give you a hug, but i'm really sweaty. so how was new york?"
16852,Susan,carlos.
17040,Susan,"oh, sure. i have to check on the laundry."
17301,Susan,aah! aah! come on. aah! aah! aah!
17500,Susan,good boy.
17996,Susan,no.
15139,Susan,"your nurse wouldn't let me see you,and i--really wanted to see you,so i sort of faked all my symptoms.the dizziness,the chills,you know,all of it."
15230,Susan,"we got to the altar,but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded."
17432,Susan,"oh, clearly this is not how i would've wanted the two of you to meet. he's--he's really a nice guy."
15297,Susan,"okay,that part sounds better when you don't read it out loud.and what are you doing reading it anyway?"
18395,Susan,canterbury road? that's where we--
16074,Susan,thank you. you are a lifesaver.
16305,Susan,it's perfect.
14016,Susan,she's only fourteen!
16664,Susan,i'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
14060,Susan,yeah.
14606,Susan,wow.
15581,Susan,bree-- are you okay?
13698,Susan,he's at a rehabilitation center. julie snuck in and actually talked to him.
15521,Susan,so do i have to worry about you attacking any more waitresses?
13705,Susan,"okay, you can leave now."
17367,Susan,"well, the first thing off the top of my head--uh--we can't afford it."
13333,Susan,what?
16083,Susan,what? why?
16385,Susan,"but we were in a bit of a jam there, and--i don't think you should be embarrassed for needing a little help."
14141,Susan,the stomach.
17060,Susan,i got you the fondue set.
17890,Susan,"oh, my god."
14953,Susan,"yeah, well, i know what r and r means. so what does this have to do with my father?"
14170,Susan,i got to learn to keep my doors locked.
18163,Susan,how?
13975,Susan,i am so screwed.
18070,Susan,"getting to know each other better. oh, napkins."
16724,Susan,"oh,so you just shun them and throw them away."
17051,Susan,"thank you. hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for you guys to take?"
17043,Susan,"oh, that's okay. you know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, and if julie happens to be here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges and stuff."
18238,Susan,my ex-husband.
16630,Susan,i'm so glad we're doing this. i hate it when we fight.
14577,Susan,good. there's a rumor going around that you don't wanna press charges against zach. is that true?
16818,Susan,right. so can we go back to date night?
18094,Susan,because i wanted you to give me a good evaluation.
18015,Susan,you're trying to get your hooks deeper into mike by showing him how much his son loves you.
17691,Susan,your what?
17349,Susan,what are those?
13596,Susan,thank you! so do you think it should be dusted for prints?
13600,Susan,you noticed that?
16159,Susan,we do. can we talk about this later?
15089,Susan,"well, i told him everything i know,which wasn't much."
13481,Susan,"no, you're the one who's been humiliating yourself, karl, why don't you see that? you walked out on your family. people think you're scum, not me. so worry about yourself, i'm okay with me. i can walk down the street and walk my head high."
16725,Susan,"yeah,get used to it."
18414,Susan,what?
14134,Susan,"um, am i supposed to talk into the camera?"
17184,Susan,"orson, you scared me. why are you sitting down here in the dark? and aren't you a little cold?"
18068,Susan,"oh, please. i didn't even get a chance to change. my ex was late picking up m.j., which is insane, 'cause he lives right across the street."
13767,Susan,"maybe i am being silly, but going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me. what if mike is hiding something?"
13589,Susan,"cats can open drawers, can they?"
17187,Susan,oh. good morning. love what you're wearing.
17395,Susan,really? whose?
17605,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
14782,Susan,"yes, and i gave him money and i sent him away and i didn't tell mike."
15797,Susan,huh?
14932,Susan,"oh. i hope that's not just because of us not being us anymore. i mean, we could be together at a wedding and it wouldn't have to be weird."
17897,Susan,"oh, thank god! we've been locked in here all night."
14324,Susan,"that's okay, that's okay."
15908,Susan,"believe me, i would love to, but, um, i gotta, i gotta get dinner started for julie."
16753,Susan,"i know it sounds weird, but julie says dylan does not remember anything about living here."
17285,Susan,"no, no. it's fine, adele. mama."
17449,Susan,potato skins at o'brien's? you've made his inner circle! this is fantastic! thank you. mmm. mmm.
16578,Susan,the chicken.
13548,Susan,"well, before you move, we thought there was something you should know."
15437,Susan,move.
14712,Susan,"yeah, well, i try."
18434,Susan,"well, all of the food is very expensive."
15185,Susan,bree?we have a question for you.
17528,Susan,"because--mike and i are divorced, so that's why--it was supposed to be a picture of the family, so you should've put your daddy in it."
14666,Susan,"no! no! it's just, we were married. and, and she's trying to make this tawdry little affair you guys have going on par with that and it's just, i got mad."
15933,Susan,"a little of both, so, boozan."
15362,Susan,so you sent him over to mike's?
17002,Susan,wow. you never ask for my help. must be something easy.
15642,Susan,he was just here. i think you should call him.
16545,Susan,what am i gonna do go hunt him down? i have a daughter. i have responsibilities.
15131,Susan,"yeah,it's pretty troubling."
14514,Susan,i'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
15522,Susan,"okay,stop that."
14225,Susan,"thanks, i will."
15500,Susan,"oh, look, the baby's doing something really cute."
13935,Susan,what do you mean?
15345,Susan,"oh, yeah, that's the plan.i swear."
15556,Susan,"well,you keep telling yourself that.i know why you really paid that guy off.you still care about me."
14774,Susan,absolutely.
16687,Susan,you were great.
17413,Susan,"well, maybe i don't deserve to be happy. a few years ago--there was this car accident--a bad one."
16091,Susan,"hey. wow, oh, those are gorgeous."
17242,Susan,"okay, i get it."
17213,Susan,"in honor of you coming home, we are making your favorite meal - steak and mashed potatoes."
17908,Susan,do what?
14302,Susan,lynette!
16298,Susan,are you sure? 'cause you seem a little anxious.
17769,Susan,"uh, not good enough. you had a million chances to say something and you didn't. that is just the same as lying to my face. you know, i always thought that the one thing i could depend on you for was honesty. what happened to that?"
13862,Susan,oh my god!
14057,Susan,"no, i, i just, i think that you should slow things down. i, i, i want you to not see her for awhile."
15197,Susan,i'm saying a little prayer.
15573,Susan,edie!why would you do that?!
15342,Susan,"okay, yes,i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance.did miss blabbermouth tell you that, too?"
18061,Susan,"oh, right. that's not till later this year."
17552,Susan,what are you doing? we talked about this. you're supposed to be new at it.
16296,Susan,reception?
14559,Susan,ow! that hurts.
16347,Susan,what's that?
14884,Susan,"oh, that's okay. julie's staying at a friend's tonight. you can sleep in her room."
14215,Susan,shut up.
13442,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
17243,Susan,"hello, karl."
17443,Susan,"and here are some other things you can talk about--cars, barbecue, fishing."
15976,Susan,"oh, my gosh.lynette."
18018,Susan,what?
15947,Susan,"no, no, i am not gonna spend your money."
13554,Susan,obviously i can't let her get away with this. the only thing to do is to go to the police and tell them everything that happened.
15347,Susan,"wow, she's-- gorgeous."
18002,Susan,"no, thank you. let's go."
16802,Susan,if that's your lame attempt to keep me from calling your parents--it worked. well played. excuse me.
13394,Susan,"bye, bongo."
18394,Susan,mike!
16685,Susan,"yeah, it was really impressive. so what are you doing tonight?"
14909,Susan,"well, i said it was a good explanation, not a great one."
17134,Susan,you can stay as long as you want.
14824,Susan,"right, right, i'm sorry."
17614,Susan,"jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well."
18062,Susan,the lady with the purple swear?
18147,Susan,"oh, hi, helen. ed. i would have introduced you, but once helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up."
13999,Susan,"oh, please don't do this."
17712,Susan,"oh, reminds me of being young and single. oh, i wish i'd never given up that."
16804,Susan,"well, of course you don't think it is, because you're knocking back a big cup of-- orange soda."
15257,Susan,"your mother is a rotten,sneaky person."
13342,Susan,hi.
18332,Susan,"i think that bree is right--that the more tom sees you digging in your heels, the more he's gonna wanna do it."
16372,Susan,what?! you said you played water polo!
15653,Susan,"karl, what do you want?"
14433,Susan,you gave her your dead wife's ring?
14915,Susan,maybe.
18075,Susan,a regular kiss on the mouth--that lasted a little longer than i thought it would.
16703,Susan,this marriage is doomed.
15273,Susan,"i don't know.you know,i'll just--i'll sell the car."
15119,Susan,"let's just say if i was a senior in high school,i'd be saying,""wow,you're a hot fifth grader."""
16002,Susan,what?
17098,Susan,"you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you."
16005,Susan,that is the subject!
17637,Susan,we just have so much baggage. i wish we could start over. can we start over?
17513,Susan,"like, i have this rule--no toy guns. except everything that m.j. picks up--whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--he pretends it's a gun."
16515,Susan,what?
14464,Susan,"and bob , i can't even begin to tell you how much that means to me. so, i'm going to walk up to that house, and you're going to let me. and you know why? because behind that badge and that big, you could crush me like a fly, chest, there's a heart. a heart that believes in love."
15067,Susan,"well, it's your word against his."
17374,Susan,"well-- we all lie to our kids sometimes, right?"
14085,Susan,"i mean, i understand why you would want to have kids, but that chapter of my life is just closed. i don't think i can go back there. and so, you know, given the way i feel and given the way i think you feel--"
13495,Susan,"i don't know. god, i hope not. i mean, they're always been wound a little tight, but i've never seen him like that. then again, who am i to judge?"
15854,Susan,"oh. okay. right, you, you, um, you sleep. i'll come back tomorrow."
13576,Susan,edie wait! um-mike and i were gonna go see the movies on wednesday-and i just thought it would be fun if you joined us.
13657,Susan,i'm mad that i like you so much without knowing anything about you.
16950,Susan,"okay, fine. you're still angry, but i'm gonna make it up to you. when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one susan mayer chained to it."
13772,Susan,"hello! i need help, i'm up here, i'm trapped in the floor, hello?!"
14685,Susan,"oh, my daughter is singing a song at church and i want to accompany her on the piano and i haven't played in years. oh, you were just so amazing at rex's funeral the other day, i was wondering--"
15619,Susan,"oh, yeah, that. um--look, i really appreciate the offer,but i think i'm gonna have to pass."
17824,Susan,"this is so fun! i haven't been out in ages. tonight, i am gonna--boogie-oogie-oogie--"
16994,Susan,"oh, yeah!"
16551,Susan,yep.
17916,Susan,"great. yeah, i haven't worn these jeans in a while, and i found 20 bucks in the pocket. don't you just love when that happens? also, karl left me for his secretary, so i need you to change these locks."
16749,Susan,i know. she was like a sister to you.
15624,Susan,"i think i'm gonna have to pass.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for."
14810,Susan,bree! where have you been? we were starting to get worried.
13453,Susan,"no, it sounds very, very wrong."
15003,Susan,you do that.
16789,Susan,mike!
14648,Susan,"yes, yes, i do."
18179,Susan,"oh, i think my leg's asleep."
13854,Susan,"oh, no good. my publisher's got me under the gun for something. what about friday?"
17857,Susan,so he was married before. you don't kick a man out for that.
16078,Susan,"sweetie, we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about, but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts."""
16861,Susan,"okay, back to charades."
14844,Susan,"well, that's comforting to know there's a silver lining."
16062,Susan,your parents? really?
17380,Susan,"well--i spend more time with me than you do, and i'm a mess."
17622,Susan,that's not enough.
18202,Susan,"uh, wait. could you maybe have one right now so that i know that you actually ate something?"
13444,Susan,"be nice, i come bearing snacks."
15723,Susan,oh.all right.i'll see you tomorrow.
16297,Susan,what's the rush? am i pregnant?
17957,Susan,what? mike bought those? he bought her pearls?
17480,Susan,"oh, sweetie. i know you're upset, but you'll feel better if you talk about it. and there's nothing you can't tell me. i'm your mommy."
15192,Susan,"edie, can you--"
17016,Susan,"is it so horrible living with me? i mean, do i make you so miserable that you can't even face me without numbing the pain?"
18288,Susan,right! score for you!
13409,Susan,i hope i'm not interrupting.
15245,Susan,i don't know--exactly.
14291,Susan,i'm sorry.
15469,Susan,"no,don't bother,'cause i'm going."
17425,Susan,fine.
13362,Susan,anybody home? i need to borrow sugar?
15420,Susan,"okay,now remember,i'm broke."
13813,Susan,sure. do you want to tell me why you had your foot in john rowland's crotch yesterday?
16579,Susan,"if by okay, you mean uneventful, then yes."
15786,Susan,great piano. do you play?
14471,Susan,it was self defence.
15926,Susan,oh. did you stay here all night?
18324,Susan,"jackson, i have been so worried. where--where are you?"
16119,Susan,"as jealous ultimatums go, that's very flattering, but, i don't think that's necessary. mike and i are done."
13918,Susan,where are you getting this?
15482,Susan,i can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.you really have changed.
15039,Susan,"no, i'm not screwing him! he's my father!"
14462,Susan,"look, um bob, let me try to explain."
16103,Susan,mike is innocent. i know that in my heart.
17083,Susan,"uh, no."
17084,Susan,"uh, i think i just twisted my ankle, but i would like to get checked out anyway."
17688,Susan,i know what's going on. let me enjoy my denial.
15092,Susan,"oh, a couple of weeks ago,um, i heard some noises coming from the basement,like a clanging.and i asked betty about it.she lied right to my face."
16729,Susan,"yes,it is! what if you wanna have kids?"
16013,Susan,sixteen years of being perfect. you were due.
14108,Susan,will you just call?
16904,Susan,"i'm not, i'm not. now get some mud. i wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell. okay, in you go."
16842,Susan,right.
15524,Susan,hi. i got your message.what's up?
17602,Susan,"uh, yeah. you want to move in."
18085,Susan,"oh, well, that kiss was all you."
14274,Susan,okay.
18423,Susan,"for god's sake, tim, she's ticklish! how many times do you have to be told?"
16696,Susan,happy one-month anniversary.
14644,Susan,even at two o'clock in the morning? 'cause that's kind of hard to miss.
15612,Susan,"okay, first, let me say,i'm really sorry about the yellow jackets.and-- also, no matter how mad i am about what you did,i don't want to see you go to prison.so i came with a solution.why don't you just come forward and tell the police that you saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline?and if you do that,then i'll destroy the tape.and then the insurance company will pay the claim.nobody gets hurt.does that sound good?"
14899,Susan,hit me.
18181,Susan,like what?
18010,Susan,"hey, sweetie. how was your sandwich? m.j.?"
16834,Susan,"yeah, i don't know. it's getting a little weird. you know, adam is my neighbor."
17209,Susan,i can't help it. my hormones are in overdrive. didn't you get that way when you were pregnant?
18314,Susan,"--mike told 'em that he was driving, but it wasn't true."
18259,Susan,i heard.
13573,Susan,"well, don't just run off. come and hang out with us."
14205,Susan,we're broken up. i thought i made that pretty clear.
13924,Susan,"well, here's something. mike told me he loved me."
14093,Susan,"well, i could see why you would be."
15426,Susan,"karl,this marriage--our marriage,this fake marriage,that's what it is,right?fake."
17717,Susan,"right, better feelings than you had about wives one, two and three?"
13483,Susan,and then i fell. so how are you?
13877,Susan,i was in bad shape back then.
13825,Susan,really? i look okay?
15818,Susan,are you sure it's okay if we stay another day?
13690,Susan,i sure am.
17868,Susan,no. help! get me out of here!
17664,Susan,"we are not having sex until date number four, and this is date number two."
16155,Susan,i didn't know they were gonna come tonight.
13724,Susan,i don't know why i let you talk me into coming here. there is obviously nothing going on between them.
16227,Susan,the hospital?
17271,Susan,oh! oh!
16128,Susan,i'm out of lipstick. can i borrow yours?
13818,Susan,"well, why don't you enlighten me? you're beautiful, you have more money than you could spend, and you have a husband who adores you!"
16313,Susan,"it's so great to finally meet both of you. oh, this is for you."
15035,Susan,did addison talk to you about me?
14788,Susan,"lonnie, are you here? it's susan. lonnie?"
17772,Susan,no--and i think it's great.
17359,Susan,"well, i have to agree. she's changed. she's not that fun anymore."
18071,Susan,no. i-i will not let you. you are too smart and funny and adorable.
15641,Susan,"i really don't, tom.is everything okay?"
13608,Susan,oh wow.
16990,Susan,what did you do?
14506,Susan,"no, no, it wasn't."
13820,Susan,what are you doing here?
17450,Susan,nice.
18257,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry. just, um, all these months, i've been telling myself that i didn't really care about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly. but i am so lonely. and as much as i tell myself that i like being the strong, single woman on her own, the truth is, i think about you all the time. and i wanted to call you, but i thought you'd gotten over me. and to hear that you still love me--that is just something that i really needed to hear right now. and i want you to know--oh, god. i want you to know i love you, too. jackson--i love you. jackson?"
15901,Susan,"uh, a little. i-- just, the last time we saw each other, it was so awkward and complicated."
15899,Susan,i just dropped my trowel. thanks.
13948,Susan,a spark?
15577,Susan,"a tad?edie, i have no roof!you can't just go around burning down people's homes."
15423,Susan,this is your father's bartender bible.see if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail.
17524,Susan,did i not say 7:00? you missed their little show. m.j. was tooth decay.
15643,Susan,"hey, what's going on?"
18388,Susan,"okay, listen. it's really important that you win this game. so i want you to find a good hiding place, and even if you hear dave, you don't come out no matter what, okay? okay? don't worry. i'm gonna hide, too. now go. go!"
17693,Susan,before that.
17601,Susan,i gave romance a shot and--i'm ready for something a little more casual.
16454,Susan,"maggie, these cakes are fantastic."
15275,Susan,"how? how are you gonna handle edie?that poor woman's dreams exploded in her face tonight.you know,it's not like you can just go out and buy her flowers,and everything will be better."
15728,Susan,"well, i think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it."
15329,Susan,okay.bye.
17917,Susan,"oh, thanks, but don't be. just hurry. karl said he was coming by to get some of his stuff, and i want this place to be a fortress by then."
18342,Susan,what?
13643,Susan,i know who you are. you're a carl in disguise. i'm done with you: all of you.
15434,Susan,karl!
13418,Susan,i'm gonna keep my one little bag and go home.
15419,Susan,"at this point,i'd like to point out that,uh,it was karl who proposed."
14315,Susan,that's not true.
16098,Susan,"hi, ladies!"
17596,Susan,h-honest? okay.
16540,Susan,"hey, carlos! wait. hi. look, there's some crazy rumor going around that mike moved."
13602,Susan,"oh,really? that's great."
17071,Susan,"no need. i'll be quick. 'cause i'm sure you have a very good reason for giving mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem. so--what is your very good reason? okay, this may take a while. you might want to spit."
14505,Susan,"oh my god, wow, um, okay oh, wow um, bye."
13430,Susan,"ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot, we're really best buddies now. oh, what a good boy! bongo, are you okay?"
16160,Susan,ian. wait!
16417,Susan,ow! damn! thumbtack!
17248,Susan,"there's nothing wrong with that. it shows our respect for lamaze, and, you know, the whole birthing process."
13350,Susan,now? you wanna come over now? y-you have company.
18198,Susan,"you know, this whole thing with edie--i mean, seeing her lying in the street that night--oh, it just brought up all those awful memories from our accident."
18312,Susan,can't this wait? we're about to get marry.
15625,Susan,"ahh.okay, break times over."
16446,Susan,he was totally innocent.
16241,Susan,"actually, yeah, there is."
15101,Susan,this is the worst date i have ever been on in my life.
16655,Susan,yeah.
14553,Susan,"yeah, he's crazy!"
16757,Susan,i know. i will lend you my salad bowl. you really don't wanna miss bree's pie. it's perfect.
14798,Susan,no!
15208,Susan,why would you need a fake bride?
18086,Susan,"well, that's because--"
13555,Susan,"julie, i don't think they'll throw me in jail. i mean, it was an accident."
13557,Susan,oh god. i hate that i'm turning you into a thief.
17049,Susan,my matchmaking skills. julie and barrett are really hitting it off.
16022,Susan,"all right, oh--but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water."
15062,Susan,zach is back!
18326,Susan,"well--i'll miss you, too. i mean, you came in my life when i was going through a really hard time, and you were amazing. i mean, you are amazing."
18402,Susan,"dave, please. please. i cannot imagine the pain you went through, but you can't do this. you can't kill my little boy!"
16595,Susan,gaby!
14550,Susan,i look like hell. i need a hairbrush.
15227,Susan,"oh, oh! no, no,stop right there.okay, i would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in holland more than anyone,with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang.but unless i get this surgery,my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.so, you know, seeing as i am just a nice person and i always support gay rights,let's just do this.and then i'll have a husband and insurance.nobody gets hurt."
16567,Susan,"well, i wanted to look nice for mike."
16156,Susan,"well,obviously,you weren't going to.they needed to know that that dead woman was orson's mistress."
17573,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
17804,Susan,you're welcome.
15816,Susan,"okay, ian, you know what? this is not happening.i am just going to sleep, and you can just drive me home in the morning."
14992,Susan,charming.
18225,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just-- the things you said--i'm worried about you.
15690,Susan,"you would think so, but, no, it doesn't."
13408,Susan,hey paul.
15011,Susan,so are you coming in?
17744,Susan,you're dating a friend of mine?
13521,Susan,"well, i guess i've done my good deed for the day."
14977,Susan,"why, cause i went to college?"
14882,Susan,"oh, karl. what do you want?"
15766,Susan,"hi, edie. nice party, huh?"
13906,Susan,"karl, do you want to join us?"
15046,Susan,yep.
15490,Susan,"our marriage was garbage!stupid,disgusting pile of garbage!"
14703,Susan,"well, it is a family recital, and edie is not family."
14874,Susan,i can wait.
17805,Susan,you're welcome.
17529,Susan,"to susan, the sweetest, most--"
16576,Susan,sorry.
18347,Susan,"ooh. hey. um, can i talk to you a sec?"
15707,Susan,"ha, still i--"
16854,Susan,"no, no! wait, wait, wait. gaby, you know how it works. okay, first, i have to go over all the signals. okay, so, um, this is movie, um, tv--"
14478,Susan,i knew you'd be happy for us. so what's going on?
16670,Susan,"you would think that, but no. come on. this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long. don't you want it to be perfect?"
18058,Susan,"jessie, you said that i could plan the lesson today, and i think this is valuable. i'm just trying to be creative."
16143,Susan,bree? uh--hi. can you hold on a second?
18031,Susan,"yeah. it was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon. uh, i mean, you know how much mike loves the ocean."
17572,Susan,"it's a little weird. i--i but, you know, m.j. will be thrilled, and--yeah, i'm fine with it."
15243,Susan,"uh,is that really necessary?i mean,do we have to do the whole ring thing?"
17697,Susan,it counts.
14410,Susan,"although if you wouldn't mind, i'm really like to see that video tape i found, the one marked ""angela"". it'd be nice to see mary alice when she was young."
14286,Susan,what? why?
17012,Susan,"and he needed something for the pain, so he happened to find the last two pills in the medicine cabinet, and he took 'em. it's no big deal."
15803,Susan,"because it was really eleven, and i knocked off two, and you're still judging me."
17076,Susan,"what was i supposed to do, mike? leave 'em in your truck? i'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control."
16356,Susan,i don't need to. i trust you.
13352,Susan,"here, here, look. put in this peanut butter. and this cooking oil. and these olives!"
18237,Susan,"the wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical divorce lawyer in town."
17368,Susan,"mike, that is so sweet. mike makes another good point. who is this professor? i don't know him. i am certainly not going to give my daughter to him for a summer. i'm sorry, julie. this is not happening."
13572,Susan,edie! i thought you'd be at work.
14832,Susan,"oh, thank god, they're here."
15506,Susan,"and this one,i ran out and got the day i found out karl was doing it with his secretary.i think you'll find this particularly helpful.it's got a chapter called,""revenge: you're only hurting yourself."""
14762,Susan,you're leaving muir and hunt? you helped build that place.
14237,Susan,"well, see that's the thing, he doesn't think of himself as ""your bill"" cause he said that date was just a one time thing. which i know because when he asked me out, i told him i thought you guys were involved."
16552,Susan,why not?
15654,Susan,"it's temporary, and if you don't mind, i'm having coffee."
17997,Susan,"hey, thanks. let me remind you that the reason i agreed to custody is so our son could spend time with his father."
15701,Susan,you might think i'm naive but i know he's coming back to me.
14859,Susan,"i, i should have told you right away. i, i know that. but you know now, so can we please talk about it?"
15564,Susan,"thanks, orson.thanks for coming.you know,you didn't have to do this."
15880,Susan,"no, no.what we're doing today is a little more low-key. don't worry. you're totally safe. we're not doing anything wrong."
16562,Susan,"yeah. what was i supposed to do, wait forever for mike?"
18282,Susan,we're getting married.
17641,Susan,okay. when?
18090,Susan,excuse me?
13468,Susan,"i left three messages. oh, he's not gonna come. big surprise. i did everything but foam at the mouth. god, i hate when i get that way. it's like every time i get within 10 feet of karl, i just become this monster."
17776,Susan,"m.j. ,hurry up. your dad's here. hey, katherine. what are you doing here?"
15249,Susan,"karl,you are so not allowed to get angry.i mean,i might've been the one to throw away the wedding ring,but you threw away the whole marriage.there was plenty of bad behavior that went on back then,so just get off your high horse.we're on the same page now,so we should just focus on that."
13586,Susan,"but remember what the note said ""i know what you did. it makes me sick. i'm going to tell"". that's not the kind of thing that someone writes to themselves. that's a message, sent by an enemy."
15688,Susan,"karl, we are not getting back together.not ever. you need to just stop and realize that it's over.i'm gonna marry mike.so i need you to sign these because i have to be divorced first."
17059,Susan,okay.
16474,Susan,"oh, that's right. she babysat your kids."
16502,Susan,i told you--hurt and betrayed.
18171,Susan,"bree, how did you know where she lived?"
13443,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
13653,Susan,i cannot believe julie sent you. she is soon going to be dead.
14801,Susan,i do.
15948,Susan,and you just tell me this now?
14234,Susan,"oh, edie. wait up, i, i want to ask you something."
13784,Susan,mike--
15736,Susan,i think i will have the mescaline salad.
14507,Susan,"okay, next time i won't bring my daughter to stalk my boyfriend. it was a slight error in judgment. honey, please don't give me the silent treatment."
16942,Susan,"well, i'm voting as a light sleeper. it's right outside our bedroom window. seriously, lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain."
16071,Susan,right--like an ambulance.
14842,Susan,"but why don't you want 'em to know about martha huber's journal? i mean, she says right in there that she was blackmailing paul's wife."
16848,Susan,you know what else is private? the parts of me that i'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone. i have a party to throw. i will deal with you later.
14775,Susan,i told you. lonnie wants me to sign with his new agency.
18019,Susan,what?
17885,Susan,"it's not a compliment, you tramp! okay, i am not gonna take relationship tips from a woman who has hooked up with--what is it? over a thousand men?"
18233,Susan,wow.
13420,Susan,"john? your gardener, he gave you a rose?"
18329,Susan,"yeah, but, no, this doesn't make any sense because mike knew that it wasn't for real."
15726,Susan,he sort of asked me out.
15244,Susan,"yeah,okay.well,i'll just grab something out of my jewelry box."
14101,Susan,you shot yourself?
16978,Susan,"uh, and how did you--"
17773,Susan,"oh. well, you haven't. just treat him well, okay? he's a really good guy."
17160,Susan,what was that? is someone there?
15379,Susan,"oh,ron!oh! ugh!what the hell is wrong with you?"
14299,Susan,the rules are simple. we play for cash. the dealer picks the game and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.
16147,Susan,"bree, i am so relieved."
16902,Susan,uh-huh. maybe a little longer.
15529,Susan,"okay,um--first of all,it was not the best sex i ever had.i just said that to make him feel better.obviously,you were the best sex i ever had."
14031,Susan,"well, not too much. julie, you know you can tell me anything, right?"
15962,Susan,carolyn! open up! my daughter's inside!
13390,Susan,well. i order takeout.
15663,Susan,what's the catch?
14233,Susan,i do. i really do.
15861,Susan,"oh, mike. come on, you're not even trying to remember! it was fun! oh, i know. okay, sing with me. car wash, talkin' about the car wash. whoo, car wash, yeah."
14355,Susan,i have not been furious with you.
15954,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
15592,Susan,hey.cleaning up after the big party?
17261,Susan,he's not feeling well. i see marisa isn't here either.
17408,Susan,i don't know. later. just go.
15133,Susan,okay.thank you.i'd like to get out now.
15537,Susan,what if i can't?
16523,Susan,"i am. i'm gonna marry ian. believe me, this wasn't easy, especially when you started to remember how it was between us. maybe if the timing had been different--"
17640,Susan,"uh, yeah. i think i remember you."
14007,Susan,"of course, anything. uh, you name it! what?"
15284,Susan,just in passing.
14923,Susan,"no, edie. i mean, this is so unexpected on so many levels. i don't know what to say."
16058,Susan,"okay, well, give me a minute, and i will change into something nice."
13368,Susan,"yeah. yeah, but she's fine now. everything's fine now."
15760,Susan,so when i left the bank i called the detective that worked the case and he said that the only reason orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
15998,Susan,"ah, cutting to the chase. i like it. i have a confession to make. this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night, and i hate being the bi*chy, naggy mom. when it comes to parenting, i am much more comfortable playing the good cop. do you see where i'm going with this, kids?"
16996,Susan,"no, they just had a baby. we're gonna ""ooh,"" we're gonna ""ahh,"" and then we're gonna eat."
17356,Susan,"i'm sorry. i--i just want our kid to have a great name. i don't think ""maynard"" is great."
17415,Susan,"yeah, i guess i could handle that."
15442,Susan,"well,isn't it?"
16773,Susan,"hey, so how's the chemotherapy going?"
15667,Susan,"oh, hi.um, we're just moving."
13422,Susan,"i hope you don't mind, i thought i'd come by early and help you set up."
17229,Susan,i can't come out my front door every day and see that man. we have to move.
18017,Susan,"well, that's the way it's gonna be, whether you like it or not."
15953,Susan,i am so disappointed in you.
17659,Susan,blocked?
16236,Susan,"uh, sweetie--i don't think she's gonna make it that long."
15048,Susan,good for you. bye.
13386,Susan,oooh.
16426,Susan,kiss me.
16341,Susan,you remember.
14707,Susan,i'm sorry you had to witness that.
18296,Susan,"oh, shoot. well, can you tell him to call me as soon as he gets back?"
17862,Susan,edie? edie! do you not hear me?
15727,Susan,it's okay with you if i go out with him?
17526,Susan,look what he did with my hair. i kind of like the bangs.
17433,Susan,"oh, i don't know that that's necessary."
13469,Susan,"what, you mean forgive him?"
15246,Susan,"well,i trusted you not to cheat on me and break my heart."
13959,Susan,yes!
16900,Susan,"bup, bup, bup! wait a second."
14211,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say ever again."
16556,Susan,"well, maybe i am a little unprepared, but it'll be fine. i work out. i have quads of steel."
15209,Susan,really?
13319,Susan,"i mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? i had that woman over for brunch. gabrielle: it's like my grandmother always said, an erect penis doesn't have a conscience."
16431,Susan,because we had just had a fight--about you.
16457,Susan,i don't know.
15165,Susan,"the first time you'll see me naked,i'll be on an operating table."
14516,Susan,"mike, hi, sweetie. i hope the job's going well. um, so i hope you're not mad, but i found mrs. huber's journal in your truck, and, well, i couldn't exactly not read it, so i did, and, um, i know all about the blackmail, so call me. we'll talk. love you. bye."
16314,Susan,anyone hungry?
15560,Susan,yes?
18264,Susan,what do you want?
15839,Susan,mike is awake! he's lying there and he's wondering where i am.
17019,Susan,me feel guilty?
17838,Susan,"just a friend. oh, gaby, do you think i did this subconsciously just to sabotage my relationship with jackson?"
14109,Susan,"don't be silly. why would i do that? no, i've just been really busy grocery shopping."
17753,Susan,"hey, do you wanna take a walk? i need a little girl free time."
15156,Susan,"you know,we've been on three dates,and you just keep acting like a perfect gentleman,and, uh-- it's getting a little old."
16712,Susan,yes.yesterday.susan mayer.your new neighbor.
16634,Susan,it's one of those hard jelly ones. do you think that's an omen?
15043,Susan,thirty-eight.
16323,Susan,"yeah, well, with karl, i was more, ""divorce the ass and seize the assets."" so you better watch out. betrayal makes me vengeful."
16641,Susan,"i mean, i've never seen gaby so torn up with guilt."
15571,Susan,"this is a little awkward,and i apologize in advance for how this is gonna sound,but um--by any chance,did-- you burn down my house?"
16534,Susan,"hi, ida.what's up?"
14236,Susan,um. bill asked me out.
17873,Susan,of course i have.
15404,Susan,"oh. no,edie,wait.um,no,it's just that--you know,i was married to karl,and i used to--try to surprise him,and he would always,always,always say--""no,susan. don't surprise me.i don't like it."""
15535,Susan,"okay,let's try this another way.you are about to unleash a nuclear explosion.lives are going to be ruined."
16654,Susan,"oh, good! i mean, not that they said no, just--'cause i really wanted to do it."
16158,Susan,yeah. i--just to tell him about the lawyer. i know that mike is innocent.
16859,Susan,edie. woman. blonde. bleach!
17786,Susan,that's the worst thing i've ever heard.
14574,Susan,no.
15664,Susan,i can't accept this.i just--i gotta get out of this mess on my own.
15289,Susan,"what ""little thing""?"
16350,Susan,huh?
17582,Susan,get out.
17893,Susan,"edie, what the hell?"
16935,Susan,i have a lovely voice.
17304,Susan,"i'm not in labor, okay?"
17511,Susan,i came to say i'm sorry.
13939,Susan,"yeah, that part when you slept with your secretary was really exciting."
16293,Susan,"oh! oh, my! oh, it's so beautiful!"
15212,Susan,"uh, likewise."
16768,Susan,"uh, we--i mean, you both make a-a good case. um--but i think i'm gonna have to agree with, uh--and you know i love you both--"
15435,Susan,whoa!
15199,Susan,what?
14106,Susan,"i'm saying that is about as likely as mike having done it. he's a good guy. i know him. i mean, he's, he's mike."
14468,Susan,but mike's lawyer pleaded self defence and if that's the case-
16877,Susan,"oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet. i'm susan. i live next door. oh! jeez."
16602,Susan,you're getting married on my wedding day?
13721,Susan,you don't know what you are talking about. they're just friends.
17139,Susan,sorry.
14240,Susan,"edie! edie, why can't i go out with him?"
16052,Susan,but--
13312,Susan,"well, sometimes people are so unhappy they think it's the only way they can solve their problems."
14919,Susan,"karl, i want to move on. i don't want to go backwards. i'm sorry, but thank you for the explosion. i really needed it."
13883,Susan,"and i still kinda do it. i just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature, i forget she's thirteen."
13990,Susan,"you know, for what it's worth, i would have talked to you in high school."
15376,Susan,"ron,what are you doing?"
14693,Susan,"well, i don't mean to be technical here, but this show, i mean, it really is supposed to be a family thing, and i hate to point out you're not family."
16594,Susan,"hi, curt. susan mayer. you did my wedding invitations? uh, i'm gonna need another batch. exactly the same, only change the name ian hainsworth to mike delfino. long story. call me."
17266,Susan,i know. i just wish i could fast-forward through my life and see that everything ends up okay.
17119,Susan,"oh, none taken."
13988,Susan,why would you think i was lying?
17041,Susan,look what i found on the dryer. julie won second place in the state science fair.
14454,Susan,oh my god! oh my god!
15414,Susan,"well,i should go."
14423,Susan,"oh oh oh, my, look! my kitchen! oh, it's a big fire!"
15287,Susan,funny. so what about my surgery?
15288,Susan,then i'm on board.
17403,Susan,"okay, new rule. from now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed, between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p.m."
14052,Susan,what's that?
13632,Susan,you couldn't get any more out of him?
15213,Susan,"hi.i thought you should know,i'm getting married."
14342,Susan,mom. mom.
13344,Susan,"well, i., i just was wondering, if, um, if there was any chance that, um, you would uh-- i just-- wanted to ask if--"
18072,Susan,"well, i mean it. anyone would be lucky to have you. you are a catch. jeez. how did it get so late? is there a school policy on showing up to work drunk?"
18212,Susan,"i'll call in sick, take the day off."
14332,Susan,"if she moves in she will burn up all my oxygen and i need it. please can't you give her another chance? you guys are really good together, you know, when-when-when there's no violence."
18214,Susan,"all right. i will be back after work to check on you. but until then, here's the phone, in case you wanna order chinese or--call a hotline or something."
17388,Susan,mike.
14546,Susan,"look, zach. i know you're upset. let's just, let's just sit down and talk."
15316,Susan,what do you mean?
17298,Susan,my water just broke. i'm in labor. we have to go.
18268,Susan,i'll help you.
14758,Susan,you should find your father first. let me help.
16539,Susan,i love you.
15146,Susan,i love sushi.i'm available tomorrow night.
16197,Susan,"yes, we do. you might have gotten your first diaphragm with milk money, but that doesn't give you the right to corrupt my daughter!"
18344,Susan,"um, yeah. i--katherine already told me about your big news."
16329,Susan,were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra?
15877,Susan,shh! i thought you could use some fresh air.
17926,Susan,thanks.
16225,Susan,"ian, i'm sorry, too. we've got to stop fighting like this."
14688,Susan,thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me. i really appreciate it.
16508,Susan,stupid?
15461,Susan,"oh,my god!oh,thank you so much."
15365,Susan,"oh,ah,okay.i made it."
13756,Susan,oh? like a hotel room?
16317,Susan,"dahlia, i am so sorry about the--"
18127,Susan,so she just left?
17072,Susan,"oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain--being a dentist."
13466,Susan,uh-
17828,Susan,i thought you had a housekeeper.
14473,Susan,thank you.
14436,Susan,oh no. no no no. they want to get their new life together started. we don't want to hold these two crazy kids back.
15444,Susan,this is insane!
14457,Susan,"oh, forget it. just let me look at it myself."
18351,Susan,i know. and feel free to throw me out of your house if i'm out of line--but do you love her?
15503,Susan,"well, every situation is different,and it's hard to judge until we know all the details."
16024,Susan,"oh, no, i'm your boss' girlfriend. surely he mentioned me."
14123,Susan,"oh, don't write that down. oh, but this is good. you can let mike go. he's innocent."
17463,Susan,really? whose is this?
14714,Susan,"no, not at all."
13400,Susan,"oh, it's sort of a new tradition."
15137,Susan,"oh,no,no,no,no."
15620,Susan,"yeah.i think it's best. i don't wanna get a rep around here for being a charity case,you know?"
15181,Susan,yeah.
17975,Susan,can't say no.
17968,Susan,"but you can't go around blowing your kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend. what did these cost you? $4,000, $5,000?"
17333,Susan,oh. forgive me. don't look at me like that. his grandfather just died.
17053,Susan,get out of my house. get him out of my house!
15611,Susan,hi.
16909,Susan,"oh, please. what are neighbors for? raphael?! here, puppy!"
15099,Susan,"dr. mccready,can i talk to you about my head?away from--the draft?"
15385,Susan,i can't tell you.
16701,Susan,so our life together is exactly how you pictured it?you've gotten everything you wanted?
17579,Susan,"so obviously, this is the bedroom."
17687,Susan,"you know, i'm very good at first impressions. i'm gonna like this guy. why is the cab driver handing julie's boyfriend money? why is julie's boyfriend getting back in the cab? and why is the middle-aged cab driver kissing julie?"
16084,Susan,"still. it's tacky. well, okay then, uh--i'll help get you out. uh, what's your bail?"
14939,Susan,yeah?
18139,Susan,you're right. i'm homeless. susan mayer. oh. it's all cleared up.
18173,Susan,you really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
15009,Susan,"well, sure."
16257,Susan,susan mayer. i'm-- a friend of the family.
17642,Susan,ugh!
13491,Susan,"okay, i gotta break the ice here. so you're in counselling, big deal. you want humiliation? i'll give you humiliation. i locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by mike."
14308,Susan,what?
15277,Susan,nothing. i just--i didn't know that you loved her like that.
15475,Susan,it is?
15322,Susan,and he keeps telling me how special i am and how much i mean to him--how he wants to hold my beating heart in his hand.
15427,Susan,what's this?
16485,Susan,rip 'em!
13318,Susan,"no, i said, really? and what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?"
13611,Susan,"okay, fine i'll go out with you."
14407,Susan,that's it? that's the explanation?
14002,Susan,"edie, please talk to me."
15986,Susan,"no, ian, am i overreacting here?"
14943,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, i thought you probably did. so i checked that, too, and he wasn't there and so i called the v.a., and there is not a single record of anyone named harrison ross in vietnam."
18172,Susan,good. we got some ground to make up. i was hoping we would be able to get there before dark.
16027,Susan,"well, of course."
16873,Susan,"look at us. pregnant gals, eating cake and bi*chin'. it's kinda nice, huh?"
16771,Susan,"i'm sorry, honey. you wanted a decision. this is my decision."
15096,Susan,why don't we get our table?
15040,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you."
15668,Susan,"uh, well, he's not moving in with us."
15826,Susan,cigarettes?
15495,Susan,i'm sorry i'm late.
16812,Susan,hey. look who i picked up coming out of the movies-- a p.g. movie. is this the perfect teenager or what?
15795,Susan,why not? i think that's adorable.
17177,Susan,so-- this man-- who do you think it was?
16559,Susan,"i mean, the doctor said that mike might never come out of the coma. and then when he did, he didn't even remember me."
13454,Susan,i have an idea.
17538,Susan,hello?
17978,Susan,i'll take it.
14631,Susan,"sure, what is it?"
13331,Susan,"julie, i like mr. delfino, i do. it's just, i don't know if i'm ready to start dating yet."
14224,Susan,i don't suppose you have any idea where i found it?
17190,Susan,you most certainly were.
15798,Susan,ian.
16680,Susan,nice save.
18142,Susan,how about coffee? i just put on a pot.
15352,Susan,i lied and i told himi didn't know a mike.
15327,Susan,"aw,that's so sweet.you came all the way down here just for me."
13550,Susan,"paul, are you going to be alright?"
13508,Susan,huh?
17061,Susan,victor knows?
13569,Susan,distant? what do you mean?
13860,Susan,"mike? mike, is that you? i'm up here!"
14748,Susan,"because, i have a lot of things to say so you can just listen. i'll buy you some food. when was the last time you ate?"
14768,Susan,really? 'cause it sorta sounds like embezzlement.
13707,Susan,"oh this?"" ""well, i have a date. right now. with mike. we kissed. fyi."
17299,Susan,"i don't know what to tell you, mama. look at me. aah!"
17401,Susan,"oh, you poor thing! you need a hug."
17740,Susan,when i'm done. don't change the subject. are you seeing someone?
13664,Susan,hi.
15357,Susan,yeah.
15256,Susan,yeah.wednesdays are becoming very popular with brides.it's like the new saturday.
15006,Susan,"i know this sounds awful, but i'm kind of glad the guy's dead."
15110,Susan,that's a great idea.you could have him do a background check on the applewhites.
14269,Susan,now that is just perfect. stay put.
16132,Susan,"yeah. but somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer. otherwise, the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go, ""who the hell is he?"" ian gets that. besides, why would it be a big deal? mike and i are over."
17436,Susan,"well, when you meet him for the second time, you can tell him that. he's picking you up here tomorrow night."
13374,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
16500,Susan,"family's terrific. seriously, you're just wasting your time here."
18004,Susan,good save. let's go.
14503,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm gonna find out. wait here and lock the doors."
16716,Susan,"it's just that it's weird,you know,considering you're--where'd you go?"
15206,Susan,hi.
13796,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm scared. something's very, very wrong."
17132,Susan,"no. i'm pregnant, and my husband's in rehab, and the only reason i seem sane is because you're here, making my house feel like a home."
13745,Susan,thanks.
14814,Susan,hi. we're just going to a funeral.
16095,Susan,"i mean, of course he's totally innocent. i'm just trying to help him find a lawyer."
18412,Susan,new york!
13507,Susan,we've all sort of felt it.
15464,Susan,"now i'm absolutely horrified that i'm about to say what i'm about to say,but there's nobody else i can talk to who won't judge me.and since you're a complete stranger, i'll probably never see you again unless i randomly run into you on the street,in which case,you'll ignore me'cause you know how crazy i am."
14383,Susan,i'm going to handle this once and for all.
17171,Susan,"what do you have to reminisce about? he was here for a week when he was 16. what could you two have even--oh, my god, you slept together."
16434,Susan,"mmm! god, that is so good!"
13460,Susan,excuse me. brandy. do you mind?
14929,Susan,okay.
15323,Susan,"mmm.maybe it's because i just haven't felt that thunderbolt yet.you know,with mike,it hit me.with karl,it hit me.i didn't have to worry about how i felt because the thunderbolt told me."
15218,Susan,hi.
13799,Susan,"that's just not true. when, when julie was a baby, i, i was out of my mind almost every day."
15203,Susan,i came as soon as i got your message. is this--?
17311,Susan,"he sure does, but i want mine first."
16079,Susan,"oh, my god!"
17357,Susan,wow. i didn't know about that.
15747,Susan,"uh, well, i, it just, wow. i hear my phone vibrating. i'm sorry, duty calls."
15959,Susan,what the hell's going on?
13810,Susan,"hey, do you need any help?"
13798,Susan,"no, it's not! so you got addicted to your kids' add medication. it happens."
16606,Susan,is this a bad time?
17366,Susan,"but it's a huge honor. yes, we've established that. it's huge. it's an honor. we get it."
16908,Susan,oh. it's just a baby shower--that i'm throwing-- for my best friend.
15967,Susan,"attention! attention, carolyn bigsby!"
17104,Susan,what do you suggest we do?
13858,Susan,come over and help my find my pilot light.
15270,Susan,where's edie?
14683,Susan,"it was the early eighties. well, i'm not gonna argue with you. you want to do the show with edie, and i think that's super. so she's really good, huh?"
17841,Susan,"bob! um--uh, what are you doing here?"
14964,Susan,all this time my father has been right across town running the feed store?
14153,Susan,"oh, um, is my daughter under there?"
18432,Susan,"come on,come on,come on."
16210,Susan,"with a better lawyer,he could be out in zero.we need to find a lawyer who believes that he's innocent."
15796,Susan,"oh, ian. it's okay. some people have a lot of lovers, and some just a few. it doesn't matter."
14168,Susan,"i was on vacation. made sense at the time. okay, not to be rude, but is there a reason you're here?"
16289,Susan,"absolutely, yes!"
18290,Susan,"i was too proud to admit it. i'm not too proud to take it. i need that money, jackson."
16231,Susan,what?
17835,Susan,oh! knock yourself out.
13565,Susan,you'd better go get that.
18411,Susan,issues? what kind of issues do you think i have?
13354,Susan,"i've told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen. kids, y' know?"
15504,Susan,"which--obviously i don't know,because how would i know?"
13993,Susan,"oh, of course, take your time."
18105,Susan,i am an art teacher.
13403,Susan,yeah.
16475,Susan,do you think she actually killed him?
15578,Susan,"that's it.i'm going to the police,and i'm telling them what you did."
15858,Susan,"oh, it's coming. um, and--and this 70's cover band, well, they started to play, and--that's how we got our song."
15579,Susan,what? you just confessed.
16453,Susan,you know what i would have said. it doesn't matter now.
14292,Susan,i said i was sorry.
14162,Susan,there's your father. go have fun.
14476,Susan,"hey there, edie."
16345,Susan,"so i guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?"
16519,Susan,"oh, come on!"
13314,Susan,"i don't like that word, julie. but yeah, that's a great example."
16645,Susan,"i mean, what could i say?"
14862,Susan,"i screwed up, okay? i want to fix it! please let me fix it! tell me how to fix it! mike, i love you!"
13479,Susan,"yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you, but i can control myself."
14305,Susan,"oh oh oh. you don't have to gasp, my mother exaggerates."
16620,Susan,"oh? no.no, this is a big dramatic gesture."
13791,Susan,do you mean that?
16406,Susan,what?
16272,Susan,for the sake of our friendship--
13733,Susan,"yeah, yeah, it's a real rush."
17694,Susan,that's the one. so you've been married three times?
13731,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, we, we did, uh, i just thought she left."
16549,Susan,"well, what else can i do? i love him. i have to go."
14771,Susan,"well, i don't hate you. i couldn't hate you. you're my lonnie."
13951,Susan,what are you saying?
14337,Susan,the day my mother will need to come and live with me and i won't have a choice.
17670,Susan,no. it's sex time!
14442,Susan,what? what were you thinking?
17183,Susan,it would?
15999,Susan,"well, in that case. meet the bad cop."
13540,Susan,"um, i'm not really a fan."
15763,Susan,"bree, we have to talk."
13942,Susan,top of the heap--
17135,Susan,and jam.
15031,Susan,"this is ridiculous. what does she think, we're having an affair?"
17259,Susan,"oh, enough with the ""hence."" i'm just saying that some things are private, and i think that you can be honest without being inappropriate."
14649,Susan,"well, etiquette is a lost art for a lot of people."
13659,Susan,what's your favourite sport?
16041,Susan,"oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?"
16430,Susan,i was in shock.
17560,Susan,"remember, it's the pavement you're mad at."
18125,Susan,"marisa? well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?"
15832,Susan,i thought you said you didn't get reception up here.
16337,Susan,"mike, it wasn't a movie. that was us."
15572,Susan,what?
15226,Susan,"oh, no,it's a serious illness.see, it just sounds silly 'cause of the word ""spleen."""
14352,Susan,what are you doing? i have a teenage daughter in the house! you cannot just bring strange men you meet in bars back here in the middle of the night!
18418,Susan,"hey, mike, it's me. are you there? pick up. hello? okay, i know you're home. your lights are on. look, i really need to talk to you about something, uh, you know what? i'm just gonna stop by."
17770,Susan,what am i supposed to do?
15867,Susan,edie?
14198,Susan,angela -- that's what mary alice used to call herself.
13610,Susan,blame myself???
16097,Susan,"you are the only one allowed to ravish me these days, so stop worrying."
14263,Susan,"you know, this is between you and edie. i just got sucked into the drama."
14039,Susan,i'd love to.
13326,Susan,"yeah, i get that a lot. here you go."
18113,Susan,"no, honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy."
15359,Susan,"all right,but if i catch you guys in there talking about me,you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair."
16187,Susan,you are gonna make a really good mother someday.
17420,Susan,"and we killed them, mike!"
14504,Susan,"all right, what the hell are you up to?"
15827,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
16613,Susan,"oh, my god. did you steal my whole wedding?"
17303,Susan,a few weeks apart. wanna go to the movies?
15849,Susan,"yes! yes, i have. almost every day. i can't tell you how much i'm kicking myself for not being here when you woke up."
15702,Susan,don't say it.you just keep doing your job and i'll keep doing mine.oops.
17757,Susan,"you know, she has wanted to get her hooks into mike for years. every time she would have us over for a barbecue, she always wore something booby."
16906,Susan,lee? is something wrong?
14556,Susan,"oh, god! oh, there's blood."
14851,Susan,a knife. i just want to slice some tomatoes.
17735,Susan,"oh, fine. he just needs some stitches. ooh, those cookies look delicious. where'd you get them?"
17429,Susan,"edie, is that really you?"
17063,Susan,"yeah, and-and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'cause we're gonna see you real soon."
17149,Susan,is this about the other day?
18330,Susan,"what's he gonna do with that, watch bruce lee movies without the subtitles?"
14750,Susan,i swear.
17768,Susan,"well, she didn't."
17302,Susan,ah. ah.
18210,Susan,oh. uh--okay. sure.
15512,Susan,"okay, let's not make a scene.it's not worth it.for the sake of argument,let's--let's--let's say that it's someone else.you know, probably it would be a vulnerable, lonely woman who karl just took advantage of,and what if--this poor, confused soul begged your forgiveness?what would you say?"
14732,Susan,okay.
14608,Susan,what are you doing?
17157,Susan,"well, it doesn't have to be toilets. i mean, it could be sinks, bathtubs."
17179,Susan,no.
15001,Susan,i'm not giving up.
13746,Susan,julie and i went over this morning.
16782,Susan,"shh! jeez! ooh, mike's in the other room."
13470,Susan,"you know, i've lived with this bitterness so long, i think i'd be lonely without it."
14313,Susan,"no, it's just a nose bleed, she's fine."
17646,Susan,yeah. i gotta have one more. ah! thank you for doing this.
14418,Susan,what?
15569,Susan,"no. no, look,the whole neighborhood turned out to help.i'm very popular."
18386,Susan,"we're playing a game with dave, okay? so run as fast as you can."
18241,Susan,"are you kicking us out, tom?"
17654,Susan,"although some days it's ""larva"" or ""chunks."""
18194,Susan,how'd that go?
17879,Susan,lunch. it was lunch.
17810,Susan,"it was--i don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out. it was bedtime. i was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you. and he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were ever coming back, and so i finally--said maybe you would. i just didn't want him to be so sad."
16838,Susan,you don't remember?
17057,Susan,that's a relief.
15441,Susan,that the wedding's off.
13534,Susan,"mrs huber, with all due respect, you're crazy."
17446,Susan,thank you. now go shave. you look like a hobo.
16445,Susan,did i mention that maggie is an amazing chef? we're embarrassed to be cooking for her.
13405,Susan,"oh, no, no. no, edie's definitely a carnivore."
17363,Susan,tuesday? what are you talking about?
13914,Susan,good.
15589,Susan,"you sure that won't put a crimp in your, uh, dating life?you know, that girl you were at the movies with?"
16433,Susan,"hi, ian. i just asked mike. he can't make it."
15525,Susan,edie hired a-- p.i.?
13991,Susan,do you need help with the container?
14918,Susan,"karl, last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. that's it."
13406,Susan,i thought that was a look she was going for.
16792,Susan,"uh, yeah, well, you know, sometimes you gotta hang tough."
18385,Susan,"come on, honey! let's run! let's run!"
14497,Susan,"well, i'll just get back to work."
17286,Susan,"bree, are you okay?"
14120,Susan,"yes, i was. it was a big night for us, relationship-wise. it was the first time that we--"
15943,Susan,"nope, we're fine. besides, i can't leave until julie gets back with my toothpaste."
17254,Susan,"well, after this, we have a big party to go to."
15781,Susan,"oh.a guest room.well, that's handy."
16927,Susan,"i don't mind it. not to brag, but i went to art school."
15016,Susan,"oh, well, we, we haven't even finished the high school years. i wanted to show you this one. this was from the father-daughter dance. i had to take my mother's hairstylist."
15372,Susan,okay.
16525,Susan,deal.
17399,Susan,"mm. uh, lynette, it's not really a good time."
16893,Susan,"gee, let me think. nope, no nuts."
14447,Susan,"oh, of course."
18242,Susan,what was that about?
15265,Susan,"i think i know that ring.that's his grandmother's ring.it's a family heirloom.and,you know,he might just be having it cleaned or something."
15644,Susan,oh.
13532,Susan,no. thank you.
13623,Susan,"i told him another man asked me out, it was the perfect opportunity for mike to be jealous. and nothing."
14096,Susan,"hey, lynette."
16564,Susan,"well, clearly, you were not paying attention, because i did go back to mike the second he woke up, and he'd totally forgotten me!"
14349,Susan,"oh uh, that's okay. i just didn't expect to see anyone up at a quarter of one."
15253,Susan,it's okay. she knows that you make house calls.
15449,Susan,"okay,let's go. i don't wanna be late for the movie.oh,those are pretty.who sent those?"
15856,Susan,"so the doctor said i should use as many things as i can to jog your memory. and not just pictures.he said i could use tastes and smells and sounds, so tonight is sounds of the seventies."
17909,Susan,"look, i know it's quiet here, but i think you'll find there's a real charm to fairview."
16460,Susan,"how would that look? ""oh, hey, everybody! here's my wedding cake. oh, and what's that over there? it's my other wedding cake. i have to pick, and i will! so just stop pressuring me, okay? i'm sorry. i think i was just having a little sugar rush."
16924,Susan,i should go.
16931,Susan,"yeah, they can get like that. so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?"
17262,Susan,"okay, karl, you win. you happy?"
18138,Susan,"uh, you think i'm homeless. oh, no, no, no. no, i live here. i-i can prove it. i know exactly what's in this garbage bag. um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle--"
15543,Susan,hey there.you look thirsty.
13931,Susan,i don't think so.
14604,Susan,you want me back?
15259,Susan,"oh,yeah."
15027,Susan,what?
14585,Susan,i didn't think you did. now tell me why zach does.
15656,Susan,"well, actually, i think that twins are genetically determined by the mother."
18035,Susan,"yes, and we talked all about it. she loves it."
13928,Susan,"of all people, you picked that tired piece of - edie!"
14459,Susan,i know her.
16739,Susan,i'm in.
16256,Susan,"i'm sorry for eavesdropping, but don't you think your conversation is a little inappropriate? i mean, we're here to grieve, not cruise."
14414,Susan,are you okay?
15753,Susan,"well, if we can't be friends than i guess we'll be nothing."
17039,Susan,"oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments. if i was--i would've shown you this one."
13673,Susan,mrs. greenberg. do you remember those two eggs i let you borrow last christmas?
15718,Susan,"yes, you did."
15678,Susan,"so--about that ring you bought, is there anything particular you'd like to ask me?"
17252,Susan,i'm not asking you to lie. i'm just saying spin. why won't you spin?
13475,Susan,"oh. um, okay. here's the thing, karl. i was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday. and i just don't wanna, i don't wanna live like this. i don't wanna be that kind of person. and i just thought, if the two of us had a nice calm-i need an apology, karl."
14357,Susan,what?
13370,Susan,"alright ladies, lift 'em up. to mary alice, good friend and neighbor. wherever you are, we hope you've found peace."
18279,Susan,"ah, fake marriages--they're complicated."
13562,Susan,"oh, i am so glad to be playing frisbee again. here you go, coming atcha."
14599,Susan,"and out of all the mixed-up teenagers in the world, zach is just the one kid that i can't be around. i can't have julie around him. so, um, what i'm trying to say is--"
18001,Susan,i don't need the details. i had a long day. i just want to pick up my kid.
13353,Susan,"uh, oh god. that's him. how am i gonna stuff up the sink--"
15147,Susan,"oh,uh,friday's good."
16252,Susan,"oh! no, i wanna, um, keep a low profile."
14797,Susan,can't.
17297,Susan,"oh, my god! my water broke."
15204,Susan,"wow, nice to meet you."
16173,Susan,hi. bye.
15389,Susan,"i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance."
14151,Susan,"oh, julie, zach, this is ridiculous. you can't hold your breath forever."
14645,Susan,"hi, matthew."
16463,Susan,no! he--he pounced.
18175,Susan,"and your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you."
16183,Susan,so i was in the middle of totally freaking out when julie assured me that she's not having sex. i can't tell you how relieved i was.
17764,Susan,so bree knew?
16127,Susan,"no, but it's a piece of the puzzle. i mean, he did have an affair with her. and when you combine that with the fact that his first wife went missing--"
13423,Susan,oh.
14535,Susan,"uh, no, he's on a big plumbing job. what's up?"
15054,Susan,i'll wait for your call.
17406,Susan,what are you doing here?
17985,Susan,well--listen to me. the whole reason i went back to work is so we could both afford to give m.j. the things we felt he needed. now i'm doing my part. it's time you do yours.
13768,Susan,i don't know.
17217,Susan,excuse me. i have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet.
16146,Susan,"bree, hi. sorry about that. damn telemarketer. so what can i do for you?"
13717,Susan,"oh my god, look at this embroidery."
18087,Susan,what?
17200,Susan,"well, it was just sort of muttering. were you having a dream about him?"
17556,Susan,"whoops-a-daisy! oh, it's a good thing your dad's here to teach you how to do it right."
17955,Susan,"uh, what am i looking at exactly?"
16492,Susan,i'm taking my damn space!
14908,Susan,you probably don't know that your father and edie broke up last night.
14764,Susan,i'll just call the agency and let them know i'm going with you.
17024,Susan,thank you.
13949,Susan,a moray eel would seem safe after you.
14751,Susan,"zach, you know what i think? i think you should come back with me."
17144,Susan,"okay, so back to these receipts."
13740,Susan,"absolutely. oh. ow! ow, ow."
17348,Susan,"oh, honey. can you get all my toiletries out of the bathroom?"
15041,Susan,"oh, no."
14405,Susan,"paul, hi."
17018,Susan,"sure, go ahead. oh, should i look you in the eyes? does it make it easier for you to lie?"
15117,Susan,he's young.
13965,Susan,"good news. i finished my book, so i thought to celebrate, you could take me out to lunch."
16141,Susan,"oh, uh, can you hold on?"
14509,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself.something must have been going on."
18368,Susan,"oh, it's your daddy. hey, mike."
16550,Susan,"uh, can i get a map to the hot springs? i'm gonna hike up there."
16517,Susan,you are so dead.
16163,Susan,"okay, bree, i know you're angry, but for the sake of our friendship--"
16397,Susan,"well, that's okay. you gotta work, you gotta work. so, um--i was thinking about london. julie's gonna be applying to college as soon, and, um, a year abroad could give her a real boost. so--let's do it."
15017,Susan,"well, i, i just want to share more than our dna i, i wanted to have a relationship with you. none of this means anything to you?"
14991,Susan,what? i just got here.
13667,Susan,"that makes sense. still, i just want to make sure you didn't want to keep it, for zach, something to remember his mother by."
13347,Susan,and you're a plumber. right?
15670,Susan,you bought me a ring?
16335,Susan,"trust him, he's not."
15232,Susan,what?
15053,Susan,that was a good one.
18152,Susan,"no, you're being immoral. you're committing adultery."
13841,Susan,there's your answer.
17902,Susan,"jackson, hi. do you have a sec?"
14589,Susan,he had a gun in my face for six hours. i know what he looks like.
15134,Susan,dr. ron?what are you doing here?
15107,Susan,"great,she caught me staring."
16963,Susan,"yeah. but apparently, his dad can rise from the dead. so let's hope the baby gets that gene."
18298,Susan,it depends. jackson and i are only getting married because he needs his green card.
13527,Susan,what's so funny?
13880,Susan,yeah.
17110,Susan,imposing. who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want. i'm sorry. the words came out of my mouth before i knew what i was saying.
16278,Susan,do you know something?
18177,Susan,"god, she is so good at that."
15835,Susan,"uh, i, i think that you're sitting on my bra."
15684,Susan,you really think that's what's gonna happen?
13809,Susan,"no, it's just when i was your age, my pen pal lived on a farm in ohio, not in a mental institution. you know, that letter is one notch above prison mail."
17096,Susan,no.
15200,Susan,"no, no,i think she's onto something."
17476,Susan,"can you leave, please?"
15794,Susan,are you saying that jane is the only woman you ever--
14262,Susan,"well, excuse me, but that, that kinda makes it sound like it was my fault. you can't possibly blame me. i'm not the one who fired you."
14208,Susan,"no, of course i don't believe that, but i also didn't believe that karl was going to cheat on me, and i didn't believe that mary alice was gonna kill herself. i mean, let's face it, mike -- blind faith is not my friend."
16357,Susan,"i'd like you to say, ""we don't need this. we trust you."" but you don't, so i'll sign it. and once i do, i am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to ian."
14500,Susan,"i don't have time to explain adult relationships to you. oh, duck down."
17387,Susan,honey? i'm home. did you miss me?
15250,Susan,"karl,i think there might be snakes in here."
13578,Susan,"edie, wait! um, you should take my ticket."
14616,Susan,"i'll take care of it, i promise."
15186,Susan,"well, we were just wondering--actually, we were curious about, um--"
17984,Susan,"you're a plumber. ms. nelson is not expecting you on time. in fact, if you show up before dinner, she'll turn cartwheels. i'm a teacher. it's different."
18099,Susan,"well, here's how. um, i--i've spent my whole life putting myself out there, and, um, i'm still--today, alone."
16616,Susan,i don't want to be paid. i want my wedding back.
14623,Susan,what?
14670,Susan,"i wanna be happy first! mike and i were supposed to move in together, you know? this was supposed to be my time."
13864,Susan,no. my clothes were already off. i was going to seduce you.
13681,Susan,"it hasn't really changed since girl scouts. girls smile at you to your face, and then behind your back, they make fun of you because you're the only one not shaving your legs yet."
14957,Susan,are you saying that i'm the result of my mother having a one-night stand?
14749,Susan,"i don't know. he, he disappeared."
13476,Susan,an apology. for the way you ended our marriage. you never took any responsibility for your behaviour.
18184,Susan,"okay. i want to do edie justice, and for that to happen, i need four words, okay?"
17771,Susan,"hello? it's me. i just wanted to tell you--i've been thinking about it, and, um, i'm okay with you dating mike."
16109,Susan,hi! i'm sorry i'm late. where are your folks?
17656,Susan,i sort of guessed that when you painted my house.
17292,Susan,i'm doing what now?
17532,Susan,"so you're still gonna wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous, and we're still nobodies?"
16034,Susan,"your shower has six power nozzles. with or without you, i'll be back."
15904,Susan,i just--i just don't think that's a good idea.
14104,Susan,"he was embarrassed. he said it was an accident. oh, don't look at me like that. accidents happen."
17959,Susan,i'm going crazy 'cause i think i left my front door unlocked. could you run and check? i'll stay on the line.
14785,Susan,"well, i can't do that. you heard what he said about his wiring. i betrayed him. he'll never forgive me."
15613,Susan,"oh, ah."
17939,Susan,"thank you for agreeing to see us, mr. hobson. running a school like oakridge mustn't leave you with much--free time."
17651,Susan,i want us to spend this time really getting to know each other.
16986,Susan,"at the motel. i slipped out without waking him. i've been up all night thinking, and i have something to say to you. i don't believe you. i don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it."
14001,Susan,"i was scared that you were sleeping with mike, and so i let myself in, and i, i snuck around, i accidentally knocked a candle over, and the whole, just, i'm so sorry! can you ever forgive me?"
17130,Susan,"okay, i know that it sounds selfish, but i did what i did because i want you to stay."
14382,Susan,"julie, what is zach doing out there? i thought i told you not to speak to him anymore?"
17830,Susan,and he wants me to move there with him.
14251,Susan,would you like a glass of water and maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?
17014,Susan,he said there were no more pills. i was looking him in the eye.
16537,Susan,moved? what do you mean?
16080,Susan,what's going on?
15945,Susan,"okay, i'm gonna need some help with this big baby. go! zip, zip, zip!"
13878,Susan,i had to send zach back. we could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
18117,Susan,that is not true!
14569,Susan,emphasize the motion detectors.
16186,Susan,"ok, you search the closet. i'm gonna look under the bed."
15188,Susan,"she makes it sound like we're angry, and we're not angry."
15424,Susan,where'd you find that?
16511,Susan,"oh. well, that's a relief."
14719,Susan,what's wrong?
16934,Susan,like what?
15057,Susan,"right, interesting."
16149,Susan,"bree--i just want you to know that no matter what, your friendship means the world to me."
15205,Susan,oh.
16194,Susan,"wait, did my blonde hair have dark roots?"
16048,Susan,i am ian's girlfriend.
17900,Susan,"good-bye, edie."
15087,Susan,i'm fine.
16698,Susan,"you are happy,right?"
15369,Susan,i take it you met mike.
15278,Susan,"no,of course not.well,okay,this is good because--you know,if this experience helped you to realize your true feelings,then,uh--then we did something good here."
16669,Susan,"okay, i know that you think i'm being silly, but all of our friends went to bree's wedding, and now they're going to gaby's. two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?"
17092,Susan,just a mild sprain. how you doing?
15869,Susan,you!
13789,Susan,"well, every little detail is one thing. you know, weird creepy secrets, that's another."
16242,Susan,i can't see you anymore. i want you to understand it doesn't have anything to do with you. it's just--
13617,Susan,"still somebody broke in, it is a crime. so the weird thing is, the cop asked me out.on a date."
13894,Susan,gotcha.
14408,Susan,she changed her name because of her aunt? that just doesn't seem like something mary alice would do.
14787,Susan,utah. oh lord. why did i do this?
16764,Susan,what? i'm eating for two.
15451,Susan,"no,his feelings.he's the one with the feelings,not me."
13732,Susan,"what? no, no, i just came here, you know, with edie. we, just, love to ride that bull."
17581,Susan,"uh, thanks."
14092,Susan,"ah, please. i'm just glad you're okay. so, you shot yourself?"
17079,Susan,and you're kind of yelling at me-also a problem.
14736,Susan,oh. zach. zach!
15658,Susan,welcome to the neighborhood.
13708,Susan,"ooo, love that jacket. good choice."
15271,Susan,she found the ring and the prenup in your briefcase.she thought you were gonna pop the question tonight.
13414,Susan,of course.
15050,Susan,sweet.
16656,Susan,"see ya. oh, by the way--you know that one percent sliver of a doubt thing i told you about? totally gone. any question i had about mike's been answered."
14186,Susan,yeah. the girls and i found a threatening note in her stuff.
17558,Susan,"oh, will you stop? the doctor said it was just a sprain."
16255,Susan,oops. watch yourself.
14776,Susan,"i know. i know. it's just, lonnie's family. you know he's always been there for me. he paid my rent when i was waiting for my first royalty check. he called me everyday when karl left. i mean, i just owe him so much."
13819,Susan,that's a rationalization and you know it! see you at the show.
15298,Susan,so?
15608,Susan,"oh, good, then you'll be prime meat picking when you go to jail!"
17539,Susan,great. he's so excited to learn. are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
16271,Susan,yes. i accept your proposal to propose.
17821,Susan,"yes, that's fine. gays love me."
14078,Susan,"it's kind of important, um, yeah i guess it can wait. so i'll see you at seven?"
14624,Susan,you lie.
14495,Susan,i wasn't talking about dinner.
16304,Susan,"oh, no, th--"
15179,Susan,"i've been waiting for three hours.after you stormed out the other night,i started to doubt myself.i started to think,""gee, you know, maybe i should just ignore my better instincts,and i should let dr. ron gut me like a fish."""
17114,Susan,and our oven is making its debut.
15177,Susan,jim--
17169,Susan,"i don't understand you. is this something you do? you worm your way into a neighborhood with the promise of free tax preparation, and then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorce?"
17904,Susan,"hey, gaby, did you remember to get change? 'cause when i cash in my chips, i don't want to hear you say, ""all i've got is $50s."""
18278,Susan,can't i at least tell the girls?
16795,Susan,we need whipped cream.
16577,Susan,mike. i twisted my ankle.
17973,Susan,"okay, maybe i jumped to conclusions, but this school is important for m.j.. i feel really bad that we're falling short."
14280,Susan,"well, it's true."
13687,Susan,"okay, fine, if you don't want to help me, i'm not going to force you."
16926,Susan,"okay, before we become an ugly mob, why doesn't one of us go talk to the guys?but not me. they hate me."
16047,Susan,"fine. fine, fine, fine, fine."
15463,Susan,"did i call edie a slut?well,that's overstating it.edie's not a slut.she's just-- popular with indiscriminate men.anyway-- yes,those are the relevant players."
16421,Susan,"sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.""mike, we're drowning. save us."" ""mike, it's dark. give us a flashlight."" let's go ask gaby."
16193,Susan,"is this dr. marvin tashman? hi. my name is susan mayer. um, my daughter julie came in to see you--yes, about birth control. so i'm just curious--where do you get off prescribing that without my consent?! what?! no, i most certainly was not there. what do i look like? i don't have blonde hair."
15381,Susan,"i can see that.so,what,did you run out of strangers to beat up on the street,and you're going house to house now?"
17054,Susan,he bought those pills a long time ago and never got around to paying the guy.
13542,Susan,will you please just drop it?
17093,Susan,"it's gonna be okay. i talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with."
17108,Susan,"how do you say no to someone in need? that wasn't rhetorical. seriously, you got anything?"
14428,Susan,morty? what are you doing?
15083,Susan,you okay?
18311,Susan,we're getting married.
17310,Susan,that--turns out i spilled some club soda.
16570,Susan,"okay, i know it's dark, but i can see you."
14344,Susan,"mom, would you please not flirt with the ice cream man."
17743,Susan,so--i know her?
14651,Susan,"honestly, edie, i don't mind. you can skate off into the sunset with karl. be my guest."
16310,Susan,"oh, thanks. i needed to hear to that."
17787,Susan,"no, i'm talking about that line you fed her. ""sports illustrated""? what's the issue about, the senior olympics?"
14015,Susan,what are you thinking?
17585,Susan,"semantics. and then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver? you know, why not just ask for a massage?"
17648,Susan,and knowing we're not gonna have sex takes all the pressure off.
15411,Susan,"uh,just talking."
15968,Susan,"this is susan mayer-- again. first of all, i'm sorry for the ""crazy lady"" remark. second, i have a proposition for you."
15364,Susan,"what were you thinking?oh,oh!"
17082,Susan,let go of me! aah! oh!
14902,Susan,wow.
16850,Susan,"great. okay, you pick first."
17952,Susan,what about that big job you just did for the last three months? what did you do with that money?
17533,Susan,mike! what's going on?
16026,Susan,"um, yeah, that sounds great. you pick."
17265,Susan,"uh, yeah. that guy was the worst."
16675,Susan,"you've been sneaking out while i've been asleep? what are you, ninja plumber?"
16920,Susan,there must be some way i can apologize to them.
13348,Susan,the clog's in the pipe.
14449,Susan,"i can't trust mike, and i wanted to find out what really happened. from a source that doesn't have an agenda. now open it up."
13985,Susan,my junior year. how'd you know?
17554,Susan,boy--he was just telling me how glad he is to have his dad here.
16638,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, i would love that!"
15220,Susan,"oh, hi.it's nice to meet you."
16796,Susan,"well, i don't think that you can have sexy date night without whipped cream."
16321,Susan,no. of course not.
15492,Susan,"ugh! ooh,out! get out!"
13591,Susan,mr. whiskers!!!
15314,Susan,"yeah. it--yes,i am."
18371,Susan,okay.
13741,Susan,we've been introduced.
14118,Susan,what day was that?
17272,Susan,wow. it's all recipes.
13729,Susan,"mike! what a small, small world."
17273,Susan,"um, well--i guess mike didn't tell you that i'm, uh, really not a cook."
17390,Susan,so were you. oh. and--time to go.
14710,Susan,"the other day when i saw you making music with my family, i got a little jealous and i went a little crazy and i pushed you out. seeing you sitting here today, well, i can see how much you care about julie, and she comes first, and it should be you up there playing with her, not me. so i'm sorry."
17818,Susan,you're no better than i am.
15870,Susan,i've been wondering why mike's been so cold to me. now it all makes sense.
15405,Susan,"karl!karl,stop! stop!oh! it's an emergency."
13448,Susan,yeah.
14692,Susan,"well, i have good news. um, i've been taking piano lessons with betty applewhite, and, uh, well, i just thought maybe i could join you guys. you know, like a trio. doesn't that sound fun?"
13853,Susan,"no, me neither."
17965,Susan,"no. so i was going to take these and sell them to try to pay for it, and, yes, now that i'm saying it out loud, i hear how stupid that sounds."
14047,Susan,"no, of course he didn't. so, what happened exactly?"
16589,Susan,"hey, fran_ois, it's susan mayer. um, call me as soon as you get this. i know i told you that my wedding is off, but it's back on, and i wanna see if you're still available to do the flowers. bye. oh, um, just so you know, ian's not the groom anymore. long story. call me."
13915,Susan,"no. no, no, no. you obviously think you have some insight into my soul, so please, go ahead, dazzle me."
13773,Susan,"if you came in here to judge me, you can just leave!"
17221,Susan,"no, i get it. really, i knew this day was coming. i just didn't know it would be a day when i was so horny."
17888,Susan,it's the way you are with men-- they're like tissues. you use one and then toss it away and then you're on to the next one. at least i'm looking for something real.
16153,Susan,so alma's alive. big deal. we still don't know what went down between orson and monique.
15071,Susan,"well, thanks.we appreciate that."
14182,Susan,"i'm telling you, he's hiding something. he clams up every time we try to ask him about mary alice. and then when we found out about dana--"
18336,Susan,"no, i need to talk to mike. now you could flush the toilet and try to get him out there."
17133,Susan,"can i have milk, too?"
13395,Susan,julie? mike delfino just invited us to dinner friday night.
17800,Susan,what? i have never said a negative word about them dating ever.
15430,Susan,why are you hanging on to that?
14960,Susan,"oh, my god. do you know where he is?"
14852,Susan,"i don't know how i know this, but i, i think that he's in utah. he, he took a bus to bountiful. you have family there, right? okay, i gave him the bus fare."
18027,Susan,"hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?"
16456,Susan,wow. it's kinda hard to decide.
17481,Susan,okay. we'll give him a call.
15792,Susan,different?
15689,Susan,"no, he was going to, but then you clocked him in the mouth with a salad shooter, remember? actually, i'm going to pop the question to him tomorrow night."
14754,Susan,what?
16076,Susan,"bree, you have got to go to the police with all of this."""
17790,Susan,yeah. i got it.
15002,Susan,i'm gonna be back in the store next week. i never got that darn horse feed.
14000,Susan,"edie, i burned your house down."
16360,Susan,you can count on it.
14757,Susan,"yeah. now that you know he's okay, you should go to him. he'll want to take care of you. that's what parents do. let me help. how much money do you think you'll need to get to utah?"
16007,Susan,it's not what you think.
14612,Susan,i live on this street. your daughter lives on this street. i will not have you flaunting your sexcapades in front of us.
14010,Susan,"oh, you don't have to. well, this is good. thank you. i guess i should go take a shower and wash mrs. huber off of me."
14590,Susan,can you give us a minute?
18269,Susan,"yeah. i'll do it. but that's it. no love, no sex, just--marriage."
15610,Susan,no!give it! no!
17219,Susan,i understand.
17927,Susan,locks.
15920,Susan,"no! no, no! actually, i just, i just had something to tell you."
17365,Susan,"yes--to be chosen, and you have been chosen. so congratulations, and you're staying home."
15309,Susan,"oh! yeah,oh--no,no,he just said that 'cause we used to be married.it's just a force of habit."
13399,Susan,edie.
16758,Susan,"hey, katherine. what's going on?"
16025,Susan,loving that idea.
13804,Susan,trouble at work?
16702,Susan,"""pretty much"" means there is something that you want that you don't have. how can i give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?"
16354,Susan,mike. i saw you watching us. we were just talking.
14245,Susan,"okay, i won't go out with him. i mean obviously you have feeling for him."
13480,Susan,you know what? i don't need an apology. i don't need anything from you.
18361,Susan,"i was thinking about what you said, and you were right. it really would do me good to get out of here for a few days"
17277,Susan,i don't have one.
14142,Susan,what? what does that have to do with -
13821,Susan,listen to me. there is no future for you and gabrielle. she's not going to divorce carlos and run away with you.
16785,Susan,do you wanna go or not?
14698,Susan,"well, why don't we put it to a test? julie, who would you rather have play with you?"
14677,Susan,"but he's with edie. i mean, she's not exactly the maternal type. i wouldn't be a good mother if i wasn't concerned. i mean, who knows what passes for a kid-friendly, good time in there? drugs? porn? smoking?"
18036,Susan,what? where the hell is it?
14200,Susan,what was that?
13682,Susan,and a lot less sneaky.
17232,Susan,"well, that's not enough. he should pay for what he did. he should go to prison."
17925,Susan,"change the locks, don't talk to me, then leave."
13700,Susan,i figure dana has something to do with what mary alice was trying to hide.
13973,Susan,"that's smart, that, that's good."
15916,Susan,i had passion with mike. and drama. lots of drama. love isn't supposed to be that hard.
15013,Susan,"oh, come on, just guess. you can tell."
13699,Susan,"there wasn't enough time. he did say one thing that was kind of mysterious. he said something happened to someone named dana, and that he could never ever talk about it."""
14339,Susan,"i think it's natures little joke, that children ultimately end up parenting their parents."
13494,Susan,i was thinking we left too late.
13337,Susan,how would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery?
15751,Susan,a part of you feels like you'r cheating on her.
17412,Susan,"the problem is, if you meet my friends, then we're in a relationship, and i can't be in a relationship right now."
14808,Susan,no! there has not been and there never will be.
18252,Susan,i'll see you tomorrow.
18196,Susan,that's weird.
18436,Susan,"actually tom could you just hang on a second. uh, i also would like to say a few words. to bree and orson, ah yes, what could be better than a second love, and this time you enter it a little older, a little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh, with a bit of caution. because, while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away. uh, not you two. you two crazy kids are great. congrats, yeah."
16916,Susan,oh. what if we take it to my cleaners?
18121,Susan,would this seem any less shocking if i told you we were once married for 12 years?
14171,Susan,"i don't know. five minutes, give or take three hours."
18291,Susan,"""chip in""? it's is not a birthday cake for shirley in accounting. it's mortgage and food and insurance. i'm sorry, but i can't marry you."
16626,Susan,i don't. i was just on my way to apologize to you.
16124,Susan,yesterday.
14893,Susan,"actually, i'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing. um, last night i started writing and, well, i think there's a book in there."
16455,Susan,themes?
16706,Susan,i cannot believe it has been 12 years.you haven't changed a bit.
14545,Susan,"honey, i know about dana."
17216,Susan,it's not your favorite?
16622,Susan,"i mean, i'm sorry, but this time, gaby has just crossed the line, and i will not make myself sit through her wedding. julie thinks i'm overreacting. you don't think i'm overreacting, do you?"
13513,Susan,"well, she's bringing out the big guns."
17566,Susan,i've never seen bree so happy. she's glowing.
17486,Susan,hey! you leave him alone. oh! honey! is that who's been picking on you? juanita solis?
14441,Susan,mother!
18261,Susan,go away! i-i don't want to talk to you.
14390,Susan,i'll talk to you girls later.
18331,Susan,why is that? when did being practical and realistic become synonymous with bitchiness?
14632,Susan,where are we?
15847,Susan,"oh, my god. you are awake."
16863,Susan,"no, we'll talk now. you still owe me an explanation for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to."
16711,Susan,sure.i'm just here for a checkup.
16035,Susan,i don't need much. one of those will do.
17820,Susan,"oh, please! i'm bored. mike has m.j., jackson's out of town, and you're gonna need somebody to bitch about bob to."
14266,Susan,"well, no, he didn't."
15532,Susan,mike--
16584,Susan,"because this date has special meaning for us. i sat in front of that trailer for six hours thinking you hated me, and a proposal would've brought the entire thing full circle. it would've turned a bad memory into a beautiful one."
15570,Susan,"oh, no, no.everybody's been very helpful.um, everybody likes me.absolutely--"
16831,Susan,great.
13752,Susan,"sounds like a job. so, julie said that you came by before?"
15725,Susan,bree?
18382,Susan,"okay. here, m.j."
15126,Susan,"oh,oh,no,i don't think that's necessary."
16822,Susan,i'm eating for two.
17095,Susan,"oh, my god. are you kidding me?"
13848,Susan,no.
14327,Susan,morty!
17679,Susan,how close are you? 'cause i can wait.
13647,Susan,right!okay. thank you.
14921,Susan,what?
16930,Susan,"oh, my god. wow! it's a fountain, too."
13317,Susan,"yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, you know susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
15467,Susan,"that's why you brought me down here?karl,you made it sound like it was an emergency."
14696,Susan,that is so not true!
14336,Susan,"i just keep thinking it's coming, millie, and i can't stop it."
14358,Susan,forget it.
18348,Susan,"um, no, thanks. so, look, uh.. i'm sorry if i was a little under-enthusiastic the other day about you and katherine getting married."
14416,Susan,but you know what they say about kids: that you can't imagine having them until you do and then you can't imagine life without them? it's true.
17866,Susan,gladly.
17690,Susan,and a damn good one.
16767,Susan,"well, uh, well, the johnson's live right down the road. yeah, i guess that's fine."
17124,Susan,thanks.
16082,Susan,is edie getting you a good lawyer?
13754,Susan,six is good.
16148,Susan,"oh, uh--sure."
17282,Susan,i have a job.
13763,Susan,"and then i opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it. i mean, there was wads of it."
13831,Susan,what?
18401,Susan,"oh, my god."
13404,Susan,right.
13709,Susan,susan.
13995,Susan,"i know, i know. mrs. huber was a good friend to you."
16126,Susan,i snuck into his office and rifled through his things.
14633,Susan,"i don't know. since the guy who held me hostage turned out to be your son, i think logic dictates that i should move on. the problem is, i'm crazy about you."
16506,Susan,"no, this is horrible! this wasn't supposed to happen! i only let myself fall for ian 'cause i thought mike was lost to me. and then bang! suddenly he wants me back, and now i have this choice that i can't possibly make."
14365,Susan,"mother, don't you think it's getting a little late?"
17527,Susan,"which is a good thing, 'cause there's a shark attacking the house."
14901,Susan,why would you--?
14192,Susan,i don't know. just something suspicious.
14021,Susan,"you're not going, you're going to stay here and talk about this."
15068,Susan,"you know,despite what i did--sending zach away,i want you two to connect.i hope you know that."
16644,Susan,"she's so excited, so needy."
13451,Susan,"no, it's sort of a way to honour mary alice. it was so important to her."
17238,Susan,quit eyeing it. i ain't sharing.
15844,Susan,"okay, not on purpose, but you did. you were sweet and charming and english.and that's why when my prayers were answered,i was a hundred miles away, naked in someone else's arms.this should never have happened."
15036,Susan,oh! i guess not.
17263,Susan,"just drop the act. you are so loving this. you ended up with the miss america with a law degree, and i ended up with the pillhead plumber. bravo. damn it! why won't this unroll?"
15575,Susan,you weren't supposed to get that.i stole that back from the mailman.
14674,Susan,"well, see? there you go."
18216,Susan,"yes, officer?"
14881,Susan,who is it?
18350,Susan,"i know. but still--i mean, it happened so fast. i just--i wanna make sure that you know what you're doing."
14446,Susan,it was all true. everything he said. how could i have been so wrong?
18318,Susan,"dave, i haven't heard jackson since he was taken away and i just wanna be here in case he calls."
18148,Susan,"oh, you met ed?"
15603,Susan,"okay, wait.could you just swallow?'cause i couldn't really--what you were saying--"
18187,Susan,we need to be annoying and persistent. we're good at that.
16866,Susan,"like what? i mean, come on. just tell me. we share everything."
17891,Susan,it's just-- now i get it.
17719,Susan,what is this about you never getting married?
14979,Susan,"oh, no. i was just looking at the color of your eyes."
15789,Susan,"wow, my heart is pounding."
16509,Susan,lynette! what are you doing here?
14243,Susan,edie.
17509,Susan,this conversation is over. tell bob and lee that i'll pay for the dent in their lawn. you did not!
14133,Susan,i'm sure i won't be late. bye.
14296,Susan,"oh, come on!"
17336,Susan,"i know. it's terrible, but i can't change it now. mike was so emotional about it."
16311,Susan,i'm so sorry.
14669,Susan,i want you to be happy. i even sort of want edie to be happy.
17705,Susan,aren't i?
14221,Susan,"no, no no. that's okay, i don't wanna, you know, litter."
17316,Susan,maybe. who cares! let her have it.
13836,Susan,"god, you are so weak!"
13889,Susan,you walked out on your family.
13801,Susan,"it helps, huh?"
14222,Susan,"great, just great!"
17416,Susan,okay.
17604,Susan,what's wrong with the way things are? why change everything now?
17233,Susan,mike says i need to forgive orson--
17974,Susan,"no. but i read in your brochure that faculty members get a 50% discount, so for your art department, how would you like to hire an award-winning children's book illustrator who is great with kids and has a face you can't say no to?"
13711,Susan,"yeah. yeah. no, actually no, i don't know. so, by old friend, do you mean college pal, bowling buddy, saved you from drowning?"
14700,Susan,"yep, i am. i think i'm going to make another push for using that pedal. i think it adds grandeur."
17487,Susan,"well, she is going to get a big surprise, because your daddy is about to turn you into a killing machine."
13472,Susan,"i'm coming! karl, what are you doing here? i asked you to come tomorrow."
16425,Susan,"don't walk in the kitchen. anyway, where is your sense of romance? it's a blackout. you have a defenseless lady. getting any ideas?"
14241,Susan,"come on, that's a really 3rd-grade thing to say."
16666,Susan,"fine, we'll skip the chocolate. how out a champagne fountain? oh, i know! maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture."
17046,Susan,"hey, that kid, um, barrett came by today."
14928,Susan,we all cleared our schedules. we thought maybe you could use some company.
18185,Susan,one of a kind.
15963,Susan,"yeah, but there's a crazy woman in there!"
16302,Susan,no.
16898,Susan,"oh, come on, uncle frank.what's the point of having a gay uncle if you're not gonna help me make friends with these guys? oh. uh, mom said that the whole family knew. um, okay. gotta go. love you."
17842,Susan,"yes. uh, we had a very nice, uneventful evening. why? what did he say? 'cause he was pretty drunk, so he was--probably making stuff up."
18111,Susan,okay. so--that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
17038,Susan,"well, no rush. you know, just yesterday, i was telling my daughter julie--oh, you know, that is so rude. i-i'm talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like. that's her."
13464,Susan,"oh, sorry. was that petulant too?"
13640,Susan,and that means what?
16775,Susan,so back to chemo--how's that been?
17269,Susan,"oh, okay."
17760,Susan,it's fine. it's--fine.
15588,Susan,oh.
17004,Susan,"okay, don't tell anybody i told you this. her mom said something at my party about her dad being abusive towards katherine--and maybe dylan, too."
13852,Susan,you are just the sweetest guy.
14330,Susan,"morty, i'd like to have a relationship again. and at my age, with a kid, if she moves in to my house, even for a couple of years, i'm doomed."
13912,Susan,"no, no! it's fine. it just kind of caught me off guard. i mean, i want to say it back."
13654,Susan,no.the cop lied to me.
17361,Susan,"hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? 'cause now you do. bree needs about two truckloads of flowers picked up from--what?"
16190,Susan,"no, you cannot borrow it."
18400,Susan,what?
13633,Susan,"then you're going to have to get zach to tell you something, so we have more to go on."
15888,Susan,"yes! that's progress! see? oh, it's all gonna come back. we're gonna be us again!"
14956,Susan,"well, why would my mother tell me that?"
14477,Susan,mike and i got back together.
16393,Susan,"oh, come on."
15988,Susan,"yeah? well, i choose to ground you. two weeks, baby."
17877,Susan,he dumped me during math class.
16300,Susan,was that the ring that you bought for--
14146,Susan,"how could you? god, 'susan, do you trust me?' yes, of course i do. oh, i'm such an idiot, and you're such a liar. oh, and apparently a killer, and a drug dealer. that's just quite a personal ad you've got going there."
15115,Susan,"oh,he could be cuter--but i don't know how."
16343,Susan,"oh, please. it's not that bad. i once worked at this fish-and-chip place. i had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder. ""would you like to hear arrr specials?"""
15510,Susan,oh! uh--okay.
17856,Susan,but you are fun to dance with.
15166,Susan,i'm curious. um--why were you so congratulatory?
14653,Susan,"edie, what are you doing?"
17099,Susan,"uh, she went to the hospital with carlos. he was pretty banged up, but they say he's gonna be okay."
15808,Susan,"i was gonna stay mad at you another hour, but your damn accent gets me every time."
15591,Susan,guess not.
14876,Susan,"thanks. that's great. 'cause if you decided to hang on to my joni mitchell cds i'd have to come after you with a club. you're right, it's not funny. actually, i did want to see if you were aware that you gave me back the valentine's day card that i made you."
14567,Susan,"yeah. he's determined to see that kid behind bars. so tomorrow at school, i want you to let everybody know that we got this new, expensive security system."
14733,Susan,"have you seen this boy? hey, missing kid. anyone? going once, going twice--"
17473,Susan,"could you please take care of this guy? he's my friend, too."
14317,Susan,"hey, millie, hi, morty."
17592,Susan,"we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident. you know that. before that, we were good. we could get back there."
16600,Susan,"well, what could be more important to you than my wedding?"
16732,Susan,"listen,my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.if you wanna have kids,you might wanna jump on it right now."
15111,Susan,why not?you said he was nice.
15252,Susan,hi!happy valentine's day.
13670,Susan,"so, how'd you get the fat lip?"
15779,Susan,"ah, wow, look at the view!oh.don't you just love when the leaves change color."
13827,Susan,"helen, helen, you're here! did they tell you about the change in lineup? i'm going to go last if that's okay."
15724,Susan,i love you.it is really just dinner.
15709,Susan,so you were very mysterious on the phone.why did you want to have lunch?
15149,Susan,wandering what?
17498,Susan,you know what? maybe you could teach your daughter how to use her words and not her fists.
17448,Susan,really?
17081,Susan,forget it.
14571,Susan,my fault?
15648,Susan,you've gotta be kidding.
17763,Susan,bree?
15412,Susan,"oh,no,that's okay."
13471,Susan,"hey karl, it's me. i was hoping you'll be there. um, listen, we need to talk. so, maybe when you drop julie off tomorrow, we could have a moment. it's important. give my best to-brandy. call me."
14276,Susan,mom!
13963,Susan,i absolutely did not do that thing you accused me of.
13502,Susan,"i'll be quick. brandy, i'm sorry for the way i treated you. it was uncalled for, and childish, and it won't happen again. i have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you, and i realise now that i just can't carry that around anymore. so, apology or no apology, i'm moving on."
17126,Susan,"oh, well, you'll reel somebody in. you always do. you should have seen his last boyfriend--justin. he was so hot. you really had a thing for the young, ripped muscle boys, huh?"
13639,Susan,"hey,i thought this went to the lab."
14295,Susan,"alright, alright."
14530,Susan,he's a good person.
17032,Susan,trust me. your finger is not where he'd put it.
16806,Susan,"yeah, well, boomer likes it."
16932,Susan,"i was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?"
15614,Susan,edie--
14819,Susan,you can?
17077,Susan,what?
15458,Susan,"well,i definitely pickedthe right person to sit next to.actually,is this seat taken?"
15474,Susan,karl. what's going on?
14180,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just so hard to find a guy like mike. i know in my heart he didn't kill mrs. huber.
14860,Susan,"mike, stop."
18372,Susan,"oh, my god."
14154,Susan,oh.
13722,Susan,so friends can do that.
16130,Susan,"oh, i so did not need to know that."
17404,Susan,"no, of course not. it's just-- complicated."
13777,Susan,"good boy, bongo! run, bongo, run, go get help!"
14746,Susan,how?
16731,Susan,what if you change it back?
18103,Susan,karl. what are you doing here?
15843,Susan,"how could you possibly know what i was feeling? for six months, i have prayed every day for that man to wake up, and you made me give up on him."
16590,Susan,there. i think i left messages for everyone. are you sure it's okay for us to have the same wedding i was planning with ian? be honest.
14384,Susan,zach! what do you think you are?argh! argh!
15542,Susan,"well,wait.why would you do that?"
17935,Susan,great. i will go to the store right now and get some wine so we can toast your retirement.
17324,Susan,conner.
15739,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in a mood to, thank you."
14812,Susan,what did he do?
15555,Susan,for keeping edie from smashing my face in.that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
16580,Susan,"mike, what day is today?"
17608,Susan,do i you think she'll be surprised?
18110,Susan,"what a lovely rainbow, june. here's a gold star for you. oh, drew, wow! you know, elephants don't have wings, but i like the way you're thinking. hey, evan, what did you draw? that's a lot of red."
14452,Susan,"if you find out something that's really bad, just try and put a positive spin on it."
14588,Susan,that's not zach.
17600,Susan,unless you're not interested.
17453,Susan,"mike told you about the ear thing, didn't he?"
14885,Susan,so am i allowed to ask what happened?
14403,Susan,believe whatever you want.
18096,Susan,"still, uh--i never meant to lead you on."
18380,Susan,just hold on a few more minutes.
16928,Susan,and they taught us that art is subjective.
13446,Susan,really?
14730,Susan,"you know, edie, could you just back off? i mean the truth is we're probably never gonna find zach, anyway. it's a needle in a haystack."
15251,Susan,mostly.
14740,Susan,but then i got hungry.
14886,Susan,why not?
13691,Susan,i don't get it. i've gone through all your yearbooks and you and zach never went to school with anybody named dana.
16214,Susan,is it gaby's birthday?
15338,Susan,"i did?oh, is that why you han't been in to see me since my surgery?"
15153,Susan,"oh, that's a good idea.i forgot.i have a bottle of wine.it's already chilled right in the refrigerator,and that'll just really relax me."
17120,Susan,"no. that walter guy needs to stay miserable, because if he's not, he'll fix her roof, and then she'll leave us."
16277,Susan,"i know we've been fighting. something like this happens, it just puts everything into perspective. i am so sorry. it was all my fault. if i hadn't got so caught up in protecting mike--"
16769,Susan,mike. i'm going with mike.
14088,Susan,what?
14731,Susan,i'm just happy to be spending the day with you.
15228,Susan,yeah.
16899,Susan,what's going on?
16609,Susan,you stole my florist?
14094,Susan,we don't have to talk about that now.
17741,Susan,"i care because you mean a lot to me, and it makes me feel good knowing that two people have found love and happiness. so what's her name? who am i happy for?"
16172,Susan,"well--don't--don't think that you can get out of this, you know, by just--oh, god. oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah, right--right there. oh, right there."
14502,Susan,oh yeah? when your father was cheating on me i used to follow him all the time. i know my stuff. there he is.
13529,Susan,i'm fine.
13363,Susan,oh-- oh! oh!
18006,Susan,"okay, lunch and movie. you are one lucky boy. i'm gonna take a quick shower. try not to get any crumbs on the couch. what's wrong? it's peanut butter, no crusts your favorite."
15279,Susan,i can't believe you thought i was jealous.it's not like i still have feelings for you anymore.
18306,Susan,"clearly, you've never been married before."
13774,Susan,"wait! wait! no! wait, don't, don't go! wait, i have an idea. here! here! here! here, grab the towel, bongo! come on, grab the other end! come on, boy! that's it! get the other end! come on, bongo! pull the other end! come on, bongo! what are you doing? bongo, over here!"
13518,Susan,"we, uh, got this by mistake."
15872,Susan,me? but why doesn't she leave? i-i'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.
16285,Susan,"the place came out great, huh?"
16234,Susan,poor ian.
17840,Susan,my mechanic? are you crazy?
13886,Susan,"oh, yeah."
15576,Susan,"this is not what we should focus on right now.the point is, you maliciously set fire to my house."
15501,Susan,she's sleeping.
17966,Susan,"well, he did."
16546,Susan,"okay, julie, i'm out of here. here's forty bucks on the counter."
14638,Susan,"mmm, brunch. brunch would be nice."
13736,Susan,oh fun. i'm a doggie.
13455,Susan,"it's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep julie an extra day."
16977,Susan,so you killed him?
16217,Susan,"yeah, i thought it was in a trust, and he couldn't touch it."
17811,Susan,i didn't even think he'd remembered it.
17545,Susan,you could've walked away.
17875,Susan,edie--
16495,Susan,"say, ""i'm a rude, arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!"""
18313,Susan,after the crash--
15296,Susan,give me that. aah!
15272,Susan,"oh,yes.you know,this whole fake marriage thing was okay when nobody was getting hurt.what are we doing? it's a lie!i lost mike over a lie,and now i'm doing the same thing to dr. ron,and--and look at edie.she was devastated.i don't think i can go through with this."
18088,Susan,"actually, i'm more worried about the lesbian that's outside of me trying to get in. um, can we just teach the class and talk about this later?"
14482,Susan,"you know, i'm gonna run home and get some milk to go with those doughnuts."
14062,Susan,i wish i could. i still feel like something's not right.
16115,Susan,"i said i was sorry, ian. i have to help mike. i'm all he's got."
15805,Susan,"what is this, the gallup poll?!"
14586,Susan,so paul killed her?
17003,Susan,maybe dylan should ask her mom.
17653,Susan,"you're just guessing. it's ""panties."""
15785,Susan,me too.
16100,Susan,"but mike is in jail, and you said yourself you thought orson did it."
17796,Susan,"hey, katherine. what a cute top."
17070,Susan,"yeah, i can see that. hi. i'm his neighbor. cute shoes. why the hell would you give mike drugs?"
18091,Susan,"though i would definitely appreciate the--beauty of the gazelle, uh, if i was going to take a trip to africa--"
14950,Susan,mom! mom.
17887,Susan,you know-- maybe i do feel incomplete without a man. but i-- wouldn't trade places with you for anything. you wanna know why?
14105,Susan,"now, did he? we don't know that for sure. all we know is that lynette's kids turned up with it."
13574,Susan,what?
16209,Susan,that's still ten years in prison.
14253,Susan,"oh, god, no. no! you are just so incredibly not hideous."
13830,Susan,"oh! ow! for god's sake, helen, this is for charity!"
17411,Susan,"no, of course not. my friends would love you."
16944,Susan,why don't you get-- tree house plugs?
14297,Susan,i mean-he shouldn't have done that.
15413,Susan,"wait until i leave to tell her,'cause she's gonna kill me."
17308,Susan,thank you. do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?
17507,Susan,i barely tapped her. she was milking it.
14090,Susan,mike?!
16585,Susan,"yes, i did, because i am a thoughtful person. and whenever we do get married, that is something you are gonna have to work on."
14343,Susan,the kids are waiting.
13970,Susan,"i, i'm sorry for what happened. it must be really hard, not knowing who did it, or why. you must feel helpless."
15268,Susan,"oh,hi. um,do you see that man over there?dark hair,handsome.i need you to slip this to him without anybody noticing."
14341,Susan,"oh, for pete's sake."
17489,Susan,that's not just any girl. you saw her. she could take down a small deer.
14350,Susan,"um, mom. could i just talk to you in the family room for a minute?"
13846,Susan,am i? hmm.
17559,Susan,"you know, why look for blame? kids fall. if you have to find fault, blame the pavement, not yourself--or me."
18064,Susan,i'm so glad you could make it. i know i sprung this on you at the last minute.
15833,Susan,"oh, it's julie. i have to. hello? what's up? hey. uh, i can't, no, can you say that again? the signal's really bad. what? oh, my god."
14353,Susan,"look, i know you're trying to get over morty, but this is not the way to do it.so can you please just go out there and tell him to go home?"
14804,Susan,"you'll never lose my friendship, though. i mean that."
15313,Susan,"yes. okay.i am married,but it's only because my insurance ran out.my ex-husband has a really good coverage plan,so he said that he would remarry me so i could get my operation.only i didn't wanna tell dr. ron 'cause i didn't want him to be an accomplice to fraud."
14135,Susan,"okay. uh, yes. he came over around ten o'clock."
18182,Susan,just one word. this is hard.
13351,Susan,"that's it, just stuff the hair down."
18307,Susan,"well, i've been in some real marriages that weren't, so--maybe you're right."
16312,Susan,here they come.
15072,Susan,"well,what do you think?"
17929,Susan,"oh, yeah. he's a great guy. i just, uh, want to be alone right now."
13560,Susan,wear these. i don't want you to leave any fingerprints.
16555,Susan,"two days? well, can't i just drive part of the way and then hike from there?"
17588,Susan,you know what? we need a minute.
14663,Susan,"oh, my god. i'm so sorry. i sent roses. did she get the roses?"
16915,Susan,how's bob's suit?
16663,Susan,"oh, wow!"
15930,Susan,susan.
17442,Susan,"no, you're not. you like football-- american football. specifically the colts."
13794,Susan,"lynette! you know, when are you coming back? lynette! lynette!"
14467,Susan,"and despite the evidence, despite all that's been laid out in front of me, i can't help feeling that there's more to the story. does that sound stupid?"
16205,Susan,he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.
15846,Susan,thank you.
18310,Susan,"please, can't this wait? we're about to get married."
18050,Susan,"it is, actually, because that is when i decided that i don't want this piece of art that i slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend. capisce?"
13373,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
16981,Susan,"yeah, an evil person."
17381,Susan,really?
16922,Susan,"mike, wait. we should talk about this."
16450,Susan,thanks a lot. now maggie thinks you're charles manson.
15991,Susan,"julie mayer, you get back here! you're grounded, remember?! edie britt, i wanna talk to you."
15838,Susan,can't you do that stuff later?
16412,Susan,i'm good.
17376,Susan,"here's the thing. you and i have always had kind of an unconventional relationship, and the reason that worked was because we always tell each other the truth--until yesterday. julie, i lied about not having enough money to send you."
15931,Susan,susan.
17644,Susan,can we start over?
15063,Susan,you do?
15094,Susan,are you jim?i'm susan mayer.
13984,Susan,"i'll go with you, edie."
17880,Susan,ron. dr. ron. are we done?
16591,Susan,"gosh, i just keep thinking there's someone i've forgotten to tell. caterer, band, florist--"
16422,Susan,dinner?
14702,Susan,i did not kick edie out. julie made that call.
15005,Susan,"bree, i'm so sorry."
13391,Susan,"yeah, it's sort of a new tradition. i'm working out the kinks."
18011,Susan,what is he doing here?
16913,Susan,"you know what? don't worry about it. i'm gonna go inside and get us some water, and then we're gonna just keep looking."
17949,Susan,"i know, i know. we may have to give up a few luxuries."
17305,Susan,that was club soda. amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge.
17809,Susan,i can totally explain this. i swear.
17267,Susan,thank you. which cousin?
14152,Susan,"oh, you might as well just stay under there and never come up for air because when you do, i'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you."
18078,Susan,i don't know.
17858,Susan,"well, maybe i can help you. think you can rent my house out?"
14947,Susan,"mom, i need answers."
18248,Susan,"oh, uh, right. jackson, you remember mrs. mccluskey, don't you?"
15511,Susan,"edie, why are you torturing that girl?"
16885,Susan,"well, i don't see the problem with it--hint, hint."
18416,Susan,"listen, i know being dramatic is the birthright of every teenager, but come on--"
14905,Susan,oh. julie! i thought you were going straight to school.
17327,Susan,"oh. well, yeah, um, i mean, ""conner"" we just picked it after the senior. this would mean something."
17482,Susan,"well, what did he say?"
15735,Susan,these dresses are hideous.
15480,Susan,yeah.
17249,Susan,"karl? is he here? oh, what a freakish--"
17150,Susan,"oh, please. after what you've been through, no one is judging. come on in. i'll put on some coffee. oh, um, this is my cousin tim. tim, this is the neighbors."
15745,Susan,"and this is the, uh, spinal cord. and it, of course, attaches to the brain."
16319,Susan,"julie? no, she's at her father's this weekend. is something wrong?"
13393,Susan,i'll be there.
15730,Susan,then why the rush?
15261,Susan,okay.
18302,Susan,thanks.
17639,Susan,may i ask who's calling?
18374,Susan,right. so how long do you think you'll be delayed?
17990,Susan,that's cute. where's mike?
15550,Susan,gus!
14054,Susan,"okay. wow, uh, wow. you know, uh, can you sit down? i need, uh to talk to you."
15820,Susan,"uh, fresh air is good for us?"
15333,Susan,"mmm,mike,mike,mike--"
15325,Susan,that's not helpful.
16377,Susan,"oh, my god. mike, you saved our lives."
17451,Susan,yeah. mmm. you've never done that before. wait. you've never done that before. why are you doing that now?
16281,Susan,we never really stopped.
16542,Susan,"okay, look, i know that i've put mike through the wringer, but that's why i have to talk to him--to make it right. he's not answering his cell phone."
13786,Susan,"well, so, in your mind, is the date off?"
14242,Susan,"well, you know, technically, i don't need your permission!"
16092,Susan,don't worry. dinner's all taken care of. we're having blanquette de veau and a grand marnier souffl.
16249,Susan,"i have got to get more depressing clothes. okay, i just need to keep a low profile through the memorial, 'cause once i get through this, ian can officially introduce me as his girlfriend, and we'll finally be a normal, non-adulterous couple. what does this one say to you?"
16044,Susan,did you consider removing the body?
15008,Susan,you came!
14391,Susan,"no, no. what do you want?"
15219,Susan,okay.
14229,Susan,aren't you dating edie?
14656,Susan,"well, yes, we are. i'm gonna go."
14897,Susan,i'm gonna be honest.
16228,Susan,"um, no, actually, i'm a friend of ian's. he asked me to come--for jane."
13620,Susan,okay.great. fine.thank you.
16411,Susan,good. i should go.
17354,Susan,"well--i hate the name ""maynard."""
14803,Susan,"well, i'm sorry, but you have."
15946,Susan,"it's my first time in paris. i want it to be magical, and that means accessories, so back off."
17628,Susan,"you met the guy in night, then you're in a shower. i'm just doing the math."
17331,Susan,"yeah. i said that, didn't i? oh, shoot. we can't do it. isn't your grandpa james significantly older than grandpa maynard? shouldn't we honor him first?"
17192,Susan,"no, no, no, no. no, i did not have a sex dream."
17226,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
14451,Susan,stop.
16008,Susan,what? no! i don't take orders from you!
17330,Susan,"oh, and rare, really rare."
13726,Susan,it's not a competition.
13917,Susan,"what? i loathe karl, and the postman will back me up on that, too."
15732,Susan,his wife vanished and he didn't even tell bree. how much more proof do you need?
18026,Susan,"washed, cleaned, ready to go."
13604,Susan,"whoops,sorry."
17593,Susan,"oh, come on! we were mike and susan, remember? you only get one of those in a lifetime. we could make things right again."
14741,Susan,"so then i just threw my ice cream at him and ran. well, somebody say something."
16368,Susan,"yeah, it's sudden. my whole life is here. i mean, my friends. you know, julie is still in school--"
15453,Susan,you're gonna make me go by myself?
13870,Susan,"young lady, we need to talk about what you did."
15793,Susan,"oh, yeah. but, i mean, you kissed other girls before that, right?"
16373,Susan,how can you not know how to swim? didn't you go to summer camp?
13369,Susan,i brought some champagne. i thought we should all have a toast.
13782,Susan,"thank you, oh, you have no idea what that was like--"
14025,Susan,"this is easy for you. you're the father of the boy. i'm the mother of the girl. you know, if things get out of hand--"
15528,Susan,well--that is karl being nostalgic.
17062,Susan,no.
14968,Susan,i just want to see what he's like. and satisfy my curiosity and get it out of my system.
16139,Susan,"good.uh, his name is orson hodge, and he had an affair with the woman that you think mike delfino killed."
16948,Susan,i'm sorry.
14022,Susan,"just so we're clear, you are not allowed to see him anymore."
18047,Susan,no.
14073,Susan,"oh, i can't have another baby. i mean i'm so grateful i had you, you know i don't regret a minute of that, but i found it to be completely overwhelming. sometimes i even wonder how i got through it."
13851,Susan,"perfumes and oils. and i want to pick out the outfit that you are going to tear off me. and plus, i need to be in complete control of the lighting."
14705,Susan,"it was not murder, it was manslaughter, and that's totally different. mike and i aren't even living together, and he cares about julie."
13680,Susan,"oh, that's right, the twins-stage debut!"
13607,Susan,it's hard to explain. even to myself.
17557,Susan,"oh, he's fine."
16046,Susan,"listen, i know how you feel about jane, but if you could just give me a chance--i mean, come on, you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?"
13842,Susan,"if we hear anything, i will let you know right away. i understand how worried you must be."
13332,Susan,"no, i'm just trying to remember. i don't wanna talk to you about my love life anymore, it weirds me out."
13675,Susan,"oh, forget about it, it's not that important, but since i'm here, do you still have that old hatchback sitting in your garage? can i borrow it tomorrow?"
14183,Susan,paul and mary alice had a baby that died.
16678,Susan,"okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself. i could max out my credit card."
17859,Susan,"jackson got a teaching job at the college in riverton, and--i'm going with him."
15023,Susan,"addison, you just got caught paying for sex. now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag."
16174,Susan,"oh! i was just, uh--i lost an earring."
14030,Susan,"anyway, you won't even know i'm there."
15173,Susan,i'm sorry.i don't mean this to sound the wrong way. i just--i would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon.
14175,Susan,why do you even care?
13329,Susan,"now that everybody's seen that i've brought something, i should probably just throw this out."
17575,Susan,what took you so long? people are gonna be here any minute. i need you to pour the cheap vodka into the expensive bottles.
13530,Susan,"oh, you don't have to apologise about carl. really, carl and i are over. i've moved on."
15332,Susan,mike is love. mmm.
16476,Susan,"hell, there's some things we don't need to know about."
18140,Susan,"oh, yeah. i saw the moving van. welcome."
13899,Susan,"yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown. a guy who plays piano and an open mike. julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together, so we're just going to make a night of it."
14538,Susan,just get the hell out of here.
16705,Susan,"oh,my god.katherine.katherine!"
16611,Susan,"oh, my god, that's my centerpiece!"
14976,Susan,"i know. but i gotta find out if there's something there. i've always wanted a dad. i mean, i know not having one affected me."
16937,Susan,"hear, hear."
18339,Susan,mm. shower's off. i guess we'll know in a few seconds.
15956,Susan,you have a lot of meetings anyway. we'll go some other time. i can't leave julie right now.
15075,Susan,hi.
18265,Susan,"oh, i'm not mad at you. you know, i'm just disappointed in myself. i was a little lonely and a little afraid and--i just did what i always do--let some silly romantic fantasy take over."
17839,Susan,"will you stop guessing? oh, god! why won't i just let myself be happy?"
17145,Susan,done catching up. all about accounting now.
13486,Susan,thanks for helping me break in. do you think it's gonna be hard to replace that screen?
16068,Susan,"will they be expecting stomach cramps, acid reflux, night sweats?"
14777,Susan,"okay, who in this room has not committed a felony, raise your hand. ah, ah, ah. not so fast."
14581,Susan,"well, you should care more about me. i'm your girlfriend. we're moving in together. he's just a neighbor. you don't even know zach."
16967,Susan,"do you see him? i mean, do you have a relationship with him?"
14602,Susan,so it looks like mary alice killed zach's birth mother in order to keep her from taking zach away.
14319,Susan,she said she won't come in until you go out and apologise to her.
14868,Susan,thanks.
16933,Susan,"yes. quiet art is subjective. but you see, mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't s sleep with all that noise."
16751,Susan,i'm julie's mom.
14601,Susan,"no. no, i'm so sorry. i'll, i'll, um, i'll see you around."
18082,Susan,thanks. i was thinking about the other night--
16489,Susan,"excuse me! uh, hey! excuse me. that's my space!"
13380,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
15743,Susan,"well, yes, and how nice that would have been, huh? um, but, no, no, i'm a brain specialist."
14197,Susan,"oh, my god -- angela."
18162,Susan,"okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, why don't we walk over to helen's? and i will introduce you. we can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about ed's favorite positions."
17668,Susan,"mmm. oh, pop quiz! why did kim beale stop talking to me in eighth grade?"
14448,Susan,"actually, before you go i need you to check into someone else's background. there's this plumber i know?"
17020,Susan,"mike, we don't need any of that stuff."
13679,Susan,"it's going, finally. we have our first official date next week. i think he's taking me to see a play or something."
17492,Susan,"gaby, we have a problem. i just saw juanita push m.j. down."
15168,Susan,"right, right.actually,i sort of meant, um--do you personally feel confident?"
14965,Susan,apparently he owns the place.
16943,Susan,"well, we need our sleep."
18146,Susan,"because we were starting to become friends and you like to run, and i like to--sit and--one of us had to give."
14487,Susan,we need to talk.
16929,Susan,come on. it's 6:00 a.m. what is that?
17723,Susan,"hey, jackson. where are you going? the guys are about to start."
15980,Susan,"okay. wait, if we hated the restaurant, then why are we bringing home food?"
15160,Susan,"oh! mmm.okay, that sort of felt unethical."
13662,Susan,what do you think of me?
15410,Susan,you're gonna make me take the hit?
15734,Susan,well. um. honestly--
15864,Susan,hi. you're new. where's marcy?
18260,Susan,get out or i will kick your ass back to the canadian border!
14934,Susan,"oh, uh. so what have you been doing lately?"
15388,Susan,hi.
17991,Susan,"well, uh, thank you very much for helping us out. come on, m.j.. it's time to go."
15752,Susan,it's all right. 'cause i feel guilty too. that's why we should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated and i think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
15997,Susan,"before we begin, would either of you like some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?"
14071,Susan,mike wants babies.
16874,Susan,"so anyway, that's why it was so great."
14427,Susan,do you think you can help me?
18028,Susan,"that ""football guy"" is peyton manning. you would do well to learn that name. oh. wow."
13807,Susan,later? what's wrong with now?
14322,Susan,morty!
16624,Susan,"no, i guess not."
18408,Susan,shhhh.keep playing.
15944,Susan,really?
15390,Susan,omelettes. you want me to make you one?
18231,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
15478,Susan,karl--you look pretty beat up.why--why don't you--why don't you come in and--we'll crack open a bottle of wine.come on.
16391,Susan,and why don't you put your water on that lower shelf?
14682,Susan,"well, i played in high school."
13359,Susan,"i can't believe it. this can't be happening. mike can't like edie better than me, he just can't!"
16113,Susan,i'm pretty sure that bree's husband murdered the woman the cops think mike killed. i went to his office--
17742,Susan,why not?
17580,Susan,"i don't know. um--i'm sort of going through a difficult transition in my life right now. i need a change. uh, i was thinking--taupe."
17666,Susan,"you know, that was hard for me to share, and the fact that you just make light of it--no, i'm am calling the second date officially over. and you know what? i was going to let you feel me up over my blouse. but now? nada."
13875,Susan,julie!
17181,Susan,imposing? who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want.
15438,Susan,you mauled me in edie's bed last night.i think that deserves a conversation.
14557,Susan,yeah.
15884,Susan,"mike, why are you being this way?"
15941,Susan,"okay, i know i--and don't play the parent card with me."
15196,Susan,"i don't need a loan.i need coverage.i mean, what if there are complications?i don't have a safety net.oh, my god, please!"
13744,Susan,any particular reason?
16618,Susan,i'm rushing? you met victor three months ago. i've known mike three years.
17577,Susan,fine. you can have a little space in the closet. i think i've got some clothes from the '80s i'm ready to part with.
16723,Susan,"i don't need any test!i am not old enough for menopause.now i don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.harvard medical school,class of '97?oh,my god!i am old!just give me the damn test."
15708,Susan,"well, in that case, thank you for my cheap knock-off.oh, my god, i'm late."
16326,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm so sorry! are you all right?"
17587,Susan,"no. no, don't go. that was very sweet of you to consider my feelings. you know what? you're hired."
16120,Susan,you would really get him the best lawyer in town?
14028,Susan,so you're moving! we're all going to miss you.
17170,Susan,"oh, nice try, timmy. like i'm really going to believe that. shame on you. just-- shame! what do you mean, ""old feelings""?"
17758,Susan,"well, it doesn't matter. she's my friend. she should've come to me and discussed it first."
16461,Susan,no. it's nothing.
18007,Susan,i don't know how to make paninis.
18009,Susan,"absolutely not. in this house, we do not eat pretentious cheeses. we eat honest american peanut butter. now watch your movie, and i'll be back in a minute."
13503,Susan,please. call me susan.
14156,Susan,"oh! i'm fine, it's good, you just, you know, uh, did, did you see - no! oh, good bye!"
16966,Susan,"oh, my god. he's in jail for murder?"
18112,Susan,"evan, that's-- kind of a scary picture."
17163,Susan,"i know, but this visit was really more for julie."
18270,Susan,"you want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?"
14634,Susan,"so, i'm thinking we should keep it casual."
17944,Susan,be bored in spanish.
18129,Susan,yeah.
17385,Susan,"okay, just listen to me."
13760,Susan,nothing. it's not important.
14072,Susan,"he wants to have kids, and he had that look that men get that says 'i'm ready to procreate, point me to the nearest cervix'."
15882,Susan,"and when i locked myself out of the house, that's where the bush was that you found me in. naked. surely you remember that."
14745,Susan,"okay, please, please don't run."
15508,Susan,"well,i just wanna help.so how about that movie?"
16093,Susan,five-thirty. but i am rewarming it all by myself.
15661,Susan,"no, no, no, no.no, turn my house around."
14690,Susan,"boy, your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud."
12191,Lynette,"yeah, we're crazy that way. i don't know why you're complaining about handicapped spaces. doesn't carlos have one of those blue placards?"
10579,Lynette,"let's suppose your husband begged you to get pregnant-- begged you--and out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.you agreed to a baby.a baby, singular."
10353,Lynette,what--what was what?
12712,Lynette,"i gave that money to anne schilling so she'd leave town, and tom has no idea."
13012,Lynette,"well, thank you, greatest friend, but i just accepted another job."
12524,Lynette,mm-hmm. oh.
9465,Lynette,"that is not the point, you don't spank other people's children."

10351,Lynette,"of you? no,i'm not."
13112,Lynette,fine. i should've just had sex. i'd be asleep by now.
9745,Lynette,"oh, did he now?"
10644,Lynette,"well, to be clear, how are you going to live? how are you going to pay the mortgage?you don't have a job here."
9311,Lynette,"oh, we went out for burgers and the boys knew you wouldn't be home till after, um, bedtime so we decided to pop in and visit the new vp"
8733,Lynette,i love you.
11225,Lynette,"crap, that's ed."
12897,Lynette,"i did, for seven years. now i'm gonna be a realist, and i need you to be one, too."
12786,Lynette,you're gonna have to.
8736,Lynette,let's risk it?
12108,Lynette,"look, you're taking her pearls. the least you can do is honor her wishes."
10657,Lynette,ten seconds.
8956,Lynette,i stopped after page 50.
12239,Lynette,"come here. come on. okay. mommy and daddy are sort of-- fighting, but we're working through it."
12682,Lynette,"i have to ask you something, and it is very important that you tell me the truth."
13294,Lynette,"hi, mrs binks, is patty there? thank you."
11512,Lynette,those are shameless rationalizations. keep them coming.
11758,Lynette,yeah.that's rough.by the way--i have cancer.
13077,Lynette,how do you think?
10520,Lynette,i know.
9309,Lynette,"look, wait, wait. i know what this means to you."
11209,Lynette,"and tonight i'm gonna slap on some sex perfume and you're gonna get naked, and then we're gonna see who the man is."
9415,Lynette,"are, are we supposed to be following them?"
10399,Lynette,"oh,i'm sorry,honey.your mom-- is in her office on a conference call,and she's busy,so you're just gonna have to wait,okay?"
9589,Lynette,"okay, off!"
10810,Lynette,"oh, my god! yes!"
10777,Lynette,"well, you're under a lot of stress. you got a new kid in the family. you're job hunting."
10359,Lynette,what? why?
11930,Lynette,you're right. i shouldn't have done that. but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts. it is their getaway from this horrible thing that i've brought into the house.
13080,Lynette,"hey, travers. remember us?"
9395,Lynette,"even better, let's just keep it adults."
12858,Lynette,"if we do well, you get a cut of the profits. if we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the first $20,000. and then, of course, my family moves in with you. so--do we have a deal?"
12107,Lynette,"hey, i-if you don't have time to do it, i will."
10464,Lynette,"oh-- that was me.he was asking about the birds and the bees, and i fudged a few of the details."
9645,Lynette,tom.
10045,Lynette,"see? all we need is a minimum participation of, uh--sixteen kids. my kids, your baby, sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon receptionist. she just popped out number six. there. sixteen."
10705,Lynette,right.
9951,Lynette,that is a damn shame.
10805,Lynette,"that's right. come. walk with me. so, money's a little tight, huh?"
12615,Lynette,huh?
9184,Lynette,okay.
11783,Lynette,"hey, gaby."
10601,Lynette,not ready for that yet.
10212,Lynette,"oh, it's just--i'm--i'm not sure that you would find this job that satisfying."
10760,Lynette,"that is not what i'm saying. but if you did, i'd find a way to carry on."
8984,Lynette,i bet--can i use your bathroom?
10664,Lynette,of course.
9649,Lynette,"yes, i am sorry. i am so, so sorry. i didn't want to hurt you. but i was trying to protect our family. if you got a promotion, we never would have seen you. you would have been traveling all the -"
8929,Lynette,i hate playing three handed poker. let's take a break.
9916,Lynette,"guys, stop it! stop it, i mean it, come on!"
11469,Lynette,"yeah? well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me? oh, that's right. you can't."
11784,Lynette,"well--i felt a little weird about something that happened at lunch, and i thought we should talk about it."
9269,Lynette,"no. i can deal with the humiliation of going around the neighborhood returning everything the boys stole, but please don't make me apologize to that woman."
12849,Lynette,"actually, i have to go to work. but congratulations, bree. it's a beauty."
10396,Lynette,"yeah,well,in the third world,they don't have juice boxes."
9326,Lynette,i'll be right back.
10382,Lynette,i love it. i just love it.let get a copy to ed.
11927,Lynette,"hey, judas."
11658,Lynette,yeah. let's get this off.
9362,Lynette,nurse abigail?
11130,Lynette,"well, i didn't know what else to do. i'm trying to win over a little girl who clearly doesn't want a new mother."
9966,Lynette,"and for good reason. someone could have driven off with them, and you wouldn't have even noticed."
9827,Lynette,that'll fix everything? hugs?
10594,Lynette,"i am not interested, and if you wanna keep those fingers, i would move 'em away from my body. thank you."
11960,Lynette,why?
13154,Lynette,"sorry. just had the handyman in here, but he's finished. thank you, handyman."
10340,Lynette,huh?
10646,Lynette,settle down.
10802,Lynette,the kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old.
11771,Lynette,out.
12521,Lynette,huh.
9032,Lynette,"well, we shouldn't. we should tell each other this stuff."
9481,Lynette,"you want to talk about good neighbour etiquette, how about you hire a gardener to take care of that jungle you call a lawn."
12844,Lynette,"oh, that man is walter brotski, and he just bought it."
13025,Lynette,what? no. i'm sure she's just affectionate.
9086,Lynette,okay.
9356,Lynette,"okay. she's going through something, and i'm sure she'd prefer it to be private."
12748,Lynette,"what? what?! that's why he ran away? i thought he was afraid of going to jail. well, i'm sure warren schilling was just trying to scare him."
9426,Lynette,"um, sure. here,boys. stay right there."
9176,Lynette,"oh. that's sweet of you, but it's not exactly true."
12752,Lynette,"yesterday, you said warren schilling will kill porter if he gets the chance. i will never let that happen."
10003,Lynette,"edie, how old were you when you lost your virginity?"
10818,Lynette,yeah.
9019,Lynette,go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell.
10787,Lynette,"it is not fake. there is not a team i know that could get along without their backup far right fielder. okay, come on, let's go practice."
9149,Lynette,my husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart. can you give us a minute?
9604,Lynette,alright?i'm coming in.
10442,Lynette,"so,um--your message said that parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.what--what kind of incident?"
11867,Lynette,"lynette's not here right now. i'm brandy, the slutty cheerleader."
11757,Lynette,"okay,i'm gonna be honest with you.i haven't been feeling that great lately."
10799,Lynette,"hey, people, he's just a kid, okay?"
8831,Lynette,"well, obviously they will be punished for this. severely."
10541,Lynette,i don't know.anything you wanna talk about?'cause there's nothing you couldn't tell me.i would understand.
9553,Lynette,"hold on, honey, grown ups are talking."
10440,Lynette,what is it?
12182,Lynette,hey.
11632,Lynette,"you wanna know what's bugging me? i'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with my family, and you're picking a fight."
9910,Lynette,"but then i started thinking about it, and you know what? i'll be damned if i'm gonna pitch to a roomful of people who are all wearing armani and vera wang, while i'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel."
9891,Lynette,"all right, so if i get my blue suit dry cleaned, will that be acceptable to everyone?"
11324,Lynette,"oh, thank you.thank you, thank you."
9590,Lynette,"oh , ha ha ha. not funny, tom."
10034,Lynette,he did what?
12595,Lynette,how do you know he didn't?
10475,Lynette,but we're not presenting for another two weeks.why don't we start tomorrow?
12065,Lynette,"no, toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs."
9979,Lynette,"tom, you're not off the hook here."
11070,Lynette,"hey, rita, i gotta go."
9335,Lynette,"aw, jeez. it looks like a sesame seed."
11805,Lynette,wait--is katherine going to susan's charade night?
12751,Lynette,"before i became a mother, i didn't know it was possible to love another human being so completely, and with that love comes this need to protect you. it wasn't a decision i made. it's--primal. it's just something in my dna whatever it is, it makes me not care about myself, and it reminds me that my reason for being on this planet is to look after you kids."
9376,Lynette,yes.
9153,Lynette,"here, blow. good, all right. come on, it's going to be fun. follow me."
9876,Lynette,yeah?
10453,Lynette,okay.
13124,Lynette,mm.
12431,Lynette,so i assume you know about what happened to jimmy conrado.
9752,Lynette,"wow. so, um, i, i take it you took the rat outside?"
12278,Lynette,there are opportunities that you can see that--i'm not! what would be my agenda?
9220,Lynette,we're not done here.
10233,Lynette,so did you do that solo?
12292,Lynette,"yeah, or a child with problems can lead to a dysfunctional family. i mean, kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire and jump off the roof."
10489,Lynette,"i appreciate that.you know, ed--i don't wanna pry into your personal business,but if you are having problems in that area,you don't have to be resigned to it."
10426,Lynette,"oh. sure.anyway,i just--i feel so guilty that this all went on in your house,right under our nose.so if there is anything i can do to help you--"
11756,Lynette,i just didn't realize how tired i would be when i took this on.
10181,Lynette,why not?
9414,Lynette,what a voice.
10941,Lynette,"ah, i see you've heard from our lawyer."
10162,Lynette,"see you later.i'm sorry,what did he mean,""shooting blanks""?"
13192,Lynette,"you're older? i'm sorry, i just cannot believe--that they're out of stuffed mushrooms. excuse me."
10905,Lynette,"mm-hmm. yeah, you are!"
10418,Lynette,i'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
9281,Lynette,read the engraving.
10735,Lynette,"no, no.what's unfair is that we're slowly running out of money and you've barely even looked for a job. you're going to have a good time, all right? i love you. bye."
10755,Lynette,"oh, that's-- delightful. that's delightful. maybe it'll just soak up the cream soda you spilled."
10922,Lynette,i had the mary alice dream again last night.
11264,Lynette,i told you i wanted this floor to sparkle like your mom's.now does this floor look bree hodge clean to you?
9975,Lynette,what if the stranger is nice and not scary? yes?
9181,Lynette,"uh, it kind of snuck up on us."
10417,Lynette,you're saying bree did this?
12976,Lynette,"so i said to him,""je crois que c'est l'homme qui fait les chez d'oeuvres."" and he said to me,""non, lynette. ce sont les chez d'oeuvres qui font l'homme."""
13153,Lynette,yes?
9264,Lynette,"no, don't you dare. we'll move it when you say please."
13250,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, easy. you're a little drunk there."
11864,Lynette,"gaby, i'm not a redhead."
11561,Lynette,okay.
13013,Lynette,why?
13240,Lynette,chinese?
12791,Lynette,"last time i came, you threw pudding at me."
10167,Lynette,thought about who i'd marry if you died?hmm. no.
10836,Lynette,#name?
13160,Lynette,"tom, i have a 7:00 a.m. meeting. how about i take a long lunch, and you do me twice at work tomorrow?"
11055,Lynette,parker!
12856,Lynette,although--how would you like to own a piece of an italian restaurant?
9677,Lynette,"well, that, that sounds great. thank you."
10660,Lynette,she said coyly.
10673,Lynette,"no, no, no, of course not. in fact we're just having a quiet afternoon at home.the kids are so bored tom and i were thinking about taking them out for ice cream."
10595,Lynette,i saw you with that woman.
9523,Lynette,"oh, thank you. and you. you're here. in the office. tom's office."
11571,Lynette,"well, it turns out our new babysitter isn't working out too well. feel up to another tour of duty?"
11962,Lynette,thank you.
11314,Lynette,"now it's ""us""? because i thought i was the one who was trying to ruin everything."
11635,Lynette,yeah?
10697,Lynette,she and turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
12692,Lynette,a witness? i--
11735,Lynette,yes.it proves they eat sitting down.
9345,Lynette,"guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves for reveling in that woman's misery. that being said, edie, please continue."
10063,Lynette,"you could stand up to fran. if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier. and without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper."
12429,Lynette,excuse me?
11548,Lynette,"okay, okay, she's circling the park."
10526,Lynette,"no,no!we are not backing down.i'm gonna walk over to ed's office right now,and i'm gonna make very clear that if you're out the door,i'm right behind ya."
12158,Lynette,"i'm not presbyterian. i'm a free agent. and if you're open to a little q and a, you've got me."
12480,Lynette,"ooh! careful, honey."
9983,Lynette,"uh, no. actually, i need you to kidnap my children."
13178,Lynette,no. no.
12502,Lynette,"you know, it's been years since i looked through this stuff. i'd forgotten i was--kinda great."
12577,Lynette,and i had cancer. i get it. i get it. you want your life to count for something.
8991,Lynette,"well, maybe you need better ideas. i'm sorry-i'm sorry, i didn't mean that."
11554,Lynette,"oh, come on, gaby, be fair. you put us in a really awkward position."
10041,Lynette,"yeah, like you haven't been through enough."
12105,Lynette,you can't do that. ida wanted her ashes scattered at the field.
8974,Lynette,"yeah. just three or four pills, i'm really hitting a wall here."
9394,Lynette,i'd love to.
12726,Lynette,"do you have any idea how bad this is? we had to post bail. if the judge finds out porter skipped town, we're gonna lose--a lot."
10252,Lynette,guys--
9369,Lynette,"oh. that is a load off my mind. well, thank you."
12674,Lynette,i'm sure you heard about the nightclub burning down.
11939,Lynette,"you saw a possum, and you didn't tell me?"
10576,Lynette,--playing russian roulette with my ovaries and--
13161,Lynette,okay. okay. we'll have sex. but can you make it quick?
9856,Lynette,"thanks. hey, nina."
11523,Lynette,why would you say that?
8997,Lynette,thanks.
9616,Lynette,"actually, it's fruit juice sweetened. can i cut you? a piece?"
12406,Lynette,"no, i mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them."
12778,Lynette,okay. i know you're mad. i know we have a lot to hash out between us. but don't take your hate for me out on your grandson. now where is he?
13015,Lynette,"i--don't know. well, he'd have to match my current offer."
10823,Lynette,"no.it was excitement, because we have just decided you don't have to play baseball anymore. ha! isn't that great?"
13258,Lynette,that's--a brilliant plan. why didn't you tell me this?
12109,Lynette,"fine. and for what it's worth, you passed bi*chy ten minutes ago."
9794,Lynette,when did this start?
8802,Lynette,"no! but when i say, we've been invited to a party, don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week. put on your dancing shoes, and take the mother of your children out for a good time."
11801,Lynette,"gaby, this was a wonderful idea. i cannot tell you how much it means to me."
11685,Lynette,"yep. dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and--prepare to wince-- there is a chicken suit involved."
9478,Lynette,thank you. it looks like tom's got the mob under control. do you want to have some coffee? sit around? bitch about our kids?
11325,Lynette,we can still have sex. just try not to wake me.
12598,Lynette,yeah?
9178,Lynette,"no! no! i, i planned ahead."
10177,Lynette,thank you.
9213,Lynette,"well, um, we don't want to be late for the game. nice to meet you!"
12587,Lynette,"ha ha ha, come on in."
12203,Lynette,"oh, tom."
11154,Lynette,"yes. i love the font, the color, everything. i am so jazzed to see the restaurant."
9513,Lynette,okay. okay.
12813,Lynette,the doctor just called. i'm pregnant.
10544,Lynette,"in all the years we have been married,i have never seen you lead with your fists."
10220,Lynette,tom cavos?
11670,Lynette,nothing happened. he's gone. it's over.
9801,Lynette,"what? oh, um. well, since i'm here, maybe she could just relax in the house for a little while, okay?"
9124,Lynette,tom--
11493,Lynette,you're kidding.
11852,Lynette,"oh, i ripped it this morning. it's been itching the hell out of me--and this is much better."
9957,Lynette,sure.
11780,Lynette,"he was getting so emotional. it felt like the last 20 minutes of ""brian's song"". so--i guess i'm in the market for a new chemo buddy."
8779,Lynette,"boys, you're gonna need to put on your-"
11992,Lynette,"lucy, every fight we have ever had has ended with my foot on your neck. i guarantee that this one's gonna end the same way, too."
11713,Lynette,"i think at a certain point, people just are who they are."
10319,Lynette,"on any given day,how many glasses of wine do you put away?"
12329,Lynette,so--no kayla?
9058,Lynette,what?
10300,Lynette,you were sleeping?
11567,Lynette,"oh, hi. uh, change of plans."
11377,Lynette,"so that's it? he threw out his back? oh, thank god."
9361,Lynette,then it's good to know how to bluff.
10654,Lynette,"no, i am sorry.how much of her crap do i have to put up with?first it's little drop bys, than she's inviting herself to dinner three times a week.now she wants to be in our christmas photo? i'm sorry, no, that is not happening."
10641,Lynette,"as the mother of 80% of tom's children, i don't think it's in their best interest for you to drive us into bankruptcy."
8718,Lynette,"not now, honey, mommy's threatening daddy."
8839,Lynette,oh.. which one goes and which one stays?
9807,Lynette,thank you for that.
8925,Lynette,she's a total nightmare. i guess i shouldn't have challenged her.
12089,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
8869,Lynette,yeah. i thought that was understood.
8930,Lynette,why not? fifty cents a bet?
13019,Lynette,gaby didn't mention that.
10923,Lynette,i haven't had it for months. i don't know why it came back.
10355,Lynette,is this about me being boss again?you gotta get over it.
12977,Lynette,"yes. tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired."
11252,Lynette,"wait, ed! ed, please don't go. yes, i lied, and that was wrong, but my husband needed my help."
11414,Lynette,"no, i know, but i've got a really good feeling about this guy, and all he wants is a fresh start."
12736,Lynette,no!
9011,Lynette,"parker! i don't know --ow!--what you think that you're doing, but put that back where it belongs!"
9452,Lynette,"oh, um, my babysitter cancelled"
12964,Lynette,"oh. actually, i have 12 years of experience."
9748,Lynette,hey.
11726,Lynette,"oh,sweetie."
10487,Lynette,"okay.thanks.well,i'm gonna go back in my office and continue to feel like a huge pervert."
10814,Lynette,what'd the coach say?
11498,Lynette,i've knocked twice. she's not answering.
11957,Lynette,"yeah. now he's playing mind games with me, but i laid out some halloween candy. pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when he does--trick or treat."
11507,Lynette,"well, of course they don't. they're kids. you're the dad. make 'em."
11647,Lynette,"cram it! okay, yeah, tom, i've been unhappy lately. i am working through some issues, but that is something i need to do on my own. talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to dr. beer pong."
9663,Lynette,"who? me? i've been out of work for seven years, i'm a woman of a certain age in a business that values youth above all else. why should i be nervous?"
10242,Lynette,and what i really need from you--is to be forgiven.
10069,Lynette,"oh, i was planning to."
12658,Lynette,what were you thinking? you could've gotten hurt in there!
11300,Lynette,wait. where are my chairs? i didn't order these.
11237,Lynette,"oh, my pills! i need my pills, and now they're all dirty!"
9155,Lynette,"yeah, i noticed that, but every time i come here, it's full."
8720,Lynette,"natalie klein, i don't believe it!"
10446,Lynette,"oh,right.that happened with dinosaurs."
12369,Lynette,you sure you haven't been married before?
12602,Lynette,why can't you do that at home? what the hell is this? you moving out on me?
12991,Lynette,"hey, gaby? i'll see ya. i wanted to ask you something. feel free to say no."
11438,Lynette,could you excuse me a second? i'm sorry. i'm sorry. what's up?
13225,Lynette,"hey, focus. our son is throwing his life away. we have got to keep him on track."
11311,Lynette,"okay, little mix-up with the new chairs."
13033,Lynette,big deal. so is this coffee mug.
12535,Lynette,"zip it, stewie."
10807,Lynette,"no! a kid's gotta have an allowance. how else you gonna buy the things you want, right? like that cotton candy. that's a little piece of heaven, huh? hey, i got an idea. maybe we could help each other out. my son's having a little trouble hitting the ball."
11281,Lynette,i consult you.
13079,Lynette,she called me a baby factory?
11979,Lynette,"oh, you know her, always busy."
11706,Lynette,you are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
10819,Lynette,"well, excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter."
12511,Lynette,no?
12450,Lynette,oh. sorry. enjoy!
10901,Lynette,"yeah, he's hot."
10173,Lynette,"okay,well,that's easy to say,but i need you to show me."
10751,Lynette,"ah, it's like an eight hour drive."
12433,Lynette,you were on the same little league team.
10560,Lynette,"do i? i'm happy.i mean, i was. why don't i just look the other way and pretend nothing's wrong?lots of women can do that."
9102,Lynette,oh. well. good luck with that.
11921,Lynette,"looks fine to me. it's hardly ripped at all. in fact, if you give me your support--"
9583,Lynette,"oh. oh, it's probably baby drool."
12980,Lynette,"i do, and it's okay. besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth? like i said--wow."
12078,Lynette,"damn it! i'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!"
12509,Lynette,aw--okay. well--i've got a whole bunch of alternatives.
10347,Lynette,yeah.i wonder if there's any way that we can turn it around still.
9187,Lynette,"excuse me. sorry. sorry. excuse me. excuse me. hey, lauren! hi. we had a really rough morning."
12987,Lynette,"so was it a good, old-fashioned american kiss or are we talking the infinitely superior french variety?"
10507,Lynette,what kind of terms?
11367,Lynette,"tom, it's me again. you should've been home thirty minutes ago. i know. you're still mad. i am, too, so why don't you come home and we can be mad together? see you soon."
11892,Lynette,"well, that's a good rule. although it wasn't bad news. it was actually--"
12040,Lynette,listen to me. i would be honored if you would come and live with us. having you around these past few months was sort of--fun.
12988,Lynette,"well, that doesn't make any difference. right, lee?"
9112,Lynette,"you're the best. oh, one more thing. since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner, i'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it."
11538,Lynette,"all right, i'll see you later."
9804,Lynette,here we go.
8824,Lynette,maybe.
9457,Lynette,what do you mean porter had less fun? i'll raise.
11541,Lynette,"edie asked me to cater. i know, i'm a total who*e, but please don't rat me out to gaby."
9986,Lynette,it's just stu from our office.
9164,Lynette,edie!
8719,Lynette,where're your brothers?
12771,Lynette,i'll take care of it. thank you.
13278,Lynette,absolutely.
10915,Lynette,"everything's all right, so you can just go back into your room and play."
11455,Lynette,for the appetizer portion. the entre is twenty.
12510,Lynette,"you don't have to. i'll be the bad guy. just tell 'em you've hired me, and i'll go in there, six-guns ablazing. so--do we have a deal? just give me the word."
9571,Lynette,it's nothing.
10906,Lynette,"go, ida!"
9293,Lynette,"well, whatever works for ya."
9953,Lynette,huh?
9370,Lynette,so which kid is it?
10458,Lynette,good luck.
8863,Lynette,"well,at least go upstairs.."
9201,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna get right on that."
10912,Lynette,ding-dong.
10904,Lynette,"look, susan, god called you a cab."
9272,Lynette,"fine, i'll do it."
8910,Lynette,"you tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago and it occurred to me,i've made sacrifices over the past six years. i gave up my career! if another sacrifice has to be made, i think it's your turn on the merry-go-round."
10928,Lynette,"whoa! whoa, whoa! you have stepped onto my property, and you've talked to tom. that's two rules you've broken, and i'm not sure that top doesn't make three."
11751,Lynette,"aw,my hero. i can handle her."
13200,Lynette,you're not doing this. we can't afford it!
9637,Lynette,"just stay here with penny for a second, okay?"
12755,Lynette,and you will convince him to come back home. shut the door.
9193,Lynette,"sorry."" ""excuse me."
12073,Lynette,what are you talking about? i had you over for lemonade last week.
10030,Lynette,"hey, pat, what's going on?"
11468,Lynette,i don't think so. i'm giving it a try.
11860,Lynette,"after two months of puking my guts out, last night i was finally in the mood, but tomnot so much. apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him."
11338,Lynette,hideously.
12694,Lynette,"yes, sweetie, we are."
12850,Lynette,what's this?
10925,Lynette,"and that's what i did, nothing."
11736,Lynette,"okay,don't take this personally,but we hate you."
8879,Lynette,thank you so much.
10964,Lynette,okay. i'll see you later.
13261,Lynette,"i'm so proud. porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?"
8763,Lynette,"well, like i said, i should go back and get dinner ready."
11009,Lynette,"good, uh, listen, as if saving my life wasn't enough, i have a little favor to ask."
10460,Lynette,"hey,mrs. mccluskey.so how did everything go?"
13098,Lynette,"sweetie, i'm home. hey."
10774,Lynette,he said that to you? he's never told me that.
10835,Lynette,"maybe i'd like to write a book or, you know, start my own magazine. and then i think, no, i can't. i have a family to support, and i am okay with that--"
9239,Lynette,glad to get that off my chest. thank you.
12699,Lynette,why would you do that?
8731,Lynette,"ooh, you gotta be kidding! i'm exhausted! i look terrible, i'm covered in peaches!"
9592,Lynette,"no, i'm glad that you find my humiliation so entertaining."
12467,Lynette,why are there two piles?
11579,Lynette,i don't mind.
12715,Lynette,no. the house is mortgaged to the teeth.
9197,Lynette,"i'm not gonna drop you. i might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place. but drop you, no. come on!"
10395,Lynette,the people in this office feel a little--concerned--that you're nursing a boy of donovan's age.
9106,Lynette,oh! sorry.
11885,Lynette,"no, i am. it's been months, and i have barely thought about what you're going through."
11925,Lynette,"fascism, ida, not fashion."
11913,Lynette,you're picking her over me?
11862,Lynette,"gaby, i am his wife. he's supposed to love me--not my body, me--my--my soul. why can't he make love to my soul?"
12030,Lynette,"i am sorry about that, mom. we were just venting. people who love you need to do that."
9227,Lynette,you knew about this?
10067,Lynette,you took the baby without telling fran?
10972,Lynette,"oh, here they are! hey!"
12187,Lynette,"yeah, it's back."
9522,Lynette,you forgot your helprin file.
10698,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey! please!"
8972,Lynette,"big fun. say, you wouldn't have any of your kids add medication that you could spare just to get me over the hump?"
11824,Lynette,yeah. i guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in.
12838,Lynette,"no. i'm gonna go help my daughter with her homework. hey, penny! wait up!"
11938,Lynette,in the garden there. has something been digging in there?
9487,Lynette,"you're going to the hospital, mrs mcclusky. you're going to be fine."
12525,Lynette,oh.
13113,Lynette,"carlos, you're early!"
9615,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i wanted to do something nice for duggan."
11480,Lynette,"why? you know he'll just shoot it down. i mean, i get it. he's in pain. he doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to--you know what?let's talk about something else."
11516,Lynette,"oh, my god. how do you botch a bikini wax?"
12443,Lynette,you're probably right. it's just--did you know porter writes poetry?
12023,Lynette,"fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her."
9396,Lynette,so what did mike say when he gave you the letter?
12447,Lynette,aw. that's sweet.
12094,Lynette,"yeah, right. oh, you're serious?"
8933,Lynette,"oh, yeah, huh, it was a creative call. look, i'm in the middle of a costume crisis, and if i don't take a few shortcuts, i'll never finish."
10624,Lynette,business?
11235,Lynette,my pills! my pain pills are in my bag.
10190,Lynette,"no, that's okay.i know you're exhausted.you should go to bed."
13298,Lynette,"i just told them to paint something nice, the sentiment is all theirs."
12422,Lynette,whatcha doing?
10412,Lynette,to soften me up for the deposition.
13127,Lynette,"i was just afraid you'd overreact, like you're doing--right now."
10085,Lynette,"no, no tension.what?"
13289,Lynette,right.
13087,Lynette,then we dump her.
12512,Lynette,but mine is better.
12004,Lynette,going?
10580,Lynette,"then--then you go in for an ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats. then and only then does your husband tell you that twins run in his family."
12050,Lynette,"well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out."
12554,Lynette,hi. my husband--i'm lynette scavo. dr. baron called me--
11527,Lynette,"oh! the boys would love that, but unfortunately, i gotta work."
11038,Lynette,"hey, what's up?"
9279,Lynette,"my kids have been on kind of a thieving jag, stealing stuff from around the neighborhood."
10229,Lynette,"uh-huh, and when were you there?because you forgot to list your dates of employment for that one."
12774,Lynette,"parker, i'm gonna be back in an hour. mr. fisherman, thank you so much."
8963,Lynette,yeah?
9587,Lynette,"you make me feel like i just got off the shrimp boat, for god's sake."

9630,Lynette,"yes, a very pretty shark."

8964,Lynette,and when exactly would this formal dinner take place?
11174,Lynette,"i think it's fantastic. it's really coming together. ooh, i love the bar."
12519,Lynette,"durber. hey! well, this was one great guy. he would schlep all the way across town just to get me my chinese food. so--what are you up to?"
10574,Lynette,yeah?
10961,Lynette,"who cares?!who cares?we all have pain! everyone in here has pain, but we deal with it! we swallow it and get going with our lives! what we don't do is go around shooting strangers!"
12359,Lynette,"oh, i'm with gaby. i mean, you know me. i always like to give people the benefit of the doubt--"
10871,Lynette,"i know, i know. catering's how you get there."
11760,Lynette,"i just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.you know,for five minutes,i could pretend i wasn't a sick person.but once your friends know you're sick,you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes--the fear,the pity."
11916,Lynette,but it's my kids' tree house. they really need it.
13236,Lynette,wh-what's that now?
9430,Lynette,"i'm sorry, what?"
12064,Lynette,what?
9673,Lynette,a girl. and three boys.
10512,Lynette,"if you just fire him,he'll sue you,and i'll back him up.you need cause."
10623,Lynette,probably.
11949,Lynette,"huh? oh, the pet scan. no, not till tomorrow. listen, i need your help. there's a possum in my garden."
10107,Lynette,okay. yeah.so exact what are you doing here helping out?
9249,Lynette,"too late, you stole and then you lied. even worse? you made me look bad in front of mrs. mccluskey, who you know is mommy's sworn enemy. time to pick your poison. how 'bout a belt? it's a classic."
11244,Lynette,there you go. great. guess what? our line is the biggest one at the fair. i counted. you know what i'm starting to think?
12290,Lynette,"he's gonna hang out and watch us, you know, be a family."
11164,Lynette,"hey, you banned me from your opening."
10821,Lynette,that is not true!
12899,Lynette,"if you're looking to get fed, it's gonna be a while."
11390,Lynette,no.
8825,Lynette,"aww. you know, it's gonna take more than just this one night."
13275,Lynette,"actually, i have an addendum to that."
10128,Lynette,it kinda does.i wanna get it clear for our friendship.
9052,Lynette,"claire? i've always loved that name. so claire--"" ""do you come here often?"
9340,Lynette,"because she saw porter scratching his head at school. they all did, and now word's getting around."
12631,Lynette,i don't know.
11274,Lynette,"no, i fired him, and you are gonna stay fired."
11409,Lynette,hi! i'm home! and i've got good news. i found a new manager.
10603,Lynette,i had already let you go.
10290,Lynette,"oh,my god!"
12966,Lynette,i know. so what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
13119,Lynette,"oh, well, i appreciate that. and here's something else i'd appreciate--could we not tell anyone else about this?"
12685,Lynette,what?
12125,Lynette,yep. third strike? what were the first two?
10267,Lynette,"aw, what's wrong, ed?you afraid a phi kap's gonna get beaten by a girl?come on, big man--it's just a little bet."
11290,Lynette,"if they're salty, we'll sell more beer. see? you're a genius."
10908,Lynette,"oh, just a quiet night with the girls."
12091,Lynette,"wow, the things you accumulate in a lifetime, huh?"
10605,Lynette,"yeah, we're going home."
11269,Lynette,get your stuff. get the hell out of my restaurant. you're fired. go on.
11937,Lynette,is that a hole?
12836,Lynette,but it's 85 degrees outside. i've never done this before.
10142,Lynette,that doesn't mean betty knew him.
11019,Lynette,"hey, don't touch anything. i'm just gonna write a note, and then we'll go."
9821,Lynette,i couldn't have imagined how much going back to work would upset parker.
11486,Lynette,sure.
11618,Lynette,"yeah, i'm mad! i am mad because i loved our nights together. it made me feel sexy and happy, and, god, how i needed that. and now it's over. you ruined it. you can't work here anymore."
9089,Lynette,yeah. i don't really think i could videotape claire. it would be a breach of trust.
10826,Lynette,"just one more game.he'll suck, the other kids will taunt him, and he'll wanna quit again.see, everybody wins."
11869,Lynette,hi.
9812,Lynette,what are you doing?
10859,Lynette,"care to elaborate, dr. mccluskey?"
13207,Lynette,yeah. it turns out he got the same procedure that you're thinking about getting. so i thought maybe you could chat him up about it.
9403,Lynette,hey. shut up.
12240,Lynette,"oh, something he did that made mommy really mad."
8948,Lynette,"maisy, we have kids the same age, which means there are years ahead of us, having to deal with each other. so instead of playing all these petty games, why don't we put an end to this right now."
11695,Lynette,"well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets."
11759,Lynette,"so i am halfway through chemo,and my doctor is very confident that i'm going to beat this,so you can all relax.i'm not going to die."
13198,Lynette,"okay, that's a lousy impression of me."
9950,Lynette,ah.
8807,Lynette,"preston, would you come here?"
9533,Lynette,"well, you can't work with her."
10457,Lynette,"oh,wait a couple months. she'll start sleeping through the night."
12965,Lynette,"yeah. i was account executive for eight years, vp for four more after that, and by the way, i wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel."
12401,Lynette,tom? can i talk to you a sec?
10677,Lynette,"hey, gaby, it's lynette.got a little emergency.is it okay if we use your backyard? great, great, and we take full responsibility for whatever the pony does.hope you get this message soon.oh!"
9405,Lynette,"i don't think we should be talking about alisa with her, so--"
11189,Lynette,"no, thanks. two's my limit."
9723,Lynette,and you didn't change them?
10092,Lynette,what do you mean?
10536,Lynette,what? that can't be right.
9864,Lynette,ah.
12174,Lynette,"oh, well, i'm pretty comfortable with the catholics. they're the only ones who don't judge me for having so many kids."
10632,Lynette,"tom!i am trying very hard to be strong right now, and you melting down is not helping me."
10053,Lynette,okay. okay. i just thought i'd give it a shot.
12566,Lynette,"what, do machine guns come out of the headlights?"
9724,Lynette,"oh, that's disgusting."
11779,Lynette,"yeah, so far--not that bad. though i did have to kick tom out yesterday."
12287,Lynette,did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?
12886,Lynette,"you know that was an accident, right?"
12787,Lynette,"yeah, well, what can i tell ya? i learned from the best."
10515,Lynette,"let me see.gaby,she's being deported.xiao-mei,is this the first letter like this you've received?"

10784,Lynette,"hey, parker, where's your uniform? you got your game in an hour."
12698,Lynette,"okay, we're gonna talk about that later. you were saying?"
11839,Lynette,"that's not the point. and what were you thinking, using my son as a drug mule?"
10763,Lynette,"all right, all right, all right, all right. i'm pulling over! jeez! what the hell are you doing?!"
9578,Lynette,"okay, you boys, it's seven o'clock. time for bed."

9068,Lynette,what?
11542,Lynette,looks like we're working the same corner.
11700,Lynette,"well, we're giving it back."
12403,Lynette,"yeah? ""creative"" like selling fake i.d.s was creative. and hot-wiring mccluskey's car-- that was a work of art."
10434,Lynette,i was helping bree with her recycling.
8705,Lynette,even the limp ones aren't that ethical.
8865,Lynette,i really do appreciate you guys staying and helping.

12463,Lynette,"hey. mind if i join you? okay, i know what i did--was unforgivable. and i am not trying to make excuses, but--we used to talk all the time, and then one day it just stopped, and it killed me. i felt like i lost you. and then i was saraj, and i had you back, and we were talking again, and you were telling me thin."
10652,Lynette,"tom, could i, could i check your tie again?"
10987,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna make you a cake."
9560,Lynette,"anyone is capable of anything. the first time we ever met, you were cheating!"

11830,Lynette,movie. it's a western.
11410,Lynette,"yeah, his name is rick coletti, and he was a sous-chef at cucina."
9222,Lynette,because i kicked him out of the house.
10484,Lynette,"yeah, ""honey,you're the love of my life.she's just the runner-up."""

11444,Lynette,"well, but he's been clean for almost a year."
11122,Lynette,"okay, okay, i know what you're thinking, but--kayla's going through a hard time right now. come and sit down. letting her watch tv is like me letting you eat ice cream when you're sick."
13017,Lynette,"the problem--how to attract high net worth clients in a down economy. the solution? be creative. christie's is hosting its first ever ""sea auction"" on a yacht in st. barths. i see a boat full of millionaires waiting to be wooed."

11118,Lynette,"kayla, where you going?"
11288,Lynette,"oh, honey, you have had, what, four hours sleep in the past three days? you need rest. who cares if we run out of breadsticks?"
10295,Lynette,"well,uh,okay,i know how this looks,but i have to tell you,i left them with a very reliable baby-sitter."
9971,Lynette,okay.
12941,Lynette,he's doing great.
9832,Lynette,"i know things have been hard for you since i started back to work, but it is just as hard for me to be away from you. and, you just have to remember that even when i'm not around, my love for you is real. you may not be able to see it, but it's not imaginary like mrs. mulberry. it's real. okay, honey?"
11172,Lynette,shouldn't you be working?
12723,Lynette,that's because he's preston.
10903,Lynette,"i brought this on myself. i tell tom, i want you to be your own man.' but the truth is, i don't. i want him to have what he wants if it's what i want. i'm a bitch with a capital c."
10945,Lynette,tell him i said to share. now put daddy on.
12214,Lynette,is that where you were during bree's acceptance speech - doing free shots at the bar?
11653,Lynette,what did he have to say?
8937,Lynette,"oh jordana, you are really a lifesaver, thank you. here, these pieces need trim."
12277,Lynette,you are.
13237,Lynette,so--you would be a college student-- again.
11730,Lynette,"no! no,i'm looking at the nightstand,and all i see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper dvd you thought would cheer me up."
9956,Lynette,hi.
9862,Lynette,"um, why don't you ask trudy? she loves going out."
9995,Lynette,"nina, i think i speak for everyone here when i say we are sick and tired of your abuse. frankly, you owe us an apology."
8813,Lynette,"no, we got perp-walked down main street usa."
12349,Lynette,what? why? wh--for what?
9621,Lynette,"yeah, that didn't walk into mike's garage by itself."
12392,Lynette,"okay, you're not gonna believe this, but--she's back."
10482,Lynette,karl broke up with edie.
11119,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, we don't watch tv during dinner."
9301,Lynette,what?
11613,Lynette,did he what?
9371,Lynette,of course.
8905,Lynette,why don't we just put them back in me and cook them until they're civilised?
9932,Lynette,oh.
12183,Lynette,you were supposed to be home at 8:00 to help me wrangle the kids for bath time. it's--it's almost 11:00.
10084,Lynette,"oh, sure, but--but maybe next time you could try juggling instead."
11299,Lynette,"i shouldn't have to tell you every little thing, you know. show some initiative."
11630,Lynette,"well, when two people have known each other as long as mommy and daddy have, they don't have to always talk. in fact, a sign of a good relationship is being comfortable in silence."
10241,Lynette,"no, it's not a deal.i need a solemn vow that you will never throw that in my face ever again.because if you do,you will unleash demons that you do not wanna meet."
10684,Lynette,oh.
9575,Lynette,whatever.
12097,Lynette,how did i not know this?
10091,Lynette,"yeah, but i probably should've just gone with it.gaby was just being gaby--having fun."
12891,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza."
10511,Lynette,"he's under contract.if you just fire him,he'll sue you, and i'll back him up.you need cause."
12648,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
10324,Lynette,"no,i'm pretty sure the lowell group used eskimos in a deodorant commercial they had last month. remember?"
11503,Lynette,we're trying so hard to protect them from this. there are just some things that kids don't need to know about.
10332,Lynette,"yes,i am."
10260,Lynette,here you go.
10341,Lynette,"tom,if you're gonna make a point,why don't you do it now before i hurl the plate at you?"
11069,Lynette,"well, believe me, rita, he scares me, too. you know what? we should have a meeting, get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy. saturday, your house. sounds good."
9349,Lynette,the stakes were raised.
9527,Lynette,three months?
13185,Lynette,i didn't say that. you're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy from me. i just went through the same thing. remember?
12114,Lynette,do you maybe want to say something first?
12687,Lynette,"no. sweetie, i don't."
10557,Lynette,sorry. stop. done talking.that's fantastic.i love you!
9221,Lynette,yeah--
10762,Lynette,nah.
12409,Lynette,but i told them they couldn't go.
10268,Lynette,"i am not fighting your fights.this is my fight.this is how guys do business, right?"
9757,Lynette,school supplies.
12303,Lynette,"oh, god. is this gonna be one of those therapy things where she hits me with a foam bat?"
13118,Lynette,uh-huh. which means you saw me--
12557,Lynette,oh. is he--
11475,Lynette,"hey, they didn't have jell-o, so i hope pudding is okay."
9420,Lynette,she's your wife. how can you talk about her like that?
10313,Lynette,"they're like lightning.it's just,penny--"
12147,Lynette,"hey, church buddy. look what i got."
10124,Lynette,"well, 99% wrong."
10270,Lynette,thanks.could you scrounge me up a bucket?
8739,Lynette,"he got smoke inhalation, he's at the hospital."
9939,Lynette,"i need these play dates. tom, we need these play dates."
12100,Lynette,but that's not where they found her.
13242,Lynette,"well, it's just so random, and the worst part is if i point that out, i'm a bitch."
9114,Lynette,you sly dog.
12994,Lynette,"not great. see, while i was working at scavo's, i got seven years older, which is weird, seeing as how all the c.e.o.s got seven years younger. the bottom line is, no one wants to hire someone who could have made out with their dad on prom night. anyway, i hear carlos is looking for a new director of marketing. think you could put in a good word for me?"
11798,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9865,Lynette,pals?'cause sometimes it's hard to tell. you know i wasn't feeling the love today when you mocked my campaign in front of the clients.
11231,Lynette,"cereal? i didn't have any--oh, i know what that is. i get nauseous from the pain, so that's just a little residual vomit."
11863,Lynette,what are you saying?
10431,Lynette,"do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter?anyway,my children have that trick down,too."
12415,Lynette,"and while i thought grounding you was an appropriate punishment, your dad convinced me. i was being a little too hard on you guys."
10540,Lynette,anything else going on?
12291,Lynette,"so i like what you said about making the family stronger, but as i told you, kayla's the one you wanna focus on."
9424,Lynette,"thanks."" ""i'll play with you."
11792,Lynette,"i'm fine. so tell me something. when you go to a ribbon cutting, do you get to keep those gigantic novelty scissors?"
9681,Lynette,okay. come on. give me your feet.
10225,Lynette,great! great!
9666,Lynette,thank you. here.
11266,Lynette,austin? what the hell's going on here?
12582,Lynette,that's right. you're a realtor.
12662,Lynette,no.
9563,Lynette,she's in the next room.
8896,Lynette,there has been flirting.
8909,Lynette,"well, you know how we both agree that one of us needs to stay home and parent the kids and one of us needs to go off and make a living. and then i suddenly remembered, when i was working i made a little more than you."
10215,Lynette,"oh, hey! hey!"
11546,Lynette,i was wrong. i was wrong. come on. follow me. follow me.
12442,Lynette,"well, the good news is he really doesn't hang out with jimmy conrado. but i am a little worried about anita47, who told him cherry fruit pops are an aphrodisiac."
13190,Lynette,back up a second. you guys were classmates?
10221,Lynette,what do you think you're doing?
10436,Lynette,that's fantastic!
13187,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes, knock it off! i am not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself. you are tom scavo, damn it!"
11308,Lynette,"okay, that brings us to 22. javi, rico, we got chairs to find. move it."
8976,Lynette,"it means come girl scout cookie time, don't bother bringing little tina, because we won't be home!"
11604,Lynette,"i'm sorry. i would've called, but they took our cell phones before they locked us in there."
10077,Lynette,we've got day care!
13256,Lynette,"hey. don't sweat it. you wanted to learn chinese--mm, we'll get you a book."
9699,Lynette,"hi. guys, i'd like you to meet penny. she gives me all my best ideas."
10785,Lynette,what?
10842,Lynette,"wow, you're pretty good at that."
10258,Lynette,tell him you're done with the games.you don't wanna play anymore.
9435,Lynette,"alisa, come here."
11843,Lynette,okay. well--i think i'll turn in.
9719,Lynette,i did. i had to load the dishwasher.
12372,Lynette,it's--stunning.
12227,Lynette,"well, for starters, mr. coletti opened his restaurant to get back at me because i wouldn't have an affair with him."
8699,Lynette,santa's cell-phone number.
9628,Lynette,"he's apples, i'm oranges, we excel in different areas. trust me, you should give tom a look."
11942,Lynette,great. here. grab this.
12689,Lynette,"oh, you are such a gentleman. sit your ass down."
12080,Lynette,"come on! hurry up! go! get in, get in! get in! uhh! hang on! hang onto this!"
9782,Lynette,ladies' room.
10096,Lynette,"bree, come on, just tell me."
8832,Lynette,"they don't have attention-deficit disorder, and i'm not going to drug my boys just to make your job easier. i'd rather change teachers."
11637,Lynette,"yeah, and then you threw up in the trophy."
12436,Lynette,his what on what?
12606,Lynette,okay.
11891,Lynette,what?
10129,Lynette,"well, well--yes,i overreacted.i think you can see how even though i was somewhat off base,you were a little wrong,right?"
8895,Lynette,"listen, i'm sorry about mike. i know how much you like him."
9085,Lynette,"come on, one, two, three, get in, get in!"
12765,Lynette,"uh, is everything okay?"
11139,Lynette,"okay, let's go."
9010,Lynette,"oh, yeah. sorry."
12186,Lynette,so you're really okay with this?
10194,Lynette,"no, the cow part--that could work.we'll-- we'll make them into characters.we'll humanize them. oh!i know! i know!celebrity cow spokespeople!"
10364,Lynette,"oh,yes!of course you do.still,you gotta love the thunderbolt."
11487,Lynette,"i just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems, and there might be another rolling blackout today. do you want me to leave ida's number in case something happens?"
9148,Lynette,it's the basic flaw of your gender. i get it. just do me the honor of-
13135,Lynette,i got it. i'll be right up.
9208,Lynette,hi.
9920,Lynette,"ah, no, it's, it's okay. believe me, my boys can take care of themselves."
13050,Lynette,don't forget your little animals!
11857,Lynette,"yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. they're fun."
12607,Lynette,yeah. what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
8902,Lynette,we're not moving.
12923,Lynette,what's going on here?
11204,Lynette,you can't drown in self-pity just because i helped you with one tiny little thing.
12262,Lynette,"you brought it up before, and in this case, i really don't think we have a choice."
9582,Lynette,what are you thinking?
11073,Lynette,you can defend him all you want. i know what i know.
9041,Lynette,i think we need to hire a nanny. full time.
8955,Lynette,really?
11620,Lynette,"don't touch me! you have to go now. please, go. you have to go now. go on. go."
12232,Lynette,didn't i? 'cause it kinda seemed like they had you against the ropes in there.
11738,Lynette,yeah. things have been a little weird lately--
12028,Lynette,"oh, crap! now where do you think you're going?"
10187,Lynette,"oh, not good. i am trying to salvage the pitch from the black's frozen yogurt campaign.you know what kills me?"
8982,Lynette,yep. he's a feisty one.
8811,Lynette,i think i can top that. try getting thrown out of disneyland for lewd behaviour.
10910,Lynette,"yeah, well, any wife can support a husband who never takes risks, and i don't want that kind of husband, and i'll be damned if i'm gonna be that kind of wife. so you open your pizza place, and we will find a way to make it work."
11623,Lynette,"ooh, sorry. by the way, we are gonna need to find a new chef. rick gave notice."
11026,Lynette,"you don't get it. his house had this creepy vibe. tell him, tom."
8885,Lynette,hey.
8940,Lynette,"um, sure."
10689,Lynette,"i know you are tom, and i know love her. why else do you think i'm willing to put up with all this for six months?why do you think i'm willing to say to my college roommates, yes, that's my husband's love child and her mother in our christmas picture.because i am your wife!you always come first with me.do i still come first with you?"
8859,Lynette,"guys, this isn't-"
12794,Lynette,"at least twice a week, and sometimes i'd bring the kids."
8815,Lynette,oh. didn't have a good time?
11519,Lynette,"hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?"
9377,Lynette,"hey, tammy."
10546,Lynette,we're aware of that.
9267,Lynette,what?
13165,Lynette,after?
10505,Lynette,"oh, god!"
12225,Lynette,so when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband?
11761,Lynette,"no. no,of course not.you know what? let's make a pact.no more secrets.from now on,we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives."
13150,Lynette,"uh, tell him i'll call right back."
11956,Lynette,shh!
11961,Lynette,"this is not a joke, tom. something has attacked our home, and when that happens, you don't just stand by-- you fight it. screw this creature that has come into our lives uninvited and is trying to destroy us. it will not defeat me."
9495,Lynette,"ok, tom, i will swing by the dry cleaners after i hit the market. um, i don't know, porter has a dentist appointment at 4 o' clock, so the, um, car might have to wait until tomorrow."
10709,Lynette,"i just, i, i, you know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting."
11515,Lynette,okay. back to edie--i'm not sure i'm comfortable ganging up on her.
12829,Lynette,"i'm sorry. is there any way we could finish this conversation tomorrow? l-l-later in the day works better for me, too. well, thank you very much. bye."
10872,Lynette,"because you'll fail! i'm sorry! god.i shouldn't have said that.but you're gambling with our life savings, and you have no experience."
13307,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
12143,Lynette,"but here's where you lost me--""god's love is as sure as the sunlight."""
12356,Lynette,"no, you are trying to stay on the fence while i fight to stop kayla from destroying us. but look around you, tom. look where i am! you have got to do something now. fix this."
9344,Lynette,"yeah, not so cool now, huh?"
12196,Lynette,i didn't go into work that night.
8826,Lynette,let 'em look. as long as they don't try and cut in.
10640,Lynette,"well, to be honest, first, we bought you pie, then you tried to extort money from us."
9798,Lynette,"hey buddy, wake up sleepyhead. parker. hi, hi pal. what do you say you and me go get some donuts, okay, before mommy has to go to work. yeah?"
12916,Lynette,"okay, you fill water glasses. i'll make the salads."
9364,Lynette,"i just can't figure out how it happened. they get a bath every night. trust me, it's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day."
10968,Lynette,he's a bachelor.
12729,Lynette,"okay, look--you know how you're always saying i know what to do in a crisis?"
9906,Lynette,"well, actually, this was already in my closet. i just forgot about it."
13021,Lynette,hey. what are you doing here?
10619,Lynette,"okay, then."
11020,Lynette,"parker? hey! come back here! honey? come on, we're leaving. parker. parker, come on, we're leaving. why didn't you come when i called?"
9186,Lynette,"i'm just picking up my sick poor little baby boy. all right, here."
10608,Lynette,i said i wanted penny.
11656,Lynette,hmm?
11573,Lynette,we missed you.
10645,Lynette,"yeah, that would be a shame."
9447,Lynette,that's me. never afraid to create a scene.
10006,Lynette,sure.
12931,Lynette,fine. congratulations. you just stole a pizza oven.
10001,Lynette,"yeah, no, i didn't think so. ante up."
9511,Lynette,"uh, mr mullins had a spare. why didn't you open the door?"
12657,Lynette,hitting women and children? you must be so proud.
11581,Lynette,rick? why would we want to let him go?
11138,Lynette,"mm-hmm. okay. boys, go to the car. i'll be out in a minute. go. listen, sweetheart, i don't blame you for being angry. your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me. but--the last thing she said to me was, ""promise you'll take care of kayla,"" and i am going to. but you're gonna have to help me, okay?"
10061,Lynette,"kiss the kids good night and i'll see them in the morning. okay, yeah. i love you, too. bye-bye."
10954,Lynette,you are gonna get through this just fine. there is a parking lot full of ambulances out there. you gotta let us take her out of here!
12435,Lynette,"hey, parker. can i ask you something, just between us? does porter hang out with jimmy conrado?"
11155,Lynette,ooh!
11872,Lynette,"oh, about brandy--bad news."
9206,Lynette,sexism.
13243,Lynette,i know tom. he's going to learn how to count to ten in chinese then he'll get bored and move on to his new dream of becoming a beekeeper.
11724,Lynette,what did the doctors say?
12202,Lynette,"okay. i know this whole thing with rick-- it really caused us some damage. i know it hurt us, but we survived it, and it's over now."
12351,Lynette,oh! tom.
10983,Lynette,yeah.
9238,Lynette,"and just so we're absolutely clear, i am definitely not your mother, because if you ever betray me, i will leave you. i will take the kids, and i will walk out that door, and you will never see any of us again."
10086,Lynette,i just said it bugged me.why is that a problem?
9494,Lynette,i'd invite you in but-
9656,Lynette,we should-- talk about this.
11750,Lynette,"and,edie,you look great. especially,you know,given the circumstances."
11353,Lynette,"hey, guys."
9768,Lynette,"i know, i promised i wouldn't do this, but parker really needs me to be there on his first day of kindergarten. he's so freaked out i can't be there."
11739,Lynette,okay.i'll jump right on it.
11121,Lynette,well--just this once.
12824,Lynette,"oh, my water broke. take the overnight bag out to the car. oh, three weeks. that's a little soon, but, uh, sure, i could make that work."
11355,Lynette,"good point, good point. but right now we're talking about these ugly-ass uniforms."
12972,Lynette,yeah.
11504,Lynette,i think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.
9820,Lynette,thank you.
13027,Lynette,"no, you won't get the chance 'cause i'm gonna kill you first. the houselights are up, gaby. you can drop the act. you only helped me get this job because you needed a spy."
11878,Lynette,and that's only possible when you're pretending i'm someone else?
12252,Lynette,boys? who are you talking about?
10448,Lynette,of course.i will talk to him.i'll talk to him till i'm blue in the face.i promise.take care.
12565,Lynette,"and when i was 12, i had a poster of shaun cassidy, but you don't see me driving around in him, do you?"
10528,Lynette,"what,what?"
11582,Lynette,"actually, he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary. i mean, with all those new dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there."
10384,Lynette,"perfect! take your time.hey,honey.how's the big apple treating ya?good. did those,uh,snooty clients like your pitch?well,that's perfect.excellent."
9504,Lynette,"well, isn't she home? she usually doesn't go anywhere."
10379,Lynette,parcher & murphy is completely mother-friendly.no one would say a word.
10291,Lynette,"honey,i was so worried about you."
9250,Lynette,"well, we could go with the old hickory stick. it's a clich, but it's pretty effective. i know, we'll go with the spatula. the holes give it less wind resistance. moves faster."
9338,Lynette,"measles, huh?"
12230,Lynette,"that's true. i saw him. i was mad that he ditched me, so i went to drag his ass back inside. but when i saw him shouting at the radio, i decided i'll just wait and make his life miserable when we get home. so unless there's a law against choosing lebron james over your wife, i think we're done here."
8851,Lynette,so do i.
12839,Lynette,who knew he had so many friends?
9223,Lynette,hold on. i made you a drink.
11125,Lynette,"whoa, whoa, whoa! sit your butts down!"
10048,Lynette,"oh, hi. excuse me. hi. i'm lynette. you must be fran."
13085,Lynette,urn is empty. let's do it.
8747,Lynette,let's say we do. there's a chance we're not gonna like what we find.
9603,Lynette,"tom, what is this?"
10088,Lynette,me neither.
10028,Lynette,"oh, he'll care. he doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars."
10231,Lynette,"what, did you get recruited by another firm?did somebody cherry-pick ya?"
12620,Lynette,what are you talking about?
9586,Lynette,yes. it soaked through a little. that is the nature of baby sick. do you want me to wear a haz-mat suit or are you going to be okay?
10800,Lynette,"hey, hey, that is not helpful. it only takes one, parker! only takes one!"
12090,Lynette,"oh, my god."
12704,Lynette,"well, i try."
10516,Lynette,"well,you've been working so hard,off on business trips all the time.tonight,we throw caution and cholesterol to the wind.you deserve a little comfort food."
9137,Lynette,"no, no! i'm sorry! false alarm. we didn't find a body. uh, susan just had some really good news. sorry."
11748,Lynette,hi!how are you?
11603,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just cold."
11764,Lynette,"it's a little uncomfortable, but i'm fine. take a card."
9791,Lynette,you couldn't have given them coffee or something? i just feel like i'm missing out on their lives entirely.
10144,Lynette,"that's okay.they don't trust you,either."
10005,Lynette,and nina!
12308,Lynette,"okay, first of all, you're, like, the greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that."
8783,Lynette,hey.
10132,Lynette,"oh, hey, carlos.hi."
9712,Lynette,really?
11302,Lynette,no. why would i order fifty high chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?
8857,Lynette,now open up.
11719,Lynette,how can you say that?
11306,Lynette,now this place opens in five hours. how long will it take to fix this?
13005,Lynette,i'm 54.
13211,Lynette,i wanted you to see the face they don't put in the brochure.
11234,Lynette,"don't touch me, okay?"
10185,Lynette,"well, what are we gonna do about that?"
10387,Lynette,"hey,hey,don't get me wrong.i find that as bizarreas you guys do.but right now this firm needs veronica more than she needs us.telling a mother how to raise her kids is an act of war.we will lose her."
9100,Lynette,no.
12552,Lynette,oh. they're just being silly. they're always silly. that's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house. come on.
9105,Lynette,you had a nanny?
9962,Lynette,hey.
10868,Lynette,i'm thinking--catering company.
8922,Lynette,"all right. i think everyone is down for a nap. we've got no more than an hour. let's get cracking. five car draw, nothing wild."
11502,Lynette,"it's just-- it's something yucky, honey. go on and play with your ball. go on."
10036,Lynette,"oh, god, ed. i am so sorry."
11697,Lynette,"you said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere."
9867,Lynette,no.
11002,Lynette,"hey, sweetie, it's a different market."
11920,Lynette,liar. you're campaigning. cookies--nice touch.
11572,Lynette,my kids know you're not a witch.
8752,Lynette,"i have no help, my husband's always away on business."
10481,Lynette,yeah?
11424,Lynette,i hope.
11042,Lynette,i didn't notice.
11861,Lynette,it was itchy.
12272,Lynette,"what? no. sweetie, we don't need to do that."
9219,Lynette,but your take on this is you're the victim?
9073,Lynette,dishes?
11712,Lynette,"well, if history's any indicator, i won't have to wait long."
11898,Lynette,you're comparing katherine to a nazi?
13022,Lynette,"oh, that is so thoughtful of you. you're such a good friend."
11668,Lynette,"i said that it was totally inappropriate, and then i fired him."
8697,Lynette,"stop it, stop it, stop it. stop it."
10568,Lynette,uh-- no.
8876,Lynette,"the boys are fascinating. they even have their own twin secret language, don't they,tom?"
10441,Lynette,teeth?
12248,Lynette,"tom, they're not serial killers. they're two little boys who were afraid their parents were breaking up."
12020,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11906,Lynette,because you'd never win. bossy women rule this street. you know that.
10848,Lynette,excuse me?
9439,Lynette,"well, because--"
8899,Lynette,apparently we're in competition with one other family. a generous donation will ensure our kids beat them out.
11111,Lynette,"and what did you get for her, porter?"
11766,Lynette,"well, let's not compose my eulogy just yet. i'm still troupin'. take a card."
12584,Lynette,"well--it's a little dumb, but compared to what i was thinking--"
10897,Lynette,"oh, i know them. they live on cypress. they just celebrated their fifty-third wedding anniversary."
10161,Lynette,see ya later.
12074,Lynette,that is not true. i genuinely care about you.
11423,Lynette,"well, you might also want to apologize to the customer who found a lego in her pizza."
11159,Lynette,yeah?
12360,Lynette,"no, i don't, but let's say i did. katherine has this aloof quality. it's like she's always trying to keep us at arm's length."
13213,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?
9539,Lynette,watch your step. tom and i are a team. our marriage is rock solid. nothing you ever do will break us up.
11056,Lynette,don't play dumb with me. i know exactly what is down here! where's the pinball? where's all the games?
11529,Lynette,"wow, that many?"
9968,Lynette,i'm sorry. i've been doing this for seven years. trust me. you have to have eyes in the back of your head.
10250,Lynette,"pat, we're all here, send the call in as soon as you get it."
10422,Lynette,i can't believe you are old enough to drive.i still remember when you were 10 years old.i paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
9097,Lynette,"well, what's wrong?"
10503,Lynette,hey there.did you have a late night?i hope.
11010,Lynette,my kids are having a hard time. they're pretty freaked out by that whole supermarket thing.
12228,Lynette,"no. i am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind, it's rick. maybe he set the fire himself so he could blame my husband."
12245,Lynette,"oh, my god."
8874,Lynette,"oh,that sounds great."
11931,Lynette,i know that--here. but here--it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
13074,Lynette,now--where's that one-armed friend of yours? i'm--wanna shoot some stick.
8760,Lynette,"i try everything. i scream, i threaten, i reason, i beg, nothing works. i don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand, or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me!"
12767,Lynette,what are you talking about?
12477,Lynette,could you just--for a sec? come on. you know i'm right. you're far too busy for this.
9229,Lynette,"no, he should never have been with her in the first place!"
9002,Lynette,"so, has anyone been over there?"
13051,Lynette,"i mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do. maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching."
9263,Lynette,nobody in my family knows or cares where your stupid clock is.
9390,Lynette,"oh, i'm sorry! i thought--"
9061,Lynette,"claire, claire, please."
12261,Lynette,"mm, no. i think it goes a little further than that. i think we have a seriously troubled young girl. she needs--professional help."
10618,Lynette,did it hurt for eight hours?
11816,Lynette,"well, thanks, but prefer not to get my medication from some guy under a bridge."
10131,Lynette,"all righty, then,my work here is done.carlos, gaby."
8835,Lynette,malignant?
12350,Lynette,burn mark? what burn mark?
12315,Lynette,oh. yow! it's a little pricey.
10710,Lynette,"oh, i'm working on a seating chart for bree's wedding."
11077,Lynette,"guys, why has it been so long since we've played poker? i really need this."
9455,Lynette,"thank you, thank you. alright in you go."
11064,Lynette,you're right. i need to talk to someone.
12046,Lynette,"gaby, you just got married."
10828,Lynette,are you asking for a bribe?
9016,Lynette,i know you're not.
10674,Lynette,"oh, i will, i will.and i'll see you tonight."
12922,Lynette,"finally. oh, great. they're kids. 1 ate of spaghetti and 15 baskets of free bread."
12124,Lynette,"because it wasn't enough, not compared to what she did for me. she saved my kids. she's this amazing woman, and i never bothered to get to know her, so, yeah, i sprinkled her ashes, but it would have been nice to do something before she was ashes."
9669,Lynette,"she said she was gonna call. she's got a lot of things to do, planning for the funeral, that sort of thing."
12451,Lynette,"oh, crap on things."
13108,Lynette,i don't. carlos does.
10219,Lynette,just-- uh--could you excuse me for just a minute?
11705,Lynette,so forgiving my mother--that's my penance?
12155,Lynette,what are you doing here?
11812,Lynette,"yeah, i am taking it. it's just--not working."
8748,Lynette,"boys, guys, i'm begging you, sit in your seats. i'm not gonna tell you again! buckle up! i mean it, so help me, i'll-"
12780,Lynette,"porter wasn't there, and she won't tell me where he is."
10958,Lynette,how can you say that?
9647,Lynette,"you know, i didn't tell you to quit."
8794,Lynette,i was looking so forward to a night out.
9456,Lynette,"bree, thanks again for watching my boys. you sure they weren't too much to handle?"
10672,Lynette,"shhh, shh, quiet, shush!"
13283,Lynette,"what, a nanny cam?"
10547,Lynette,atlantic city?
9627,Lynette,"he's more then solid, tom's ideas are spectacular. he's passionate about his work. his visual instincts are off the chart."
12488,Lynette,you bought tom a new bass?
12955,Lynette,you're grieving. i get it. but this sounds like a fantastic job. please just hear the guy out and make a nice--impression.
13288,Lynette,please tell me that's not a purple wall clock. pack your bags. we're moving.
9113,Lynette,they're full of iron. could you make sure they clean their plates?
11888,Lynette,"oh, i'd like that."
10742,Lynette,no!
10322,Lynette,"no.i'm worried about her,but i don't know how i'm gonna get over what she did."
11893,Lynette,"got it. sick talk done, okay? you guys have fun."
11518,Lynette,hello?
9744,Lynette,"hey, sweet pea. why? what's wrong?"
11788,Lynette,yeah--kinda. can i pencil you in?
11823,Lynette,"are you kidding? it's genius. he's a sponge, but he talks!"
10854,Lynette,mm-hmm.
10000,Lynette,"well, if one of you would just agree to raise my kids, i wouldn't need a job. any takers?"
9510,Lynette,"hello? it's lynette? hello? mrs mcclusky? mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
9482,Lynette,then why don't you think about moving somewhere less expensive? like a nursing home?
10089,Lynette,"hey, you're out early."
8875,Lynette,yes. completely identical. you can't tell them apart. they're like bookends.
11466,Lynette,"we've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!"
12270,Lynette,"actually, you do. that's why you're here. so let's just wait and talk to the doctor, okay?"
11014,Lynette,"in the daytime, art coaches swimming at the rec center, but, please, i can tell parker? please?"
13140,Lynette,"no, we're in our third week. we got this down to a science. just deal me out a few hands."
10439,Lynette,there's a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
12092,Lynette,"hahaha, so her niece and nephew are taking all this stuff back to nebraska?"
11710,Lynette,i'm fine. everything's just fine.
10209,Lynette,"you have a real job, right here staying home with the kids."
10425,Lynette,she must be.it's hard for me to imagine the bree i know capable of hurting you.
10804,Lynette,"hey, give the kid what he wants."
12626,Lynette,"gee, porter. that's just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman."
9365,Lynette,i keep thinking that maybe it was the petting zoo that i took them to last week. that llama was really iffy.
11836,Lynette,"could you check on 'em for me, please?"
10586,Lynette,"no, dad is not gonna be there, but he--he is gonna come and see you guys all the time.we are still gonna be a family.it's just-- we won't be living in the same place anymore.so--is there any questions you wanna ask me?"
10371,Lynette,"oh,i get it. i get it.ooh! this is your idea of driving the train.and it's very manly and really impressive,but it's really,really bad timing.you can't be serious.mmm. we're gonna--we're gonna be late."
12282,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! what happened? is he okay?"
9847,Lynette,it's a gimlet. you'll love it.
12170,Lynette,"oh, you don't have to do that."
11359,Lynette,"well, you gave me no choice."
13191,Lynette,meaning you were in the same class at the same time?
11415,Lynette,"i can't find somebody else. i've interviewed fifty guys and this junkie happens to be the best of the bunch. seriously, tom, i don't know how much longer i--"
9406,Lynette,it was really nasty and he wouldn't shut up either.
12163,Lynette,"yes, and do you know why? because out of all my friends, you are the one who had real faith. you had an actual relationship with god. at least, that's what i thought."
10377,Lynette,"really, veronica?well, you know, there's another perk that i just thought of."
10073,Lynette,"no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me. okay? listen, and you? all right, good. so, first of all, ed, stealing the baby was really stupid."
9532,Lynette,"c'on, you can tell me. you still care about her, don't you, just a teeny tiny little bit?"
12297,Lynette,so we were sort of surprised to get your call. don't you need to see kayla a few more times before you report back to us?
8721,Lynette,"years! uh, how are you, how's the firm?"
10617,Lynette,thank you.
12458,Lynette,go away.
10736,Lynette,hi.i'm ready.
12027,Lynette,"ah, there's booze-illa now."
10724,Lynette,"hey, i just brought two lost souls together. okay, how about this? he cheated on my friend. he deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him."
12205,Lynette,"yeah, we were sure one of you would end up killing the other."
11246,Lynette,here you go.
10240,Lynette,"on one condition.if you take this job,you are never allowed to bring up what happened before with your promotion."
9228,Lynette,"impressed? impressed? i-tom, please, please don't tell me you're all right with this!"
9411,Lynette,excuse me!
11292,Lynette,only two.and the mailman had the good taste never to bring that up again.come on.let's go get some sleep.
11039,Lynette,oh! good.
12588,Lynette,"oh, right. and, kirby, tell your mom thanks. that place she found for tom is already paying off."
11664,Lynette,"the idiot told me he had feelings for me, which he never would've done if you hadn't pushed him, and now he's gone. it's all your fault."
10831,Lynette,good.
13110,Lynette,then maybe i'd get that raise i've been asking for.
10047,Lynette,"well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?"
10634,Lynette,what if you pull out his key chain?
11394,Lynette,hi.
10397,Lynette,"come on,baby birds don't jump out of the nest.they need to be pushed."
9035,Lynette,"well, mrs. huber never showed up. why don't you wear this one?"
10473,Lynette,"ugh!because it's dirty and wrong, and i'll wash your mouth out with soap! that's why."
10524,Lynette,i can't believe that son of a bitch hired a forensic accountant.he's more whipped than i thought.
12273,Lynette,you don't understand.
12841,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
12971,Lynette,your job? the one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat? you had a shot. you blew it.
12596,Lynette,no.
11364,Lynette,no.
13239,Lynette,which is?
12625,Lynette,"okay, that's it. i'm calling her."
10834,Lynette,you get to chase your dream while i get to spend the rest of my life in advertising.
12713,Lynette,hey. whose lawyer are you anyway?
10447,Lynette,so you think that now he's obsessed with--
12642,Lynette,are you really pregnant?
12862,Lynette,"we'd like to shut scavo's down for the night and throw a party in your honor. just family and friends. we'd toast your success and have a night of fun, just like old times. what do you say?"
12259,Lynette,but it doesn't matter! intentionally setting a fire is a very serious crime. don't you get that?
11433,Lynette,don't cry. just clean.
11276,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. let's hear them. what are your reasons for bringing back joe bong hit?"
9271,Lynette,"if our house catches fire i guarantee you, she's the one that started it."
10642,Lynette,sort of.
11551,Lynette,"hey, gab. hi."
9341,Lynette,"well, it is for the rich bee-eye-tee-see-atch's--"
9480,Lynette,"oh, that's cute. that's great. here, give them here."
8978,Lynette,"oh, i'm fine. i just need some coffee."" ""thank you."
10890,Lynette,"it's a grown-up word, and when daddy comes home, you'll learn a new one: grovel."
11291,Lynette,"hey, chill out. you're acting like i did when i was six months pregnant."
11478,Lynette,"oh, wow. candles, too?"
11729,Lynette,hey! hey! my wig is gone.where is it?
12659,Lynette,"aah! porter, i told you to go home. what are you doing here?"
13062,Lynette,"before you go, would you put my socks back on? my feet are cold again."
11101,Lynette,where are you going?
9056,Lynette,"well, if we had a nanny like you at my house, we would treat her like gold. did i mention i have four very loveable kids?"
10454,Lynette,"and then the mommy and the daddy,because they love each other so much,they hug.real tight."
9654,Lynette,"well, yes, yes, it is hard, but i, i love it, too, and i've been doing it for six years, and i haven't complained the entire time."
12809,Lynette,that's penny. i'll be right back.
10829,Lynette,i'll get my checkbook.
11380,Lynette,we run a restaurant.
12893,Lynette,what is this?
9258,Lynette,what?
11590,Lynette,thank god for italian. you can charge way more for 'orecchiette with pancetta' than you'd ever get for 'bacon and little ears.'
11782,Lynette,gaby?
12613,Lynette,i followed you to the warehouse. i know everything.
12863,Lynette,"yeah, yeah."
12647,Lynette,"okay, well, just so you know, i hit back."
10342,Lynette,stop right there.this is meat loaf. your presentation was business.
10730,Lynette,you're right. you are right. you're right. i'm so sorry. it's just--
9729,Lynette,being too lazy to change the sheets is not a principle.
9359,Lynette,"edie, if you want me to share stuff with you, you're gonna have to start being more supportive of susan."
9674,Lynette,"yeah, of course, they won't get in the way of the job because my husband's staying home with them from now on."
9374,Lynette,"i'm begging you. they've already been uninvited from a birthday party, a really big birthday party with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown."
12679,Lynette,"good luck. anne? when the baby comes, you don't contact porter. you can contact tom or me, and we'll do what we can for you from a distance. understood?"
11858,Lynette,a week? all right. you'll hurt if you can?
11600,Lynette,tom! in here!
12937,Lynette,sorry.
13241,Lynette,"uh. we didn't get that far. i felt faint, and he left to go buy a backpack."
13129,Lynette,tom?
9110,Lynette,hi.
12045,Lynette,sorry. can you say that again? i don't think i heard you right.
9104,Lynette,"well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. you know, our mothers were smart. they didn't get us nannies or put us in day care, because they knew, if they did, we'd find out - there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were!"
12827,Lynette,could you hold on one second?
8952,Lynette,"yeah, i didn't think so. and just so you know, next spring when we do bambi, his mother is going to take a slug to the heart, and you're going to like it!"
9165,Lynette,hi. come on in.
10875,Lynette,okay.
9588,Lynette,fine.
11131,Lynette,you know what might solve something?if you were home once in a while.you're the one she listens to.
12041,Lynette,then why not come back?
12367,Lynette,"oh, tom. don't you know an urban myth when you hear one?"
12810,Lynette,"hey, sweetie. what's up?"
10704,Lynette,"what? no! no, no, no. what happened?"
10078,Lynette,"hi, bunny, bunny. hi."
9043,Lynette,ten. ten! each one more incompetent than the last. one actually asked me--here you go --if she was expected to change diapers.
13171,Lynette,don't just walk away.
12559,Lynette,hey.
10607,Lynette,no way.
11205,Lynette,why haven't you told me about all of this?
9817,Lynette,"oh, i am so sorry."
11602,Lynette,"yeah. no, i'm fine."
12247,Lynette,"well, gee, i'm kind of at a loss here, tom. dr. spock didn't have a chapter on how to punish your kids for burning down a building."
10407,Lynette,"oh,i don't wanna be mad anymore.and i'm so happy to hear all that,and i am so proud of you."
8988,Lynette,exactly!
9540,Lynette,"edie, hi."
13068,Lynette,i'm not supposed to drink.
12558,Lynette,so he's okay?
10669,Lynette,thank you.
11825,Lynette,that's me! the ninja!
10542,Lynette,"i love you,too."
11947,Lynette,"okay, we're done talking here."
9319,Lynette,okay.
10737,Lynette,ummm.
8789,Lynette,i'm still in.
9800,Lynette,"all right. ah. so, what do you think you are going to have, huh? jelly? cause i think i'm gonna have a bear claw."
12418,Lynette,"come on, tom. i mean, we trust them, right?"
9651,Lynette,"oh, well, yeah. i think it would be good for you to take some time off."
11357,Lynette,"really, kim? 'cause--i heard one of your customers say that when halloween comes around, we should stick a candle in your mouth. see? morale. you guys need to stand up for yourselves. it's your right-no, it's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts. and if management doesn't like it, you tell him he can go screw-!"
9863,Lynette,"oh, is she now?"
12159,Lynette,"okay, what gives?"
11660,Lynette,sorry. i'll try to be gentler as i move down south.
9428,Lynette,what?
9625,Lynette,"no, no, not me. i was actually thinking more about tom."
9810,Lynette,"well, why didn't mrs. mulberry volunteer that information before i turned your room upside down looking for it, hmm?"
12608,Lynette,you sure?
10494,Lynette,"hey, any luckwith that i.m.ing thing?"
11928,Lynette,don't do that. i wanna be sad when they knock it down.
9836,Lynette,"or, uh, maybe she's not. she could have left. you know. maybe she had some other little boy that she needed to help."
12904,Lynette,just know we're 100% behind you.
10532,Lynette,"he's not answering his cell phone.but you don't have to worry,okay?you got what you wanted.he's out of the building."
8729,Lynette,yeah! it's been a little rough!
12106,Lynette,it doesn't matter. she was an amazing woman. you should respect her wishes.
12953,Lynette,"mwah. ohh. you couldn't shave? come on, tom. you need to look nice. bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner."
10444,Lynette,"oh,it doesn't.i'm just stalling because i am completely mortified."
9049,Lynette,is this seat taken?
12110,Lynette,wait! you'll never find it i'll get it for you.
9336,Lynette,"yeah, well, there's lots more where that came from."
9756,Lynette,"parker, guess what i got."
8931,Lynette,"um, ladies. we all grew up with little red riding hood, and we survived it, scary stuff and all, so i say, to hell with political correctness, let our kids experience this classic like it was meant to be enjoyed. let's kill the damn wolf, and just put on the best show we can."
8959,Lynette,so somebody found out mary alice's secret--
12635,Lynette,"but one day, you are gonna meet someone more--appropriate. someone who want the same things that you do out of life. then you are gonna know what real love is. and when you do, i hope you will finally see where i am coming from."
8809,Lynette,"yeah, but tonight, anything goes. make sure you share with your brothers."
12553,Lynette,"yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless he doesn't get home in time for mrs. mccluskey's party, and then all bets are off. oh, daddy's gonna be fine. come on."
10037,Lynette,"yeah. sure. i'll, i'm gonna go and take care of that."
10790,Lynette,hey.
12906,Lynette,"i thought maybe after our conversation today, you'd realize it's time to pack it in."
9350,Lynette,i can't believe how lucky you were today.
13034,Lynette,"um, i have a tiny scheduling conflict. i coach my daughter's basketball team on friday nights. so if i could--"
9833,Lynette,parker!
10158,Lynette,"hey,guys."
9485,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
11224,Lynette,"i can't call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave, especially when i've been fine for three of them."
8741,Lynette,to mary alice.
10502,Lynette,what?
10403,Lynette,"already?i mean,i'm sorry."
11062,Lynette,what if parker had been in there?
12536,Lynette,"yeah, that's immaterial. what do you think of the coupons?"
9134,Lynette,you don't say.
10450,Lynette,"no,not exactly.i'm just--i'm trying to understand why you--did that."
10613,Lynette,"you promised me we'd stop at four.remember?you wanted four kids, i wanted one, and somehow we compromised on four.can we please stop now?"
11363,Lynette,"later i'll be asleep, and then i will be back here before you wake up. we gotta deal with this now."
11828,Lynette,okay.
9759,Lynette,"so on your first day of school, you and your dad can find your cubby and you can hang it up."
12184,Lynette,"so where were you? you were stewing, weren't you? come on. you're upset about rick."
9658,Lynette,"oh, why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?"
11755,Lynette,i know.the timing is terrible.
9959,Lynette,"porter, preston, what have i told you about playing outside after dark?"
9682,Lynette,how's that? is that better?
9027,Lynette,"oh, susan, you gotta take my kids for a while."
9490,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, you're back from the hospital already?"
12641,Lynette,"no, i have to talk to someone else first. remember when you left that soda can on the coffee table, and it left a ring, and i yelled at you i take it all back."
10175,Lynette,"look,it makes perfect sense.we're not gonna have any more kids.and the pill just makes me bloat.it'll be great!"
10366,Lynette,"nicholson will be coming in in about 15 minutes with a pitch,so let's grab everybody and make sure we're all on the same page."
9023,Lynette,thanks!
10370,Lynette,"mmm.whoa. hello.what's going on,huh?"
8917,Lynette,"i'm sorry, aren't we doing little red riding hood?"
9189,Lynette,hi!
12400,Lynette,sorry.
11169,Lynette,"andrew, hi! i thought you weren't starting until the opening."
8985,Lynette,"i've got it covered, no problem."
12898,Lynette,"if we sell this place now, we can escape with some dignity and maybe even some money. but if we keep on going like we are, we're gonna lose everything."
8771,Lynette,"i have 4 kids under the age of six, i absolutely have anger management issues."
11219,Lynette,"tom, no. you can't. you can't. the pizzeria opens in a week, and that street fair is the best advertising we're gonna get."
12997,Lynette,you guess? gaby--
12954,Lynette,"okay. i was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood, but i realize that's not gonna happen, so bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher--and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive."
13306,Lynette,for someone with your coloring.
9518,Lynette,we don't have to be friends. but we're two human beings living on the same piece of earth. we could at least help each other out once in a while.
11910,Lynette,"hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street."
12722,Lynette,what took you so long?
9115,Lynette,"bye, guys!"
8911,Lynette,"so if i went back to work, then you could stay home and take care of the kids."
11349,Lynette,since always. you know my closet. surely you've noticed i don't own anything orange.
10662,Lynette,you move fast.
9313,Lynette,"oh, you know it."
9859,Lynette,"oh, parker hates pepperoni. how about sausage? yeah. and a small cheese. okay, perfect. love you."
9215,Lynette,"you know, the house isn't that big, rodney. you're going to have to stop avoiding me."
12818,Lynette,"oh, please. you know it's gonna be a boy. it's always a boy. it's just gonna pee in my face and hide dead things in my shoes. i am doing this, tom. i am going after this job."
11536,Lynette,i agree.
12619,Lynette,who?
12543,Lynette,don't give me that. you are having the kind of success i only dreamed of back in my ad days.

13083,Lynette,"okay, we're here. guys--wake up. guys? we're home. get out."
13151,Lynette,hello?
10575,Lynette,"he's not coming, sweetheart.but you could show me."
11258,Lynette,"i had so much fun at the fair today, working with you on something that was all ours. i want every day to be like that."
10437,Lynette,formula.
10518,Lynette,"okay,well--remember i was helping ed spark up his love life?"
11378,Lynette,how much of a while?
12197,Lynette,"yeah. no, he was here."
12946,Lynette,could you call him now?
11853,Lynette,"no, i'm good. hey, babe, what's going on? you still with me?"
11941,Lynette,"i can't eat right now, tom. i've got to go to the garden center and get some fencing. god, this is annoying! can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!"
11594,Lynette,"oh-- my--god! oh! oh, my god! they locked us in here! it's forty-two degrees! we're gonna freeze to death!"
12376,Lynette,"yeah, i can. sit down. earlier, my husband, in an attempt to help you with your relationship, mistakenly gave you some advice, which he would now like to take back. tom?"
10243,Lynette,this dinner is really good.
10495,Lynette,"okay, that's good.then what?"
12895,Lynette,"okay--as much as i love tommy scavo's improve theater, we need to face some facts here."
11403,Lynette,no. it's great you can spell. you are now officially the front-runner.
9775,Lynette,"uh, right, yeah. i'm going to be right there."
12837,Lynette,"yeah, i do."
11396,Lynette,love you!
11631,Lynette,"well, daddy probably didn't notice that i was unloading twenty-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them, so mommy didn't exactly have time to sit around and chew the fat."
12884,Lynette,home. tell me how the party i threw for you turns out.
13302,Lynette,"oh, yeah.i'll bite you good."
12508,Lynette,i see women really responding to that.
11183,Lynette,"mr. gaunt? hi, i'm lynette scavo. my husband is opening the pizzeria right down the block--"
11499,Lynette,"oh, great. now we know she's watching us."
12199,Lynette,"hey, guys, would you go play in the back for a while? i need to talk to your dad. thanks."
12599,Lynette,okay. bye.
13247,Lynette,so i was thinking this whole going back to school thing deserves a little celebration.
10308,Lynette,that's ridiculous.
12995,Lynette,y-you don't know?
8800,Lynette,it's a frat party.
9919,Lynette,is that true? did they beat you up?
12523,Lynette,"well, it's really my husband's. and i'm still doing some freelance stuff."
10949,Lynette,"nora, please!"
12088,Lynette,hi!
8894,Lynette,umgophers.
9988,Lynette,why? are you worried they might get in?
12013,Lynette,"oh, my god. it's the police?"
12807,Lynette,i'll sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant.
11084,Lynette,wow. what is all this?
10307,Lynette,what?
12785,Lynette,"porter, listen to me. bob talked to the judge. he thinks he can get them to drop the charges."
9896,Lynette,"yeah, well, i haven't bought a new suit in six years."
10318,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you not get how big that is?do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
11369,Lynette,this isn't about the shirt anymore. this is about us working together. every day it's a battle. it's hurting our marriage. you know what? i'll just tell tom i need to step back.
9090,Lynette,"so, how are things with you and rex?"
10334,Lynette,"oh. well,you don't have to bribe me.we're all friends here."
11621,Lynette,hey.
10956,Lynette,"okay, i'm listening."
10782,Lynette,"well, think about it, okay? cause whatever you wanna do, i'm in your corner."
9499,Lynette,"no i can't. i'm sorry, but i have a lot of things to do."
11307,Lynette,"hi. i need to rent fifty chairs by tonight at five o'clock. what? why not? what do you mean, it's bar mitzvah season? there's no such thing. you still have five. i will take those. scavo."
10665,Lynette,and?
11329,Lynette,"well, you didn't have to plan anything, but you did, even though we had an agreement. you like ties? you're getting a tie."
13270,Lynette,i went to the doctor today.
8904,Lynette,they won't make it to their later years if i have to spend all day with them.
10415,Lynette,i don't know why i have to get dragged into this.what happened with my kids has nothing to do with bree's situation with andrew.sit.
10368,Lynette,"ah,yeah--"
10525,Lynette,what? yesterday you were up in arms.now you're ready to cave?
12623,Lynette,i want you to call that woman and tell her you are never seeing her again.
11104,Lynette,of course you did.
10398,Lynette,ouch.
9695,Lynette,"um, i got to do a broader range of campaigns."
11815,Lynette,"""kick-ass chronic""? uh-huh. you're a grandmother. shouldn't you be off somewhere knitting an afghan?"
12990,Lynette,congratulations. you're now dating a lesbian.
13054,Lynette,"well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything."
12085,Lynette,"why can't we hear them? if my kids are alive, they would be yelling. tom would be yelling."
11434,Lynette,"i swear, i will be there in one second."
13097,Lynette,"yeah, 'cause he hasn't suffered enough."
9321,Lynette,really?
12585,Lynette,"well, it's just--i saw you two together, and i--i didn't know that you were-- and she looks so--for god sakes, tom, the woman has to be somewhere. just sign the damn lease."
12875,Lynette,you want to explain this?
9275,Lynette,the boys have something they'd like to say to you.
10393,Lynette,"oh,wow,he's such a big boy."
9543,Lynette,"look, you're basically a predator and i need your advice."
12820,Lynette,you did not just say that.
12423,Lynette,"actually, it's 32."
11895,Lynette,"see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer. you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles."
12112,Lynette,"well, here's the thing. i called the general manager to ask if we could scatter the ashes here, and he said absolutely not."
9157,Lynette,"i hope someday, you have lots of children."
8715,Lynette,"that's right, get over here. go, go, go, ugh. move it. out. get out."
11395,Lynette,"at some point, tom's gonna ask you to look for this. you will not find it."
11178,Lynette,"well,then why isn't he dealing with it instead of shopping for napkins?we could lose our shirts in this dump!"
11425,Lynette,it was so awful tonight.
10750,Lynette,"hitch?you mean, like, we're going to be driving in the car together?"
12019,Lynette,"yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?"
8806,Lynette,"well, if the food's late, god help you."
9520,Lynette,i'll see you tomorrow morning.
11145,Lynette,okay. you go--
9257,Lynette,"hey, what do you think you are doing? get out of here."
12500,Lynette,i'm sorry. what?
12102,Lynette,at about the rest of these boxes?
9429,Lynette,why?
9824,Lynette,maybe i can change my work schedule. try to get some flex time.
11743,Lynette,he's gonna be watching for me all day.he's one of the leads.
12077,Lynette,karen! you gotta get inside now!
10222,Lynette,"you want the truth, tom?i think you're good.you have moments of brilliance.but i also think sometimes you coast.and i think if i were your boss and had to ride your ass every day,you would come home seething with resentment.come on! it's hard enough keeping a marriage together."
11814,Lynette,yeah.
12180,Lynette,"well, i-- i've got some work to do."
10456,Lynette,"parker,i'm your mother.mothers don't lie to their sons.now go wash your hands or santa's not gonna bring you anything for christmas."
10569,Lynette,"whoa. that's weird kind of feedback.you know?physics can be spooky that way.listen, i gotta go.i gotta go.ed is talking to me,and, um,i'll call you back later?"
10592,Lynette,he broke his arm.they took him up to x-ray.
10670,Lynette,hello.
12481,Lynette,you could break your dad's guitar and--
11958,Lynette,shh! do you hear that? he's making his move.
11902,Lynette,my kids' tree house. can you promise you'll leave it alone?
11124,Lynette,eat your tacos.
9286,Lynette,"honestly, i don't think mike did it either, but if we don't call, we're guilty of withholding evidence."
13279,Lynette,"okay. so, now that i'm going to do some, heavy lifting, i believe i have a right to talk about the changes made to the script?"
10953,Lynette,"okay, i gotta keep the pressure up to stop the bleeding!"
11025,Lynette,he's a single man with a basement full of toys!
9741,Lynette,"oh, i'm so sorry. is she gonna be okay?"
11341,Lynette,knock yourself out.
10825,Lynette,this is all my fault. why punish parker?
10971,Lynette,"i thought they were little young to deal with their mother getting shot. all i told them is kayla is staying with her grandmother, and i made up a story about how i got hurt."
11574,Lynette,okay.
9492,Lynette,"oh, mrs mcclusky, you don't have to."
13094,Lynette,you're in a garden club?
12735,Lynette,what do you mean?
11646,Lynette,"no, no."
9080,Lynette,"fine, fine. be three-foot-eight the rest of your life. see if i care. good luck finding girlfriends!"
11484,Lynette,"what? yeah, sometimes. why?"
9917,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, porter, preston, knock it off. all right, did you hear me, i said stop it. stand up. stand up! come here!"
12058,Lynette,yeah. mm.
9391,Lynette,oh.
11777,Lynette,thank you.
13204,Lynette,really? poor bruce.
10830,Lynette,two bribery scandals. gotta count the batting helmets.
10841,Lynette,"whatever you wanna do,i'm in your corner."
13076,Lynette,less yakkin' more draggin'.
13208,Lynette,"well, like you said, it's your face. come on, i'm dying for you to meet bruce."
11149,Lynette,"well, you could tuck me in."
11552,Lynette,"well, edie hired me to cater, so it's just business. i don't know what her excuse is."
10857,Lynette,"hey, parker, be careful up there.i just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea."
11393,Lynette,that is a great idea!
12396,Lynette,"and obviously i am not getting through to the twins, because no matter what i say, they keep pulling this crap, and i am sick of it."
12921,Lynette,"so? take another one. what's the difference? well, since i'm the only one here who c wait on that table without knocking over a glass with my pants, how about i take it? you handle the cash register. you bus tables. go on."
10016,Lynette,you fired stu?
12388,Lynette,"oh, yeah? why didn't you play at home? why did you have to sneak in here?"
12047,Lynette,you can't be serious.
8887,Lynette,"yes, yes, come on!"
13130,Lynette,cause it's patty rizzo. she's a total slut. you should be on antibiotics just for sitting in her car.
13088,Lynette,strong.
12059,Lynette,"hey, we're here!"
11521,Lynette,"well, i'm really busy at the restaurant. believe me, i come home to daddy just as soon as i can."
10244,Lynette,"yeah, something about the applewhites.i'm dying of curiosity."
13117,Lynette,"hey, carlos, quick question for ya. last thing i remember, i was in the shower, naked, reaching for the soap. then i was here on the bed, under a blanket--still naked. and my question is, how did i get from there to here?"
11985,Lynette,give me that.
11404,Lynette,how old do you think i am?
10509,Lynette,what?!
11128,Lynette,"no. first, she ripped off its arms, stuffed it with chili. then she threw it in the trash."
9133,Lynette,"so, claire, when did this incident occur?"
13176,Lynette,"i thought you wanted to do this, to take a break and stay home."
9611,Lynette,"you told me duggan's coming back to work today, i thought i'd do something special for him."
10950,Lynette,i'm sorry. i'm sorry. we'll-- we'll be quiet.
9328,Lynette,head lice.
12777,Lynette,"no, no. we have this great lawyer. he thinks he can get the case thrown out."
12141,Lynette,it'll just take a sec.
9441,Lynette,"yes, thank you. i know what she just said."
10389,Lynette,"okay,so who's gonna tell her?"
9848,Lynette,"don't be ridiculous. could we get a trough of these, please?"
9431,Lynette,i'm sorry but i can't understand you. you're gonna have to talk slower.
8833,Lynette,what if we separate the twins? put them in different classes? they're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.
12706,Lynette,what's going on? is there news?
10837,Lynette,"don't you dare! you are gonna chase your dream, and i am gonna support you 99 % of the time."
11443,Lynette,he has a history--using cocaine.
11677,Lynette,i know her plane landed on time. she'll probably be here any second.
11926,Lynette,"it's up to you, hon."
10796,Lynette,"easy hours, big paycheck, access to great parties--yeah, what was i thinking?"
12373,Lynette,it's your ice sculpture.
11924,Lynette,have i got your vote?
11672,Lynette,that's me. i'll be back.
9386,Lynette,"i'm going to tell the truth to every mother out there, and then i'm gonna take back the bongos."
12855,Lynette,it would. but i can't. i wouldn't want it to affect our friendship.
11412,Lynette,"you know how stressful it is working in a four-star restaurant, and he, like many chefs, started using cocaine just to stay ahead--"
9981,Lynette,'cause i've got an important assignment for you.
12539,Lynette,"fine. and don't worry. even though i'd like to, i'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene."
11386,Lynette,"yeah, but don't worry. i am gonna find you the assistant manager of your dreams."
12025,Lynette,why? mom cheated on you. no one blames you for leaving.
11995,Lynette,i don't have any room for her. i already have seven people in four bedrooms.
10182,Lynette,"oh,please."
10249,Lynette,go.
10572,Lynette,i can't. i can't.i'm sorry. i just can't.
11889,Lynette,"hey, guys, i got your snack. what you playing?"
10909,Lynette,"oh, stop right there. i am the one who should apologize. i have been a bad wife."
9958,Lynette,you should hold onto that stuff for a while.
9657,Lynette,hey!
12913,Lynette,thanks. and do you have the calzones for table three?
9160,Lynette,"you see this gum? if you promise to be quiet while i am downstairs playing cards, it's all yours. deal?"
11096,Lynette,"wait, wait! art, wait, i'm sorry--i'm sorry."
9207,Lynette,"in the future, checklist means 'is it in the car' not like, 'do you remember', okay?"
11983,Lynette,nobody is manipulating you.
11182,Lynette,my husband is in trouble. i love him. shouldn't i want to help him?
11102,Lynette,i will love her like she is my own.
13229,Lynette,"if you're really stopping by there, bring home some onion rings."
11175,Lynette,what?
10676,Lynette,"okay, now, move it.i've got ten bucks here for the kid who can carry the most stuff. okay?"
12629,Lynette,"oh, please! you would never do that."
12892,Lynette,"tom? come here. we haven't had a customer in about a half an hour, so maybe we should just--close up early."
9434,Lynette,i didn't mean that you--
9639,Lynette,"tom, what are you doing?"
10314,Lynette,"well,i mean,i just don't understand how porter and preston managed to wrangle her into the stroller and then make it out your front door without you even noticing.i guess if you'd fallen asleep--it could've happened like that,i-i guess."
11708,Lynette,"aw, i think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you. when's your due date?"
9595,Lynette,because she now comes to our house everyday to remind you of what i'm not.
11583,Lynette,yeah. i think firing him would be a huge mistake.
12476,Lynette,"okay, i need to dial you in to some gigs you already have, which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father. and i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family."
9660,Lynette,"oh, i have a thousand things to do before that. borrow a decent scarf from bree, buy a lipstick i don't hate."
13170,Lynette,"oh, would you stop with the book? you bought it at a car wash along with a pack of gum and an air freshener."
9940,Lynette,okay.
12949,Lynette,"bye-bye, high road."
12280,Lynette,there are so many opportunities that you could look and see what's going on. i am not!
9721,Lynette,"you know, for the sake of our marriage, please don't mention the system again."
12802,Lynette,"no, you don't have to do that."
11520,Lynette,oh. okay.
9784,Lynette,yes!
12634,Lynette,"hey, breakfast's on the table. porter, this whole hating me thing that you've got going on right now--believe it or not, i get where you're coming from."
10466,Lynette,that is ridiculous.
10462,Lynette,no.
11873,Lynette,"well, penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist."
13180,Lynette,"well, think inside. i made porkchops."
9778,Lynette,"damn. i forgot my prospectus. any extra copies? no? oh, i'll be right back."
9653,Lynette,"tom, that's--crazy."
10675,Lynette,"no, i think she'll be over here in ten minutes."
12876,Lynette,we use that parmesan all the time. you can't go changing things without asking me.
10230,Lynette,uh-huh. and how long did you stay?
10886,Lynette,"well, that sort of depends on daddy."
10772,Lynette,i'm sorry i said that about tom. he's doing his best to find a job.
10074,Lynette,"you're welcome. you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife. and, fran, i know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head. you can take a break and be a great mom. doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?"
12347,Lynette,"yeah. which says ""kick my ass"" less--""may"" or ""nerd""?"
9672,Lynette,i was a stay-at-home mom. i wish it had taken time off.
11575,Lynette,"i just talked to mrs.mccluskey, and she is gonna start looking after our kids again."
9607,Lynette,no.
9918,Lynette,i'm so sorry. did my sons beat you up?
8724,Lynette,"well, to be honest--"
11140,Lynette,"hey,whoa!whoa,whoa,whoa!okay. what the hell are you doing?! stop, stop! stop screaming! stop!"
8702,Lynette,let's get this over with.
12873,Lynette,"hey, can i borrow you a sec?"
12139,Lynette,right.
12219,Lynette,"no, no. of course not. it's just, if the police came here to ask us about the brick, they're probably gonna ask us about the fire, so you might wanna be ready."
9573,Lynette,we haven't had sex in ten days. and the longest we've ever gone before is nine.
12132,Lynette,"ah, it's just--we've been through a lot lately, and we have a lot to be thankful for. don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?"
10719,Lynette,you know what's really bad luck? marrying a wife killer.
10391,Lynette,"okay. but for the record,the team is made up of wimps."
9753,Lynette,you killed it?
11769,Lynette,"oh, my god. are you letting me win?"
13041,Lynette,i thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
10026,Lynette,"and that wasn't right of her. she shouldn't have been having sex with you. she's upper management. technically, it's sexual harassment."
10740,Lynette,thanks.
9445,Lynette,"yeah, a lot of good it did her."
11366,Lynette,i told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen.
9546,Lynette,i'm listening.
8848,Lynette,"paul, i'm so sorry."
12082,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! tom! help me! help me, tom!"
9835,Lynette,"no, can't say that i have."
12407,Lynette,"you do! this is tom, former high school nerd, living viciously through his awesome-ass kids."
9473,Lynette,"preston, don't listen to them. back away from the toilet and no one gets hurt."
11699,Lynette,"no! tom, you didn't ask my mother?!"
13295,Lynette,"well, these are trained technicians and i've got a roast in the-freezer."
12241,Lynette,"yes, of course."
10480,Lynette,"thanks, jer."
12527,Lynette,yeah.
11316,Lynette,"i think what my husband is trying to say is, if you really want to test a marriage, open a restaurant together. anyway, thank you for coming. eat a lot and come back, 'cause our kids need braces."
11106,Lynette,"well, nicer than that, or she's gonna get all your toys, too."
13276,Lynette,"no, tom. we're having twins--again."
12894,Lynette,"so now we have pretend customers? gee, let's think of something to do with all the pretend money we're gonna make."
11090,Lynette,"yep. go ahead, say it. i know you want to."
9108,Lynette,huh.
13209,Lynette,"bruce, i want you to meet my husband tom. tom, this is bruce."
13169,Lynette,"tom, you're being completely irrational. we've had sex 23 days straight. i've seen more ceiling than michelangelo."
8834,Lynette,are you sure? he's gonna freak.
9167,Lynette,yeah.
10372,Lynette,okay.
11132,Lynette,"i know, i know. i know."
8772,Lynette,"i-i-i didn't abandon them, i came back!"
13293,Lynette,"parker, i swear i will spank you, knock it off."
12561,Lynette,"the kids know everything's fine. they send their love. don't worry about anything, okay? just rest. i'll come back soon, okay?"
13058,Lynette,hey.
12733,Lynette,"bob, we're so sorry. we meant to tell you. we really did."
13093,Lynette,"so who can come by later and check on him? i'd do it, but i'm working late."
11082,Lynette,"oh, i'm not taking sides."
10537,Lynette,that doesn't make any sense.there's gotta be some kind of an explanation for this.
12173,Lynette,meh.
12816,Lynette,"i had it in the back of my mind for a while, and then yesterday, i got a ph--"
12945,Lynette,thank you. this will really cheer tom up.
13063,Lynette,it's fine.
11644,Lynette,"okay, okay. give it up, tom."
11400,Lynette,my fault for asking.
9991,Lynette,"and we integrated the corporate logo into the jungle background creating not only an ad for the clothing, but for the company, itself."
12032,Lynette,handle what?
11293,Lynette,"i know. i'm the one that put in the order. i will handle anything that needs to be done. and you, take these and get some sleep."
10121,Lynette,hey.um--i hope it's okay.carlos let me in.
10421,Lynette,"yeah,you think so?why don't you come over here for a second?i'd like to pick your brain.you're the demographic that my client is interested in,so you'd actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours,and tell me what you thought.do you mind?"
12489,Lynette,we can't accept this.
10031,Lynette,yeah.
10811,Lynette,"absolutely. if he's cheating, he could bring home a disease."
10023,Lynette,"see, i don't think that's why you got fired."
9109,Lynette,bye.
10111,Lynette,"maybe.yes.but gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.that's not right,either."
12663,Lynette,"well, i was right there, detective. my son said no such thing."
11899,Lynette,"after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?"
9888,Lynette,another suit. i have other suits.
10506,Lynette,you're getting divorced?
9599,Lynette,you should go. you don't want to keep annabel waiting.
9806,Lynette,i'm looking for parker's umbrella. have you seen it?
11563,Lynette,"so--what--well, how did you get here? i mean, you're not supposed to--drive."
12973,Lynette,i-- ugh!
12382,Lynette,what the hell is going on?!
12842,Lynette,"hey you go, walter. she's all yours."
12653,Lynette,"no. so if you see him, please tell me."
10032,Lynette,i am?
12330,Lynette,"again, i know i crossed the line, and i am so sorry."
13031,Lynette,"okay, it's true. i used you to get more money, but you used me first."
12361,Lynette,"bree, you can talk katherine up all you want, but she is just never gonna be one of us."
9566,Lynette,it's too late. you said it.
9911,Lynette,and you know what else? i kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit.
9670,Lynette,hi. what are you doing out here?
8737,Lynette,ooh!
11663,Lynette,you didn't make him quit! i fired him!
12962,Lynette,"you can have mine. stop saying, ""i don't know."""
12243,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, i am so sorry. i bet that really scared you, didn't it?"
9196,Lynette,"you can do this, all right? just, just scootch down a few inches, and i'll grab you."
10869,Lynette,"start small, have an italian theme,create some cash flow, and then later on,expand into the pizza thing."
9283,Lynette,i don't know.
11988,Lynette,"oh, yeah. where is that waiter? i'm gonna go find him."
8923,Lynette,might i suggest the barcliffe academy production of little red riding hood?
10058,Lynette,i work because my family needs me to.
9889,Lynette,"no, actually, i have quite a few others. uh, the blue one, and uh--"
9828,Lynette,hi.
12432,Lynette,"your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at school, and all you have to say is, ""i guess""?"
12887,Lynette,a check for the damage to your car. i can't afford to go through my insurance company.
11884,Lynette,"oh--my god. i haven't, have i? i am one of those--whiny, self-involved sick people."
8935,Lynette,i'll finish the costumes.
9716,Lynette,i think i'm asking you to clean the house.
10900,Lynette,"oh, god, here she goes again. what grade is he in?"
12832,Lynette,"oh, mr. swenson, i can't tell you how excited i am. maybe you could schedule a staff meeting so i could hit the ground running on monday. no, no. no, it can't be friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start next week? so again, thank you so much for this opportunity."
10339,Lynette,"oh,good.parker,don't put your elbows on the table. come on."
11514,Lynette,"what do you mean, we?"
11886,Lynette,will you stop being so heroic?! i'm a cancer bi*ch! what?
11875,Lynette,"brandy's history, tom. let her go."
8924,Lynette,"sure, they get to play oak trees. i'm the one who has to deal with all the drama behind the scenes."
10459,Lynette,i'm home.
11491,Lynette,thanks.
11144,Lynette,"well, you gotta hand it to her. just when you think bree's thrown every conceivable theme party she hosts a ""shame on you for thinking my husband killed someone"" dinner."
11382,Lynette,"hey, andrew. ah, thanks. he's gonna be okay. no. no, absolutely not. we will open tonight as usual. hey, it's gonna be fine, andrew. i will take care of it. it's my job now. okay. see you soon. bye."
11117,Lynette,"oh, sorry, sweetheart. he's working late, trying to get the restaurant ready. oh, lovely, parker. go wash your hands. go on."
10562,Lynette,hello?
8884,Lynette,you're going to have some fun today.
10009,Lynette,"no more belittling, berating, rude sarcasm."
13197,Lynette,"tom, men don't need plastic surgery. they look better as they age."
13300,Lynette,hi.
13128,Lynette,what little friendship?
9550,Lynette,i'm good. looks like we're got some company.
12803,Lynette,"all right, time for my luck to change. this hand is for eli. hmm, next hand is for eli."
12133,Lynette,tom--i'm serious.
10474,Lynette,well-- it turns out we really needed one.you can go and play.
13003,Lynette,"well, if i was dumb enough to answer that, i never would've gotten into northwestern."
10467,Lynette,"no,i'm not gonna shame my son."
11207,Lynette,"i don't have to. you're always giving it to me, inspiring me. remember the mouthwash jingle? you came up with the hook. and--and what about the bartlett campaign? would i have ever come up with tango-dancing fleas? all you. there's nothing that i have accomplished that i could have done without your help."
12586,Lynette,hi. what's that for?
9057,Lynette,"oh, yes."
9837,Lynette,"i don't know. it could be a little boy in, uh, england named spencer."
10973,Lynette,"hello. oh, this side. hi!"
9418,Lynette,that was fun. you play really well.
11845,Lynette,you remembered.
10599,Lynette,uhh!
11215,Lynette,"oh. well, that's good to know. when you think about it, me going back to work is not that big a deal. we're only losing a little time together in the afternoon."
11733,Lynette,"look,i can deal with the chemo.i can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.but what i cannot deal with is the pity,so we are doing it my way."
10703,Lynette,what's wrong?
9740,Lynette,"well, i'm very sorry for your loss, too, phyllis."
12113,Lynette,"hey, you've abetted. might as well aid."
11978,Lynette,what do you mean? i thought you were living with lucy.
9665,Lynette,"uh, no. i can't. you're very, so--"
13144,Lynette,we'll--double up tomorrow.
10265,Lynette,i'm calling you out.
12493,Lynette,"i'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible. yeah, i think i know."
12590,Lynette,hum.
13222,Lynette,"oh? well, good luck paying for it, because if you so much as apply for a passport, we're cuttin' you off."
11333,Lynette,"oh, i couldn't relax. i just kept replaying the fight i had with tom in my head."
12366,Lynette,"fine. you can be as angry and sulky and pissy as you want, just so long as you're here tomorrow, helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas."
11016,Lynette,he really did. that's why you don't have to worry. that's protector man's job. your job is to run and play and have fun. okay?
10488,Lynette,"well, we do the best we can given the circumstances."
12869,Lynette,"oh, no. it's fine. we use it all the time."
9770,Lynette,okay. good point. and i'm sorry about your hair. i can see why you're upset.
13157,Lynette,oh. didn't we already do it tonight?
12338,Lynette,have a seat. i'll be with you in a second.
10948,Lynette,shh! she told us not to talk.
9760,Lynette,"actually, your dad's gonna take you to school on your first day."
13267,Lynette,"so it is the cancer. oh, god, i can't go through this again!"
9761,Lynette,"yeah, well, honey, i have to work. mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady and if i miss work, i'll lose my job and then we won't have any money to buy food. honey, you gotta believe me, if i could be there, you know that i would."
13059,Lynette,"eh, same."
10002,Lynette,edie! i am sure susan's father will like her just fine.
13060,Lynette,thanks. i'll watch it during chemo if i'm not too tired.
9432,Lynette,"well, yeah!"
8986,Lynette,"oh, you know what would be even better? dry cleaning bags."
11511,Lynette,i know. i'm a horrible person. i just chose ravioli over motherhood. i should--i should go home.
8773,Lynette,"well, my kids aren't normal, and now i don't have time for this, lady, so. boys! get out here."
10201,Lynette,they're calling me in for a meeting.i gotta go. love you. bye!
11576,Lynette,yeah.
10822,Lynette,"i just figured, since you're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is, you might wanna make a few bucks in the meantime. i have a dream, too. it includes keeping this house."
10213,Lynette,i'm not saying that.
11345,Lynette,"oh, crap. i left it at home again."
10360,Lynette,i'm sorry.i'm not following.
10884,Lynette,my mistake. i assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.
12387,Lynette,what the hell's going on here?
10649,Lynette,"all right, let's do this.i'm just going to check the focus."
11999,Lynette,"okay, but the point is, she went."
12917,Lynette,yeah?
10501,Lynette,"no,ed,i'm not doing this for you!"
12901,Lynette,i know.
10974,Lynette,yeah--
9145,Lynette,you and i have had crushes before. we always tell each other. we laugh about it. it's no big deal. what worries me about this is you're denying you're obviously attracted. why?
10274,Lynette,"uh,not that i know of. why?"
10163,Lynette,we're not having any more kids.why would it matter?
12285,Lynette,okay. all right.
10865,Lynette,"i don't know if you noticed,but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept--i was a wee bit skeptical."
11818,Lynette,"yeah, about that-- i don't think i'm gonna make it."
12649,Lynette,oh! she's asleep. she's fine.
11387,Lynette,"yeah, i know, i know. bottom of the barrel, convicts and losers. you were clear about that last night."
9650,Lynette,what does that mean?
9613,Lynette,"tom, i don't care about you working with annabel. i told you that. this is for duggan. he had a heart attack. i don't care about annabel."
12963,Lynette,"yes, like the greatest city in the world."
9765,Lynette,"hey, nina."
12877,Lynette,"well, they probably would have loved my pizza, too, but we'll never know, because my partner threw it in the garbage. what a waste."
11092,Lynette,"excuse me, can you tell me what happened?"""
13299,Lynette,"okay, great. like your dad said, it's time for bed."
11948,Lynette,bree.
11596,Lynette,yeah. that helps.
12236,Lynette,okay.
10879,Lynette,"well, i just don't. tom, you know how i feel about this pizza thing."
12989,Lynette,"she's your boss? let her kiss you again, then sue her."
11568,Lynette,but--i'm sorry. you could still go.
11417,Lynette,"fine. i'll, uh, keep looking."
13282,Lynette,why didn't you ever tell me this?
8938,Lynette,"you're not human, are you? you were sent by aliens to make the human race feel inadequate."
10843,Lynette,hi. yes-- i am. what is all this?
11900,Lynette,i mean-- you're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
11698,Lynette,"what, someone loaned us ten thousand dollars?"
13234,Lynette,"good. good. i knew if you saw the campus, you'd have a change of heart."
10432,Lynette,"no,i don't hold her responsible.bree van de kamp and i have known each other a long time.i trust her completely.she's a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.she puts the rest of us to shame."
11381,Lynette,"yeah, it is."
11171,Lynette,"yeah,i-i know.and hey,don't tell him i stopped by.i'm not supposed to be here.i just wanted to sneak a peek."
10090,Lynette,"oh, cool. listen,i just wanted you to know i appreciated you backing me up last night,you know,with the kiss thing."
12101,Lynette,"well, we'd do anything for your aunt. i hope you know what an amazing woman she was."
11304,Lynette,"animatronic rats. where do they find you people? okay, okay, here it is. see? i ordered fifty of item number seven three--"
9168,Lynette,that's so sweet.
9117,Lynette,she's bringing him home from the hospital today.
12744,Lynette,"porter, it's mom. where are you?! porter!"
12978,Lynette,"well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, tom? i was sort of sugarcoating it when i said his restaurant was very successful. the truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground."
9397,Lynette,you're a better woman than me. i would have ripped that open with my teeth. aren't you dying to know what he wrote?
11820,Lynette,"tom, hair loss and constant nausea-- those are inconveniences. losing at charades to susan meyer--that is just flat-out intolerable."
12758,Lynette,"we can get a restraining order to protect you, and bob thinks there's a good shot at getting the case dismissed."
11272,Lynette,hey! you hired him back? did he tell you he was stoned on the job?
13271,Lynette,i'm pregnant.
10362,Lynette,ew.
12000,Lynette,"okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly. but she gave birth to us. we owe her our lives, and now that she needs us, we can't just turn our back on her."
12063,Lynette,yeah. he'd be very safe. we could put him in a closet.
10160,Lynette,"oh,it's just chicken pox.but brave heart here will only come in to sleep and shower."
8793,Lynette,i already got a sitter.
10381,Lynette,i have absolutely no idea.let's go hammer out the details.
12456,Lynette,calm down. i'm gonna break it off in an e-mail.
10891,Lynette,"hey, you."
8975,Lynette,"i'm not going to forget about this, jordana."
12768,Lynette,what?
11922,Lynette,"pay for a fence you don't even want. that's not how you make good neighbors, and i don't care if--"
10427,Lynette,"um--actually,yeah.one of the perks.even so,it's a little out of the price range of a high school student."
12200,Lynette,"and you made me lie to them, too, which brings up another question. did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?"
12332,Lynette,"well, kayla loves waffles, and since she and i have been having some problems lately, i wanted to do something nice for her. oh, you tell kayla her breakfast is ready."
12975,Lynette,"oh, you were. you were the best person who ever worked for me. i used to be his boss."
11826,Lynette,ya ha i'm sorry. i didn't mean to--okay.
11303,Lynette,give me that.
9689,Lynette,"great. listen, uh--"
9475,Lynette,i will walk you over to mrs van der camp's and we all know what happens when she gets mad.
11437,Lynette,"look, i think you're great, and we would be lucky to have you. it's just, my husband isn't really comfortable--"
10680,Lynette,"oh, crap!"
9726,Lynette,why are you yelling at me?
12714,Lynette,what am i supposed to do? where am i gonna get that bail money?
9600,Lynette,hey.
13090,Lynette,"go ahead, susan. what are your four words for edie?"
12054,Lynette,we can be quiet--relative to the storm.
11462,Lynette,"it's delicious, huh?"
8707,Lynette,"ow! ease up, you little vampire."
10584,Lynette,"well, don't encourage him."
13046,Lynette,"hey, i got you sodas, didn't i? and i let you feed the paper shredder."
12614,Lynette,"yeah, at this point, i think i'm gonna need a little bit more than that."
10472,Lynette,because it's not.
9497,Lynette,"um, mrs mcclusky, thank you, that is very nice."
9278,Lynette,um--
12957,Lynette,hi.
10846,Lynette,"oh, my god! you know what you wanna do! that's fantastic! what is it?"
11822,Lynette,this really is delicious.
10218,Lynette,i know! i know! i know.so who's up next?
10392,Lynette,"hey,veronica.hi,donovan!my,he's getting big.how old is he?"
10130,Lynette,"okay,let's test that theory."
12176,Lynette,"oh, my god. rick."
9878,Lynette,"chuck, i'm gonna stop you right there."
10585,Lynette,"guys?could you come here for a second?we need to have a serious talk. okay, we have had a great-- vacation, but tomorrow we're going home, except we're not going to our home. we're gonna go stay with grandma."
10455,Lynette,"oh,that's not important."
10997,Lynette,"well, because she's--"
8774,Lynette,oh. get in the car.
9870,Lynette,you're gonna take me off kamarov because i won't go drinking with you?
9624,Lynette,"well, as happy as i am to see you, i actually have an agenda. i ran into someone last week who said you guys were looking to hire. is that true?"
11071,Lynette,"sorry, i can't talk now. i have somewhere to go."
11915,Lynette,"see, that's awkward for me. this is about personal freedom. you know? i'm running as a libertarian."
10963,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
10166,Lynette,i can't believe you've actually thought about this!
11301,Lynette,yes.
11214,Lynette,come on. you and your brothers will be thrilled. don't you get tired of me yelling at you to clean up your room and finish your homework?
12575,Lynette,how about the crazy married couple throwing drinks? how are they gonna be?
12178,Lynette,"hey, tom. look who's here--rick."
11482,Lynette,don't you have any friends to hang out with?
8841,Lynette,"thank you. that's the nicest way you could have said that. you know, the truth is, when they're not making me want to pull my hair out they're really, really sweet. i'm afraid that if i change the bad stuff, i'm going to change the good stuff."
12959,Lynette,"well, tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome profit. so he's waiting for the right opportunity. you might have to do a little selling here, bruce."
13141,Lynette,"hey, honey. how's your day going?"
9693,Lynette,thank you.
11933,Lynette,"oh, look, it's our new queen-- katherine of arrogant. hey, where's the wrecking ball?"
10824,Lynette,huh?
12215,Lynette,you go alone?
12540,Lynette,hey.
8888,Lynette,i can still see your heads. the pool's not deep enough.
9642,Lynette,could you talk to me for a second? i don't understand.
12654,Lynette,thanks.
12834,Lynette,could you hold on a second?
10350,Lynette,what?
9075,Lynette,i've got a nanny--
11987,Lynette,okay. okay. okay. good for you. i'm sorry.
11585,Lynette,probably.we got a big party coming in at ten. so--mm-hmm. i'll just see you in the morning.
9083,Lynette,you have my cell phone number. you call me if you need anything.
13273,Lynette,"well, apparently, not old enough."
10855,Lynette,"i know, but i said that i would support him and help him follow his dream."
11717,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life. you didn't care about that, though, did you? you just drove him away."
11296,Lynette,"well, i'm so glad she has you to take care of her, and of course your mom comes first, andrew. and i wouldn't even ask except, you know, we're opening tonight--"
8850,Lynette,yeah.
9046,Lynette,so i can poach me one.
9987,Lynette,maybe.
12067,Lynette,knock yourself out.
11100,Lynette,you can't stay here.
12750,Lynette,"i can handle warren schilling. but if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
10985,Lynette,i'm gonna make you a cake.
11718,Lynette,no i don't.
12385,Lynette,"again? i am so sorry, officer. we have talked to porter till we're blue in the face. it's like he's determined to go back to juvenile hall."
11508,Lynette,"ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?"
9254,Lynette,do you know what physiological warfare means?
12103,Lynette,"um, well, there's a great diner right near granville field."
11268,Lynette,austin!
11667,Lynette,"well, i feel just fine now."
11965,Lynette,no. this is about the baby.
11649,Lynette,"look, even if gaby is in the wrong here--and she--she is hugely, hideously wrong--do you really want to boycott her wedding?"
9905,Lynette,i don't follow you.
12334,Lynette,"uh, one second. preston, you might wanna stop dropping your waffle on the floor, cause i'm still gonna make you eat it. so, uh, what's c.p.s.?"
10100,Lynette,guess what? ed loved the pitch.i got off early!
9259,Lynette,"are you sure you didn't misplace it? you're getting up there in years, no offense, but you probably forget where you put things."
13163,Lynette,"oh, okay. uh, coffee will be fine."
13044,Lynette,"okay, yes, carlos and i spoke briefly, but i thought he blew me off."
11671,Lynette,don't do this.
12224,Lynette,"andrew, do something! do something! stop it! stop! oh, for god sakes, what is the matter with you? what are you, 12 years old? stop it. jeez."
12717,Lynette,shut up!
12951,Lynette,what are you doing?
10288,Lynette,yes.
10631,Lynette,"if she takes you to court, we'll lose and end up paying 11 years of child support all at once. we could lose the house."
12866,Lynette,right. glad i thought of it.
10335,Lynette,oh! uh-- i guess.
13259,Lynette,what's going on?
12340,Lynette,wait. they could take my children?
10477,Lynette,that would explain all our working hours.
12725,Lynette,what the hell is going on? where's porter?
11277,Lynette,what is--
11136,Lynette,"well, they, you know, wolfed it down like kids are supposed to. so-- hurry it up."
12188,Lynette,"gaby, since when do you come to price warehouse?"
12664,Lynette,absolutely.
12345,Lynette,how did he die? was he beaten to death 'cause his name was maynard?
10348,Lynette,yeah.
9688,Lynette,you!
10651,Lynette,uh.what are you doing there?
10767,Lynette,what happened to your ride?
13038,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss."
9970,Lynette,where's penny?
11715,Lynette,you heard about this from my kids?
13189,Lynette,really?
10204,Lynette,"oh, the pickings are slim.so far none of my top choices are available.hey, um, do you have someone from your old company that you could, you know,maybe recommend?"
12327,Lynette,my gosh! that is so sweet. thank you so much.
8727,Lynette,"hey, yeah!"
10311,Lynette,"hi.you,um,you recovered from all of yesterday's excitement?"
12883,Lynette,"no, you're the one who's never gonna let me forget it."
8722,Lynette,yeah.
9150,Lynette,parker's getting sniffily.
12336,Lynette,abuse? that's ridiculous.
10798,Lynette,"come on, parker! keep your eye on the ball!"
11165,Lynette,"hey, it's me. you wanna meet for lunch?"
9082,Lynette,"i--don't want to--shock them, by suddenly disappearing. you know? deep down, they're very sensitive."
12515,Lynette,she won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book.
12079,Lynette,"oh! hurry!oh! go! no! come on! come on! come on, come on! get in!"
12808,Lynette,"i wish i could say the same for my uterus. oh, yeah. i ruined the brunch."
10038,Lynette,this is not what i wanted. i just wanted you to be nicer.
9287,Lynette,it was a murder.
10883,Lynette,"okay.okay, here's what we're going to do. you said there were multiple offers, so we can sublease. now let's get the hell out of here."
11804,Lynette,"hello? oh, hey, bree. mm, what's up?"
10065,Lynette,"you're doing the right thing, ed, for little mindy."
9585,Lynette,what?
13245,Lynette,that's your advice hope an opportunity just drops in my lap? might as well start shopping for beekeeper suits.
11876,Lynette,i'm not. whatcha got back there?
11625,Lynette,you sure you're ready?
10939,Lynette,"oh, that's rough. excuse me."
9248,Lynette,boys! get your little fannies inside. guys?
11285,Lynette,"yes, sir. okay, that's enough."
12848,Lynette,it's okay. just keep it under your hat. it's a little embarrassing.
9931,Lynette,"oh, uh--"
11991,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey.no, no, no. you are not leaving those here. hi, mom. take her away."
8749,Lynette,i have a theory.
12190,Lynette,"gaby, people don't come here for the amenities. they come because toilet paper's 3 cents a ton."
13010,Lynette,yeah! how'd you hear about it?
12865,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
9343,Lynette,"it's been one day, and they've been disinvited to a birthday party. if rumors start flying, these boys can kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye."
11435,Lynette,here you go. here you go.
11052,Lynette,hello? open up! open the door!
11903,Lynette,that sounds like a no.
11765,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens. pay attention."
12395,Lynette,"please don't take this the wrong way, but--we love you."
12142,Lynette,"hi. i'm lynette scavo. i'm a friend of bree hodge. and your sermon was lovely, especially the part about the trees."
10764,Lynette,nora! you can't be serious!
10309,Lynette,i've known bree for years and years.there's no way she was drinking while baby-sitting my kids.so--just go spread your poison somewhere else. okay?
10196,Lynette,the talking cows rocked their world.
11321,Lynette,"well, we've been going there for the last seven years. it's not exactly a surprise. anyway, i hope you don't mind, but i canceled."
10812,Lynette,"so if tom was cheating, you wouldn't tell me?"
9517,Lynette,"let me tell you something: half of life is obligations. you don't want to go to your husband's company christmas party, but you do. you don't want to sell candy so your kids' band can play piccolos, but you do. you attend your third cousin's wedding. you pick up the dry cleaning. that's life. its obligation. and you are now my obligation. so tomorrow morning i'll pick you up and take you to the pharmacy."
9260,Lynette,"look, my boys do not break into people's houses. sure, they may have stolen your flower pot, but you know they apologized for that."
11012,Lynette,"but my other son, parker. so. back to the favor."
9290,Lynette,i thought you liked tim doogan.
12260,Lynette,i know. turns out the whole thing was kayla's idea.
9050,Lynette,"you know, i couldn't help but notice how wonderful you are with those children."
9861,Lynette,"you're welcome, but i really need to get home."
11980,Lynette,"ooh, look. the special is chicken. doesn't that sound good?"
9142,Lynette,"nothing. i'm just saying you prefer women that are really curvy, like that sales girl or claire."
12821,Lynette,"tom, i cannot just stay at home wiping noses. i need it for my sanity, and i need you to back me up."
10449,Lynette,"sweetie?um,could you put the crayons down for a second?we need to talk.so i spoke to your teacher today,and she told me about the--cookie deal you made with cindy lou."
11041,Lynette,sorry?
8837,Lynette,they refused? they're six years old.make them.
10223,Lynette,what does that mean?
10614,Lynette,i will stop as soon as you promise.
10262,Lynette,what?
11196,Lynette,"really? well, what if i were to very briefly refresh your memory?"
11560,Lynette,"yeah. um, i told kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up."
8998,Lynette,"nothing, i'm tired."
9240,Lynette,i love you!
12569,Lynette,"oh, don't. i like my mind the way it is."
8996,Lynette,"no, they don't."
9216,Lynette,"well, for starters, you can wipe that disgusting smirk off your face."
9192,Lynette,no! you're not dying! people just think that because i shaved your head.
10757,Lynette,no! you're colorful.colorful in a way that might respond to medication.
8836,Lynette,"hi, i got your message. what's going on?"
11262,Lynette,"you fell for the face. what are you, a rookie?"
12671,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
11993,Lynette,"guys, i can't be any clearer on this. i am not taking her back."
9330,Lynette,"i, um, excuse me."
12531,Lynette,"guys, i am just gonna offer her a little advice. geesh."
13183,Lynette,it's a social networking tool where you send instant updates to anybody who signs up for them.
8710,Lynette,i said you could go by the pool. do you have your swimsuits on??
13182,Lynette,and what'd you say?
12420,Lynette,don't thank me. thank your father.
12258,Lynette,do you have any idea what you've done? someone could have been killed.
11964,Lynette,no.

10228,Lynette,"yeah, gosh, it is.it's quite impressive.oh, wow,i see you worked for bellfore and barrasso.that's a great shop."
12513,Lynette,"look, bree--i think i know a little more about marketing than you do. when i was in it, i owned this town. i had every big account. hell, i was even named businesswoman of the year."

12546,Lynette,"and the rest of the stuff--you'll find a way to fix it. just know that all your friends are very proud of you. bitterly jealous, but proud."
11451,Lynette,"oh, i don't wanna scare them away."
12145,Lynette,"okay, i give you that one. but what about the tornado that just happened? you can't blame man for that."
9580,Lynette,i love you.
13284,Lynette,"all right, hold your water."
12453,Lynette,he may be in love with me.
11315,Lynette,"yes, you did. but i have customers."
9298,Lynette,"hi. so, what's the word on tim?"

12006,Lynette,"yes, hi. i'm looking for my mom. she hangs out at your bar sometimes. stella wingfield? uh, older lady, big smoker, talks like a teamster. well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab. look, if you see her, could you tell her to call lynette? thank you."
9502,Lynette,"here, you should take this back. i don't have a place for it."
10408,Lynette,i heard about that.andrew's asking to be emancipated?
12601,Lynette,you said you were rehearsing.
12399,Lynette,i really appreciate it.
8989,Lynette,"why not? start by targeting the top chain, then branch out from there. boom, boom, boom. mass saturation. oh, and you know what else would be a great idea? here's the thing --"
10551,Lynette,"tom, it would be better for your general well-being if you did not laugh at this moment in time."
11537,Lynette,"hey, guys, go check out the snakes. i'll give you some pizza later, okay?"
10801,Lynette,"yeah, guy's a machine. who is that kid?"
9895,Lynette,"yeah, well, this one was the most expensive. the other ones aren't as nice. but look. look, look, look, look at me, look at me. watch. i don't walk in it. i glide."
10491,Lynette,"okay, well,that wasn't my best work,but you can't deny results.i.m.ing works,and when i go home tonight,tom and i are going to--okay, well,i'm gonna be exhausted,so i'll probably just lay there.but trust ,tom is gonna go to town."
10721,Lynette,all of them? what about jerry? jerry's fun.
12001,Lynette,it's like you're saying you don't care about her. at all? and i don't understand that.

12732,Lynette,"honey, that's porter."

9901,Lynette,"you saw the walk, right? you wanna see the walk again? i'll tutor parker myself."
10496,Lynette,you blocked?
9378,Lynette,i see topher's made a speedy recovery.

9191,Lynette,sure.
12746,Lynette,"but you have been talking to him. what the hell, preston?!"
10870,Lynette,"well, think about it. you're gonna do all these fun parties. people will start talking-- ""hey, this is great food. this guy should open a restaurant."" ""yeah, yeah, i'd eat there,"" and then wham! five short years later, you have a built-in customer base."
12979,Lynette,so dinner--wow.
12221,Lynette,"hey, andrew. what do you need?"
12160,Lynette,bree--
12434,Lynette,no. not really.
10622,Lynette,and you must be nora.
10027,Lynette,"stu, you're a gopher. you can't consent to anything. so, i think you should talk to ed about getting your job back."

13042,Lynette,pardon?
11610,Lynette,you okay? you've been so quiet all night.
11688,Lynette,should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
12257,Lynette,kayla--why would you even joke about something like that?
12514,Lynette,really?
12479,Lynette,"oh, come on, tom. this is not your--"
12304,Lynette,could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?
11790,Lynette,"""top ten new hairstyles"". yeah, well, i'm kinda bald right now, but thanks."
9506,Lynette,she never leaves her mail sitting out there. i mean how many times has she thrown ours away because we didn't pick it up the minute it came.
13218,Lynette,"you're gonna get a job, and it'll be because they're impressed by your experience, not your wrinkle-free face."
8714,Lynette,"get out. or i will get in this pool and just grab you, get out! get over here. get over here. get back or i'll kill you."
11577,Lynette,what?
9299,Lynette,thank god.
11787,Lynette,"nobody likes hospitals. unfortunately, that's the place you have to go when you're sick, or your friends are. you are my friend, right?"
12574,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
12530,Lynette,stu? stu is doing bree's ad campaign? i rode in his hatchback once. it smelled like mu shu. i gotta warn her.
8990,Lynette,i was just participating.
8743,Lynette,what're you doing? that's private.
11609,Lynette,there. hey--i made you an espresso.
11151,Lynette,mmm.
11918,Lynette,what? that doesn't even make sense.
9597,Lynette,"i used to be the fantasy. there was a time when i didn't need a maid's outfit because i knew i was enough for you, even wearing a smelly t-shirt. and clearly, that's no longer the case."
13030,Lynette,"oh, you found out about that?"
11912,Lynette,but what?
9387,Lynette,"too little, too late."
11840,Lynette,let me ask you something. do you remember what i wore to the junior prom or what part i had in the play that year?
8855,Lynette,"it's like a vitamin, and you'll take one everyday."
9690,Lynette,"stu. you look like a bright, uh, responsible young man, and i bet you just love kids. am i right?"
9065,Lynette,"oh, she never showed up, somebody's got to take her place."
9758,Lynette,"yeah, and the best part of it is i got you a really cool backpack."
11752,Lynette,i'm in charge of decorations?
12529,Lynette,you know what this tastes like? more.
11113,Lynette,"this is nellie. my grandma gave her to me when i was little, and i was hoping you could take care of her for me."
9678,Lynette,okay.
12982,Lynette,"i was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince bruce i was good, and i remembered something. i am good. and i would like another chance to prove it."
13096,Lynette,that'd be great.
10522,Lynette,"you're under contract.ed can't fire you unless he has just cause.so until this blows over,you have to be a model employee.show up on time,no more 3-martini lunches,and above all,have ready all your presentations."
12368,Lynette,"mm-hmm. uh, chicken marsala, and pasta for the vegetarians."
13000,Lynette,"okay, that's it. four shrug. i'm out. thanks for your help."
13147,Lynette,"well, then what are you doing--here? oh, no. are you crazy?"
11115,Lynette,okay.
11737,Lynette,muriel.how are you doing?what's up?you look good.
10331,Lynette,"did you give it 100%?well,exactly. so? big deal.go work up some new ideas,and then we'll go over it during lunch.okay?"
12939,Lynette,"the hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan, and i thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car."
10172,Lynette,do you have any idea how painful it is to hear about you even think about your next wife and kids?i could never do that!i can't imagine my life without you.you are my everything!
10788,Lynette,"all right, let's try it again. nice and easy. watch the ball hit the bat. you ready? you can do it. here we go. okay, parker, i keep telling you, you gotta keep your eyes open. how are you gonna hit the ball when you're doing this?"
8843,Lynette,"yeah, i know."
13223,Lynette,"tom, why didn't you help me out there?"
10098,Lynette,the teenager?
11203,Lynette,"aw, come on, tom."
12035,Lynette,why didn't you tell me?
9182,Lynette,oh.
11362,Lynette,except we're never home. we live here. our marriage happens here.
11095,Lynette,"well, that's my home, and i don't feel very safe right now. please, please, all of you, just leave this street. please, i beg of you. go! just get off my street, please!"
10711,Lynette,i did. we need to find her another boyfriend and weddings are crawling with single men.
12618,Lynette,you know what? i have to kill you now.
10468,Lynette,"i talked to mrs. mccluskey,and for god's sakes,parker,you can't ask people things like that."
13070,Lynette,"no, i can't. uh, see? cancer."
12644,Lynette,"warren, i'm sorry that"
10500,Lynette,"mnh-mnh-mnh.""yeah? what did you want to do to me?"""
12122,Lynette,i'm just glad we gave ida what she wanted.
10611,Lynette,isn't your aunt named penny?
11692,Lynette,just say thank you.
10979,Lynette,okay?
13069,Lynette,"no, thanks."
9619,Lynette,mike's a decent guy.
11569,Lynette,thanks. thank you.
11368,Lynette,"exactly, and i'm supposed to wear that every damn day."
10761,Lynette,"oh, lighten up. it's a joke."
11334,Lynette,wow.
12370,Lynette,"no, no, give me another chance. i will get it."
10079,Lynette,he played the tuba.i have pictures.
12734,Lynette,that's why we've been trying to get you to postpone the hearing date until we could find him.
9393,Lynette,my twins talk about matt all the time. we should set up a play date.
9743,Lynette,okay.
11129,Lynette,nothing.
10523,Lynette,"well,honey,in all fairness--those are all things you should be doing anyway."
9453,Lynette,"please hear me out, this is important. today i have a chance to rejoin the human race for a few hours, there are actual adults waiting for me with margaritas.look i'm in a dress, i have make up on."
9860,Lynette,hey.
12604,Lynette,so you'll come home?
10068,Lynette,oh.
11211,Lynette,"oh, deciding what to wear on my first day back to work. do i look fat in this?"
9602,Lynette,sound asleep.
11458,Lynette,"no, no, the profit margin."
9162,Lynette,i remember talking to her right before she disappeared.
11693,Lynette,"listen, mom, i really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, i'm perfectly fine."
11963,Lynette,i'm sorry.
12775,Lynette,where is he?
12069,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no, no. you stay here."
9790,Lynette,dad's gonna take you.
12413,Lynette,have you been drinking?
10936,Lynette,i'll look as soon as i get back from the store.
9707,Lynette,give it to her! give it to her!
9419,Lynette,what's your problem?
13142,Lynette,"did you remember to get my, um--my special deodorant?"
12560,Lynette,"so i'm thinking no more electrical work, okay?"
12594,Lynette,what are you saying?
11413,Lynette,clean for almost a year.
11773,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
10054,Lynette,okay.
11360,Lynette,"because i need to win one, tom."
10352,Lynette,"are you serious?tom,i wasn't doing anything.i was just going for it.i was just lost in the moment.oh,come on!come on,this is silly.i don't wanna argue.i mean,unless it turns you on.does it? 'cause theni'm all about it,baby."
9013,Lynette,"oh, for the love of god!"
9268,Lynette,i'm not going over there.
12342,Lynette,so what do i need to do to keep my kids?
10094,Lynette,no!
12011,Lynette,"the morgue is listed under government offices, right?"
10328,Lynette,"oh,please.i live with you.last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work,you were watching the game."
10245,Lynette,"oh!hey, none of that in here."
11454,Lynette,and we're offering that for twelve dollars.
12346,Lynette,"i guess that's why they didn't name you ""einstein""."
13131,Lynette,"drop it, tom. we'll continue this at home."
13001,Lynette,yep. thank you.
9685,Lynette,"tom, being a mom is like being an e.r. doctor. there are no days off, so get up! get up!"
10189,Lynette,thank you.
8781,Lynette,just give me a second-5 minutes.
10376,Lynette,i didn't know you had a child.
13249,Lynette,"oh, tom. you and tequila? what a great idea."
12275,Lynette,"and i wouldn't have done that unless i thought we had a serious problem, which we do."
10316,Lynette,"oh,gosh,you got drunk,and you passed out."
10746,Lynette,"well, why don't you give them to the kids?"
11153,Lynette,too late. i looked--and it's great.
10582,Lynette,"what are you, a scientist?"
9140,Lynette,that sales girl that sold us the water heater - she had a cute figure.
11286,Lynette,this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family.
12121,Lynette,oh!
9525,Lynette,"well, i'll let you get back to work. i'll see you later."
13181,Lynette,"oh, right. how'd that go?"
12034,Lynette,kinda.
9392,Lynette,"oh hi. nice to meet you, lily."
11430,Lynette,"i have been doing everything i can to keep our heads above water. i can't do you, too."
12339,Lynette,my neighbors? god! i could strangle that girl.
10827,Lynette,please? you can't bend the rules just once?
11135,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry,but we gotta go. i have a dinner party i have to get to."
8723,Lynette,"yeah, well."
12903,Lynette,not yet.
11391,Lynette,it's okay. i am gonna find a way to make this all work and you just get better.
11375,Lynette,"hello?hi.there's something wrong with my husband. i don't know. he's unconscious. 357 hawthorne place. okay, could you please hurry? thank you. yes."
11310,Lynette,did you get some sleep?
11851,Lynette,hey! hey. screw it.
9577,Lynette,bye.
10294,Lynette,"yes! yeah,no,i know."
11704,Lynette,"great, so in the middle of everything i'm dealing with, you're gonna throw rick in my face."
12686,Lynette,oh.
12478,Lynette,those of us with hearing beg to differ.
10097,Lynette,"oh, you're kidding!"
11198,Lynette,hey.
10202,Lynette,hi!
10105,Lynette,"really?wow, that was nice of you."
12814,Lynette,yeah. whoop-dee-doo.
12822,Lynette,my hero.
10235,Lynette,"no, no, no, no,we never hire in the room."
12503,Lynette,"well, maybe i'm the lucky one. this could be a perfect way for me to stick my toe back in the business. nothing big, maybe just pick up some freelance work."
10978,Lynette,i've gotta--
12545,Lynette,"it is. you're at the start of an incredible journey, and i am going to be there every step of the way, cheering you on, telling anyone who will listen that the bree van de kamp is my friend."
10726,Lynette,uh oh.
9464,Lynette,"so help me, if you don't back me up on this i will lose it."
12756,Lynette,"sweetie, where are you?"
11530,Lynette,"well, yeah, i guess i could work somethin' out."
10203,Lynette,hi.
13308,Lynette,you better not be apologizing for me!
10357,Lynette,tom--
11679,Lynette,"hey, i'm starting to get worried about bree. maybe we should call."
9318,Lynette,"of course, i mean, i will miss him being gone all the time. he'll be bringing in more money, but he is gonna miss the birthdays, baseball games, first steps. that's the trade-off, right? i just hope one day tom doesn't look back and regret being gone so much. i better get out there before they break something."
8810,Lynette,"the kids are bouncing off the walls?huh. well i'm sure you can find a way to put them to bed, tom. i mean, for god's sakes, tom, they're just kids."
12985,Lynette,"hey, tom. no, still waiting. big surprise. they're running behind at an ad agency. so did any of those other places call back? seriously? six interviews and nothin'? well, i should probably try and keep my game face on here. i'll--i'll call you later. i love you. bye."
13115,Lynette,"no, i'm fine. i-i want to go."
9347,Lynette,really.
11662,Lynette,nothing was going on! he never touched me!
11950,Lynette,"not as much as me. i put out poison, but it ate around it. i got one of those humane traps, but all i trapped was penny."
11188,Lynette,i bet you were quite the player.
12845,Lynette,"sadly, we can no longer afford tom's midlife crisis. okay, here's the deal. we're-- sort of broke."
12146,Lynette,"well, sure. i'm easy. thanks."
12150,Lynette,what isn't my fault?
9059,Lynette,are you going to be here tomorrow? i want to see you again.
12286,Lynette,"it's okay, sweetie. you're gonna be just fine. there."
9119,Lynette,"you know, if we're going to buy a water heater, we should talk about it. we could go to the mall tomorrow. they're having a sale."
9409,Lynette,"well, obviously she needs to be told."
11553,Lynette,"gaby, she asked me to make twenty pizzas. i couldn't turn it down."
10797,Lynette,"look, i was just making conversation. batter up!"
10411,Lynette,"all right.that's-- not why you came to apologize,is it?"
12986,Lynette,"coming. do me a favor. if you hear a gunshot, tell my four kids i love them."
12381,Lynette,"good. good, then--get out there and get committed, you crazy kids."
11833,Lynette,"yeah, no, i'm good. hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?"
9006,Lynette,an innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off? i don't think it's extreme.
11605,Lynette,"i was doing receipts, and rick surprised me with this great idea for the menu. it's called--what are they called?"
11066,Lynette,"i know! if something happened to someone's kid because i kept my mouth shut--the thing is, i promised tom i'd back off."
10975,Lynette,"well, let's see how well you do on a morphine drip."
13168,Lynette,"oh, okay. i'm gonna let that one go, 'cause you're upset."
9315,Lynette,really?
12057,Lynette,thanks. and don't worry. i'll have a talk with my kids. i promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.
9307,Lynette,"i'm sorry, but you should have consulted me."
9982,Lynette,"yeah, i applaud that, but what i need is for you to help me to prove a point to my husband."
11601,Lynette,we were robbed!
11866,Lynette,that's too bad. i had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
11150,Lynette,hi.
9111,Lynette,"yep. um, i'll be home late, so just the usual routine. a nap for penny, and-"
12179,Lynette,"oh, well, that's nice. thank you."
11543,Lynette,"trust me, we can both relax. i talked to her this morning, and she's out with victor all day."
12307,Lynette,"hey, bree, perfect timing. we were just getting ready to deal the cards."
12448,Lynette,is that my yeats book? i love his poetry.
9507,Lynette,"i don't know, tom, i think something's happened to her."
11320,Lynette,"before i forget, you got a call from chez nous confirming your reservation for our anniversary."
12337,Lynette,"okay--first, i'm not that kind of mom. and second, kayla has a tendency to--exaggerate."
11834,Lynette,it's like chocolate love.
10731,Lynette,"i'm so unhappy. ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives i can't even work up a smile. and the more she pushes the more i resent tom. tom. for something he did twelve years ago. and i'm afraid if i can't fix this, that the anger is just going to fester until.."
12656,Lynette,stop it! go on! go on! go on!
10050,Lynette,"i'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day. maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon. wouldn't that be great? have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?"
10693,Lynette,"well, we are happy to pitch in."
10479,Lynette,you're kidding!
10577,Lynette,hi.
12354,Lynette,"no, you'll figure something out. i have to go back to my cell."
9697,Lynette,could you excuse me for a minute?
10556,Lynette,i knew that. you didn't have to tell me that.why did you buy flowers for milt's wife?
12655,Lynette,don't you touch him! don't you touch him! go home now!
11580,Lynette,"yeah, well, you know, it is, but i just don't want you to come back before you're ready. you might reinjure yourself."
11440,Lynette,"all right, all right. i will put you order in. but the kitchen's a little backed up."
10701,Lynette,"no, i'm good. could be a monkey."
12622,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?!
12761,Lynette,"and if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
10867,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, i am totally on board."
11669,Lynette,i would never cheat on you. you know that.
9474,Lynette,"i mean it this time, these are not just words. if you do this, so help me."
11850,Lynette,"well, it's just like riding a bike. you never forget. now start pedaling. hey. hey. what are you doing?"
11611,Lynette,that's funny. he didn't mention it.
11940,Lynette,"well, we gotta do something about this."
9129,Lynette,oh.
12911,Lynette,"you're putting us in the cheapest nursing home you can find. yeah, i got it."
9489,Lynette,you're not going to die.
9210,Lynette,oh.
9803,Lynette,"hello, mrs. mulberry. don't forget to buckle up."
8889,Lynette,they're always a little shy at first.
8966,Lynette,you think? how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
11392,Lynette,mrs. mccluskey. perfect timing.
11848,Lynette,"well, it's back. and since when do you question the mojo?"
12840,Lynette,i can't help feeling there's more we could have done to honor him.
11847,Lynette,"next month, so i have some time before i start feeling like total crap again. and i was hoping we could put that time to good use."
8792,Lynette,have you heard anything i just said?
12383,Lynette,"we always knew he'd do something like this eventually, and he did."
11034,Lynette,"i am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and barney fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!"
9531,Lynette,do you still have feelings for her?
13291,Lynette,"please christy, there is no way that i can get another babysitter this late in the day."
11323,Lynette,"i'm exhausted. honestly, all i wanna do is pawn the kids off on somebody else, take a long bath and be in bed by eight."
10530,Lynette,"okay,go get him."
9829,Lynette,shut up.
11624,Lynette,"well, he got a better offer from some place across town."
11501,Lynette,"well, so far, she's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse."
11510,Lynette,i will. i love you. bye.
9211,Lynette,"uh, it's nice to meet you."
12086,Lynette,"okay. you really, really, really think so?"
12348,Lynette,what's going on?
13136,Lynette,tom and i are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
13014,Lynette,"i'm confused. before, you didn't even want to talk to him. you weren't even sure i was good."
12737,Lynette,"but if the judge finds out that porter's gone, we have to forfeit the bail."
10620,Lynette,"i must have been crazy, agreeing to this."
9107,Lynette,really.
9538,Lynette,you heard me.
11975,Lynette,i just think it would work better for everyone if you got your own place.
12874,Lynette,you'll still be a celebrity in five minutes. come on.
10404,Lynette,"oh,sweetie--i know that we wanna keep them young as long as we can,but kids grow up.they just do."
9200,Lynette,yep.
12781,Lynette,of course i did.
11566,Lynette,oh. it must be the basil. it has a kind of sweet smell.
10208,Lynette,oh!no! no!i do not think that that is a good idea.
11407,Lynette,which is four more than we have.
8726,Lynette,now what.
12116,Lynette,"she played third base, right?"
12393,Lynette,what happened to your tenant?
12516,Lynette,"i'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign is this dinner roll."
11061,Lynette,that proves nothing. he knew i was on to him. he had to dump it someplace.
8921,Lynette,sure. whatever.
11749,Lynette,"oh,sorry."
13024,Lynette,actually--i am kinda tired. i think i'm going to head inside.
9277,Lynette,hey.
12223,Lynette,yeah.
9147,Lynette,"we are not going anywhere until you confess you have the hots for our nanny. tom, it's okay. she's attractive. men by nature are drawn to fertile young women with whom them can plant their seed."
9562,Lynette,"well, what am i supposed to do? you hire your old girlfriend and you don't tell me for three months?"
8814,Lynette,how was your night?
12589,Lynette,sh-she was there? why?
9686,Lynette,"jeez, are you crying?"
11233,Lynette,"oh, son of a bi*ch!"
9404,Lynette,"well, lynette loves talking about lynette, too."
11811,Lynette,"i appreciate the effort, but i told you, i can't keep anything down, and f.y.i. mac and cheese is halfway to vomit. you might as well have given me a plate of creamed corn."
11465,Lynette,us? what is us?
12126,Lynette,i got time for that.
10275,Lynette,really?
9031,Lynette,that's what's so humiliating. other moms don't need help. other moms make it look so easy. all i do is complain.
12321,Lynette,"well, we've done enough damage for one day. let's go home."
8709,Lynette,what are you doing!? we are at a wake!
8907,Lynette,"oh,thank you."
10878,Lynette,it's a burner-downer.
8708,Lynette,oh.
9071,Lynette,i would never treat you that way.
8994,Lynette,"and when you work on a pitch, or you bring the partners over, i am reminded of a world i left behind where i was the winner, and people tried to keep up with me! i can't go back. i can't win where i am. i'm stuck in the middle, and it is really starting to get to me."
10832,Lynette,no.
12950,Lynette,"that's how i got rid of tom's last bottle of ""musk, the cologne for men."""
13116,Lynette,mm-hmm.
10153,Lynette,and since you're immune--
10995,Lynette,"hey, sweetheart, you okay?"
12739,Lynette,"tom, i talked to every kid in his english class, the entire debate team. porter hasn't contacted any of them. well, hurry home. we gotta decide what our next move is. all right. i love you. bye."
12772,Lynette,call bob. tell him we can make the hearing tomorrow.
10286,Lynette,"have they signed the contract?'cause if not,somebody should call bednark and tell them to adjust the language."
10483,Lynette,"guys,i'm all for bashing exes,but let's save a little of our hate for his partner in crime--the other woman."
11657,Lynette,fine. let's have sex.
10264,Lynette,ed!
9978,Lynette,"give me a break. you know our kids. i love them dearly, but that goes in one ear and out the other."
9789,Lynette,yeah.
9626,Lynette,"yeah, he's been thinking about making a move for a while. he kind of feels like he's done everything he can where he is now."
9388,Lynette,"well, why are you standing there? get to it."
11460,Lynette,yeah?
9711,Lynette,wow. it's really pilin' up.
9547,Lynette,i thought you said you didn't have any female friends?
11058,Lynette,don't pretend you don't know. i'm calling the police. parker!
10051,Lynette,"oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it. wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her before you want to strangle her?"
11775,Lynette,out!
10363,Lynette,"yeah,yeah.gotta love the thunderbolt."
11267,Lynette,are you high?
9038,Lynette,"while you're gone, i'll be here, paying bills and sorting laundry and cooking dinner, so what part of that sounds like a vacation?"
10438,Lynette,welcome to parenthood.come on.
8901,Lynette,and that's what i told them.
11401,Lynette,rick coletti?
12605,Lynette,"good. maybe when you come home, you could teach me how to play that video game."
11640,Lynette,tom--
9742,Lynette,i forgot.
9180,Lynette,what?
13281,Lynette,oh!
9015,Lynette,"look, i'm on my last nerves, so i'm going to level with you. i've screwed up my entire system by taking my system by taking my kids'add medication. yeah, that's right, you heard me. i plan to stop, but right now i need to sleep, and i need more than a few, crappy, needles, so whattya got?"
12053,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, please?"
10485,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
12636,Lynette,good. i'll see you downstairs.
10255,Lynette,i don't care!you're not gonna do this!
11177,Lynette,this is a nightmare. how did this happen?
9188,Lynette,"ah. that was the best class ever. you can just terrific, thank you."
11809,Lynette,"yeah, i am feeling much better, so count me in. will our new neighbor be coming?"
12700,Lynette,did anyone see you do this?
10626,Lynette,how could he abandon her if he didn't even know she existed?
13155,Lynette,so--carlos--where were we?
9373,Lynette,"here's the thing. acting like parents won't assign blame is like pretending they don't keep score at pee-wee league games. it's human nature. if you don't give the moms someone to blame, they'll pick a scapegoat. i can't let my boys be the scapegoat."
12306,Lynette,"hey, honey, could you get that? thank you."
9410,Lynette,"how can i ignore this? and i quote, 'it's not like she can hear.'"
10966,Lynette,why not?
11431,Lynette,here you go. sorry for the wait.
12136,Lynette,"well, i decided i should go to church today. yeah, tom said the same thing. anyway, since you're the most religious person i know, i was wondering if you would take us to your church."
11195,Lynette,"and, harry--harry, what did i say?"
12468,Lynette,you need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986? you don't climb mountains.
10312,Lynette,"yeah,although i-i still can't figure out how my boys managed to sneak past you."
12185,Lynette,"oh, yeah?"
8735,Lynette,yeah.
11728,Lynette,"okay,honey.just give me a minute.give me a minute."
12066,Lynette,"no, that's ridiculous. karen, come on."
9733,Lynette,hello? hi!
12444,Lynette,"yeah. our porter, the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs, writes this--beautiful, heart-wrenching poetry."
12542,Lynette,drunk? jealous?
11167,Lynette,okay. good. i'll see ya.
8738,Lynette,she was having sex with some guy when the fire started.
8918,Lynette,"so then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy. he eats little red's grandma. if you let him go, he's just going to chow down on another defenseless old lady."
8908,Lynette,"yeah. it gave me some good ideas. well, one, anyway."
11093,Lynette,okay.
9763,Lynette,"well, hey, when a kid's that good, you gotta give him his due."
10991,Lynette,shot? where did you hear that?
11674,Lynette,stop. just--stop. what is it you think i have?
9853,Lynette,"hey, stretch. see my friend over there? she thinks you're cute."
10816,Lynette,"not nicky, too!"
8856,Lynette,stay right there.
8973,Lynette,"yeah, that's exciting. i wish my sister would visit more often."
11309,Lynette,"oh, hey, hon."
12222,Lynette,"oh, my god! stop it! what are you doing? stop. hey, easy. easy. just stop it! oh!"
13262,Lynette,"okay, that's everyone."
9960,Lynette,does your dad know you're out here?
13251,Lynette,"i love you, too, baby. here you go."
11229,Lynette,"no, it's too close."
13006,Lynette,"he didn't even flinch. i said i was 54, and he bought it. there was not a ""wow, you look great for your age!"" not even a courtesy gasp."
9706,Lynette,"okay, obviously, i'm gonna clean that up."
11240,Lynette,"you haven't heard? he has been begging gaby to go on a date with him. he's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her, even a diamond bracelet."
11638,Lynette,"oh, wow. well, i'd love to chat, but i have cheese to grate."
11297,Lynette,"oh, god. seriously? fantastic. thank you. it's just two quick hours, and then we'll get you right back home with your mom. thank you, andrew. okay. bye-bye."
10083,Lynette,thanks.
10712,Lynette,"hey, sacrifices must be made, tom!"
11389,Lynette,"oh, for god sake, tom! i'm gonna be late for this interview. i really should go."
12137,Lynette,"great! just give me a second to sell tom on the idea. you know, he was raised catholic."
10277,Lynette,thanks.follow me.you're part of the thing.
9643,Lynette,"okay. okay. could we go home and talk about this, please?"
10123,Lynette,so cute.'cause it's beautiful!
11447,Lynette,"please, please, tell me we can still make pizza."
12718,Lynette,hey.
9382,Lynette,how could you do that?
8881,Lynette,ooo-observation?
9659,Lynette,you're right. i'm sorry.
8852,Lynette,"boys, will you come in here please?"
11555,Lynette,gaby!
13028,Lynette,gaby!
8829,Lynette,"well, the little girl."
9754,Lynette,"hey. little guy. i just wanted to say i'm really sorry about what happened with the shovel. neither one of us saw that coming. i know it's not much consolation, but you really helped my marriage. that's a lot for a little rat to accomplish in one lifetime. well, it's getting late, so, hats off to ya!"
9505,Lynette,alright. okay. thank you.
12749,Lynette,"okay, we'll get a - we'll get a restraining order."
10559,Lynette,"is this crazy?following tom across the country just to spy on him?if he knewi was doing this--god, i don't think i can go through with this."
9401,Lynette,she is so opening that letter.
10845,Lynette,"thanks. no, seriously, though."
11742,Lynette,"it's my life.some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.besides,parker's expecting to see me."
10146,Lynette,see ya.
11048,Lynette,okay.
10681,Lynette,"hey, nora, wow.we weren't expecting you until seven."
9224,Lynette,"yesterday, i came home, and i walked in on your dad with a woman. he's having an affair. i am so, so sorry. i know. are you okay?"
10668,Lynette,so what are you saying?you're more afraid of nora that you are of me?
11793,Lynette,"boy, you really don't wanna be here, do ya?"
10110,Lynette,"come on, gaby.it's a small town. people talk."
11689,Lynette,"well, in that spirit, as soon as i start chemo, i will be giving up shampoo."
10365,Lynette,sorry.
10856,Lynette,yeah--how's that divorce going?
10606,Lynette,"not here, penny.mommy's gotta change you now 'cause you stink."
10999,Lynette,"okay, i should be back at around six o'clock. they can have one snack. try and push apples, but if they threaten violence, i have an emergency candy bar under the sink."
12276,Lynette,"tom, it is one thing not to want to admit something's wrong with your kid. it's another to just bury your head in the sand."
11879,Lynette,"this--is me, tom, not brandy or candy. it's just your wife, lynette. am i not enough for you?"
9579,Lynette,"i told you, honey, daddy and i have a special meeting tonight."
11108,Lynette,"hi, kayla! we missed you! we're so glad you're here. okay, boys."
12707,Lynette,"oh, thank god. how much?"
13057,Lynette,"oh, please. we're talking about edie. a little more irreverence is what we need."
11147,Lynette,"hey, stranger."
12322,Lynette,"honey, we're about to have dinner."
10302,Lynette,"all right,go back in."
10629,Lynette,"well, it's that or the kids' college fund.we'll write nora one big check, and in return, she'll sign away her claim for the back child support. if we're lucky, she'll take the bird in the hand."
13145,Lynette,"i know, and i'm really sorry. listen, i gotta go. i will call you later. i love you. bye."
10630,Lynette,"well, we need to show her we're serious. $30,000?"
8893,Lynette,"oh,thanks."
10470,Lynette,"well,that doesn't matter!you gotta quit talking to people about their bodies,and about where,you know,babies come from."
10610,Lynette,"neither are stretch marks, but what are you gonna do?"
12164,Lynette,"because i have had a rough few months. okay? but i know you've had rough times, too, and i always assumed that your faith had helped you get through them. i envied you that, to be honest."
12096,Lynette,ida? i have trouble seeing her as the leadoff hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.
12235,Lynette,excuse me?
10754,Lynette,"yeah, i do mind. i mind deeply."
11874,Lynette,oh.
12189,Lynette,"oh, i've been unwashed for years."
10561,Lynette,and what if i see him with another woman? what then?
10104,Lynette,"yeah. hey, gaby.a surprise seeing you here."
9694,Lynette,"""i have. but when i moved over to cenn and simmons-"
12944,Lynette,"oh, my god. that would be great. and if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check."
8936,Lynette,"bree, i totally understand. yeah, i already tried susan. and gabby can't sew to save her life but seriously, i'm going to be fine. but thanks anyway. bye!"
12573,Lynette,"and when we start stealing to support ourselves, the kids can see the inside of a prison. you're right, tom. it's a brilliant idea."
11181,Lynette,i'm gonna tell him. i'm gonna tell him i went to the restaurant and that i know he screwed up and that i'm gonna fix it.
12670,Lynette,i'm telling you i heard him threaten warren schilling. i don't know what happened next.
8867,Lynette,we need you to recommend porter and preston. we can't even get an interview.
9141,Lynette,"oh, how can you say, she was so your type, big breasts, really curvy."
9655,Lynette,we should talk about this seriously before we make any rash decisions.
12702,Lynette,"tom, if you're gonna freak out, can you do that in the other room? i'm kind of busy here."
11802,Lynette,"oh, i'm gonna be sick."
10549,Lynette,i didn't say anything.
9022,Lynette,"you're never going to be a sailor, what do you care? okay everybody, let's just take a break!"
12690,Lynette,"look, this family has been through a lot lately, and your dad and i feel we'll be better parents if we know what's going on in your lives. so, parker, how's that science project you've been working on?"
11734,Lynette,"hey,sweetie,what's up?"
10478,Lynette,"hey, great.let's go before he changes his mind."
8751,Lynette,you saying i'm a bad mother?
11659,Lynette,i said i'd have sex. i didn't say i'd make love.
10014,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. i work here. who are you?
11967,Lynette,"i have to get checked every six months, but, yes, the doctor is very optimistic."
12806,Lynette,"it's not happening, tom."
12555,Lynette,oh. hi. what happened?
10808,Lynette,yeah. ever seen one of these?
13221,Lynette,"well, it seems like, based on your last visa records you've already been on vacation."
9033,Lynette,"yeah, it really does."
12335,Lynette,"for what it's worth, i keep my floors incredibly clean."
10942,Lynette,even you have to admit kayla would be better off with us than in a dingy apartment over a tijuana strip club.
10499,Lynette,"ugh.""i love the way that blouse clings to your body."""
11894,Lynette,"uh, you mean katherine 's homeowners thing? yeah, i think i'll sit this one out."
8971,Lynette,"actually, i'm getting ready for a dinner party tomorrow night. six people."
12603,Lynette,"so you can have your affair--you know, the one that follows the sports car and the garage band and wanting to quit your job, the final stage of your midlife crisis. oh, and then--when i hear anne schilling has been dropping by--"
10747,Lynette,"please, tom, please!don't do this to me!"
11794,Lynette,"yeah, in any way that gets you out of this room."
11050,Lynette,"what--okay, watch her!"
11643,Lynette,"oh, dear god you didn't."
8762,Lynette,"mrs. huber, i could never leave my kids by the side of the road."
11506,Lynette,aren't you sweet? what's that noise in the background? are the boys still up?
13290,Lynette,oh really? more steak?
9077,Lynette,she's a total nightmare.
9907,Lynette,"good morning. hi. i'm lynette scavo. now is everyone taken care of in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like? great. well, then, let's get started. i will show you how kamarov vodka can expand its customer mindshare while still holding the line on marketing costs. it's something we here at percher and murphy like to call ""persuasive engineering."""
9127,Lynette,"just so you know, if we go to the mall, we can go to the shoe store. you said you wanted new running shoes."
9937,Lynette,"norma, wait! we're still on for next week! norma! the water park! right?"
12115,Lynette,that was lovely.
8849,Lynette,"of course, of course."
8872,Lynette,it really doesn't.
8769,Lynette,"oh! excuse me, i'm sorry, i'm looking for my boys. three boys with red hair, have you seen 'em?"
10564,Lynette,yeah?you're quite a gambler.where's jerry?
11152,Lynette,he already did.
9899,Lynette,"all right, now you're being ridiculous."
8873,Lynette,that's the second time this week. they never used to fight like that when mary alice was alive.
9202,Lynette,i'm so happy to see you. it's such a shame that alison couldn't make it.
12578,Lynette,"scavo's was the adventure. we changed our whole lives so you could live out your dream, and now you're bored. we can't keep doing this, tom. we can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air every time you get a little restless. let's call it a night. we have to work tomorrow. are you coming?"
12868,Lynette,so?
9194,Lynette,"--okay, your 30 seconds is up now. get back here, get back here, get back here. i want the toys picked up. how many times do i have to tell you, pick up your toys! you want a spanking? is that what you want?"
11655,Lynette,"remember when i was giving birth to the twins and screaming in agony because porter was dragging my uterus out with him? well, i was more in the mood for sex then than i am now."
10609,Lynette,eight hours of grueling labor.
12353,Lynette,and go where? i can't get within 500 feet of my children. are you not up to speed on the people vs. lynette scavo?
11859,Lynette,i'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
12140,Lynette,i've got a question about his sermon.
12766,Lynette,porter?
11457,Lynette,"sorry. i'm sorry. but it's gonna be worth it. okay, so tell tom the secret of your risotto."
9508,Lynette,but if i'm wrong then i'm sucked into a two-hour conversation about bunions pilkingtons.
10033,Lynette,why? what happened?
10323,Lynette,it feels a little familiar.
13177,Lynette,so--what do you want to do? hmm? what are you passionate about?
12296,Lynette,she never does this.
11589,Lynette,so this little ear-shaped pasta is called--
10639,Lynette,my sincerest apologies.
10433,Lynette,no.
12175,Lynette,"i faced cancer and a tornado, but i'm running from this."
11952,Lynette,that was the old lynette. the new lynette kills the possums and let's god sort 'em out.
11004,Lynette,"i'm only gonna be in there ten minutes, i promise."
9451,Lynette,hi. hi.
8780,Lynette,"if any of you acts up, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas."
11673,Lynette,is it a concussion?
11275,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry, but you totally blindsided me out there."
11079,Lynette,"hey, why don't we start that girl talk?"
9912,Lynette,"you can't explain obsession, tom. it just is."
11467,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?and you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with rick's idea!
11087,Lynette,"well, that's what we think, but we don't exactly have proof."
9850,Lynette,"well, i'm not. so, uh, what about that guy over there? he's been checking you out since we walked in."
13011,Lynette,oh. that job. i don't know what to say.
11564,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
13305,Lynette,i'm on my way.
8854,Lynette,not exactly. this is a special kind of medicine.
11929,Lynette,what? you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did? we're supposed to be friends.
13061,Lynette,thanks. i can't get comfortable. could you fluff my pillows?
10336,Lynette,i don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
11626,Lynette,"well, okay, then."
12355,Lynette,how can you talk like that? what else has to happen for you to get what's going on here?
9218,Lynette,it's not complicated. it's completely irresponsible.
10780,Lynette,"okay, let's call that the backup plan. but, seriously, don't you have some road not taken, some dream you never got around to?"
12645,Lynette,damn it.
11909,Lynette,"no! this is about personal freedom--specifically, my personal freedom to take down that jackbooted hausfrau."
12969,Lynette,"well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister--""uh, i don't know. are there any more potatoes?"""
12039,Lynette,"if i understood why you couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent i'd ever known, yeah, i could've found a way to forgive you all sorts of things. we can talk about this later. let's go home."
10101,Lynette,"hey, i'm right by the supermarket.you want me to pick up anything?"
11837,Lynette,you drugged me.
8797,Lynette,"you know what, it's not gonna change until you resolve your issues with that man."
10625,Lynette,we can't afford this.we have four kids.tom just lost his job.that'd bankrupt us.
11495,Lynette,"i'm not, but susan's written a poem."
8734,Lynette,"oh wait, i gotta tell you, i was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just gonna have to put on a condom."
12628,Lynette,i am not promising anything.
8995,Lynette,"yeah, well."
9873,Lynette,i can handle the extra hours.
12462,Lynette,"you said it was great. way to bury the lead, tom! tom, don't you dare!"
10977,Lynette,"there she is! hi, my little bunny!"
12419,Lynette,"no! you don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car, especially with that big dent they put in it last month."
9972,Lynette,"hi, guys."
10637,Lynette,tom?!
12171,Lynette,"well, maybe a little."
9091,Lynette,"well, i'm just curious. i mean, he moves out, he moves back in. is he back for good?"
12017,Lynette,she did? is she okay?
13172,Lynette,"see this? my third espresso. i'm wired. no way i'm falling asleep tonight. hey. how about we throw a pizza on the front lawn, and when the kids run out to get it, we lock the door and do it in every room in the house? tom, i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say. if you wanna stay mad, i guess you're gonna stay mad."
10741,Lynette,"no, no, no, no!"
8861,Lynette,mary alice was not crazy.
10527,Lynette,"oh,it'll never happen.he knows this place will go down like a house of cards without me."
9558,Lynette,i did not mean it that way.
12151,Lynette,"yeah, but how do you get the answers if you don't ask the questions?"
13210,Lynette,"isn't it exciting, tom? in a few weeks, you are gonna look just like bruce."
10114,Lynette,you're kidding.
12984,Lynette,oh! mwah.
11427,Lynette,you wanna have sex? but you're immobile.
12926,Lynette,tom!
13274,Lynette,what am i gonna do about my job?
9205,Lynette,are you okay?
9809,Lynette,what?
9977,Lynette,you're smiling like that actually meant something.
8713,Lynette,here.
10543,Lynette,you know what's weird?
13219,Lynette,"this isn't about me, tom. come on."
11280,Lynette,you pulling rank on me?
11187,Lynette,did you live in las vegas?
11199,Lynette,you're home early.
10982,Lynette,"uh, yeah."
11955,Lynette,great.
12118,Lynette,"oh, yeah. okay."
10627,Lynette,"are we just gonna keep talking louder?is that the plan?you wanna just keep raising your voice 'cause that's how you get what you want, right?you make a scene, you throw a tantrum, and everyone gets scared and backs off.well, i don't work that way, lady.i don't care that my husband was so phenomenally stupid and or drunk to actually have sex with you.i'm not gonna let it ruin my life. am i talking loud enough for that to get through to you?"
12716,Lynette,"i guess i have no other choice. but again, this is all in the strictest confidence. remember, you are my lawyer, not tom's."
8877,Lynette,it's not really so much scary as highly developed.
9436,Lynette,are you sure you want to be saying these things in front of your daughter?
11033,Lynette,i'm not snapping at you.
8730,Lynette,"oh my god, oh my, oh!"
12896,Lynette,"it's not a slump. in this economy, people aren't eating out as much. between that and porter's legal bills and paying bree back, we are about a week away from going bankrupt."
9252,Lynette,"for a first time offense, if you swear, cross your heart, that you will never, never steal again, and you write mrs. mccluskey a letter of apology, i will let it slide."
12593,Lynette,"not a bed-- a futon, like a couch."
10661,Lynette,wow!
12581,Lynette,right. so--what the hell?
9062,Lynette,"well, look on the bright side, tom's having the time of his life."
9926,Lynette,"well, you should be polite and watch it too. you know they're your guests."
11986,Lynette,she's so not like that now.
10600,Lynette,why did she wait so long to contact you?
11513,Lynette,"those, too."
12193,Lynette,"uh, yes."
9766,Lynette,"uh, about tomorrow morning--"
11953,Lynette,wusses!
9646,Lynette,"so, did you have a fun day?"
11223,Lynette,"what?! no.uh-uh.look,i'm wearing makeup.i am holding a briefcase.what does this suggest to you?"
12394,Lynette,"oh, let's make it a party. we could do it at my restaurant."
12003,Lynette,"here's how you can help--don't visit for the next few years, 'cause it seems fairly likely i won't have stopped hating you by then."
12211,Lynette,whatcha doing?
9605,Lynette,oh my god!
12730,Lynette,here's what we're gonna do. youno questions. you--you're porter now. let's go in. come on. come on.
8787,Lynette,"i'm not being flip, i'm just pointing out a reality."
11374,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, tom. tommy--okay, okay, you're breathing. that's good. that's good."
11075,Lynette,"i have kids, okay? better safe than sorry."
9638,Lynette,tom?
10064,Lynette,there's science to back that up.
9652,Lynette,huh?
13016,Lynette,"$100,000 a year."
11464,Lynette,but?
10321,Lynette,"so apparently bree had a few too many and passed out.next thing i know, i get a call at work--someone found my kids wandering the street."
12213,Lynette,"the open bar is no longer your friend, huh?"
11944,Lynette,don't give him a name. he's not gonna be around much longer.
10042,Lynette,does he know yet?
11570,Lynette,"hey, mrs. mccluskey."
9692,Lynette,thanks so much for having me in.
9831,Lynette,"well, isn't she nice. it's time for bed, so i'm gonna tuck you in, okay?"
13081,Lynette,"come here. i'm afraid we have some bad news. your mom was in a very serious accident, and i am so sorry--but she passed away."
12425,Lynette,"i know. that car is your baby. if only there was something i felt that intensely about. oh, wait! there is-- my actual babies."
11489,Lynette,okay. i'm off.
10940,Lynette,"hey, nora. how's tricks? i thought it was your car i saw in the lot."
10994,Lynette,"no, no, afraid not."
12449,Lynette,"aah, this is the kind of poetry that melts a girl's heart. so romantic. oh! here's a great one--""the lover tells of the rose in his heart."" my first boyfriend gave me this poem. i was a junior in"
8758,Lynette,"no, no."
10976,Lynette,"fantastic! lead the way, i'm coming in."
9844,Lynette,"no, tom. she's gone."
9713,Lynette,two days.
10310,Lynette,"okay,well,thanks."
9702,Lynette,"well, then watch me multitask."
12192,Lynette,"no, i'm pretty sure the blind qualify, too."
9914,Lynette,"sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy. i know that sounds selfish, but i've been thinking. it might make us better people and maybe even better parents."
12627,Lynette,"well, then you have put her in a very dangerous position, haven't you?"
11326,Lynette,what was that?
9308,Lynette,i thought this was an in-house position.
10338,Lynette,is it that bad?
13037,Lynette,"but she makes people crazy. can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?"
12784,Lynette,"no, sweetie. i was driving home last night, talking with your dad on the phone, and two cars in front of me had an accident. and i thought, damn, that could be me. and then i thought, that could be me."
12680,Lynette,who's that?
10256,Lynette,"that's because ed gets off on humiliating you.please, don't do this!"
11835,Lynette,"oh, my god. ""hang 'em high"" has three syllables."
9796,Lynette,"i agree with you to a point when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots, not surrogate mommies."
10933,Lynette,you bet i would. kayla will be much better off without crazy in her life.
11441,Lynette,i can't do this. it's just--
11522,Lynette,what?
10329,Lynette,i saw you!
8941,Lynette,"that's add medication. my kids take this, or they almost did. i thought it was supposed to calm you down."
8701,Lynette,okay.
11259,Lynette,"when i got shot and i was lying there bleeding, i wasn't thinking ""god, i'm really gonna miss advertising."" i think this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family. we can make our own hours, we'll be together more, and, yes, the money is gonna be a little tight, but i think this place could be a gold mine."
12538,Lynette,"you know, when i had a high-powered career, and you were just a housewife, i never looked down on you."
9783,Lynette,"nina, nature is calling."
13071,Lynette,can you excuse us for one second? i need to go to chemo. i have cancer.
10538,Lynette,hey. hey!i didn't know if you were coming back.
13257,Lynette,marketplace?
12362,Lynette,hey. you know what we haven't done in a really long time? made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.
10071,Lynette,"no, i am on mindy's side. she is the one caught in the middle, and i'm not letting you two have her until you calm down."
13159,Lynette,mm.
11059,Lynette,you're damn right there's a problem. i can't find my son.
9945,Lynette,"so, um, we've been trying to contact you, but you haven't been returning any of our messages."
8817,Lynette,"well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party."
11241,Lynette,his grandfather left him all that money.
12764,Lynette,"oh, hello, mr. fishman."
9799,Lynette,"come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
10237,Lynette,hey.
12846,Lynette,between porter's legal fees and that ghost town that we call a restaurant--
11091,Lynette,i know. but be fair. there is no way i could've anticipated this.
11436,Lynette,"oh, my god, rick. i never got back to you. i am so sorry."
12177,Lynette,"great, actually. we're great."
9644,Lynette,you're just gonna stay here and play games all day?
9967,Lynette,"yeah, well, that was a different time. you have to be more vigilant. there was a break-in on this street."
13092,Lynette,i say we keep showing up here until he lets us help him.
12673,Lynette,i hear you're getting discharged today. are you going back home?
11617,Lynette,and i have nothing to offer! i am taken! god!
12743,Lynette,oh.
9088,Lynette,"it's just, i don't know this woman, i mean, not really. so she has a degree in sociology. well, big deal, who doesn't? my boys are a lot to handle. what if she's not up to it?"
12460,Lynette,"what? no, i didn't."
10752,Lynette,"ah, how far is the impound lot because, you know, i would just drive you over there--"
11702,Lynette,if you would just try to understand--
11682,Lynette,"oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. it's, um, hodgkin's lymphoma, and apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want."
12283,Lynette,get up. up.
12981,Lynette,idea--check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
11023,Lynette,hello?
12933,Lynette,"yeah, well, putting an ""everything must go"" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position."
11037,Lynette,hold on.
9868,Lynette,hi.
12328,Lynette,okay.
9902,Lynette,"fine. i'll take them back. could you step out for a minute, please? i want to be alone with it for a little while."
10635,Lynette,"sorry, that's penny's baby monitor.it's always picking up weird frequencies."
9004,Lynette,"slow down, you jerk, this is a residential neighborhood."
9675,Lynette,"with all due respect, nina, won't be an issue. i can leave home at home."
10346,Lynette,just eat it.
8870,Lynette,"yes, but by the time they realise their mistake we'll be in."
9792,Lynette,"i'm sorry, who?"
8992,Lynette,that is not fair!
10143,Lynette,what's that about?
10278,Lynette,"a million teenagers in this neighborhood,and you hire mccluskey?"
12915,Lynette,"well, clearly, that's not true because you're not a baby. you're 15, remember?"
12311,Lynette,no. what are we gonna do?
11452,Lynette,okay.
12956,Lynette,and brush your teeth. my eyes are watering. and don't just wet the toothbrush. i can tell.
10145,Lynette,sounds like a plan.
12753,Lynette,"you see that bar? warren schilling goes there every night. all right, come on! tonight, when he leaves--i'm gonna do what i have to, to make sure my family is safe. so--i need you to get out now. you can't be in the car when this happens."
12823,Lynette,"jeff cuevas is fantastic, but i know i could take his department to a whole new level."
9785,Lynette,"bill on delivery, yes!"
11305,Lynette,i switched the seven and the one.
12437,Lynette,really? can anyone talk to him?
9992,Lynette,"what, um, don't you get?"
11500,Lynette,"oh, please, i don't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement. i mean, jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice, at least have a dedicated freezer."
9372,Lynette,"no, i don't. you're going to have to give me a name."
11032,Lynette,"he doesn't care about the cake, tom."
12669,Lynette,"yes, that time, the building was empty."
10133,Lynette,"well, sure, no problem."
13254,Lynette,"hey, babe. how'd the test go?"
11595,Lynette,"no, he won't. he takes a pain pill at ten. he's probably already asleep. jeez. how are we gonna make it through the night in here?"
10367,Lynette,what's going on?
12162,Lynette,"well, forget it. let someone else help you with your power grab."
10134,Lynette,"yeah, i can imagine."
9251,Lynette,"guys, guys, guys, hey, my hands are tied. thieves get spanked. just the way it works. unless--"
9047,Lynette,"look, at my old job, we didn't wait for good people to come to us. we went out and raided other companies. i don't see why it should be different when you're hiring a nanny."
9727,Lynette,of course it is.
10728,Lynette,"well, i thought you might need a change of clothes. yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?"
12470,Lynette,"toss it, and keep tossing until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car."
8756,Lynette,"here's, uh, here's what i pulled for edie. i should warn you, most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish."
8968,Lynette,"no, no. let's, let's do it."
9488,Lynette,"yeah, i'll come with you. here i am."
12472,Lynette,"i do, but i'm hoping i'm wrong."
12474,Lynette,"""gigs""? did you just say ""gigs""?"
10497,Lynette,"you're an award-winning copywriter, ed.you get paid to write."
9961,Lynette,"you do that. okay, guys, come on over here. on the sidewalk. stay there. not on the street. thank you."
12457,Lynette,"i know that you have only been the receiving end of break-up letters, but i've actually written a few, and i know how to let him down easy."
12386,Lynette,preston?
10943,Lynette,"you went after my husband. if anyone should be afraid, it's you."
9569,Lynette,"oh, that's fine. i wanted to talk to you about something."
11043,Lynette,"oh, sorry. never made it past the living room."
10992,Lynette,"okay, listen, kids. i am sorry. we shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents wanna protect the kids from scary things."
11532,Lynette,and--and--and you want me to go with you?
11036,Lynette,take a nap.
9118,Lynette,"i know. the way she was talking about mrs. huber, it was like she was already dead."
12209,Lynette,"oh, my god! that's horrible! how did it start?"
9676,Lynette,"are you kidding? this office is paradise. grown-ups talking about grown-up things. no screaming, no vomiting, no boogers under the table. you're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming - weekends, holidays, whenever."
10138,Lynette,why are you telling me this?
12255,Lynette,"i'm looking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer here."
12469,Lynette,"i know. you get winded just climbing out of the tub. you're never gonna climb a mountain. you know what else you're never gonna do? learn german, make your own beer or--have 8 minute abs."
11917,Lynette,why don't you get earplugs?
11134,Lynette,"all right, let's hit it. now come on, kayla."
9402,Lynette,"only for first time guests. normally you'd be having, um, chicken fingers and cartoon shaped macaroni."
11265,Lynette,"okay, just for that, you get to help me take out the trash. i know you think i'm being a hard-ass, but i'm just looking for a basic level of professionalism that--"
11477,Lynette,are you kidding? i should be thanking you. we took in three grand tonight.
12890,Lynette,we're sort of broke.
13073,Lynette,i'm doing the best i can.
11951,Lynette,i want a gun.
11774,Lynette,just go. i'll cab it.
13091,Lynette,maybe they did. anybody seen any dead squirrels around here?
11361,Lynette,"you keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and overuling me, and i'm sick of it. we have to do things my way at least every once in a while."
9858,Lynette,"no, it's fine, i'll pick it up on my way home. so, what do you want?"
10012,Lynette,and i'm gonna take your parking space.
10122,Lynette,"i'm just here to say i am sorry,and i have been a complete idiot."
9574,Lynette,we started to but then *huh* you fell asleep.
9903,Lynette,thank you.
9965,Lynette,"tom, it's nine o'clock at night."
9808,Lynette,"i couldn't find mrs. mulberry's umbrella so i brought her her sun hat instead, all right? and, here we go."
8827,Lynette,i have a theory.
10739,Lynette,could you be all about shutting up!
9845,Lynette,"because of me, my son's imaginary friend got crushed by a garbage truck. i am the worst person in the world."
11008,Lynette,"hey, art."
9747,Lynette,i'm home.
9132,Lynette,about what?
9946,Lynette,"home, home movies. the fact is, we really don't care, and it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart."
11339,Lynette,"oh, don't you dare."
10947,Lynette,a big one with laser beam eyes. now go get daddy!
11639,Lynette,"oh, sure, now and then."
13043,Lynette,i'm--not sure what you're talking about.
13152,Lynette,now? i'm kind of busy!
11031,Lynette,it was a thank you cake. he sort of saved my life.
11074,Lynette,"well, i am sorry that happened."
9029,Lynette,"then i started taking the pills because they gave me energy, but then i couldn't sleep at night, and i was getting so tired in the daytime. and, it totally messed me up. i love my kids so much. i'm so sorry they have me as a mother."
8934,Lynette,my boys are the oak trees.
11429,Lynette,"is that why you apologized, just so i'd-- service you?"
10851,Lynette,hmm.
10876,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
11206,Lynette,"gambling with our life savings and not asking for help doesn't make you a man.it makes you an idiot. come on,tom,for god sakes, we are a team, and that restaurant is a huge undertaking. no one could do it alone."
10165,Lynette,so you're saying that if i died--you would want a second wife and a family?
11971,Lynette,"well, it got me thinking about how much you've had to put your life on hold these past few months."
11800,Lynette,it's okay. come here. let it go.
9667,Lynette,"oh, my cell phone."
9346,Lynette,i don't get it. i don't get who would pay maisy for sex.
12621,Lynette,what are you talking about?
11968,Lynette,"oh, i was just telling everybody the good news about my--cancer."
12633,Lynette,"so do i. and if you ever lay a hand on him again, you will find out just how much."
13175,Lynette,that is so sweet.
12592,Lynette,um--neat or rocks?
10039,Lynette,"oh, nina, come on."
9144,Lynette,the only reason you made love to me the other night was because you had just seen claire naked.
10155,Lynette,it is not the ebola virus.it's chicken pox.you are being a baby.
10692,Lynette,"personally, i love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser you can't beat chicken."
9163,Lynette,"oh, actually, she yelled at me for not bringing my garbage cans in."
9561,Lynette,it's a pattern of behaviour.
10839,Lynette,"oh, he's never gonna quit now!"
8744,Lynette,"i don't know, but check out the postmark."
10957,Lynette,"yeah, yes, i will, i will, i will. i will love her like she is my own. i will, nora. nora? nora!"
12616,Lynette,that's what you were afraid of?
11081,Lynette,"we're not gonna play cards, are we?"
12070,Lynette,i'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.
9935,Lynette,"actually, yes. we've agonized whether to tell you this, norma, but one of your private videos made its way into jimmy and pj's bag."
9265,Lynette,think so?
11763,Lynette,i have cancer.
10602,Lynette,you have no idea how badly you scared me.
9261,Lynette,you know what? this has been fun but now -
12773,Lynette,"look, tom, i can't talk now. just call bob. i'm going over there now. okay. bye."
9544,Lynette,"and i know tom loves me, but i don't trust this woman. i think there's an agenda there. i don't know, maybe i'm being paranoid."
9892,Lynette,okay.
9762,Lynette,all right. i didn't know it was that important to you. i will talk to my boss and i will see what i can do.
10931,Lynette,it's fine with me--soon as you figure out a way to leave your genitals here.
10179,Lynette,you're not limping.did everything go okay?
9503,Lynette,"yes, and it was a beautiful gesture. really. but i-"
10902,Lynette,"well, maybe you should try to patch things up with him."
9274,Lynette,"really, i, i recall no such motto."
10713,Lynette,"oh, there are other urologists in the world. go back to that other guy."
10727,Lynette,they are just two random people who met at a wedding. can't pin it on me.
9774,Lynette,"oh, hey, honey, this is so exciting. your first day of school. you're going to make so many friends."
10378,Lynette,"how can they not?for working parents like you and me, it's a necessity.so is the pot getting sweeter?"
8981,Lynette,i knew this play date was a good idea.
11565,Lynette,"oh, i missed you, too. hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and i will have rick whip something up for us?"
11003,Lynette,"no, i won't. lots of mommies go to the store every day, and they're fine. it's really not a scary place."
10419,Lynette,"i don't either,but on the other hand,she spanked my kids,she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother-in-law.so i'm torn."
9887,Lynette,i'll just wear a different suit then.
12572,Lynette,"just so i'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?"
12169,Lynette,huh. that's nice of you.
9704,Lynette,seriously?
11786,Lynette,"yeah, but between us, you're the one i really want there. out of everyone, you're the most fun, and i need that now."
12624,Lynette,"her name is mrs. schilling. she was your t-ball coach when you were 6. by the way, does your best friend know you're sleeping with his mother?"
10380,Lynette,"yeah?well, that's fantastic!"
11142,Lynette,kids. they're always rough housing.
8962,Lynette,okay.
9709,Lynette,"makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
9444,Lynette,you did. why do i do it? this compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn't belong. i mean--
9446,Lynette,"oh, please."
11770,Lynette,by taking all the fun of the kill?
10944,Lynette,"sweetie, it's mommy. i need to talk to daddy."
11703,Lynette,what's that supposed to mean?
11996,Lynette,why can't you take her? you are in that huge house all by yourself that you got from the divorce.
11228,Lynette,yeah--it heals a little slower when the bullet's still in there.
11313,Lynette,i'm happy for you.
10685,Lynette,"oh, apology accepted.you want me to walk you to your car?"
10766,Lynette,"see?this is what you do. you just manipulate. you wormed your way into my family. you conned your way into coming on this trip with me, and now you wanna force me into saving you. well, forget it! you wanna go, go."
9440,Lynette,"no, because your husband was being a total jerk!"
10062,Lynette,you're mindy's father. you have a right to spend time with her.
12637,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?
12031,Lynette,"drop it? do you hear that? she wants me to drop it. and when she cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, i bet she wanted you to drop that, too."
13166,Lynette,oh. was it good?
10183,Lynette,staying home and taking care of the kids doesn't make you less of a man.that's crazy.
11163,Lynette,fine! good night.
11068,Lynette,our neighbor is a pedophile.
10919,Lynette,you will never again see my husband.
11254,Lynette,"you got it, ed."
9886,Lynette,"um, i wasn't planning to, uh, but why?"
13107,Lynette,at work.
11146,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
9101,Lynette,"where is she, by the way? i haven't seen her in days."
10469,Lynette,because--it's rude.
11376,Lynette,"listen to me. i forbid you to die. if you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids, i swear i will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay. do you hear me? come on, baby--oh, please."
8728,Lynette,i wasn't expecting you for a week!
10465,Lynette,excuse me?
10043,Lynette,our company insurance policy. you ever bother to read it?
12998,Lynette,enough with the shrugging. come on.
12632,Lynette,"i know everything, okay?"
12609,Lynette,okay. hurry back.
12583,Lynette,i think--it's great.
9994,Lynette,you're being rude and it's totally out of line. you know how hard we all worked on this.
8819,Lynette,why not?
12804,Lynette,how about we pick something from your cookbook?
9928,Lynette,"guys, what is this?"
10563,Lynette,"hey! great.great. how's atlantic city?are you, um, winning some money?"
9852,Lynette,"oh, for god's sakes."
12251,Lynette,"no, sorry. i hope you find him."
12204,Lynette,but-- nothing ever happened between us. you have to believe me. come on!
11652,Lynette,it could ruin your friendship. are you willing to take that chance?
13303,Lynette,"hell, yeah.first, i want you to touch yourself."
10895,Lynette,"fine, gaby! don't say hi!"
12012,Lynette,you're waiting outside. why are you waiting outside?
12454,Lynette,"okay-- remember how you told me i should stop talking to him online? well, of course, i didn't, and i sort of told him i liked his poetry."
9797,Lynette,"i hope you're right. at the risk of sounding too sensitive,"" ""how come she gets a bigger portion?"
13235,Lynette,what was that? i thought you said the tour was fantastic.
9407,Lynette,i can't believe you said we'd play tennis with them.
9235,Lynette,"you're right. you're right. i guess i just got so upset because - oh, whatever, let's not beat a dead horse, it's over, i'm sorry, good night."
9530,Lynette,tom!
9881,Lynette,"well, i don't usually do this."
13089,Lynette,all right.
9938,Lynette,"they need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home. and, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex."
12948,Lynette,does she know you painted it?
12265,Lynette,well--yeah. think of what that poor girl has been through. and on top of that--her mom was kind of a psycho.
9360,Lynette,"what do friends do? they call, they're sympathetic, they ask about the pain the other person is going through, and then they listen."
11725,Lynette,what the hell happened? how could she pull a stunt like this?
9634,Lynette,you're gonna lose it?
13035,Lynette,"isn't she fun? hey, carlos. did i ever tell you that tom a i seriously considered you and gaby for penny's godparents?"
12762,Lynette,what?
11007,Lynette,yeah? okay.
9296,Lynette,tom--
8943,Lynette,"oh, that's very kind of you, but i just smoked some crack a little while ago, so i better not mix."
9924,Lynette,"rest assured, we have not forgotten. see ya!"
12016,Lynette,"oh, just a little cancer. no, but i kicked its ass. i'm good now. you come here. oh! so why--why are you here?"
11251,Lynette,"uh, on the mend, but i'm gonna be there bright and early monday morning."
11343,Lynette,nine years--and i have loved every minute of it.
9871,Lynette,thank you.
11977,Lynette,wait a minute. that was all the money you had?
9151,Lynette,"he doesn't have a cough yet, but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening."
10694,Lynette,"he says he innocent. she believes him. if we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us."
9266,Lynette,"i need to know if my policy covers it. no, my car actually wasn't involved. it was my neighbor's car, but the egg was mine. uh huh. can i please speak to your supervisor?"
13125,Lynette,"hey, is this gorgonzola?"
11421,Lynette,"wait, wait, wait! please don't do this. please. i am at the end of my rope."
11120,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. those are the rules."
10413,Lynette,"and--so-- what,you want me to lie?make you look good?"
12288,Lynette,i think we have a seriously troubled young girl.
12263,Lynette,"you didn't see her. she just sat there, playing with her doll with this kind of eerie calm."
13156,Lynette,what are you doing?
10259,Lynette,but--
11883,Lynette,yeah.
11453,Lynette,so--good news! our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
10191,Lynette,we've got-- nothing.
11017,Lynette,okay.
9024,Lynette,"no, tom, you can't do this to me. because, i need you at home. boys, stop it, i am on the phone. well, yeah, i realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed, but you promised you'd be back tonight. i, i, i gotta go. the kids are-- yeah, i know-- you're sorry, just, will you try to get back as soon as you can? okay, bye."
8821,Lynette,you're wearing a really big hat.
10445,Lynette,"oh,my goodness."
12967,Lynette,"okay. bruce, could you hold that thought? i'm gonna be right back."
9152,Lynette,"hi, i understand your agency handles nannies. uh, i need someone experienced and preferably unattractive."
8776,Lynette,"oh, i don't think so. oh!"
12052,Lynette,yeah.
9076,Lynette,"if i don't get some help, i will lose my mind.where can i score some high-grade nanny?"
12912,Lynette,"all right, that's a large mushroom pepperoni pizza and two salads. i'll get that started. tom, i got need a large---"
8830,Lynette,why didn't she say anything?
10934,Lynette,i am right there with you.
13231,Lynette,oh!
10029,Lynette,"well, i'm not gonna lie to you. there is a possibility she'd get a slap on the wrist. so, you'll think about talking to ed?"
9691,Lynette,ah.
8862,Lynette,boys! stop it! go to bed.
10860,Lynette,"oh, great. so, uh, tom will drop her off at your house on friday."
10423,Lynette,"uh,all the bells and whistles,but listen--i really wanted to tell you how sorry i am."
11236,Lynette,thanks.
9130,Lynette,good morning.
11356,Lynette,"focus, people! the subject is shirts. it's killing morale."
8950,Lynette,your sorry ass. we're throwing down.
8840,Lynette,i used to run a company with 85 people and now i can't wrangle three small boys without doping them. talk about feeling like a failure.
9479,Lynette,hey hey hey. hey! why are you stealing my garbage cans?
8823,Lynette,you look-ridiculous in that thing.
11666,Lynette,this whole thing is ridiculous. i bumped my head.
9997,Lynette,"no, stu! these people don't deserve muffins."
11558,Lynette,"hi, mrs.mccluskey. would you like some cake?"
12888,Lynette,"yes, i do. and the minute we're back on our feet, i am gonna pay back your investment--every penny, with interest."
13045,Lynette,"well, i'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until i got something better--"
11158,Lynette,"might there be a v.i.p. preview for people, say, who bore your children?"
8764,Lynette,goodbye.
11559,Lynette,you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.
9417,Lynette,sorry. i should have mentioned that my tennis is much better than my cooking.
10813,Lynette,"aw, you're sweet. bree, i'm sorry. i think you gotta follow your heart on this one, even if it isn't the easiest thing to do."
8801,Lynette,"margarita, cigar, sombrero."
11785,Lynette,"oh, not that. okay, i don't know how to say this, so i'm just gonna say it. when everyone was offering to come with me to chemo--even katherine, who i don't even know, you sort of clammed up. what was that about?"
11831,Lynette,sorry.
8786,Lynette,"we didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies, the party's off."
9954,Lynette,"well, that sounds expensive."
11492,Lynette,thank you. so have you told bree about your engagement?
10768,Lynette,"oh, my god, nora. did you actually-- well, i'm-- i'm very sorry. i had no idea. but your life is better now, right? you have a beautiful daughter, and you have that fun job at the--pancake house."
10116,Lynette,come here.
12805,Lynette,"yes, 'cause that's what women in their eighth month really crave--more stove time."
12010,Lynette,okay. okay. i guess you're right.
12541,Lynette,"so--give me some guidance. do i grovel, send flowers, or--"
9830,Lynette,"hey, buddy. you busy?"
10729,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i was desperate. i had a little too much to drink and you are divorcing carlos."
11821,Lynette,"wow, sweetie. those really look delicious, but i just don't feel like eating right now."
11616,Lynette,"yes, flirting! that's it! it's what married people do, because we know there is a line you don't cross. and maybe i've gotten close to that line, and maybe i've enjoyed getting close to that line, but i have never once crossed it."
10571,Lynette,hello?
8716,Lynette,"paul. we have to leave now. once again, i am so sorry for your loss. go!"
11856,Lynette,"oh, okay."
12940,Lynette,i think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything. let's just hug and move on. okay?
11127,Lynette,she is special. now sit down. come on.
9788,Lynette,"you're gonna be great, parker. i love you."
9036,Lynette,"that is so like you, edie. you're always thinking of others."
11408,Lynette,"but seriously, why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?"
10667,Lynette,"yeah, your damn straight i lied.i will not have that lunatic ruining one more family gathering."
9825,Lynette,"no! no, no, no, no, no! it would help if you came up with some ideas."
9985,Lynette,i'm just trying to prove a point.
9045,Lynette,all your rich friends have nannies. a-list nannies. i need to catch one--here you go--without their bosses.
12867,Lynette,yep. just adding the parmesan.
11312,Lynette,"okay, okay, we could point fingers, but what's important is forgetting about what we expected, and focusing on what we have, which isn't so bad. i mean, all the different kinds of chairs give the place a kind of bohemian vibe. plus, if we get a lot of babies, look, we're just totally set. tom, i'm sorry. i am. i'm sorry. i just, i realize it's not perfect. but--please say something."
12667,Lynette,"maybe he didn't. but ten minutes later, that nightclub was on fire."
10299,Lynette,come on out.
10916,Lynette,"okay. never mind. i'm leaving. first, i'm just gonna give your mom a hug."
12683,Lynette,"did you set that fire at the nightclub? before you answer, let me say that if you did, i promise, your father and i will stand behind you and try and find some way out of this nightmare. but if you lie to me, and i find out later that you--killed--those people--well, i will love you. that will never change, but i won't believe in you anymore, and if i--don't believe in you--i can't help you. we have to tell each other the truth from here on out."
13018,Lynette,"okay. okay. not to pry, but when you said carlos took you to st. barths--"
12935,Lynette,"look, i know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be."
12747,Lynette,fine. you know what you're going to do with it? you are going to call your brother and tell him to come home.
12507,Lynette,"well, they overshot and wound up in ""bland,"" right on the border of ""sucky."" you need to grab your audience, just grab 'em. i've gone for jazzier colors, bolder fonts. oh, i have really played up the whole nostalgia angle."
10493,Lynette,"god,i don't know.i'm gonna go check with ed."
12312,Lynette,"she did, so you can kiss that little blackmail scheme good-bye."
12266,Lynette,"i am just saying, apple--tree. maybe not so far."
13260,Lynette,really? you passed the test?
9999,Lynette,"i left a proposal on my desk at work. i have to go over it tonight, or you-know-who's gonna have my head."
10018,Lynette,"come on, nina, we both know why you got rid of him."
11176,Lynette,"no, he didn't. don't, um, restaurants make half their money on the liquor?"
10010,Lynette,"yeah. pretty sweet deal, don't you think?"
12268,Lynette,"well, i thought you might like to have a safe place where you could share your feelings. you know? with your mom's death and moving in with us, you've been through a lot."
11973,Lynette,"come on. it must be driving you crazy living with five screaming kids underfoot. i don't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet. you need to leave, mom."
10743,Lynette,hey.
10911,Lynette,mmm. so what happened tonight?
13049,Lynette,i don't know. i'm just as worried as you are.
10907,Lynette,hey.
11354,Lynette,"no. no, don't be silly. who am i, tom? i'm one of you guys. sit down. hey--you know what we could use? a good old-fashioned bi*ch session, get some stuff off our chests. so what's bugging you guys? okay, i'll go first. how do we feel about these uniforms? a little--eh?"
12828,Lynette,we agreed i could go back to work after i gave birth.
9383,Lynette,and the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fall?
9467,Lynette,it does work. it does work most of the time.
10885,Lynette,fine.
9509,Lynette,"six months from now when they find her mummified corpse at the bottom of the stairs what do i tell the kids? oh yeah, i let mrs mcclusky die."
10732,Lynette,"no, seriously, gaby, i am so tired of pretending to smile."
12666,Lynette,"tom, i was 6 feet away. porter looked warren schilling in the eye and said, ""you're dead. i don't care what it takes. you're dead."""
13122,Lynette,this dinner is delicious. you really didn't have to do this.
11587,Lynette,the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
10409,Lynette,"well,it makes sense,i guess."
9598,Lynette,"no, there's nothing to fix. we've changed. that's all i'm saying."
9943,Lynette,no!
9339,Lynette,tammy brennan spent a fortune on topher's party. she'd call in specialists from switzerland before she'd let it be canceled.
12792,Lynette,here's a thought--stop being angry.
9333,Lynette,"aah, aah, aah."
9232,Lynette,"no, he's not."
11194,Lynette,"this place is his dream, and if he can't make it work, then it's just gonna kill him, and consequently it's gonna kill our marriage."
9256,Lynette,hey.
12506,Lynette,"well, who knew your marketing guys were such lame-os? what they came up with is so--tepid."
11459,Lynette,"and we charge twenty dollars! four people who would've shared a fifteen dollar pizza are now spending eighty bucks. okay, kids, dig in!"
10148,Lynette,what? why? i called.the machine kept picking up.
11762,Lynette,you with us?
10486,Lynette,"ed? hey,i'm so sorry,but obviously that was just meant for tom's eyes only."
10304,Lynette,hey!
11531,Lynette,such food exists? don't tease me.
10117,Lynette,"thank you.thank you for reminding me that i am the only woman in the whole world who could love an ""idiot"" like you.i'll talk to gaby."
13138,Lynette,i've gotta say it is. you become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to--
9498,Lynette,now's not a good time. i'm on my way out and i have a tonne of errands.
11813,Lynette,you're suggesting pot?
11534,Lynette,"no, it would be, but sunday nights are kind of crazy. i'm packing lunches and checking homework--"
10852,Lynette,i think-- i'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
13148,Lynette,"but i have so much to do, and i'm not gonna be done till 2:00 a.m. possibly 3:00. whoo!"
11754,Lynette,"i'm sorry,sweetie.i'm just-- i'm just too tired right now."
10517,Lynette,"god,your mind goes to dark places."
9079,Lynette,"yeah? well, brussel sprouts help you grow. you don't want to be short your whole life, do you? here, look, you know what we'll do? we're gonna dip them in a little cheese. here you go. good, yummy!"
9357,Lynette,"she's devastated about the breakup, and she hasn't left the house in days."
12378,Lynette,where the hell are you going with this?
8987,Lynette,"no, really, hear me out. put a big spotless scrub ad between a woman and her cashmere sweater, and i guarantee you'll get her attention."
11720,Lynette,stop comparing us. i never did what you did.
11772,Lynette,"you are supposed to be distracting me, not depressing the hell out of me."
9779,Lynette,"hi, i'm back. how's he doing?"
10057,Lynette,excuse me?
11505,Lynette,"hi, honey."
12547,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
11614,Lynette,i don't know what you're talking about. there's nothing to admit.
9993,Lynette,"could you can the attitude, nina?"
12397,Lynette,sorry.
12402,Lynette,don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
13292,Lynette,"parker, knock it off."
10863,Lynette,and make tom resent me for the rest of his life. i don't think so.
13253,Lynette,"oh, jeezs."
12788,Lynette,"hey, mom. i just came by to tell you that the judge threw out porter's case for lack of evidence. isn't that great? mom--i did not put you in here to punish you. i didn't have a choice."
11126,Lynette,i don't care. we have rules.
10106,Lynette,no.
9231,Lynette,that man is not coming back in this house.
9159,Lynette,"okay, boys."
9526,Lynette,"i almost forgot, your file. here."
12494,Lynette,"so--now my marriage is in trouble, and you're gonna save it by giving tom a bass?"
11707,Lynette,"until your wedding, of course."
9172,Lynette,yes! yes! i am mad at you.
12319,Lynette,mm-hmm.
12695,Lynette,like why do the police have a witness?
10803,Lynette,"i'm gonna go buy him an ice cream. it's okay, p-dog. you're gonna get 'em the next inning! so tell me, what else do you know about this nicky kid?"
12482,Lynette,"hey, is everything all right? oh, my!"
13263,Lynette,"this is lynette scavo. may i please speak to dr. rushton? tell him it's important. dr. rushton, i need to come in and see you as soon as possible. i think the cancer's back."
11242,Lynette,"until he turned eighteen, which was a month ago."
12061,Lynette,i didn't realize there'd be a cat. tom's really allergic.
12363,Lynette,"bree's in a horrible jam, and i told her we'd help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow."
11083,Lynette,"thanks so much, rita. i think it's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and--wow."
9841,Lynette,oh. goodie!
12389,Lynette,"asked and answered. okay, that's it! everybody out. game's over. can i have your chair for a second? hey! look up here! mom's here. party's over. door's open. out you go. go on. shoo! you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts. but this? this? risking our liquor license, our livelihood?"
13004,Lynette,"okay, i'm gonna stop you. what is this obsession with age? i am a vital woman with passion and a library of knowledge when it comes to this industry. why doesn't that count for something?"
11202,Lynette,"okay, let's say just for the sake of argument, that someone else did. someone who clearly loves you very much. what's wrong with that?"
10210,Lynette,what about penny?
10930,Lynette,she's tom's daughter. you can't just take her out of the country.
9128,Lynette,what?
9908,Lynette,okay.
12800,Lynette,"well, we watch the kids play soccer."
10046,Lynette,"well, maybe if i talked to her."
12790,Lynette,it's not a very pleasant experience.
11914,Lynette,"yes, but that was before your best friend threw her scarf in the ring."
12567,Lynette,"where have you been? so help me, if mccluskey gets there before us, i will brain you."
10753,Lynette,"ah, i don't have a problem.i just don't think we both need to go up there.i can grab kayla and bring her back."
10894,Lynette,you were trying to figure out how to kill edie without doing time.
12049,Lynette,"oh, yeah. you're welcome. um--can we stay in your basement?"
11806,Lynette,"we should go, too. get a few drinks in her, see if she loosens up."
8768,Lynette,"boys? boys? boys?? if you're hiding, you've gotta stop now cause mommy doesn't think it's funny!"
8750,Lynette,"i yelled at them. they never listen to me, it's very frustrating."
8912,Lynette,ah-ha!
11911,Lynette,"hey. listen, i promised tom i wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so i was hoping you could help me--you know, ring some bells, talk me up, that sort of thing?"
9976,Lynette,"so, what if the stranger says they're gonna take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides? don't look at your dad. eyes on me. what are you gonna do? what are you gonna do?"
10025,Lynette,being intimate. and nina fired you to keep ed from finding out.
11210,Lynette,"oh, i'm sure it will be."
10052,Lynette,"really? yeah. look, i'm gonna level with you. parcher and murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least sixteen kids and without little mindy, we only have fifteen."
12568,Lynette,"well, sheesh. oh. sweetie, we already got karen a candle. an r.v. might be overkill."
11981,Lynette,have fun.
9612,Lynette,what?
9034,Lynette,i'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
12325,Lynette,are you-- threatening me?
10718,Lynette,the point is alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
9092,Lynette,"so if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?"
9769,Lynette,"because we can't escape the fact that i have kids. i love my job, but to be fair, there's gotta be some balance."
10289,Lynette,hi. excuse me.hi.you called and you said my kids are here?
9253,Lynette,"all right, start with 'dear mrs. mccluskey.'"
9007,Lynette,"i hope this works. my sleep cycle is totally out of whack. i'm up all night, i'm dozing off during the day."""
11789,Lynette,"gaby, where have you been? you went to the bathroom, like, half an hour ago."
9381,Lynette,"no, not -- not -- not quite yet. boys, keep bouncing. that's right. keep bouncing. oh, by the way, i spoke to nurse abigail. i know who patient zero is."
12504,Lynette,"well, gee, i don't know. i guess the same place that you find time for your garage band."
12471,Lynette,hey.
12728,Lynette,it's not just money.
10354,Lynette,"okay,okay,can i just mention you're talking like a crazy person?"
9555,Lynette,good.
9720,Lynette,"yeah, i sorta did."
10070,Lynette,"i am not on your side, ed."
13296,Lynette,"honey, i'm hating you a little right now."
12580,Lynette,"so funny. i was gonna ask you the same question. but i was gonna start with ""what the hell?"""
9854,Lynette,why don't you buy her a drink?
12036,Lynette,what are you talking about?
8846,Lynette,why? we unloaded a lot on you.
13053,Lynette,mm. why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend? that was fun.
11746,Lynette,no! it's too late!
10612,Lynette,our daughter is officially named.you may go now.
9021,Lynette,"what? oh--right! okay, boys. this knot is called the bowline. it is a remarkably useful knot. now, pick up your ropes. okay. first we cross this end over here, and then we make a loop, and then another loop, and then you sort of pull it through, i'm guessing, and then, ready? yank it taut."
12705,Lynette,"tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon. you mind? thanks."
11496,Lynette,"she's reworked the lyrics to ""wind beneath my wings."""
13056,Lynette,"or what, i'll turn to stone? she's all rough and gritty."
10921,Lynette,okay. see you later.
11076,Lynette,i'll do the chips. you deal.
12081,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9017,Lynette,sure. whatever.
11133,Lynette,yeah. i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children.
8796,Lynette,"i'm sure it's not that bad. he's coming to the party, right?"
11897,Lynette,i don't think katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
12960,Lynette,yeah.
8953,Lynette,how do you cram it all in?
10615,Lynette,okay.
10400,Lynette,that's chocolate milk.i shouldn't be having it.have you ever had any?
11054,Lynette,"he's not at our house, he's not in our yard. do not jerk me around."
9427,Lynette,"so, how are you?"
8695,Lynette,touch every inch of your body until you're trembling.
12302,Lynette,"of course i do--as much as i can, given the way she joined our family. it's just--it's complicated."
11562,Lynette,hey! hi! what are you doing here?
12880,Lynette,"i've worked my ass off, too. i just wasn't as lucky as you."
9012,Lynette,i'm sorry. you were saying something about wind?
10317,Lynette,really?is that why you passed out on your front lawn yesterday morning?
13133,Lynette,"yeah. but just to be on the safe side, if i fall in my tub again, let me die there."
10866,Lynette,"of course you did, 'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea i have to make the whole thing work."
8891,Lynette,so he just blew you off?
13224,Lynette,what?
13132,Lynette,"it's my fault. i should have just told tom the truth, although it turned out to be kind of a wash with the whole patty rizzo thing."
9317,Lynette,"well, it's great, obviously. thank you."
13008,Lynette,"nobody cares how old you are, tom."
13101,Lynette,hmm. that's okay. i can see it from here. thrilling. mwah.
10858,Lynette,why?
12759,Lynette,"there is not a shred of evidence against you. when people see that, they will be on your side just like we are. sweetie, you have to trust me."
12731,Lynette,"bob, you've been going at this for over an hour. why don't we take a break?"
12233,Lynette,"sure, i do. it must've been some other random maniac with a grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant."
11340,Lynette,"i had a lot of time to think tonight, and i realized you were right. we have to keep the romance going, no matter how tired we are. the only thing worse than just going through the motions is not bothering to go through the motions."
8961,Lynette,great! you wanna run it by me?
12267,Lynette,"well, actually, this is a different kind of doctor. you know, the kind you can talk to?"
12678,Lynette,i'll pick you up tonight. i'll give you a ride to the bus station. you can count it then.
9819,Lynette,uh huh.
10081,Lynette,"yeah.i know this sounds silly,but--it kind of bugged me."
12120,Lynette,"okay, split up, and i'll meet you back at the car. go!"
8753,Lynette,my babysitter joined the witness relocation program. i haven't slept through the night in 6 years.
9874,Lynette,yeah.
9536,Lynette,"no, i wanted to see you."
9020,Lynette,the scout meeting is today?
13272,Lynette,how long have you been sniffing those markers? of course with a baby.
12405,Lynette,you think they're cool.
8882,Lynette,that's wonderful.
12424,Lynette,yeah. remember when you spent the entire day on the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob? worst anniversary ever.
12526,Lynette,oh!
12229,Lynette,and tom was at the founder's ball with me.
11446,Lynette,of course! absolutely!
10734,Lynette,"no, no, you'll be fine."
9610,Lynette,hey.
11021,Lynette,"parker, come on, we're gonna get out of here."
11945,Lynette,"honey, i put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it. the man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures, and there's only one way to stop 'em."
11197,Lynette,glad you thought so.
8980,Lynette,dana. wow. dana was a baby.
11405,Lynette,not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss. you are doing very well.
9437,Lynette,"lily, we're coming back."
10850,Lynette,isn't he the one that asked us for a loan last christmas?
12610,Lynette,what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
9493,Lynette,i don't know what to say. it's stunning. thank you.
11633,Lynette,"there's nothing to talk about, okay? just leave me alone."
11481,Lynette,"i mean, unless you'd like to go. you're here so late all the time."
11442,Lynette,why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?
11342,Lynette,"well, after this year, i would be happy with any date that included food and shelter."
11200,Lynette,really? that's great!
13202,Lynette,"oh, my husband wants to spend money we don't have on a face-lift he doesn't need, so--not great."
9679,Lynette,"okay, let's get outta here. tom?"
11080,Lynette,"okay, okay, we've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam. whoo! let's play some cards."
11841,Lynette,"parents who weren't stoned. my whole childhood passed in a blur because you were medicating yourself--pot when you were sick, booze when you weren't. i am not going to do that. i won't miss a second of my kids' lives, not if i can avoid it."
11049,Lynette,"i'm sorry, guys, i just--i guess i was really tired. where's your brother?"
11337,Lynette,"i appreciate what you were trying to do. it was a lovely thought that just went hideously, hideously, hideously wrong."
11586,Lynette,okay.
10325,Lynette,"yeah. no,i get the subtle distinction.i think we can do better.okay? so,sally,you're up.what do you got for me?"
9425,Lynette,"hey, alisa, hey lily, how are you guys?"
10261,Lynette,"you know, ed,i've been thinking.we've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,but maybe it's time to set a slightly more profession tone in the office."
13311,Lynette,i hardly think the kids are going to suffer without a clump of fur on their heads.
9771,Lynette,"not now, stu. hang on a sec."
11186,Lynette,thank you.
11709,Lynette,"nothing. same old, same old."
12323,Lynette,"all right. thank you. if you're hungry, i'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car."
13287,Lynette,could you hold her?
13055,Lynette,mm. i'll take her. kinda looks like cat litter.
12665,Lynette,"you might wanna go ahead and give him those pain pills, doc. he's gonna need them."
10587,Lynette,would it be better if we came back at another time?
10773,Lynette,he doesn't hate advertising.
9276,Lynette,no. i'll just wait out here.
9400,Lynette,"why wait, why don't we just rip it up now."
9476,Lynette,now go brush your teeth and i want them to sparkle. go on.
12331,Lynette,"tom, if you had been there and heard what she said--"
12925,Lynette,"tom, it's fine. i'll take the table."
12650,Lynette,i went over to talk to anne about recent developments.
12486,Lynette,hey.
9448,Lynette,you know what i admire you for? you find a way to compliment me when you could say 'i told you so.'
9816,Lynette,oh. that must have been ugly.
12314,Lynette,mnh-mnh.
13114,Lynette,"oh, crap. i'll be right there! aah!"
13121,Lynette,could you maybe step outside? i only do one show a day.
9422,Lynette,"yeah, well it's not working too well if you have to unload on a perfect stranger, is it? if you're unhappy in your marriage, do something, instead of just complaining, 'cause frankly, i don't want to hear it!"
12172,Lynette,well--there are some things that are easy to believe in.
11796,Lynette,i get it. you're uncomfortable. just go. i'm fine. i'm fine.
13143,Lynette,"i'm totally slammed, which is why i'm calling. it looks like i'm gonna be here late tonight, and by ""late,"" i mean past midnight."
10188,Lynette,"here we are at ""t"" minus 9 hours and 11 minutes from the biggest pitch in our company's history,and i have nothing even vaguely presentable."
9879,Lynette,happily married.
10529,Lynette,we're a team.i'm just lending support.
9636,Lynette,"uh, you can, honey, if you can pay for it."
9623,Lynette,"i know it seems like we're ganging up on you, but you're moving so fast we thought a sort of intervention was necessary."
11627,Lynette,"i missed you, too."
10723,Lynette,"hey, carlos. you should come over to our table. that's where all the hotties are."
9900,Lynette,"oh, no. come on, tom. not this one."
11168,Lynette,oh-- my-- god.
10550,Lynette,"no! except that i know you've been to atlantic city three times in the last month without telling me.ed found the receipts when he did the office audit.other than that,no, nothing's wrong."
13286,Lynette,really--
8999,Lynette,"i'm fine, really--what's going on outside?"
10013,Lynette,i kid the nina!
10621,Lynette,"i don't..well, here goes."
9662,Lynette,go on. off. good.
10714,Lynette,"oh, it's once a year. suck it up."
11230,Lynette,everything.
13228,Lynette,i want you to get this stupid europe idea out of his head. take him on a tour of the campus. get him excited. show him college could be fun.
10405,Lynette,huh?
9591,Lynette,tom!
11721,Lynette,you're leaving tomorrow. i don't want your money. i don't want you imy house.
10656,Lynette,"fine, fine, no absolutely fine. put crazy' at the end and we'll crop her out later."
9028,Lynette,"no, no, i'm sorry, i can't do this. it's just too much. boys, you stay with your aunt susan."
12936,Lynette,and that is so great. so when do you think that great thing might happen?
9929,Lynette,"oh my god! oh my god, where's the off button?"
10847,Lynette,"okay, okay, i'm dying here. what's the dream?"
10174,Lynette,with a vasec to me.
11722,Lynette,you can't stay if i don't want you here.
11854,Lynette,what?
10920,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
13246,Lynette,coming. i'm coming.
12776,Lynette,do you know what's going on with porter? the fire? the arrest?
11832,Lynette,yes! yes! yes!
11428,Lynette,"but you can't bend at the waist, and that pretty much leaves the heavy lifting to me."
8944,Lynette,"jordana, maisy, here are the costumes, right on time."
9354,Lynette,"um, i'm not sure."
10745,Lynette,"oh, well why don't you take a muscle relaxant."
9989,Lynette,well-
10349,Lynette,hi! what's up?
12390,Lynette,unbelievable. you guys are grounded for two weeks.
12459,Lynette,uh-- thanks.
9212,Lynette,thank you.
12087,Lynette,"no. no, i guess not."
10149,Lynette,chicken pox?that's the emergency?
13023,Lynette,"yea, i do."
9358,Lynette,because it's personal. it's the kind of thing she would only want me to tell her friends.
12612,Lynette,"i always knew things could change between us, tom, but no matter what, the one thing i always thought i'd get is your respect."
10282,Lynette,we will find someone--someone who doesn't remember what they were doing the day lincoln was shot.
10159,Lynette,"hi,carlos."
10197,Lynette,"uh, well, i rewrote some of the stuff we worked on,but, you know, essentially, it's the same, and they ate it up."
12427,Lynette,"no, listen. this is important. when they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, ""relax! they're young. when they're older, they'll get it."" well, tom, they're 16 now. not getting it. we have a lot of work to do in a very short time, and if you and i aren't in sync, i'm afraid it's not gonna happen."
9730,Lynette,"no, tom! tom, no! i'm gonna change the sheets!"
10510,Lynette,you can't make my husband your scapegoat.i won't let you.
9255,Lynette,"well, too bad for you. okay, start with a big em, little c. good."
12745,Lynette,you know where he is!
8700,Lynette,"i know someone, who knows someone, who knows an elf. and if anyone of you acts up, so help me, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas. you willing to risk that?"
9477,Lynette,"hey. look, i just wanted to apologise."
9060,Lynette,i just want to talk.
9838,Lynette,"i mean this is conjecture on my part, but it is possible that someone like little spencer needs mrs. mulberry more 'cause he doesn't have a daddy and a mommy who love him. yeah, that's it. he's an orphan with no hands. okay?"
13203,Lynette,and? how's he look?
11295,Lynette,"tom, i do not need to be pregnant to kick your ass. now go. go on."
10361,Lynette,"aw,sweetie."
9154,Lynette,i'm here for the 10 a.m. yoga meditation class.
10076,Lynette,we've got day care!
13020,Lynette,"yeah. yeah, that gaby's a real class act."
8871,Lynette,you're not having any more kids. what do you care?
12852,Lynette,that must be nice. but--i can't accept it.
11612,Lynette,"what? i'm so sorry. oh, my god. i'm so sorry. that paranoid idiot. you know, i knew it. i knew when we were watching the surveillance tapes that he would completely misinterpret it."
12391,Lynette,"yeah, yeah! keep complaining. i'd love to make it a year. now clean this place up. now!"
11844,Lynette,what?
8927,Lynette,"that would have never happened in boy scouts. when i worked, mostly with men, i preferred the way they fought. a guy takes his opponent on, face to face, and once he's won, he's top dog. it's primitive, but it's fair."
10666,Lynette,i told her that we were picking up kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.
9635,Lynette,"yep, that'll do it."
10935,Lynette,"i don't, but i didn't want the first four, and they're starting to grow on me."
13233,Lynette,really?
11072,Lynette,i'm not sad. he shouldn't be around kids. i saw those pictures.
12157,Lynette,"no. i just put 10 bucks in the collection plate, and i'm gonna get my money's worth."
9567,Lynette,please do.
12549,Lynette,penny!
11388,Lynette,i'm the one that told you that.
8906,Lynette,"boys,could you stop?"
9772,Lynette,this system is gonna let mommy be with you on your first day of school. the resolution is fantastic.
10214,Lynette,i'll go.
13078,Lynette,isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
11273,Lynette,"look, i don't know what kind of hustle you pulled on him, but it's not gonna work on me."
12452,Lynette,porter sent me a sex poem.
9037,Lynette,sunscreen?
13067,Lynette,"um, i--edie, i have chemo in half an hour."
9668,Lynette,apparently rex's heart just gave out.
11550,Lynette,don't turn around. m.
13268,Lynette,excuse me?
10108,Lynette,"i never said that.what i said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.it's obviously an issue for me.and yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.so you tell me,are you hitting on him?"
10356,Lynette,"oh,that's ridiculous."
11545,Lynette,gaby's coming.
12216,Lynette,"yeah. i was thinkin', if anyone asks about that fire at rick's, it'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were."
9594,Lynette,"that's annabel, how ironic."
8761,Lynette,you're kidding.
10136,Lynette,yeah?
10581,Lynette,"your family had eight sets of twins over three generations, not to mention your relatives in kentucky with triplets!triplets! so i ask you, do i not deserve to punish this man severely?"
12343,Lynette,"oh, susan. he's adorable."
12864,Lynette,"well, we've filled the place many times, but it's your party. whatever you want."
9070,Lynette,how can you stay here after the way she treats you?
9306,Lynette,"more travel? tom, you're barely here half the time as it is. now you're going to have -- what, twice the work load?"
11099,Lynette,what do you mean?
9199,Lynette,"hey, rodney!"
12206,Lynette,the obnoxious backstabber just called your name.
11370,Lynette,yeah. we could hire a manager or something.
12724,Lynette,"hey, preston."
9512,Lynette,have you been taking your arthritis medication?
8880,Lynette,what is a must-meet list?
12428,Lynette,thank you. but you didn't have to--
12281,Lynette,come on. i do.
12769,Lynette,ah.
10531,Lynette,here are the numbers you wanted.
9949,Lynette,"well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional."
12485,Lynette,"oh, tom! she's up in her room."
11661,Lynette,you had lunch with rick.
8838,Lynette,fine.
9893,Lynette,"okay, don't be distracted by that. look at me. here i am tomorrow, making my presentation."
9302,Lynette,you're going after tim doogan's promotion?
9368,Lynette,they didn't?
8732,Lynette,"well, is it ok if i just lie here?"
11372,Lynette,i'm an idiot. would you guys mind--
12398,Lynette,you have to. i am tired of being the bad cop. you walk the beat for a while.
9262,Lynette,get out of my house!
11222,Lynette,"well, whatever it is gonna take."
12591,Lynette,okay. drive safely.
12851,Lynette,"no. thank you, but i can't accept this. however, i would like to know how much i'm not accepting. $20,000? how many cookbooks are you selling, woman?"
12861,Lynette,tom and i are so grateful for your investment that we want to do something special for you.
11030,Lynette,the door was open--i was bringing him a cake.
10192,Lynette,"come on, i'm sorry.i just really need to focus here."
10109,Lynette,"well,that's not entirely true."
9355,Lynette,huh?
9000,Lynette,how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
10410,Lynette,"i,i'll focus on your good qualities."
10017,Lynette,i can't believe you would sink so low. i'm going to ed.
12952,Lynette,susan!
11890,Lynette,"thanks, sweetheart. hello. oh, yeah. hi, dr. shiller. okay, that's my white blood count. uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, that means i don't have neutropenia, right? well, that's great. thanks for calling. yeah, you, too. bye."
9412,Lynette,are you saying i can't be tactful?
13104,Lynette,"ooh. whining-- that's hot. fine. let's have sex. but i warn you, i'm just gonna lie here, resenting you the whole time, waiting for this hell to be over."
9622,Lynette,yeah.
9764,Lynette,"stu, isn't that the new video conference setup?"
12024,Lynette,yeah. it's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.
11024,Lynette,"i am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and i expect you to do something about it."
12646,Lynette,get off of her! get off of her! i'm calling the police!
8791,Lynette,"oh. tom. there'll be liquor. and hors d'oeuvres. and grown-ups without children. and, and silverware. remember silverware?"
10984,Lynette,"i'm good. i just, how do i thank the man who saved my life?"
9500,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, i won't have any time tomorrow."
8903,Lynette,i know you did not just say that.
13220,Lynette,you know what would be more educational? you going to college like we talked about.
11740,Lynette,i can handle it.
9491,Lynette,"huh, well, i'm glad to hear you're alright."
11846,Lynette,"we, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do."
11803,Lynette,"that's sweet, and totally accurate. but i'm really whipped from the chemo, so--oh, there's my other line. can you ask me next time, okay, hon? okay, bye."
9170,Lynette,"okay, mommy's friends are gone now and you can -"
11966,Lynette,"well, the results are back, and while you can never actually say you're cured--"
12789,Lynette,"no, i didn't. from the moment glen died, you were out of control. it's true you lost all that money in vegas. you started drinking again. and how many times did i go to your condo, only to find you asleep on the sofa with a cigarette in your mouth? no, i won't apologize for bringing you here. i did it because i love you."
9042,Lynette,"i know. and i know we can't afford it. and i know everything that's happened is my fault. but, if i don't get some help, there's an excellent chance, i will lose my mind."
10238,Lynette,oh.
10702,Lynette,"nora, what are you doing back? are you okay?"
10193,Lynette,that's actually good.
12914,Lynette,"sweetie, i need two dinner salads. what's the matter?"
9005,Lynette,"it pisses me off. i've got four kids, you know. i was up all night reading statistics online. one out of every four traffic accidents happens on residential streets. i hope whoever hit juanita gets put away for life."
9521,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, we're going to be late for the doctor."
12517,Lynette,stu!
12294,Lynette,yeah?
11943,Lynette,you know that possum that's been ruining our garden?
10720,Lynette,"hey, look at you. miss popular. so, you having a good time over there?"
9541,Lynette,"wow, things are really coming along."
11870,Lynette,yeah. good as new.
9225,Lynette,that's it?
9680,Lynette,what's the matter?
8960,Lynette,thanks.
12534,Lynette,"do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies. knock off 20% on some of the items featured in your recipes, then they do the same towards the purchase of your cookbook."
11450,Lynette,for pasta? are you crazy?
12779,Lynette,mom--this is wrong. please.
13040,Lynette,i brought you a little gift.
11045,Lynette,"great, great."
9557,Lynette,what's wrong with subtly reminding annabel that you're happily married?
9839,Lynette,you're so sweet. come here. i love you. you all right? go get dressed.
12201,Lynette,"no, overreacting would be if i threw a brick through you. what were you thinking? help me understand."
10293,Lynette,"oh,yes.oh,yeah,me too. thank you."
10280,Lynette,it was not that long ago that she keeled over in her front yard.a day with our kids will finish the job.
9081,Lynette,"i'm going to cancel it. the boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way."
10779,Lynette,you're a bright guy.isn't there anything else you might wanna do?
9051,Lynette,i'm lynette.
11245,Lynette,"this restaurant is gonna be a big, fat hit."
11201,Lynette,good for him.
9273,Lynette,you know whoever came up with the motto love thy neighbor clearly lived nowhere near karen mccluskey.
8717,Lynette,"tom, this is my 5th message and you still haven't called me back. well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. i can only imagine. well, guess what, the kids and i wanna have some fun too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you."
11006,Lynette,"hey, buddy, you've been reading comic books for a while. don't you wanna go and play?"
13086,Lynette,mm. here's a thought--we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
12983,Lynette,really?
13195,Lynette,"no, you're not having plastic surgery."
11470,Lynette,"hey, buddy, whatcha doing?"
11946,Lynette,"sweetie, let me ask you something. if you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden and a gross, mean, dirty possum, what would you pick?"
8958,Lynette,that's the mystery part.
11838,Lynette,"what is wrong with you? i told you, i didn't want any pot."
9072,Lynette,"i will give you a 20% bump on what she is paying you, plus overtime."
12194,Lynette,vandalism? porter! preston! get over here!
9242,Lynette,"really? i love it. well, this is the nicest present you boys had ever given me, and you know what? i'm gonna put it out on the front porch so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it"
13146,Lynette,tom. what are you doing here? is everything all right?
9161,Lynette,"yeah, okay. that's what i like to hear."
11741,Lynette,shhhhh!
12299,Lynette,hmm?
8844,Lynette,it seems there may be more to mary alice's death than you were aware of .
10597,Lynette,then why are you going to atlantic city every other weekend to visit her?
12051,Lynette,"we, me, tom, the kids, that family you've come to know and love."
12556,Lynette,uh-huh.
10093,Lynette,gaby had an affair?
12365,Lynette,"'cause you know we didn't have a choice, tom. we had to get her out of the house."
11473,Lynette,yeah?
12544,Lynette,"no. but watching you, i look down on me. when i held your book in my hands, i felt so jealous my stomach hurt. and i thought, if i could just hitch a ride, have a piece of it, i wouldn't feel so bad about your success."
11882,Lynette,well-- i know that.
10893,Lynette,okay.
10205,Lynette,yeah?
10937,Lynette,"well, you're gonna love the neighborhood. are you all moved in?"
8954,Lynette,i thought the character of madame bovary was -- very inspirational.
9786,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just, i'm very excited. it's a really good plan. yeah."
11694,Lynette,i'll manage. you got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
12220,Lynette,okay.
12129,Lynette,"no, we came here. we wanted to help you, to fix you lunch or clean your house. or offer up our own houses for you to clean, if that's your thing."
10330,Lynette,are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that eskimo pitch?
12501,Lynette,"oh, god, no. her agency really whiffed-- hmm? so i'm coming up with a whole new campaign. i was looking through my old portfolio for inspiration."
10794,Lynette,"well, it's called parenting, tom.watch and learn.okay, p-dog, this is a curveball. again, opening the eyes--can't stress it enough."
12149,Lynette,"yeah, and i hope the reverend's ready, cause i got about a zillion questions for him."
11190,Lynette,"look, i understand your concerns about the license. your neighbors had them, too. but they signed the waiver once i explained to them that this is a family restaurant. no late nights, no loud music."
10416,Lynette,"i'm sorry,mr. bormanis,but i'm not gonna testify.it just doesn't feel right to me."
12068,Lynette,you okay?
9710,Lynette,why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?
12551,Lynette,what? of course not. why would you say something like that?
12250,Lynette,wait a second. those are your chores.
9984,Lynette,"just wait for it. okay, here he comes."
11557,Lynette,i might take a little for tom and--
13036,Lynette,then do something about it. you're the president. put the brakes on lucy.
12831,Lynette,"tom, i am in pain. do you mind? you'll see, tom. i know. people say that you--you can't have it all, but i know we can."
9094,Lynette,"all right. ""harvey: the flying turtle"". doesn't this look fun!"
9139,Lynette,"okay. well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out. see you later."
10119,Lynette,"good night, tom."
12900,Lynette,"oh, boy. i think i know what this is about. listen, kids, things have been tough down at the restaurant, and i think your dad has finally decided to sell it."
11271,Lynette,what are you doing here? i fired you.
8799,Lynette,honey. get a pet. see ya. son of a-?
11923,Lynette,"you can keep that satellite dish. in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue. the way i see it--"
9554,Lynette,you think?
11162,Lynette,"what? i am snarky because i point out one small, glaring mistake?"
11239,Lynette,"no, they're probably from zach young."
9331,Lynette,"stop scratching. stop scratching. now, now, stop it. guys, let's go, okay? stop scratching. i mean it. stop, stop."
10888,Lynette,"'cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.not this pizza place.it's a rat hole.but once your dad comes to his senses and stops being petulant, he'll come home."
11027,Lynette,"okay, he wasn't there. he doesn't know. look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits."
12688,Lynette,the first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.
11636,Lynette,you won the beer pong championship?
13206,Lynette,"honey, i'm glad you're home. i brought someone home from work i want you to meet."
12300,Lynette,oh. well--s-sure. i've been very good to her.
10873,Lynette,i'm trying to.i am trying to. but are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?
11998,Lynette,"i really wanna meet this jackass. okay, we all have our excuses, but we gotta figure something out. come on. she is our mother."
11057,Lynette,"did you donate the photos, too? parker!"
9121,Lynette,okay.
10929,Lynette,you're the lunatic if you think i'm letting you anywhere near my husband.just drop kayla off and go.
9866,Lynette,okay. one drink.
13137,Lynette,"we've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer."
11753,Lynette,i don't want to hear it.
10461,Lynette,oh.
12564,Lynette,what the hell is this?
9529,Lynette,congratulations. you read me like a book. why would you hire that woman?
9717,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no. no. i'm not saying it has to be sparkling."
8805,Lynette,"the boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5 o' clock-"
9548,Lynette,"tom, we're having a dinner party. i'm thinking of inviting annabel."
13066,Lynette,love it? i have cancer. i probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room
12377,Lynette,what?
9173,Lynette,"and i'm also cranky. you know how you get when you haven't taken a nap? well, mommies are the same way. we need our down time, and if we don't get it -"
9385,Lynette,that was not a smart thing to say.
9442,Lynette,"tom, am i a bad person?"
10951,Lynette,"nora, shut up!"
9501,Lynette,"oh, for god's sake."
11887,Lynette,you suck. well--i guess i could give candy a whirl. are the kids really asleep? 'cause i think she might be a screamer.
13264,Lynette,do you know what they are?
12617,Lynette,i think-- i have to sit down now.
9732,Lynette,"all right, fine! fine! fine! fine! ah!"
10591,Lynette,"no, no!"
8828,Lynette,how in the world did they?
9284,Lynette,i needed you to see something.they said they stole it from mike's garage.
9217,Lynette,how could you do something like this to alison?
11747,Lynette,bravo!i'm sorry.i'll get you a new purse.
8920,Lynette,yeah.
9014,Lynette,"knock it off, you little monsters."
9171,Lynette,"well, yeah, i know it hurts, but that's what you get when you let your brothers put bubble gum in your hair. pain and misery."
9291,Lynette,"well, did you tell mr. peterson that you wanted the job?"
9348,Lynette,i'll call. bree?
10555,Lynette,"no! okay, a little bit.i'm sorry, i'm sorry.ed found receipts for flowers and theater tickets.i mean, by the way, did you--"
8926,Lynette,because now no one on the play committee even wants to talk to me.
8916,Lynette,"oh, okay."
11989,Lynette,"i told you, if you're gonna have a tree house--you've gotta keep it clean."
11997,Lynette,"well, we can't just throw her out on the street."
9421,Lynette,"all right, enough. if you've got issues with your wife, tell her."
12154,Lynette,okay.
9297,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11220,Lynette,"well, you know, hire someone else."
13103,Lynette,but i am exhausted.
12208,Lynette,what? what? is everyone okay?
10792,Lynette,he's got five more games in the season. he made a commitment. he's gonna see it through.
8784,Lynette,yeah.
9813,Lynette,i'm so sorry i couldn't get here sooner. i forgot my husband had to take our youngest to the pediatrician--
12127,Lynette,"well, we heard you were having a rough time."
9461,Lynette,"yeah, you're right, bree, i've got a lot to learn about parenting. and i feel so blessed to be getting sage advice from such an impeccable mother like you. i mean your kids turned out perfect, as long as you don't count andrew. where is he again, hum? some kind of, uh, boot camp for juvenile delinquents."
9515,Lynette,"you're a piece of work, you know that? well, this is crazy, why'd they give you childproof caps?"
9025,Lynette,"boys, would you please, please, stop it. really, really, mommy's got a headache. okay? just, uh--"
12660,Lynette,thank you.
11221,Lynette,the future of the restaurant is at stake. it is time to get creative.
10066,Lynette,"hey! you know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest."
11539,Lynette,"hey, you want some pizza?"
10020,Lynette,black?
12600,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11744,Lynette,i'm feeling a little.
12812,Lynette,"i know, but mommy's still planning eli's memorial. start without me. i'll be there in a little while."
10115,Lynette,are you drunk?
9093,Lynette,that's good. it's good to have faith in people.
9596,Lynette,"she's the fantasy, tom, the hot woman that you work with everyday. with her manicured nails and designer outfits. i am the reality. the wife who never wears make-up and whose clothes smell like a hamper."
13120,Lynette,"if tom finds out, he'll freak. he has this weird thing about being the only guy who gets to see me naked."
12269,Lynette,"well, good, but sometimes when you go through hard things, it changes the way you think. maybe we have trouble telling the difference between what's right and what's wrong."
13105,Lynette,tom!
12198,Lynette,"thank you. oh, oh, hey, honey. could you hold back a sec?"
11191,Lynette,"come on, harry. you are my last holdout. what's it gonna take? cash? uh, free pizza for the rest of your life? you name it."
11232,Lynette,yeah! don't be silly. i'm fine. come on. let's go sell some toothpaste.
12226,Lynette,"if you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn't commit, you should at least have all the facts."
9990,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
12878,Lynette,"oh, sure. it's only money, right?"
10375,Lynette,"fair enough, fair enough.okay, what is your secret?how can you eat like that and keep your figure?"
9247,Lynette,you're capable of doing all sorts of things.
13277,Lynette,i'll do it.
10305,Lynette,yeah.it was cleared up.it was just a little confusion.
11592,Lynette,"no, i mean--everything--the food, the wine--you. i swear, there are times this is all that gets me through my day, knowing at the end of it, i get to steal this little half-hour where i'm not a mom or a wife or a--pizza slave. i'm just a--tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her."
12930,Lynette,"not a dent. a fist print. my husband's been a little frustrated lately. on the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher."
12492,Lynette,you mean his junk?
11680,Lynette,"oh, good."
11593,Lynette,"oh, crap."
12630,Lynette,"but if you don't end this, you won't have to leave. we will throw you out."
9700,Lynette,it won't be an ongoing thing.
12310,Lynette,yeah. this woman is outta control.
12677,Lynette,"well, then you can face statutory rape charges without the money. your call."
12833,Lynette,yeah?
9551,Lynette,"they never get to see you, let them stay up for a while."
9234,Lynette,"i overreacted, i know. i'm sorry."
11022,Lynette,"oh, i just say so. come on."
11248,Lynette,"i'm gonna go poach some customers from that sausage-on-a-stick guy. oh, i love it. scavo's pizzeria! try the smoked chicken and sundried tomato."
11935,Lynette,"katherine. what's with you? sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice. you are one complicated lady."
10273,Lynette,hi.
12249,Lynette,no. we can handle this in house. we can make sure they never do anything like this again.
11170,Lynette,oh.
9064,Lynette,you should never take this dress off for your entire life!
9849,Lynette,so why don't you go out and get in the game?
10504,Lynette,i didn't!i didn't.why would she--oh!the honeymoon thing.
10248,Lynette,"well,tom, why don't you pitch him the other idea you came up with last night?you know, the one where people love bacon so much they wanna keep it a secret?"
10952,Lynette,"no!i-- we're--we have--we're sharing custody,and then,she tried to seduce my husband, so--"
12104,Lynette,"yeah, you stopping there anyway to spread your aunt's ashes?"
9285,Lynette,"well, i wouldn't put it past them."
10247,Lynette,i can't protect you.you're gonna have to find a way to click with ed yourself.
8740,Lynette,absolutely. she'll get through this. she'll find a way to survive.
12043,Lynette,i'm sorry. you want this around?
9214,Lynette,where are you going?
12439,Lynette,i am just--talking to porter on silverfizz.
11745,Lynette,"oh,i'm gonna be sick!"
12727,Lynette,tom
10791,Lynette,i'll tell you what we're not doing--quitting.
9909,Lynette,"just hear me out. i was gonna take it back, i swear."
9537,Lynette,"yeah, i'll check my book. so annabel, do you have feelings for tom?"
12815,Lynette,i was planning to go back to work.
10383,Lynette,"oh,shoot,i gotta take this one.i'm sorry. it's tom."
11686,Lynette,so where are we gonna find this ten thousand dollars?
10234,Lynette,ed--
10452,Lynette,daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.why don't you wait for him?
10513,Lynette,so you think you and carlos will try for another adoption?
10998,Lynette,or wherever.
12740,Lynette,"preston, why didn't you pick up when i called you?"
11877,Lynette,what are you doing?
9078,Lynette,you better finish those brussel sprouts. and don't think i can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
10970,Lynette,"yeah, um, listen, about that--the kids don't know what happened."
11250,Lynette,hi--ed.
10164,Lynette,"so that if you're the last man to survive a nuclear holocaust,you could repopulate the planet?"
9947,Lynette,"you know, what we're saying is, we get it. you're just having fun. it's nothing to be ashamed of."
12333,Lynette,hi.
9996,Lynette,"guys, we talked about this. what happened to standing up for ourselves?"
13255,Lynette,i'm sure it wasn't that bad.
12947,Lynette,"because i vividly remember yesterday, and i wasn't born during it."
9198,Lynette,okay. just wait.
8983,Lynette,"hey, word on the street is that you've been medicating timmy--"
12661,Lynette,i saw a grown man beating up on my teenage boy. what else do you want to know?
11184,Lynette,"please, i've been at this for hours. just hear me out."
10738,Lynette,gaby!
11148,Lynette,you have good timing. i just got all the kids to sleep.
9327,Lynette,"hey, guys. what's going on?"
9559,Lynette,keep your voice down!
11934,Lynette,thanks. why?
10211,Lynette,what about the two of us working and living together?i think that could be a recipe for disaster.
11791,Lynette,"no, no, i don't need magazines. i need company. sit down. you've been bouncing around since you got here. so--how do you like being the first lady of fairview?"
8967,Lynette,what did you say?
9030,Lynette,"no, i'm not. i can't do it. i'm so tired of feeling like a failure. it's so humiliating."
10060,Lynette,bye-bye.
8965,Lynette,tom
12797,Lynette,poor eli. we should make sure he's got flowers at his funeral.
8977,Lynette,"great, this will keep the crab dip warm. it took forever to shell the little buggers, but it'll be worth it."
10141,Lynette,"well, he is our friendly neighborhood murderer."
10521,Lynette,"look,i know it's ridiculous,but ed is not a rational person.fran has him whipped,and a whipped husband is someone we must take very seriously."
8898,Lynette,you think mike is a carl in disguise?
10082,Lynette,"yeah, i am.i don't--i don't want to make a big deal out of it,but, uh,could you maybe not do that again?"
9458,Lynette,"now when you say punishment, what exactly are you talking about?"
12375,Lynette,i'll get lee.
11347,Lynette,"listen--i was thinking, wouldn't it be better if the staff wore a uniform, and you and i wore regular clothes? that way it's like, ""hi. welcome to scavo's. we're the scavos."""
12320,Lynette,okay. good times.
9922,Lynette,"well, they look fine to me."
12168,Lynette,hi there.
11528,Lynette,cater?
12902,Lynette,i don't know that's why we all have to be really supportive. are you with me?
9329,Lynette,"hey, guys, over here."
12826,Lynette,"i swear, if you touch this phone, i will have this baby right here and then beat you with it!"
10075,Lynette,"this is communication. this is good. why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?"
9282,Lynette,i don't know.
13310,Lynette,"seriously, stop or i will hurt you."
11173,Lynette,touch.
9930,Lynette,"well, it's stuck. get the remote! get the remote!"
9687,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes!"
12942,Lynette,yeah. he's up early today. he just doesn't know what he's doing next.
12002,Lynette,i don't need your money. i can take care of my mother all by myself.
12611,Lynette,liar.
11249,Lynette,it's cornmeal.that's the secret.
12639,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i'm great. that's it?"
9143,Lynette,"aww--you kiss as though that would end this conversation, and it so won't."
12927,Lynette,"all right, that's enough! let go of him! let go of him! let go of him!"
9767,Lynette,you know how the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow? 'cause i've got this thing--
12522,Lynette,"no, i-- also went into business for myself."
12301,Lynette,"do you have a diploma on your wall, tom? i don't think so. zip it."
10815,Lynette,that's not fair! it's not his fault!
12062,Lynette,"ida, is there any chance that we could put little toby upstairs?"
11810,Lynette,"oh. no, thanks."
10251,Lynette,"i'm sorry,i thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?"
13227,Lynette,"i am just trying to help preston avoid the way marked ""unemployable loser."""
11317,Lynette,"hey. it's after nine. come on, thomasina, it's time to get up."
12675,Lynette,your husband's blaming porter.
13309,Lynette,"yeah, that's it. give it to me."
9781,Lynette,"okay. i'll be back in two seconds, sweetie."
9921,Lynette,"no, not to worry. i got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves."
9243,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, why are you taking my flower pot?"
9443,Lynette,i don't know. i guess i just have it in my head that only bad people break up marriages and offend the handicapped.
12060,Lynette,"oh. sorry. kinda get used to it. come here. give that to mama. hey, guys? come on now. knock it off. here you go. and-- first base, second base, third base, sit. we gonna have a nice, quiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems."
9300,Lynette,oh.
12721,Lynette,thanks.
12309,Lynette,i can't believe she was blackmailing you.
11476,Lynette,what's this?
9292,Lynette,i'm not saying to beg. you just have to step up from time to time. you have to see your opportunity and take it. nobody respects a shrinking violet.
8694,Lynette,"hey, it's lynette. i know you're down about this mike thing, but you got to come to poker. it'll be worth it. i got dirt on maisy gibbons."
9524,Lynette,"it uh, must have slipped his mind."
8818,Lynette,"i don't know. rex announced that he and bree are in counselling. she retaliated with this whole revelation which i won't even go into now. and the bottom line is, he stormed out. clearly there's trouble in paradise."
12872,Lynette,son of a--
11105,Lynette,"okay,they're here. now listen, stand up. kayla has been through a lot, so when she walks in the door, i want you to make her feel welcome, okay? give her a hug and be really nice."
569,Bree,roses and english toffee?
3431,Bree,yes.
1165,Bree,oh!
1142,Bree,where did you get this?
3901,Bree,"steal what you must, my love. but it won't be my company."
4030,Bree,"i, uh, took some of my silver off the mantle, and it threw off the balance."
2276,Bree,what are you watching?
888,Bree,"all i'm saying is that we're both gonna die eventually, and in the time that we have left, whether it's two days or two decades, i think that we should be nice to each other."
1004,Bree,"um, yeah. sure. hold on a second."
294,Bree,"oh, andrew, thank god you're back. i need your help, honey. there's been an accident. andrew?"
761,Bree,"lynette, don't. the fact that you just crossed that street means the world to me. and if anyone should apologise here, it's me."
1443,Bree,"are you sure that you can't check on the applewhites?i mean,i just know that there's something there.and,you know,i have a sixth sense about people."
2122,Bree,andrew!
3098,Bree,"you really want to be effective? try hollow points. these rounds you've got punch straight though, but a hollow point blooms on impact, cuts the body to shreds from the inside."
1359,Bree,''so what's happened?have you had any luck finding george?''
1236,Bree,"well, i know it sounds rash, but, well, there's something comfortable about george. we share the same tastes and interests. oh, and best of all, he loves the opera."
3698,Bree,"great. gaby, do you have your copy?"
1628,Bree,"oh,and why is that?"
2075,Bree,"orson, you're scaring me. did he do something awful?"
1239,Bree,hey. we'd better hurry. the movie starts in twenty minutes.
615,Bree,"andrew, this is not funny."
1552,Bree,"sure.just--just a moment,okay?"
1125,Bree,"thank you. so, uh, what will happen now?"
3026,Bree,what are you talking about?
3753,Bree,so that's like the dust they sweep off the floor of a place that makes real cheese.
1957,Bree,hummm.orson.
1617,Bree,"did he just call her ""baby""?"
203,Bree,oh! you are going to love it! it has quite a kick..
2399,Bree,you raped my husband.
3019,Bree,"i sympathize. i do, but i have a new baby, and it's really more work than i care to take on right now."
1736,Bree,"um, excuse me.i don't know what that means,but could you please stop saying it?"
794,Bree,"oh, my heavenly days. rex, look, it's george."
4062,Bree,"sadly, karl, i always know what you are saying."
2838,Bree,"well, adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming. and as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out. so would you please be a dear and come on out?"
899,Bree,you really want to know?
3952,Bree,"honey, i don't mean to be negative. it's just--what's gonna happen? will you keep stealing and lying to me? i love you, but i just can't put up with that anymore."
2322,Bree,sour cream.
1347,Bree,"oh, thank you."
3751,Bree,lynette. i understand you and your fellow chefs will be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.
2581,Bree,good idea.
432,Bree,"hello, george."
2606,Bree,"i knew it! phyllis--rex's mother. ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection."
2810,Bree,"well, i know that."
2852,Bree,"oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?"
3071,Bree,not exactly.
204,Bree,hello?
3496,Bree,"katherine, i'm sorry, but i just have to ask--are you sure you know what you're doing?"
1602,Bree,i'm sorry.i didn't quite catch that.
1996,Bree,"oh, that reminds me. and don't worry susan, i will think of a job for you."
33,Bree,"oh my god, she got it the day she died."
1369,Bree,"don't you worry about me, detective barton. i will be just fine."
566,Bree,"we're, um, wasps, doctor goldfine. not acknowledging the elephant in the room is what we do best."
2327,Bree,"i just feel really awful about our fight, and i-i think it's time for an apology."
1832,Bree,"stop!one of the candles went out.um, we're gonna have to do this all over again.i'm sorry. i'll be right back."
3281,Bree,"i've been asking myself that all day. maybe she's afraid if you get big, you'll leave home and go play for the red sox."
2999,Bree,"well, uh, this has been an evening full of, um--surprises. i never would've imagined that, um, i would be recognized by this wonderful organization --"
2081,Bree,yes. i left you two messages. didn't you check your voice mail? he woke up from his coma.
4108,Bree,my knees haven't buckled yet.
905,Bree,"well, then how do people know because we both know that i wouldn't say anything."
2732,Bree,i thought you liked debbie and lou.
3630,Bree,i don't know if i have it in me. she's such a troglodyte.
954,Bree,"oh. well, um, what kind of input?"
2967,Bree,"yes, of course. why wouldn't it?"
2304,Bree,"no, i wasn't. they arrested mike for the murder of monique polier."
39,Bree,do you remember when you proposed?
1965,Bree,i've never heard that.
506,Bree,"okay, now i want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove. hold it firmly enough that it can't get away, but not so firmly that you can kill it. got it?"
811,Bree,"honey, do your hands still tremble when they touch me?"
2512,Bree,"well, thank you. i don't think i did anything differently."
796,Bree,i would love to. rex?
865,Bree,"okay, time's up. take your best shot."
554,Bree,look at the guilt that she must've lived with.
3820,Bree,"well, look who's here. somebody owes me $20."
291,Bree,"that's a smart idea, because you're probably going to have to sleep in it for a while."
2111,Bree,"thank you, dear. danielle, you haven't touched your dinner."
2644,Bree,"phyllis, wait!"
1360,Bree,"'oh,um--well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.''"
3352,Bree,"oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed."
1616,Bree,is this libby's real hair color?
1547,Bree,"look,for the record,i had an allergic reactionto my antihistamine medication,so i would appreciate just a little bit of sympathy."
205,Bree,"oh, hi,rex. how are you? is something wrong?"
1878,Bree,"is that what you're doing, asking me all those ridiculous questions about my childhood, trying to get to know me? well, here's a clue. i'm not crazy.i just have a few issues."
4083,Bree,what?!
2237,Bree,just for a few weeks till we find a place where she'll be happier. you should've heard her in the car. she's absolutely miserable in that nursing home.
1517,Bree,"why should i?you betrayed this family,and you're not even sorry."
2669,Bree,"danielle, you should introduce yourself. these people are your new friends."
336,Bree,"you've got four kids. that's a lot of stress. honey, you need some help."
272,Bree,"mrs. stark, you handle this however you see fit."
1907,Bree,"oh, i was afraid of that."
3970,Bree,"well, that's odd."
2795,Bree,"hello, doctor."
3287,Bree,let's get you to the powder room.
837,Bree,what?
3532,Bree,at least the house won't be quiet anymore.
3452,Bree,"good. well, now that that's settled--let's make some pies."
3642,Bree,"well, did it occur to you i might want to sit next to the boys?"
2977,Bree,"well, perhaps i could try something new. let's go with the lisianthus."
1757,Bree,hello?
4093,Bree,what can we think of? he's holding all the cards.
1974,Bree,"and then it was like something inside ruptured.well, not so much a rupture as a spasm.waves of this hot, clutching.i think i might have had a small stroke!"
3073,Bree,"i've already hired one. you'll be hearing from him shortly. oh, and if you're in the mood for a carnival, why not call edie? i hear you get three throws for a dollar with her, too."
2188,Bree,"i used to think that, too. then i met you. good day."
1567,Bree,"lynette,if i close my eyes even for a moment,it's because of these antihistamines i've been taking."
2989,Bree,is everyone having fun?
1209,Bree,guilty?
3177,Bree,"well, you make this all possible."
1680,Bree,"oh,hello."
801,Bree,"good, then it's a date."
1057,Bree,no.
3633,Bree,"you know, we actually have some very comfortable patio furniture in the backyard--along with a place to put your recyclables."
719,Bree,nowhere in their brochure did it say that we were expected to attend.
3780,Bree,"well, the chamber of commerce just called. they've added 40 people to their guest list."
2548,Bree,"god,it's getting harder and harder to keep her at arm's length. i never knew she was such a hugger."
2471,Bree,yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
726,Bree,hi. what's going on?
1353,Bree,and then we'll call an ambulance and they'll pump your stomach.
1278,Bree,"so we're gonna go to my house. i made banana bread, and we'll put on a fresh pot, and just talk about anything."
2354,Bree,"oh. well, um--i don't want to keep you. i'm sure that edie has lots of other houses to show you."
2740,Bree,i hope orson 's rant didn't give you a headache.
71,Bree,i think it's a great idea.
1029,Bree,"well, if i am, you're wasting your time. i loved rex and anyone who knows me will tell you that i was incapable of hurting him."
2049,Bree,"excuse me, young man. have you seen this boy?andrew! oh, my god, thank god!"
966,Bree,she went out of her way to be cruel to me. i don't want her at the funeral.
775,Bree,would you like some water? i have flat or bubbly.
1331,Bree,it was not a tiff! we broke up! it's over!
521,Bree,"oh my god! george, here."
710,Bree,"hopefully, you won't have to be there for more than a few weeks."
791,Bree,"no, i don't. and i need you there. i would be so lonely without you."
1815,Bree,name it. it's yours.
2697,Bree,how can i help?
92,Bree,"oh hi, paul, i was just?"
3987,Bree,"i want you to say that for $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to help me protect my business."
1343,Bree,how can you not believe in evil? a man just threw you off a bridge for no reason.
2693,Bree,"i'm just saying, if i were you, i might be feeling--"
1062,Bree,"no, that's why i need you to take the polygraph, too."
1017,Bree,so have you given any thought to when you might be ending your visit? what?
1094,Bree,"oh, you don't know the lengths i'd go to for even seating."
2349,Bree,please leave my house.
1397,Bree,i saw what you did with your friend.
1299,Bree,"i say, given your overall demeanor and your freewheeling use of epithets, i'm willing to bet that he was provoked."
3292,Bree,"all right, i'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake."
3919,Bree,"if she's visiting my husband, i think i have a right to know"
1162,Bree,that better?
2892,Bree,all righty. here you go.
809,Bree,"well, i certainly don't want to hurt him,again."
1357,Bree,i called them while you were asleep. they're already on their way.
1575,Bree,"okay,take care."
165,Bree,hi.
3424,Bree,but this is orson's college roommate. and--he's quite the catch!
2930,Bree,"well, then maybe you should explore other options. i mean, if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit, why don't you try that gospel church by the airport?"
2767,Bree,i know that.
1135,Bree,"i'm here, sweetheart, and i'm gonna take care of everything. but you knew that, didn't you? you've always known that you can count on me."
934,Bree,"but his operation, it's not until tomorrow."
3043,Bree,you are?
1499,Bree,he's your son?
2752,Bree,and this rotating spice rack? those little airplane bottles of vodka fit perfectly in the back.
2675,Bree,"oh, please, phyllis. even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood."
682,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being!"
1032,Bree,she blamed me for every problem that rex and i ever had.
3931,Bree,you're right. i shouldn't have asked. i know it's horrible here.
1415,Bree,"oh, you think i won't?"
2564,Bree,"yes, and it is going to stay that way because i have instructed sister theresa to keep you sequestered in your room until the baby is born."
3134,Bree,"okay. well, what's going on?"
973,Bree,give me your tie.
2619,Bree,nope.
2312,Bree,"oh, we've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community. it's our christmas gift to you."
2630,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, phyllis, it's not as if we got along when rex was alive."
3046,Bree,"hi, edie, thanks again for helping me out last night."
3700,Bree,i'm sorry if the frittata is a bit dry.
4074,Bree,no. all i want is out.
268,Bree,"rex, this was practically assault."
2209,Bree,"well, all the more reason to send her one. let the nurses know that she has family at home who loves her--and who could drop by at any minute and slap them with a lawsuit."
2470,Bree,"no,i mean they're stickley.it means they have taste."
1856,Bree,i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
3172,Bree,"andrew, dear, i'm going to take a little break. would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me ""sweetie"" one more time, i'm gonna grab his camera and take picture of his colon."
2074,Bree,yard work?
2872,Bree,"well, we'll just have to find him someone who's not good at gay math."
3414,Bree,you can't just up and move. you have a life here.
3317,Bree,"well, i'll wait in reception until it's over."
85,Bree,"oh, well i don't have any personal issues. my only issue is that my husband wants to leave me, and how can i work on that if he's not in the room?"
1080,Bree,andrew!
3189,Bree,"really, katherine. just because i let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify your need to show off, doesn't mean that i can't do them just as well myself."
1322,Bree,"george, stop it."
596,Bree,i want you out of the house!
317,Bree,"well, more importantly, is there any good news about juanita?"
2974,Bree,"well--if you have a different idea, i would love to hear that, too."
2340,Bree,"amazing, isn't it, where some people's minds will go?"
2707,Bree,"okay, you made your point.now go home."
1803,Bree,i noticed a bus stop about a mile back.you can go anywhere you want.
3114,Bree,"no, i told you. i was only trying to send a message to my ex."
2225,Bree,"now you listen to me. that woman gave you life, and the fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be."
1452,Bree,"detective,i am not drunk,and i am not stupid.i know exactly what this is all about."
3852,Bree,"andrew, cancel my lunch. no, everything's fine. your stepfather's just misplaced a few things, and i need to find them."
3470,Bree,"oh, much better."
3841,Bree,what do you call this?
658,Bree,"oh, sweetie. they didn't abandon you because you're a whore. they abandoned you because you weren't all that nice to begin with."
2133,Bree,of course not. i already went through thinking i'd lost andrew. i can't go through that again.
1120,Bree,"andrew, what are you doing?"
2553,Bree,"you know, my o.b. is all the way across town. you just do not want to drive that far."
1777,Bree,#name?
3687,Bree,"alex-- i'm gonna tell you something i haven't told anybody-- not orson, not andrew, just you. i know that i've changed since my business took off, but i didn't want to admit it. i've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude. i was never the type to suffer fools gladly, but now i seem to find fools everywhere. and i don't want to be that way. i need someone who isn't afraid to speak out, to call me out when i cross those lines, and i would love it if you would be that person."
2633,Bree,where is she going?
1742,Bree,"look, you don't have to worry about peter,not while he's with me."
929,Bree,thanks.
3697,Bree,i'd be happy to. any special requests?
3339,Bree,"goodness, lynette. when you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign, i wasn't expecting anything quite so--elaborate."
601,Bree,tell him that we found his condom and that he is forbidden from - y'know.
3528,Bree,goodness.
1939,Bree,that rosotto was perfect.
193,Bree,"zach,calm down."
1090,Bree,"you know, i haven't even thought about it."
3273,Bree,"so instead of sending him to a proper school, you're gonna give him the benefit of your straight ""c"" average?"
3055,Bree,"i hope so. truth is, i miss him. and i'll probably let him come home eventually. i just need to know he understands the gravity of what he did."
3619,Bree,what?
510,Bree,i was just caught off guard.
1760,Bree,"yes, it is."
415,Bree,"that's okay. how are you now, rex? are you strong enough to listen to the things i need to tell you?"
3215,Bree,gaby--
4014,Bree,"i used to think of myself as a good person. if i had a choice, i would always choose the high road. lately i've begun to realize that, um--i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done."
3712,Bree,"thanks, eli."
2447,Bree,"well, um, while we were in switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad."
2370,Bree,this isn't a social call. we need to talk.
3164,Bree,we don't have much time before the police get here. we need to talk.
864,Bree,"come on, i'm allowed to psych you out."
2118,Bree,"andrew, please don't interrupt me while i'm speaking.true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift, but you know my policy: no husband, no baby gift. now what is it, dear?"
271,Bree,"and so does andrew! blaming his actions on our problems--"" ""--does not help him."
2601,Bree,it really is.
3001,Bree,the photographer's asking if he can get shots of the two of us.
1024,Bree,"i don't know what you're talking about, phyllis."
1195,Bree,really? you mean that? you wouldn't mind?
1639,Bree,"no,it makes it sound like i think i have a problem,and i don't."
2915,Bree,i would love that. we're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.
3377,Bree,i'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.
2363,Bree,"oh, so you're just gonna wait until she moves in?"
403,Bree,yes. why?
357,Bree,oh. what was it about?
117,Bree,andrew?!
639,Bree,"what's wrong, rex? didn't you enjoy your golf game with dr. wallace?"
1266,Bree,there you go. all done.
2684,Bree,my son--trying on his costume. he's going to be cher this year.
1861,Bree,this is my husband rex.
532,Bree,"sweetie, i think it's too late."
3843,Bree,look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
1435,Bree,is it serious?
4079,Bree,"orson, i understand this is a shock, but you have to face facts. our marriage is over."
304,Bree,don't you think that's a little bit extreme?
3429,Bree,"well, katherine's been lonely, so i set her up with a client, and he's been there for over four hours, so you know it's going well!"
814,Bree,i think it would be a mistake for us to spend too much time together.
3006,Bree,"that's everything, i guess."
4098,Bree,what?
2526,Bree,"no, it's true. the only thing about me that's special is what i can do in the kitchen. you're right. i have got to get that recipe--by any means necessary."
2246,Bree,"what did she mean by, you can't afford not to? was she threatening you with something?"
3657,Bree,"orson, take it easy!"
1724,Bree,"maybe not,but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you."
382,Bree,hello.
3421,Bree,"what a thoughtful son you are. so, uh, have you given any thought to the venue?"
1027,Bree,anomalies? what anomalies?
4043,Bree,wow.
3517,Bree,what kind of rumors?
2522,Bree,that's hers!
2679,Bree,i'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
3153,Bree,"well, i suppose i should say thank you."
2018,Bree,"you're upset, aren't you? you're still thinking about what i said at the church."
2459,Bree,"look, if you're gonna start complaining, i'm going to hang up."
852,Bree,"oh. oh, i mean, everybody needs someone to talk to."
459,Bree,"well, we're just, um, talking. mr. williams took me out to dinner."
66,Bree,"well, i care. they don't need to be burdened with our marital problems, and if we're working things out, the least we could do is try to keep up appearances."
2506,Bree,"well, maybe she blocked it out. did something bad happen to her when she was young?"
3580,Bree,"well, i want to know now, so that's why i'm having you and alex over to dinner tomorrow night."
1805,Bree,you win?
3109,Bree,"ah, it worked. thank you for that."
1366,Bree,"''no,wait!is that supposed to be me?''"
3316,Bree,i wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person. i will be at your office in two minutes.
3586,Bree,"all right then, alex. oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart. scootch over."
4073,Bree,"there's no point. so you should get a piece of paper, start to make a list of what it is you wish to take with you."
3305,Bree,"yeah. oh, i almost forgot."
2607,Bree,"well, i'm not giving it to her. can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?"
4085,Bree,that will never happen.
1923,Bree,"i would beg my son andrew for forgiveness for having given up on him, and i would tell my daughter not to worry, that i have a plan to protect her."
1251,Bree,but you should know that. that's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.
483,Bree,"hello! oh, hi, lynette! what?"
31,Bree,we all do.
2305,Bree,"the other night, you wanted a chance to explain everything. well, here it is, and i want it all. if i find out you've left anything out, then i will ask for that divorce."
3386,Bree,go away. i don't feel well.
3813,Bree,"now that you brought it up, lynette, i've been feeling just awful about the way i took over your restaurant and insulted you and--what can i say?"
1233,Bree,"it was just awful. george had a ring. his mother and her friend were there with champagne. if i had said no, it would have devastated him."
299,Bree,our son could spent the rest of his life in jail. i won't allow that.
2735,Bree,"oh, that's ridiculous."
1674,Bree,come on?where are we going?
253,Bree,"you humiliated me, rex. for no good reason."
3622,Bree,stop that! you can't call all the major holidays.
2156,Bree,"hello, tish."
93,Bree,"oh. that's too bad. well, i should go."
1403,Bree,"no, i wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history."
1294,Bree,"oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature."
2632,Bree,then i'll give it back to you.
2922,Bree,"oh, lord."
2146,Bree,he dumped you?
3972,Bree,so did she get a good look at--death?
2317,Bree,"well, you should've told someone. people thought you were dead. some even thought that orson killed you."
137,Bree,keith. ian. andrew.
298,Bree,"we have to get rid of the car. but we can't sell it. the police might find it, and there could be dna. we take the car to a bad part of town. we'll leave the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. if the police don't find it, we'll get the insurance money, and if they do, it wasn't in our possession. anyone could have hit mrs. solis."
1993,Bree,"yeah, don't you think it will be gorgeous with my coloring?"
282,Bree,don't you two see what he is doing? he's trying to get you on his side. he's trying to buy your love.
3371,Bree,promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
2147,Bree,"i don't plan to. well, i hope this doesn't make history class too awkward."
2965,Bree,"it's a lot of work, exhausting and completely worth it."
2391,Bree,"not as sorry as you are gonna be! orson, get up!"
2438,Bree,"hello, ladies."
170,Bree,"the point is i don't feel safe here, and i was wondering if you would spend the night."
2194,Bree,"andrew, honey, would you please get the phone?"
2724,Bree,"are you sure? sweetheart, do you feel like you're making a mistake?"
361,Bree,what's that smell? have you been smoking marijuana?
1720,Bree,"well,i have to admit,i was a bit upset at first.but then it hit me.you're his grandparents. you should bond,get to know the real andrew."
952,Bree,"thank you. that's just a huge weight off my shoulders. oh, these are for you."
213,Bree,"hi,zach. i just wanted to see if everything was alright."
3007,Bree,"oh, that's so sweet, but--our house is livable again - the downstairs anyway - and we have imposed long enough. besides, mike is coming home tonight, and you're gonna need the house to yourselves."
3230,Bree,orson! did you get my message about linda flanagan?
3272,Bree,excuse me? you're teaching him?
475,Bree,"george, would you go out to dinner with me?"
2848,Bree,we can't. there's a woman in there.
2373,Bree,"oh, please. orson made it perfectly clear we don't want you here."
1177,Bree,"dr. goldfine, rex is dead. you can't cheat on a corpse."
1627,Bree,we are going home. wait tilli tell the judge about you stealing my credit cards and sneaking off.it's gonna do wonders for your little emancipation case.
4115,Bree,"so, how does this domination thing work?"
727,Bree,"oh lynette, i'm so swamped today. my house is a mess and i've got millions of errands to run."
3635,Bree,did edie show you the adams house?
1819,Bree,"isn't it darling?i made it for your party.it's a big ""1""and a big ""7""--for ""17."""
3145,Bree,"lynette, i wish i had time to be more tactful, but i don't. your swan is pathetic, and i'm firing you from napkin duty."
1111,Bree,"what he said to you was horribly rude. that camp, it's extreme and unless i felt like andrew was getting really out of control, then-"
4064,Bree,"ooh. lynette, that's bad."
795,Bree,the doctor upped his dosage twice and it's still not helping.
2680,Bree,"i need something that will fly, phyllis."
1584,Bree,the answer is no.
604,Bree,"well, we can't put it back in his room. i mean that would be like we're condoning him having pre-marital sex."
2149,Bree,carolyn. this isn't a very good time. i'm baking.
799,Bree,"rex, are you still jealous?"
2300,Bree,"well, that was incredibly awkward. i'm sorry you both had to sit through it. was it me? was i out of line?"
1953,Bree,"actually, no, we haven't had sex yet.we're waiting until we get married."
2709,Bree,what's wrong?
3168,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. what's wrong now?"
2259,Bree,"it's just not right. your mother skipped lunch, too."
1227,Bree,huh?
2168,Bree,"oh, i'd love to."
2720,Bree,how are you feeling?
1926,Bree,do you remember that girl melanie foster?matthew is the one who killed her.
1005,Bree,that's all right. it was really sweet of you to stop by.
2715,Bree,a what?
883,Bree,"edie, do you want to be a part of it?"
3996,Bree,"no, thanks, i don't drink."
88,Bree,hello zach! i hope this isn't a bad time.
335,Bree,"lynette, you're a great mother."
1613,Bree,"it's true. i'm coming here because of my son.you see, he's--he's trying to take me to court to become an emancipated minor,and he's planning on lying to the judge and telling him that i am some sort of dreadful lush."
2849,Bree,"no, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there."
3707,Bree,"oh, we're having leftovers. you can heat them up yourself if you want."
1533,Bree,a girl?
2410,Bree,exonerate mike. how could you stand by and let an innocent man be dragged off to prison?
1652,Bree,what?
616,Bree,so obviously we need to talk.
1694,Bree,"i slapped him once,and he deserved it."
1940,Bree,oh.
3147,Bree,"why don't you fill water glasses? that's an important job, too."
2805,Bree,"well, i guess i'll just have to take my veal scaloppini and go home."
1429,Bree,i don't think i can do that.
2923,Bree,get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.
857,Bree,"why don't we start doing things again, as a couple?"
397,Bree,"oh, hi gabrielle! what have you got there?"
296,Bree,"rex, you need to come home. something's happened, and we need you."
2540,Bree,"hey, it's our chemo party, and we'll laugh if we want to."
2428,Bree,"yes, and i intend to go to the police."
2283,Bree,and yet you're cooking?
172,Bree,you're right. that was hard to hear.
3016,Bree,hire us? but we're not a business.
1056,Bree,"um, i, i was thinking of something else just then, so why don't you ask me the question again?"
2806,Bree,"thank you. you know, i'd make it for every day if you'd move back home."
3786,Bree,"orson, drop it. i am not telling you how much andrew makes."
1863,Bree,"well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?"
1872,Bree,"um, listen, i told my friends that i was, um, i was at a spa, so if you run into susan,i--"
3493,Bree,"mike. yes, indeedy."
236,Bree,you're dining alone?
2134,Bree,danielle.
3834,Bree,would anyone care for something sweet?
355,Bree,"andrew, can i come in?"
3239,Bree,chives! how could i forget chives?
1173,Bree,"how are we going to do that, george? you have just given me hives."
2500,Bree,"well,would that be so horrible?"
1812,Bree,what?
2504,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
2637,Bree,"well, um--technically, yes."
3726,Bree,"oh, dear. is something wrong?"
1998,Bree,"orson, i moved the furniture back!"
122,Bree,i spoke to brian's mother. now tell me again where you were last night and this time don't lie to me.
3508,Bree,"""a deeper look suggests something darker, something more ominous, a woman whose perky surface conceals a deep, almost demonic thirst for power."
3978,Bree,"oh, you know, i just remembered some business i have to discuss with andrew."
233,Bree,"oh, maisy does love to rule her little kingdom."
2946,Bree,"lynette, please. can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?"
2290,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
164,Bree,just because you didn't hear them fighting doesn't mean they were happy.
2371,Bree,about what it's gonna take to get you to sell this house and move.
1669,Bree,"but,peter--"
497,Bree,"oh, yeah. you always remember your first time. god, i hope i brought enough bullets."
162,Bree,"it's just that i'm very well respected at barcliff, and my word won't be good there anymore."
3009,Bree,"well, um, as much as i appreciate this naked display of emotion, you know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable."
3053,Bree,"come on, edie. think of our friendship."
629,Bree,she said that you broke up with her because she refused to have sex.
190,Bree,ooooh.
588,Bree,okay. so what's our control word?
1706,Bree,do you really think that i am a failure as a parent?
81,Bree,not a drop!
663,Bree,"well, i could be wrong, but i suspect that maisy gibbons' client list has been released."
3545,Bree,"you want honesty? fine. you didn't want to divorce mike. you hit a really bad patch after the accident, but you never stopped loving him. and why would you? your relationship didn't have a natural end. so face it. you're not mad at me or mike or katherine. you're mad at yourself for letting your marriage falls apart."
1744,Bree,"well,i am sorry,but the peter i know has a little more sense--"
707,Bree,"sweetheart, it's been clear to us for sometime now that you've been unhappy. all this acting out--"
3020,Bree,excuse me?
3732,Bree,why not? what's the point of success if you can't share it with the people you love?
333,Bree,she'll be fine. what do you think's happening with lynette?
3065,Bree,"oh, yes, the neighborhood's safe. i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent."
655,Bree,"maisy, please. i mean, we used to be good friends."
2019,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i had to ask."
1163,Bree,that was nice.
2023,Bree,it's hodge now.
2985,Bree,about what?
1425,Bree,how'd it go?
91,Bree,"yes, it's just gonna be a casual night with the gang. we're going to eat, and tell fun stories about your mum. zach, are-are you okay?"
717,Bree,you don't have a choice.
679,Bree,"well, um, i've been doing some thinking. rex and i have been members of the fairview country club for years, and, well, lately, it seems to have lost some of its exclusivity, and so i've decided not to renew our membership. i'd rather see the money go to someone i care about."
645,Bree,"well, you heard your funny story, rex. why aren't you laughing?"
1317,Bree,"oh, my goodness. oh, george, this is ty grant. we used to date in college. ty, this is george, um, he's a good friend of mine."
1580,Bree,"andrew,we're not touching your trust fund."
2899,Bree,you. sit.
3659,Bree,"he only thinks he got a good deal because the salesman threw in one of those ""kiss the cook"" hats."
1428,Bree,do we even know who he is?
3135,Bree,"all right, you can all wipe those smug looks off your faces, because every one of you has just become my employee."
3760,Bree,"oh, dear. i was hoping to spare your feelings, but since you know, i wasn't comfortable having my recipe made with substandard ingredients."
3048,Bree,he spent the night here?
2282,Bree,it's not that easy. i love him.
740,Bree,"oh no, we had a wonderful time. although i think porter had a little less fun. okay, i'll bet."
903,Bree,you're a liar.
1109,Bree,but i only sent him there because his behavior at the time was so completely out of bounds.
4047,Bree,i can't believe you went to all that trouble.
1207,Bree,"oh, okay. have you been sitting there all this time?"
2874,Bree,"you're funny. now i need you to be honest about this recipe. it's a dry run for a small dinner party i'm having tomorrow night. again, if you don't mind."
649,Bree,i need a favor.
4090,Bree,i told him i don't love him. he said he doesn't care. he wants us to work on our marriage.
2086,Bree,"gaby, are you and carlos getting back together?"
3920,Bree,really? because i would consider that a perk worth paying for.
1283,Bree,rex has only been dead for seven weeks.
295,Bree,andrew--
2695,Bree,"lynette, i was just thinking about you. did you get your test results yet?"
2250,Bree,thank you.
2765,Bree,"i gave them very serious consideration. but it's my blood running in his veins, which ultimately makes it my decision."
106,Bree,"i don't need much time, it just seems that you have more insight into my situation than i do. and i just think that-"
1016,Bree,it's right down this row.
1008,Bree,what?
2945,Bree,i am not! my friend's just a little confused. she forgot that she's presbyterian and wandered into the wrong church.
457,Bree,"andrew, where did you come from?"
2647,Bree,"well, it was mary alice, but as you may have heard--"
3696,Bree,gaby?
2570,Bree,"oh, good! katherine, i was hoping we'd get a chance to chat. open this now."
3668,Bree,"hi, mike."
1859,Bree,"well, don't tell him that.if he doesn't feel guilty he'll never learn shame."
836,Bree,"yes. rex and i took a vacation there, right before the kids were born. we had so much fun in those first few years. i guess it was easier to be happy back then. i can't believe i just said that- no more wine for me. "
3457,Bree,"charlie, we wouldn't accuse you unless we had concrete evidence, and thanks to my diligent partner here, we do."
1500,Bree,"but, betty, the police are looking for him.he escaped from that facility they sent him to."
2286,Bree,i asked orson to move out last night.
2839,Bree,"hi, katherine. could i borrow adam for a second? i have a--situation on my hands."
4008,Bree,"oh, really? what a delightful coincidence. you know, i could bake these for you every week, and all i'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors."
3121,Bree,they're a little late getting started.
673,Bree,"well, you keep coming up with excuses to use everyone's bathroom, and then two days ago, mr. cowley looked into your back yard and saw you and carlos doing your laundry in the jacuzzi."
3569,Bree,"well, over time, you'll learn that there's a balance of power in relationships, and if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you, and then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery. do you understand?"
748,Bree,yours is blue. danielle loves pink. and i have no idea what my own son's favourite colour is.
2078,Bree,"howard keck? oh, that's ridiculous. he's got a wife and a daughter. he plays on tom scavo's bowling team."
3411,Bree,what are you doing?
2180,Bree,"orson? if you have a moment, there's something i'd like your thoughts on."
2988,Bree,dig in.
2797,Bree,i was in a very naughty mood when i left that.
232,Bree,"oh, dear."
919,Bree,mm-hmm.
98,Bree,"so, uh, where are you going?"
2060,Bree,"because there is a bottle of chardonnay in the refrigerator, and right now, this little chore is the only thing that's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing."
961,Bree,you are no longer invited to the funeral.
1799,Bree,consider me a cheerleader for anything that expedites me getting you out from under my roof.
1356,Bree,not until you admit what you've done.
3096,Bree,"although i always, uh, like a trip to the range, is there any particular reason we came here for party planning?"
896,Bree,i see.
3331,Bree,partners? oh.
4019,Bree,"absolutely not. i am all up for a little creative accounting and some secret bank accounts, but hiring some thug to stage a break-in?"
1037,Bree,"my husband died of a heart attack. i loved him very deeply, and your mother did a lousy job."
214,Bree,are you sure?
3149,Bree,"oh, dear god. oh, no. don't die on me now! aah! oh, dear god."
3653,Bree,yeah! let's do that.
1260,Bree,"but why? i mean, surely they have friends who have children."
1524,Bree,hi.i'm bree.i live down the street.i'm a friend of your mother's.
1653,Bree,really?peter! but--but--you forgot your shirt!
2379,Bree,who knows? she's probably gonna sneak in and plant them in our house.
404,Bree,"well, that depends. are you having an affair with my husband?"
2119,Bree,how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!your sister tried to kill herself.that doesn't upset you?
2913,Bree,"exactly, and all the while, where was edna? lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps. she won't let any of us forget it."
241,Bree,is that how you see me? as some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish? i love sex.
3091,Bree,"orson, hear me when i say this. it's over. you have done unconscionable things for which i can never forgive you, and no amount of flitting about in my peripheral vision is going to change that."
495,Bree,"oh, absolutely. george, this is just so much better than an orchid."
2007,Bree,i don't have time for this. i'm getting married now.
2158,Bree,"rebecca, i just spoke to her. and call me paranoid, but amy griswold did the same thing to me on the golf course last week. what is going on?"
1097,Bree,"okay, time for cobbler. sorry, one of the dessert plates doesn't match. i tried to replace it but it's spode florence. it's a rare pattern. belonged to my grandmother, but hopefully, once you taste the dessert, you'll forget all about it."
2362,Bree,so what are you waiting for?
2232,Bree,"please, stay for dessert. i'll work on orson, and we'll discuss this together."
789,Bree,"please, he can counsel you. it can help."
2750,Bree,i can tell you someone whose sexual pleasure is going to be reduced big-time!
3893,Bree,"andrew, do you know why my book sold so well? because it was authentic. i actually believe in the old-fashioned values i wrote about. i believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders. i also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands. i would be the worst kind of hypocrite if i preached these values and then didn't follow them myself."
651,Bree,"i was wondering if, perhaps, you could remove rex's name from that little book."
1086,Bree,"i don't care. here, put this on. every time you leave this house, you represent this family. and the least you can do is not humiliate us."
245,Bree,it sure is nice and toasty in here.
3979,Bree,enjoy your tea.
1350,Bree,"hey. what were you thinking, taking the pills?"
1588,Bree,"honey,what happened to-- to your face?"
2142,Bree,"and don't even think about blaming me,'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke,i'll phone the police."
2628,Bree,i'm going to mingle.
1003,Bree,phyllis? you're going to have to stop that.
131,Bree,it's nine thirty at night. what is your brother thinking?
531,Bree,it's time for your heart medication.
1465,Bree,"thanks,betty,and,um--i'd appreciate it if you could keep this little incident to yourself."
2341,Bree,detective ridley. can i help you?
3801,Bree,you're paid based on your contribution.
1960,Bree,"well, i thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect."
211,Bree,take off those handcuffs please.
654,Bree,i don't think it's asking that much. all you need to do is remove one little name.
3736,Bree,what?
1382,Bree,"this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it. andrew, i want us to heal. i want us to be a family again."
1564,Bree,penny?
3524,Bree,"but it isn't, sandra, because i don't think i'm great. i have fallen down more times than i can count, just like so many other housewives out there, we're all just barely holding on, and we all think that we're alone. so maybe you're right. maybe it isn't a cookbook. it's a lifeline from me to those other women, because i want them to know there's always a chance to get something right. even if it's just a casserole."
1133,Bree,"thank you. ah, the hearse is right outside, so if you'll just follow me."
1909,Bree,"one can only hope.of course, if a doctor gets here first and sees that someone forgot to release me, i'm sure they'd get in a lot of trouble."
2863,Bree,"hey, susan, orson likes to sleep with the window open. do you mind if we rearrange the furniture?"
2621,Bree,"uh, guys--what did i tell you?"
2206,Bree,"honey, would you put on another cd? something with sleigh bells."
2392,Bree,"orson, i have caught you cheating. at least have the courtesy to wake up! oh, for god sakes. orson! orson? what have you done to him?!"
174,Bree,"honey, the marriage counselling might not work out, you need to get used to bad cooking."
3212,Bree,listen--van de kamp--hodge.
2502,Bree,absolutely.
2608,Bree,you know how i feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles. they're too dangerous. we'll donate it to the church.
3982,Bree,so i think i have to divorce him.
142,Bree,"i'm staying for the show. i'm dying to see what all the fuss is about. excuse me, waitress, i'll have a glass of your house chardonnay."
491,Bree,"george, you shouldn't have."
548,Bree,"you are such a special man, george williams. and you deserve such a special woman."
274,Bree,"well, he better be good, because when i'm finished with you, you won't have a cent to your name!"
3489,Bree,"what? well, who is it then?"
912,Bree,when i finish making the bed.
1375,Bree,"well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so he could marry me. honey, please use your coaster. that's gonna leave a ring."
496,Bree,the memory of this night will stay with you forever.
2140,Bree,"well, that hotel room was small, and you seemed happy enough there. oh, and i trust you to be discreet. you wouldn't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce."
3187,Bree,"well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley. mine calls for minced flat leaf."
3294,Bree,"orson, i'm truly sorry. it's just, seeing--all these mistakes that she's making with benjamin, it's just so hard for me."
1199,Bree,"so i was talking to one of the bellmen, and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback riding. doesn't that sound like fun? george?"
1420,Bree,"here's a check for $100.that's enough for a retainer, right?"
1230,Bree,"see, george, um, the thing is--"
3328,Bree,oh. who?
4068,Bree,"orson, i'm home."
4104,Bree,i wanted to protect what was mine. you have turned into someone i don't recognize.
238,Bree,"oh,"" ""i suppose it can wait."
3024,Bree,and--it worked beautifully. i'm in.
2739,Bree,is everything okay?
2689,Bree,sure! how familiar are you with pop icons from the '70s?
139,Bree,i hope it wasn't anything i said.
3775,Bree,"i knew. i just thought if they'd tasted mine, they might change the rules."
1860,Bree,please don't make excuses for him.that is exactly what his father does. rex!
2404,Bree,"no, dear, you were dead to the waist."
3859,Bree,"ah, you're a lifesaver!"
3151,Bree,ugh. what more can you do to me?
996,Bree,"this is my third phone call, mr. flannery. and if someone doesn't call me back soon, i'm going to be irritated."
849,Bree,"i am not having an affair! george and i-we just talk. he's a very good listener and i share my hopes and dreams with him and my innermost thoughts. and that's all there is to it, and you have to believe me."
3565,Bree,"yes, that's the one. so anytime you wanna get in there and start hacking away, he's ready for you. aren't you, love?"
3285,Bree,"yes. yes, it is."
1618,Bree,"well,you know,before mike came along,i always just assumed they'd get back together."
1597,Bree,"oh,there's no pretending.i am going to my first a.a. meeting tomorrow.of course,i picked one in the worst part of town so i won't run into anybody i know,which,of course,means i will."
2123,Bree,pump her.
2127,Bree,i didn't call you that.
2726,Bree,"orson, you better take benjamin to the other room before my friends run out of lies. ah."
1657,Bree,"thanks,but i'm not really out of the woods yet.i still have this whole court case hanging over my head."
3351,Bree,"honey, i don't snore."
3013,Bree,"prove me wrong, sweetie. prove me wrong."
3243,Bree,gaby!
1306,Bree,"well, then why did you date her in the first place?"
972,Bree,do not close that coffin.
3004,Bree,so--i don't really know how to be friends with you.
68,Bree,"well, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?"
2273,Bree,i know--but it scares the hell out of me.
3784,Bree,andrew moved into a new home. i simply gave him a cost of living increase.
1896,Bree,"i don't have time for therapy, you quack!now let me out of here!let go of me!you idiot. let go of me!"
3060,Bree,i saw you kissing my husband.
1607,Bree,"oh! um, i couldn't possibly top that.thank you, though."
0,Bree,"there we go. feel better? lynette, you were saying?"
3499,Bree,is that what i saw on the tape-- a relationship?
3666,Bree,"""tough""? that's not a word i would use to describe myself."
3631,Bree,"mmm. you're sweet. oh, all right. get the lace tablecloth. i will pretend to like this woman. just like i pretended to like nana."
1987,Bree,your wife disappeared?
1083,Bree,"stop it, the two of you, this instant! this was a perfectly lovely evening and now the both of you have ruined it. i will not tolerate this kind of behavior. do you understand?"
1786,Bree,"listen,i don't expect you to lie about the alcoholism.i mean,they know that's how we met.it's just--you know,the other thing."
3961,Bree,i know.
1378,Bree,"andrew, i'm not trying to minimize my part in this. believe me, i, i hate myself for what's happened."
3948,Bree,i don't know. a few words describing how we felt about her?
2613,Bree,"orson, i said be careful! i just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby."
3432,Bree,is that bad?
134,Bree,call andrew and find out where he is.
816,Bree,he said you're still in love with me.
15,Bree,are you doing drugs?
2351,Bree,"oh, make no mistake, our friendship is over."
3521,Bree,thank you.
1675,Bree,"peter. hi,it's bree."
576,Bree,huh?
502,Bree,here. take the gun.
1862,Bree,and this is my son--the criminal. go on.
2745,Bree,that you even felt such a thing was necessary.
1886,Bree,i committed myself voluntarily.
3923,Bree,"i stopped by the prison today. the guard tells me you've been visiting orson--sometimes twice a week, she said."
386,Bree,meet someone. i'm raising your children.
3021,Bree,"yeah, sure. you know, i don't really think it's fair that you should profit from something that i designed."
1281,Bree,how did this get in the paper?
2519,Bree,"oh, it gets worse. her pie was better than mine."
1072,Bree,"george, you're a very special friend, you are, but rex hasn't been dead four weeks so i think kissing on the lips is-"
628,Bree,"well, i'll tell you. my daughter is planning on giving you her virginity and i would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn't take it."
3755,Bree,"uh, take your time. i'm sorry. we haven't been introduced. i'm bree hodge, part owner."
2623,Bree,phyllis!
3527,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i can wait. mmm, he looks so peaceful."
3418,Bree,"oh! yes, of course. uh, i'm his wife bree. i'm afraid he's out running errands, but he's told me all about you."
2009,Bree,"if the three of you don't drop this right now, i will never forgive you."
1842,Bree,barbie!
958,Bree,"reverend, if you don't call her on that incredibly insensitive comment, i'm gonna lose it."
1730,Bree,i think you'd love the opera.the music and the voices--it's just all so-- passionate.
2582,Bree,gaby!
396,Bree,yeah. but i['d still buy that camera.
631,Bree,"well, she feels very passionately about you."
2953,Bree,it just did.
3068,Bree,"well, that sounds boring. i know. why don't you take him to edie's house, and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?"
936,Bree,you are gonna come through this operation just fine.
202,Bree,"oh,good, because last night you put me in such a holiday mood, so i'm going to make roast turkey and canned yams and egg nog. have you ever had real old-fashioned egg nog?"
3938,Bree,we brought you some muffins. you can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
1355,Bree,"yes, you did. but that's not what i'm talking about. you killed rex. but i know it wasn't totally your fault because you're not well. so, if you'll just be honest with me, i can forgive you. it'll be the hardest thing i've ever done, but i'll do it. but you have to, you have to tell me the truth."
3033,Bree,"i know, but i'm the one thing you can't have."
571,Bree,good. i'm looking forward to it. are you looking forward to it?
3679,Bree,"well, why not? it was a fairly grand gesture on my part."
546,Bree,yes.
825,Bree,"come on, rex, you owe george some sort of a gesture."
1654,Bree,hello.
3320,Bree,"yes, you will."
3250,Bree,"at this point, i would just run off screaming into the night."
686,Bree,they've been in the drawer for a few months. i had a feeling we might be needing them.
1150,Bree,"well, he did something to upset me and i want him gone!"
2213,Bree,"but, orson--"
1216,Bree,"well,i'll just have to get over it,won't i?"
1686,Bree,what?! why?
196,Bree,nothing.that's it. just that mary alice killed herself because of something he had done.
582,Bree,what do you want me to say? my husband likes to wear metal clamps around his nipples. hooray?
3171,Bree,mm. and i know this before i've tasted it?
2177,Bree,#name?
1867,Bree,do i know you?
1034,Bree,"no, you may not record this."
3444,Bree,"no, i'm not."
59,Bree,"that is not true, rex."
1053,Bree,yes.
3125,Bree,"hi. i'm, uh, here to check on orson hodge. an ambulance brought him in less than an hour ago."
2943,Bree,"i meant sample, like a buffet. you take a little plate of everything, and then you sit down for the main course, which is across the street--at the presbyterian church."
1345,Bree,"george, i know what you did to dr. goldfine. and i can see now just how sick you really are, so please just turn yourself in and that way you can get the help that you really need. george!"
3959,Bree,"well, save it for those karaoke parties at bob and lee's. i am not amused."
1810,Bree,i don't want to talk about it.
3523,Bree,"i wrote a cookbook, sandra-- meatloaf, pot pies, peach cobbler. why are you trying to crucify me?"
3345,Bree,"sorry, but i prefer their campaign."
2954,Bree,"lynette, why didn't you tell me?"
438,Bree,"yes, i think it would be fun."
1145,Bree,"detective, i know exactly what my husband deserves. now would you be a dear?"
2747,Bree,i'm only thinking of benjamin. be reasonable.
108,Bree,"well, why can't you?"
3357,Bree,"oh, that's not until 4:00."
3437,Bree,what?!
1676,Bree,"no! no,i-i don't feel like i'm gonna drink.and if i did,i certainly would call donna.i mean,she and i are just--we're just really clicking."
4112,Bree,"as of this moment, rex, i am no longer your wife. i am going to go out, and find the most vindictive lawyer i can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you. i'm going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity. do you hear me?"
828,Bree,"no, he doesn't hate you. he hardly knows you, and you don't even really know him."
128,Bree,it's a tough call.
2089,Bree,"i know how painful this must be for you. it isn't easy for me either, considering andrew's role in it."
1033,Bree,"well, it was a marriage. of course there were problems."
2353,Bree,a house?
3224,Bree,"okay, now i'm terrified."
2597,Bree,no. this early?
3416,Bree,"when you're done with that, the oven could use a really good scrubbing."
263,Bree,what happened?
3280,Bree,"well, because she's all grown-up. you see, hot dogs and hamburgers are what make little boys and girls grow up to be big and strong. and now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore."
2265,Bree,i'll deal with you later.
2694,Bree,"you always say that like it's something to be proud of, but the day i see even a glimmer of myself in you is the day that i realize you've finally started-- to grow up."
3349,Bree,"orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?"
858,Bree,"i think that as soon as you're well enough we should go on a vacation. take a trip, go somewhere fun. remember our trip to italy?"
2450,Bree,there. now you have something new.
3484,Bree,"orson, we don't need to know."
552,Bree,"if you could just tell me what he told you,then i could fix the problem."
1419,Bree,"hi, karl. oh!oh, um, quick question--when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself,when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?"
2288,Bree,"i know it sounds suspicious, but in my heart of hearts, i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing."
26,Bree,oh wait?
183,Bree,"i'm serving it this year for christmas. i like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday. that way, if the cook book has gotten it wrong, i can fix it."
700,Bree,you no longer get an allowance.
4031,Bree,was that necessary?
3078,Bree,"edie, if word got out, my whole family would be--humiliated."
1225,Bree,hi.
258,Bree,"well, then, if that is the case, then take me, right here, right now. the house is spotless. there aren't any burritos lying around to pull my focus--"
458,Bree,"oh, uh, you remember mr. williams, our pharmacist?"
771,Bree,i'm making homemade bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage. it's a recipe i found in an old german cook book.
3472,Bree,that does it. we're pressing charges.
2051,Bree,"andrew, please!"
1918,Bree,"things were falling apart at home, and i just--i just needed a place to rest, that's all."
381,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life.you're not getting something from me,but you're simply too afraid to ask."
121,Bree,where were you last night?
2269,Bree,monique polier? i thought that was harvey bigsby's mistress.
3042,Bree,except for the occasional hit-and-run.
3839,Bree,bruce's tape recorder.
3604,Bree,hey there. do you have a second?
3716,Bree,"thanks, but i know exactly what i'm gonna make."
1461,Bree,"oh,for goodness sakes!"
3094,Bree,wonderful! with a little goat cheese.
200,Bree,but how?
1214,Bree,"george, wait. please don't go. stay here with me."
541,Bree,"and even now, you know, after the betrayal, i, i know that we're supposed to be together. but i don't know how i can be with someone i don't trust."
2920,Bree,"lynette, please, we don't do that here."
235,Bree,dr. goldfine.
3549,Bree,that doesn't sound right.
1410,Bree,absolutely not.i think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
2973,Bree,"oh, no, thank you. we have so much ground to cover. now let's move on to the flowers. uh, last year, we went with a cascade of pink and white roses. there it is."
3182,Bree,"katherine! fantastic news. ""what's cookin' fairview?"" is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book."
1098,Bree,"george, you have to have this. it's absolutely scrumptious."" ""ummm, ummm!"
3689,Bree,we're ready! come on.
832,Bree,"mmmh! oh, george, you have got to taste this. it's a little messy but.."
450,Bree,"rex, say hello to george!"
2646,Bree,"of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste."
1509,Bree,what on earth?
3678,Bree,i mean i bought you a house. you'd think you'd show me a little respect.
614,Bree,"as a matter of fact it does, and just so we're clear, if you get lisa pregnant, you will marry her."
468,Bree,there comes this point in every boy's life--
1265,Bree,"well, i'm just smiling because i think a few months from now you are gonna come to me and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby, and i'm gonna have to resist the urge to say 'i told you so.'"
3430,Bree,"mmm. ohh. mwah. well, you deserve some credit, too. i mean, you brought us peter's business."
3832,Bree,this is not what i had in mind.
1853,Bree,that would be nice.
1630,Bree,"andrew,the judge is not seriously gonna believe that i beat you."
885,Bree,don't say that.
1118,Bree,george.
749,Bree,how can you say that it doesn't matter? of course it matters.
2699,Bree,"well, unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council forbids us from using live ammo in our own backyards."
3621,Bree,i'm a caterer. i oversee events on thanksgiving. it's the one holiday that i don't need.
2673,Bree,but you can't raise this child in a miami dorm room. you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
2730,Bree,"i'd start saving your pennies. bonny briar's up to $10,000 a year."
1271,Bree,"you know, honey, people change."
1741,Bree,"no, i'm not."
4127,Bree,proceed.
1178,Bree,"oh so you uh, think i'm crazy?"
835,Bree,"i've had one better, in italy."
1261,Bree,"well, maybe they'll just be happy for you."
1093,Bree,doesn't it require a large entrance fee? one that you can't afford by yourself?
2527,Bree,i hope this isn't a bad time. i just wanted to bring you a housewarming gift. it's the recipe for my special mincemeat pie. it wouldn't be thanksgiving at my house without it.
680,Bree,"gabby, this is the way i see it -- good friends offer to help in a crisis. great friends don't take no for an answer."
1031,Bree,she's my mother-in-law. of course she said horrible things about me.
1787,Bree,"they're just getting to know you,and so i want them to focus on your good qualities.i just don't know how they'll react if they find out that you're a sex addict."
2453,Bree,"it is so good to be back. i can't believe how much is happening. i mean, you and gaby getting married, and i'm having a baby. what's going on with you, lynette?"
3290,Bree,that is not meat.
1570,Bree,i will not be spoken to like that.i just won't.
1966,Bree,"ahh, excuse me."
3934,Bree,i never told you about that because--i was embarrassed.
2347,Bree,"right, just like you knew she was dead."
610,Bree,is lisa your friend with the pierced navel?
2706,Bree,"that's not what i meant, and you know it, and as for your little imitation of me, i don't sound anything like that."
2569,Bree,we should help mike with the food.
1905,Bree,"exactly, and look how well you turned out."
1603,Bree,"you know,the opposite of love isn't hate.it's indifference.and if you hate me,that means you still care,and we're still connected,and i still have a chance to set you right."
247,Bree,then perhaps you shouldn't say anything.
1155,Bree,"i have done nothing to be forgiven for! i was a fantastic wife! when he was sick, i nursed him. when we were low on money, i stayed within a budget. i cooked his meals, i mended his clothes. for the love of god, i used to check his back for acne. and that miserable son of a bitch has the nerve to understand and forgive me! well, the joke's on him because i do not understand and i do not forgive!"
2388,Bree,no reason.
1395,Bree,"oh.bye, sweetie."
3191,Bree,"this is my kitchen, and this is my staff--the most gifted, hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for. i cannot say enough good things about them."
2667,Bree,"seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough to take on the burden of motherhood all by yourself."
3895,Bree,this is happening so fast.
3194,Bree,"oh, you poor dear. could someone please get some ice? oh, no."
4011,Bree,"now, m.j., we can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick. what do you say? will you invite him? would you like some ice cream with your macaroons? because i could make that happen."
3093,Bree,and also with you. do not give this man peace.
347,Bree,"well, that's because you just don't love him as much as i do!"
3083,Bree,yes.
2344,Bree,susan?
2056,Bree,thank you.
303,Bree,we can only hope.
288,Bree,"no, and in the future i would appreciate you keeping your ridiculous ideas to yourself!"
1483,Bree,danielle--
1099,Bree,george.
1792,Bree,"isn't this wonderful?good food,pleasant conversation--this really is a very special night."
4036,Bree,"yes, being a lady takes effort."
684,Bree,"well, glad that you asked."
1723,Bree,"oh,dad,andrew hates labels.i'm sure it's just a phase."
2829,Bree,"yes. that was unfortunate. if you need any antibacterial soap, i-"
3768,Bree,where are you going?
3816,Bree,"maybe i can help. my publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone."
3325,Bree,"apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year."
1076,Bree,"ah, wel,l it's getting late, so-"
941,Bree,what a waste.
281,Bree,"oh, is she now! and when you were planning on telling me?"
842,Bree,i um. i have to talk to edie.
3966,Bree,"oh, right. i heard she was here."
2625,Bree,"well, i'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, phyllis, but i didn't want orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home."
2807,Bree,"seriously, andrew, you don't even have a bed."
3184,Bree,really? what?
1023,Bree,insurance investigator?
891,Bree,"oh, well, that's very nice of you."
3734,Bree,"come on, lynette. you can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off."
657,Bree,i have fourteen thousand dollars in that account. it can all be yours.
714,Bree,for being here. for standing by me through this.
2602,Bree,oh!
664,Bree,"no, i think they're laughing at you. i think they feel sorry for me, which is just as mortifying."
3683,Bree,"fine. then as my employee, i authorize a 5-minute break so we can talk about my son's boyfriend and his absurd overreaction this afternoon."
2032,Bree,"orson, you can't imagine that we are still going!"
3648,Bree,"it was going to be a surprise, you know, for your wedding. unfortunately, this whole silly oakdale thing has forced me to show my hand."
4065,Bree,"no, she has a choice. it's entirely possible to get what you want without being perceived of as a nagging shrew."
1491,Bree,"now that you mention it,i guess i do.i have to go. i have some,um, muffins in the oven."
886,Bree,so could i.
1116,Bree,"george, it's my pattern. where did you find it?"
2139,Bree,good.then we're all set.here are some of her clothes.i'll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.
2555,Bree,"i, um--don't remember."
537,Bree,hi! wha-what are you doing here?
3866,Bree,"uh, i don't know. but, you know, there it is."
3880,Bree,why would you want to hurt me?
873,Bree,"like famine, or disease, or hobos. whatever. just hurry."
2196,Bree,is she all right?
1387,Bree,"he didn't die on his terms, andrew. he paid for what he did to your father."
2287,Bree,i can't. not yet. i need some time to think.
2289,Bree,what in the world?
2956,Bree,"just-- wanted to tell you that i'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary. i told reverend sykes to, uh, give it to edna fletcher. she was in the peace corps, you know."
3338,Bree,"well, you've only been looking for a few weeks. i mean, give it another-- say, month or two, and you still haven't found anything, then we'll revisit the idea. okay?"
3029,Bree,susan 
559,Bree,let's just say that i put them in an imaginary box and don't plan on looking at them for a while.
130,Bree,and we think that you should have it.
3000,Bree,"i certainly, uh, wasn't expecting it."
377,Bree,good. where does andrew keep his marijuana?
3257,Bree,"here they come, finally."
1990,Bree,"orson, my hand."
1544,Bree,"well,okay.tony?how many more arias is he gonna sing?"
1758,Bree,"hi,i'm--i'm looking for,um, peter mcmillan."
2002,Bree,"well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman. strangers may talk, but i know the truth."
395,Bree,because i have faith that he'll come back. and that he'll do the right thing.
3174,Bree,oh. sorry. paid for what?
1476,Bree,"honey, stop complaining.one day you'll wish that someone were offering to do your laundry."
3610,Bree,"you're going to marry him. i thought he wasn't being honest with you. i wanted to protect you, so i"
2883,Bree,"oh, thanks, dear."
2603,Bree,that is so kind of you.
3536,Bree,not exactly true. the doctor said there's a very simple procedure--
2525,Bree,she will have stolen my entire identity.
812,Bree,"yes, we have. . and you still don't know when i need you to lie."
3141,Bree,"oh, i get it. so i'm desperate and vulnerable, and you're gonna swoop in and save the day. well, thank you very much. i'm fine."
2102,Bree,"you know, we never discussed what it was like for you while you were-- away. i just want you to know, if you ever wanna talk about it, there's nothing you can't tell me."
192,Bree,what did you do??? zach? sweetheart?
2488,Bree,"oh! no,no,i'm fine!i'm fine!"
642,Bree,"tisha. tisha. oh, i can tell by that look on your face you've got something good. now, come on, don't be selfish."
451,Bree,"i'm going to go put these in water. george, why don't you have a seat, and i'll be right back."
2345,Bree,i don't believe this. you called the police?
191,Bree,you do?
3552,Bree,when you were downstairs.
1408,Bree,her gardener.
3124,Bree,orson. orson.
2638,Bree,"we're saying that the baby is mine and orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious."
2302,Bree,orson?
1556,Bree,porter! preston!this isn't funny!
3710,Bree,you think i'm just like every other housewife?
2446,Bree,"wow, somebody's--blonder."
1884,Bree,fine. then i'm going back to my room.
254,Bree,i was there. i was willing. normal men don't say no to that.
3379,Bree,it's not that easy. you know she'll be furious.
827,Bree,"hi. you left the party so quickly i didn't have the chance to apologise to you for what rex did. oh, george, i'm so sorry he humiliated you in front of all those people. i don't know what got into him."
901,Bree,"forcing me to share in your depraved pasttime wasn't bad enough, you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?"
540,Bree,"it was my first week in college, and i went to a meeting of the young republicans where rex gave a speech, and i went up to him afterward and introduced myself, and i told him that i agreed with his stance on the death penalty. he took me out to a diner, and we, uh, stayed up till two in the morning talking about big government, gun control and illegal immigration. ah. it was just--it was just such a magical night, and i knew, by the time he got me back to my dorm, that one day i was going to be mrs. rex van de kamp."
3617,Bree,really? they say that?
1434,Bree,"oh,well,where does she live?"
1122,Bree,stop it!
2687,Bree,are you insane?
2799,Bree,"he's in the exam room, readjusting the chair."
2758,Bree,i should only have a nickel for every time i've heard that.
613,Bree,you may be able to abdicate all your parental responsibility but i cannot.
2364,Bree,"how can i be calm?! for months, people thought you killed your first wife. no sooner does she show up and clear your name, than the police haul you off to ask you about another murder!"
544,Bree,"no, george, it's not okay. it was insensitive. i know how you feel about me, and i--"
1507,Bree,"oh, come on. do you honestly expect us to believe that you had the time to prepare a 6-course meal for 10 women?even i couldn't make this and i have time to get ready for a party"
1417,Bree,andrew--
804,Bree,please don't be this way. he's the only friend i have who is interested in cultural things.
2350,Bree,you heard me. get out!
1043,Bree,"i was in shock, danielle. you know that. andrew, surely you don't think i murdered your father."
1264,Bree,"oh, come on. you don't think you're gonna love your own baby?"
2663,Bree,let him talk.
4057,Bree,"see, this is why i wanted to check on my things. you don't leave a valuable painting on the damn floor. you need to put something underneath it."
2980,Bree,"""take over""? what in god's name have you done with my french onion soup?"
1151,Bree,"you know, it's so unpleasant i'd rather not get into it. have you seen these gravestones? some are from the eighteen hundreds. just fascinating."
3871,Bree,"after i told you to stay out of the neighbors' houses? you stole again, didn't you?"
683,Bree,you know we are just lucky that that security guard did not press charges.
1152,Bree,"my husband, the man i spent my life with for eighteen years, died thinking that i murdered him!"
1351,Bree,george. george!
1904,Bree,"why is my certainty a flaw? i know what i'm about,i know my values, and i know what's right.why shouldn't i stay the course? am i right, mr. williams?"
798,Bree,what thing? we don't have a thing.
3494,Bree,let's not dwell on it.
1277,Bree,how are you?
1854,Bree,"hello.my name is bree van de kamp,and i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation."
2045,Bree,"yes, very, and i'm worried sick about him."
1707,Bree,"justin,what happened?"
974,Bree,give me your tie!
3735,Bree,okay.
1520,Bree,"is that what you really think, danielle?i should go to mrs. applewhite, be nice,and then she'll hand over all her secrets?"
2172,Bree,this is not possible.
2369,Bree,"you went over there to read her the riot act. instead, it looked like you were reading her a bedtime story."
945,Bree,"here's your tea, phyllis."
1381,Bree,"andrew, i made an appointment with a therapist for you, me, and danielle."
126,Bree,if the school and the paediatrician both think that the twins could stand to be medicated-then what's the problem?
2951,Bree,lynette--
3138,Bree,"oh! yes, i'm sorry. one cherub delivered at 1:30."
3515,Bree,"now, um, may i pour you some more tea?"
2819,Bree,and everything will be just the way it was.
3090,Bree,"oh, please. i saw you at my nail salon."
2309,Bree,so you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother?
2507,Bree,what about her?
1640,Bree,"tonight was a very unusual situation.i wish you could've known me when--rex was alive and my kids were young,and everything was--the way it was supposed to be.i think you really would've liked me-- so much."
586,Bree,good night.
931,Bree,because i told you: the best is yet to come.
2836,Bree,"be that as it may, i really think you should go now."
1560,Bree,i most certainly was not.
758,Bree,"don't get up. i'll be quick. andrew, all any parent can do is try to provide their child with the tools to succeed in life. education, love, a good, clean safe home. well, i have given you those things and i'm through feeling guilty. so if you want to piss your life away and blame it on how horrible things are at home, then go ahead. but i want it stated for the record that i am a good mother. do you hear me? i am a good mother."
1661,Bree,what do you mean?
545,Bree,thank you.
2050,Bree,looking for you. how did you get that bruise?
3038,Bree,"exactly, and if you could muster that kind of moral courage, i think i could forgive you. oh, come on. i promise i'll wait for you."
600,Bree,"honey, you have to talk to him."
1702,Bree,"my mother didn't think they were awful.when i made those same cookies for her,she loved them."
3546,Bree,"either tell mike how you feel or move on, because that's what he's trying to do, and it's not fair to stop him. you need to make a decision, susan. and i need to get back to my nap."
1092,Bree,"andrew, don't you have a meet at the swim club?"
3378,Bree,"well, it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party."
314,Bree,but i'll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.
285,Bree,did you offer to help danielle get into modeling school?
25,Bree,what?
2611,Bree,not without a helmet.
2824,Bree,did i do something wrong?
879,Bree,"already? wow, good for her."
398,Bree,"oh! well, that's um, very thoughtful of you."
2424,Bree,and you say he's just down the hall?
2326,Bree,susan. hi. it's bree.
1327,Bree,i don't think we are any more.
2377,Bree,"uh, yes, i need to speak to my husband. yes, there is. could you please ask him to come home as early as possible tonight? thank you."
994,Bree,"i am not cold. i just, well, i don't like public displays of emotion."
3023,Bree,"oh, i see what's going on here. this is shameless emotional blackmail."
2714,Bree,you're a dentist! what if there are complications?
2546,Bree,point well taken. i'll bring the wine.
792,Bree,"oh, andrew. thank you. you don't know how much that means to me."
3602,Bree,what?
3144,Bree,"okay, so you have another one of those in the truck? thank you."
97,Bree,rex cries after he ejaculates.
1329,Bree,if you'll excuse me for just one minute.
978,Bree,no. in theory.
208,Bree,"we will do it again. we'll have our impromptu holiday dinner, i promise. bye."
1986,Bree,please leave my house.
3314,Bree,"oh, my god! that is so amazing! the, uh, dry cleaner just, um--found my sweater."
2011,Bree,"excuse me, could you give us just a second?"
1119,Bree,george. george. george!
1976,Bree,"i was, ah, with my fiance.we were lying down, resting."
3791,Bree,or taffy swallow. we moved around a lot and had three dogs.
150,Bree,"if you think i'm going to apologise for taking you out of a strip club, you're wrong! i consider it one of my finest moments."
4042,Bree,what is that?
3486,Bree,why? i'm embarrassed enough as it is.
3567,Bree,"oh, he's not apprehensive. he's terrified. and i don't care, because he owes me one--a big one. don't you, darling?"
1190,Bree,because i am starting to get that rash again.
3560,Bree,i just don't understand why i feel so loopy.
3428,Bree,"my god, he's still there."
2882,Bree,you know what else you two have in common? a love of boots.
1946,Bree,"hi, hi, hi, hi.i'm so sorry i'm late."
56,Bree,"oh, who cares what he thinks? i took psychology in college, we learned all about freud. a miserable human being."
1014,Bree,really?
3309,Bree,very funny. i hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.
3865,Bree,that's not yours?
1693,Bree,"andrew,i forgive you."
2084,Bree,she told me she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.
3661,Bree,it's true. there's a reason the local car dealers send you a fruit basket every christmas. wow hush.
730,Bree,"porter, honey, those cookies are hot. just wait a few minutes and i'll give you one when they're cool, okay."
2670,Bree,"well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. you're be happier here."
1961,Bree,hum.it will be better this way.now can i get you some more ice cream?
659,Bree,thank you.
1566,Bree,"no!ah,you know,i may have had just the tiniest little bit of chardonnay."
1751,Bree,"well, i have been doing some thinking and--here's a thought--why don't i be your sponsor?"
2476,Bree,"oh,well,i'm--i'm sorry about your vegetables,but that pine shields my view of the purcells' backyard,and if you had ever seen mr.purcell sunbathe,well,you'd know exactly what that tree means to me."
2271,Bree,no. i'm done.
3939,Bree,"a couple of days ago. we've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country."
2263,Bree,is that alcohol? where did you get that?
2400,Bree,"i'm sorry, but you've been out cold for ten hours, and we need to talk."
1740,Bree,"yeah! you know, they're always coming up with these excuses to justify being a home-wrecker."
3953,Bree,how?
1055,Bree,no.
2544,Bree,"well, i doubt a woman like katherine is gonna spill her secrets just - because she's had a little win"
598,Bree,no.
2696,Bree,ugh! i hate possums.
1243,Bree,what happens in nine months?
3985,Bree,wait. i'm not planning on giving him half. it's my business.
3503,Bree,"that was all local. this is ""the new york dispatch."" if this goes well, my cookbook could be on the front page of their weekend style section. katherine, what did you do to your hair? i've never seen it look so thick and lustrous."
2323,Bree,why don't i wrap up a piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later?
2671,Bree,"well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday, but since you're keeping the baby, you'll want a more practical gift."
499,Bree,"oh, george, that's so sweet. now come on, let's go shoot something!"
3518,Bree,i cannot let this happen. i have to find her.
3568,Bree,"are you married, dr. cominis?"
2469,Bree,"well,uh,dining chairs.there's a clue."
2888,Bree,"watch your mouth. i would never suggest that. you can raise a man's hopes without satisfying them. i've done it all my life. andrew, i have got to get back into my house, and you're my only hope."
1104,Bree,"well, i think given everything that's happened, um, it's perfectly justified that you'd be frightened of zach."
2101,Bree,you're awful.
1885,Bree,and how are you going to do that?
2557,Bree,"ooh. here you go, but please don't mention my name. as i said, you know, he's overbooked, and i just don't want to get on his bad side."
2944,Bree,"no, no problem. just talking to my friend."
4076,Bree,"i don't need any help. and besides, my parisian salad doesn't call for any chives."
1467,Bree,"yes,but the difference is most of those people were actually drunk when they were arrested.i was not."
105,Bree,i didn't have time to make an appointment. rex moved out today.
820,Bree,yes. and bring ginger.
2762,Bree,"oh, we had a very busy day. we dropped off the dry cleaning, we deposited money into our christmas account, and then we got circumcised."
841,Bree,"but honey, we socialise with them. what am i going to say to helen?"
1647,Bree,it was just a peck on the cheek.
1141,Bree,how would you know that?
3395,Bree,and she'll be twice as mad at having been put in that position. i am not telling her tonight.
3990,Bree,"well, that's the rule. there's nothing you can do about it. so stop bitching."
3052,Bree,edie!
2022,Bree,could you excuse me for a just a minute.
3699,Bree,you use my cookbook to balance your table?
627,Bree,"hello, john. i'm sorry to drop by on you, unannounced. do you have a moment?"
2712,Bree,"okay, everybody, in the house now."
1007,Bree,george. what are you doing here?
4087,Bree,"i had to. he found the storage unit. he wanted an explanation. i was in such a state of shock, i couldn't think of anything else to say."
2026,Bree,i hope to.
1115,Bree,oh.
3126,Bree,i'm his wife.
555,Bree,all i know is this: mary alice loved zach more than anything in the world. when you love a child that much--
769,Bree,it'll be fine.
1677,Bree,"i know it's really late notice,but a friend of mine,uh,got engagedand she's throwing a party,and i thought,um,maybe you'd like to come."
1971,Bree,okay.
618,Bree,"danielle, you are president of the abstinence club."
1039,Bree,"at the risk of ruining a lovely evening, i have some unpleasant news. the police dug up your father today."
3087,Bree,neither did i.
4046,Bree,like i could finally take it off and be myself.
3466,Bree,"yeah, and the best part is we get to see each other all the time."
965,Bree,"no, i don't. if you heard the things that she said to me-"
2893,Bree,oh. you're going to eat that--here?
943,Bree,you're about to find out.
57,Bree,"well, think about it. he grew up in the late 1800's, there were no appliances back then. his mother had to do everything by hand, just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown. not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family. and what does he do? he grows up and becomes famous, peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother has done. there you go."
52,Bree,"what? oh, oh, oh no, thank you. i have some things that i, i need to do today."
1671,Bree,"oh!well,good for you."
688,Bree,"oh come on, don't be so dramatic. some of these places actually look fun. look. camp hennessey."" ""camp hennessey teaches kids respect for authority and boundaries in a summer camp-like atmosphere."
1215,Bree,"well, i'll just have to get over it, won't i?"
1291,Bree,"uh, yes, i think so, mr. williams."
1217,Bree,"honey, you need to put that in a frame or something."
3799,Bree,"no, you were a dentist. now you're a caterer, and you're paid fairly based on your expertise and contribution."
2301,Bree,you're right--
2643,Bree,"oh, he was happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits."
2386,Bree,excuse me?
4111,Bree,what just happened?
2433,Bree,andrew? danielle?
998,Bree,probably.
2421,Bree,but why?
1562,Bree,"oh,truthfully,i haven't been able to get my mind off it.what a scare,huh?"
2903,Bree,this is a conversation that could benefit from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.
605,Bree,"so what are you saying, that the twins murdered martha?"
906,Bree,"i don't know, rex. maybe you were bragging or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me. well, congratulations, you did it. i am officially destroyed."
3660,Bree,don't encourage him! orson is a horrible negotiator. he's never met a sticker price he didn't like.
1087,Bree,yes. a bad one. i hope you haven't made plans for tomorrow night.
602,Bree,"well, then the least we can do is go search his room and if we find any more of these, we'll confiscate them."
3396,Bree,"no, you will not. i forbid it."
737,Bree,"well, i'm not your mommy and if you mess around in my house you will get spanked. now be good."
32,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
1496,Bree,betty.what a surprise.
186,Bree,"it was right before christmas as a matter of fact. we were all singing carols and the dog was howling, because everyone in my family sings off-key except for me.anyway, it was just a terrible ruckus.so no-one noticed when my mother wenta cross the street to give the neighbour their gift. the next thing we heard were brakes screeching."
776,Bree,"well, that's just too bad because this needs to be discussed."
724,Bree,"because the minute i get there, andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him and i don't want to hear it."
2167,Bree,nice to be seen.
3163,Bree,first we have to do something to stop that bleeding.
932,Bree,hello?
417,Bree,"and i am so thrilled to know that you still love me. because i want what's about to happen to you, to hurt as much is as humanly possible. i'm so glad you didn't die before i got a chance to tell you that."
560,Bree,"well, it won't be easy at first. there'll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory love making, but after a few decades whiz by i'm sure i'll find a way to forgive him."
240,Bree,"no, i don't."
1384,Bree,"so, are you saying if he were executed, that it would be easier for you to get past this?"
222,Bree,"oh no, i don't worry about john. both he and danielle are in the abstinence club."
504,Bree,"uh, i'm not wearing perfume."
2343,Bree,can't this wait? we're having a dinner party.
3399,Bree,fine. you're fired.
690,Bree,"all right, what about this one. it's in the desert and it's very reasonable. barracks are a little bit bleak, but that recidivism rate is to die for!"
1978,Bree,"no, no, no.i've had orgasms before."
1038,Bree,get her out of here.
3793,Bree,"orson, why are you being so morbid?"
3714,Bree,"you mean, with my life? i don't know."
455,Bree,"well, i guess i should go inside."
2587,Bree,"i said i was sorry. for god sakes, susan, not everything is about you."
3599,Bree,don't give me that. you've been whispering to each other all night. you obviously know alex. how?
2855,Bree,"she said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which i know isn't true because i've seen him at the pool, and i would've remembered 'cause tattooed people make me very uncomfortable."
603,Bree,"well, if we take away his condoms, maybe--"
351,Bree,"oh lord, what do you want me to do?"
3236,Bree,and because it was the right thing to do. i just didn't know then that i would be a public figure someday. but i am. i have a name now.
323,Bree,"andrew, um, i know the last few days have been stressful, and, uh, you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody--"
284,Bree,i said no.
1052,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna respond to something that's none of your business."
3179,Bree,good.
1634,Bree,"hi,it's bree van de kamp.i didn't know who else to call,and,well,i'm in a bit of a situation."
3129,Bree,"ladies, i don't know what you're talking about. katherine has all sorts of wonderful qualities."
3502,Bree,the reporter's almost here. i am so nervous.
1293,Bree,can i help you?
3853,Bree,how about a confession? sit down. start talking.
2703,Bree,i expressly forbade her from coming tonight. who does she think she is?
474,Bree,"you are? oh, that's wonderful."
2886,Bree,"and poor walter just had his heart broken, so if it takes you being nice to him to get our house fixed, then--"
54,Bree,dr. goldfine. there is something you can do for me.
444,Bree,"it's a romantic date with a single attractive man, and i intend to french the hell out of him."
4061,Bree,"yes, and i'll be single again, and i can concentrate on my business, maybe do some traveling."
3964,Bree,great. be back in a minute.
1587,Bree,"his lawyer? well,why on earth would andrew need a lawyer?"
889,Bree,george. hi. what are you doing here?
3806,Bree,orson? why do you have a salt shaker from scavo's pizzeria?
3773,Bree,"lynette, stop. wait. please. don't be this way. i don't want money to get in the way of our friendship."
2845,Bree,"oh, my god. what did you do?"
3214,Bree,"oh, right. um, tomorrow for sure, then."
2775,Bree,"well, that doesn't make caring for an infant any less tiring. can't we just give it a chance?"
1218,Bree,"oh, come on, that's a picture of your baby. you can't tell me you're not a little bit excited."
976,Bree,--we don't really care what happens behind closed doors.
2501,Bree,we're your friends. why would you shut us out?
3157,Bree,i've already told you. turn yourself in to the police and let justice run its course.
1448,Bree,"you know what?i politely rejected you,and now you're getting your revenge by embarrassing me."
2995,Bree,"why not? i'm perfectly capable of presenting. i've done it for the last eight years. i mean, no one wants to accept an award from a woman who looks like she should be in line at the needle exchange."
2294,Bree,i said i had concerns. concerns that have disappeared now that mike has been arrested.
1969,Bree,i'm a republican!
262,Bree,"no, i don't. i sound like a woman whose husband won't touch her. rex, after mary alice killed herself, it all hit me. we all have our secrets, and i think it's time for you to tell me yours."
1385,Bree,"george didn't intend to commit suicide. he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back and he swallowed those pills hoping that i'd feel sorry for him. he just assumed that i would call an ambulance. when i got there, he was already slipping away. i tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done, but he wouldn't."
2113,Bree,when you start acting like an adult.
845,Bree,i saw you at alfredo's yesterday.
3459,Bree,"well, then i suggest you return your purchase. do you have a receipt?"
2277,Bree,"it's fun looking back at the past, isn't it?"
3152,Bree,"yes, and the ""venus de milo"" is missing two arms. what's your point?"
2110,Bree,"oh, and, gus, the carpet is beautiful."
3221,Bree,"no, i'm good. how do i look?"
1569,Bree,"no!the only problem i have is with your children.they're incorrigible because you let them run amok.and if i hadn't drifted off,they would have waited until i was in the bathroom or stuck on the phone or upstairs doing laundry."
1929,Bree,danielle--i want you to get out of the house now.he's a killer.
28,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
3942,Bree,we felt we owed it to your mom.
2562,Bree,"in your condition, that's what you should be doing. and where on earth did you get skates in a convent?"
2164,Bree,"oh, they are a regular barrel of--tish!"
318,Bree,"well, when did you decide this?"
2723,Bree,he looks just like you did. do you want to be alone with him? do you want me to--to go? what should i do?
1949,Bree,i'm not being coy.
3017,Bree,"katherine, need i remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices?"
449,Bree,"oh, we are, emotionally. physically, he just lives here because his mistress refuses to care for him. would you like a drink?"
3,Bree,"well, the least i could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning. i know you're out of your minds with grief."
3929,Bree,i do.
4095,Bree,you were assaulted?
2534,Bree,"well, it's tradition. i always organize our little get-togethers, and i always bring dessert."
3857,Bree,"you will do no such thing. from this moment on, you are forbidden from entering any of our friends' homes."
2160,Bree,carolyn knows tish?
1349,Bree,what?
1892,Bree,"i am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.do you know that you can be arrested for kidnapping,for detaining someone?!"
402,Bree,could i at least poke my head in? i'm his wife.
3279,Bree,"oh, yes. your mother loved hot dogs. every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me, ""mommy, i want hot dog."""
4006,Bree,then again--m.j. does--love my macaroons.
1136,Bree,detective barton. what are you doing here?
3886,Bree,"yes, am i speaking to mr. dinsmore? ah, this is bree van de kamp. yes, it's nice to talk to you, too. well, as i'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine. yes, i know i said i wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and i think i'm ready to--finally make a deal. really? well, that's wonderful. why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk? good-bye, mr. dinsmore."
861,Bree,"well, let's see i've beaten you to bridge, and mahjong and hearts. this is your last chance to redeem yourself."
2589,Bree,it'll just take a few seconds. these damn cords--
407,Bree,"needs. like, sexual needs?"
3900,Bree,tell your wife i will be doing that second book after all.
982,Bree,"i'm sorry. this is, uh, rex's mother, phyllis."
490,Bree,"another gift? i hope it's not another orchid, they're so expensive."
2622,Bree,oh! so you're responsible--
454,Bree,"thank you, george. that was a lovely evening."
2867,Bree,"walter. walter. walter, i'm begging you. please. i'm living like a vagabond in a teenage girl's bedroom. i'm sleeping under a poster of orlando bloom. you can't leave me."
1871,Bree,"oh, i just thought it would be a lovely place to take a nice, long rest."
2120,Bree,is my daughter all right?
2850,Bree,sylvia! open the damn door!
2178,Bree,should we go introduce ourselves?
3798,Bree,"yes, orson, we're all aware of how you got the job."
2211,Bree,"lakeview? oh, you gave me the impression that she was back east."
1585,Bree,"andrew,did i hear the bell?oh,hello."
855,Bree,"oh, honey."
338,Bree,"oh, baby. nobody likes to admit that they can't handle the pressure."
678,Bree,hi.
768,Bree,"andrew, i would love you even if you were a murderer."
3315,Bree,"orson, i have amazing news. the chamber of commerce just called."
892,Bree,well?
1947,Bree,"well, it's a very elegant club.you know orson's been a member here for years. it will be even nicer when they finish the construction."
4117,Bree,why would you say that to me?
311,Bree,"we still have so much to teach them. for starters, we need to get across to andrew the enormity of what he's done."
3062,Bree,hi!
1737,Bree,"yeah, apparently,he was seeing someone."
573,Bree,"i'm sorry, rex. i thought i could pretend that this doesn't upset me anymore, but i can't."
3590,Bree,"bob hunter, lee mcdermott, i would like you to meet andrew's new life partner, dr. alex cominis."
3509,Bree,you must be sandra. what a sharp outfit. and look at that hair--so thick and lustrous.
1212,Bree,can't you just be patient? can't you wait just a little bit longer?
3014,Bree,"no, thanks. we're almost done."
324,Bree,"actually, i was thinking we could arrange for you to talk to a professional."
384,Bree,"were you with a woman? did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pick-up style?"
797,Bree,"well, why don't we just go by ourselves then?"
1898,Bree,have they rung up your prescription yet?
1303,Bree,"that's what i thought, at first, but then having had time to think about it, i can't understand why she'd go to so much trouble. i mean, what would her motive be?"
564,Bree,"i realize that. this thing that he's hiding, is it bad?"
422,Bree,"i'm sorry to disappoint you, andrew, but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young!"
2176,Bree,edie said he's a bachelor--
120,Bree,"well, i want to talk to you."
687,Bree,we have to admit that we need help. if we can't get through to andrew then we have to find someone who can.
1015,Bree,this is rex's mother phyllis.
3034,Bree,"orson, every wife understands that her husband will make a few mistakes--a forgotten anniversary, the occasional harsh word, but we all have to draw the line somewhere, and i'm drawing mine at the attempted murder of my best friend's husband."
1911,Bree,"oh! does anybody ever call you ""alfie""?"
4055,Bree,send me the papers when they're ready.
626,Bree,oh.
2481,Bree,"no,not at all!i'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine."
2890,Bree,"fine, and if you can get him to come in on time and under budget, i'll throw in surround sound."
1439,Bree,"we have these,um,new neighbors--the applewhites.it's a mother and her son. they just moved here from chicago.and they seem very nice.but there's--there's something about them that's--off.they're--odd."
2272,Bree,"there were two women in your life before me. one vanished, and the other was killed. that's all i need to understand. i've packed some of your things. i want you out of the house. now."
2338,Bree,"everyone, this is alma hodge, orson's first wife."
2352,Bree,"alma! i-i didn't know that, uh, you knew edie."
2335,Bree,"oh, you didn't have to do that."
539,Bree,"george, would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?"
956,Bree,"well, don't you think it'd be nice if reverend devoted part of the eulogy to his life after he was married?"
1066,Bree,i said no.
3118,Bree,then let me send you a clear one. i am not attracted to you.
1469,Bree,"i'm sorry,but since when do you know so much about my personal life?"
2437,Bree,"i'd love that. what about your mother? after all the things she's done, she's just gonna get off scot-free?"
325,Bree,"of course not. it's just that the accident probably stirred up a lot of emotions, and it would be normal for you to be feeling confused or depressed or ashamed--"
643,Bree,no.
3729,Bree,"well, it is pretty amazing!"
2182,Bree,"oh, how did she fall?"
2200,Bree,you can peel a clove of garlic.
4025,Bree,go on.
2538,Bree,i just let myself into katherine's house to get that recipe.
2573,Bree,some wine?
1392,Bree,very--interesting.
2718,Bree,"i need your services as a doctor, but before i tell you what's going on, i need you to promise that what you're about to learnmwill be kept in strictest confidence."
300,Bree,"well, everybody should, uh, go wash up. we're having pancakes for breakfast."
2798,Bree,"hello, adam."
1223,Bree,"oh. george, this is just, uh, an empty house. why is this a surprise?"
1747,Bree,"well,i think peter is a better man than you do,and i am not gonna let you keep us apart."
3123,Bree,"oh, dear lord."
908,Bree,rex? what is it?
1210,Bree,that chair looks so uncomfortable. why didn't you sleep next to me?
927,Bree,"rex, you don't have to say anything."
2700,Bree,"i suggest you get an air rifle. it won't kill it, but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good."
3874,Bree,"i had hoped that this compulsion to steal was something we could solve privately, but orson seems unableor unwilling-- to control himself."
1912,Bree,"and why should they? so, um, alfred, i was wondering if you could maybe loosen my restraints. they're incredibly tight, and i'm sure there are no rules against making me more comfortable."
1274,Bree,"well, i know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels."
3348,Bree,"yes. there's a luncheon on the 12th. i do hope you can make it. oh. by the way, you're right about those colors. very--jazzy."
621,Bree,"well, if that's the type of boy he is, then good riddance."
2934,Bree,"oh! good morning, reverend. i brought your favorite-- blueberry scones."
3848,Bree,who are we dishing? i do hope it's not me.
2425,Bree,susan.
2498,Bree,"you think danielle could raise this child?orson,you've seen her in action.she's--she's shallow,and she's--she's selfish!she would ruin this child's life!"
2031,Bree,a reporter just did a story on homeless teens and my son was one of them.
4110,Bree,"well, it's obvious you've never had to remove a cheese stain. hmph!"
1202,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna get another rash just by holding your hand."
1206,Bree,i know.
1186,Bree,i will let you make all the arrangements. something out of town would be nice. good night.
1936,Bree,orson.
1619,Bree,"you didn't know them during the good times.i mean,there was such a spark between them,so much passion."
3769,Bree,"lynette, i-i-i don't understand why you're so upset."
767,Bree,i can be just as cool as you can.
3274,Bree,"well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?"
2098,Bree,i am so tired of feeling like the worst mother who ever lived.
3413,Bree,maryland?
2857,Bree,oh. sorry.
354,Bree,"i understand that good help is hard to find, but stealing a family's nanny is so--unseemly."
1284,Bree,"so, i don't want every woman in this town talking about me behind my back."
3389,Bree,"i can't help myself, all right? my husband's gone. my son's gone. i have nothing left."
1697,Bree,andrew falsely accused me of molestation--in a mall!
2052,Bree,how did you find out that?
3155,Bree,"and you were right. i did. you just think i'm being stubborn, don't you? making you jump through hoops when it's so clear we belong together."
2394,Bree,"oh, i knew it. these are sleeping pills, and these are--oh, my god. you raped my husband!"
960,Bree,"phyllis, is there something you'd like to say?"
2284,Bree,"oh, no, no, these things practically build themselves."
987,Bree,then why didn't you put me on?
3838,Bree,give it.
1256,Bree,do you really want to know my secret?
2228,Bree,you'd never ask a magician how a trick is done.
283,Bree,"a car? a modeling academy? you should have discussed these gifts with me first. i'm sorry kids, but we cannot accept them."
4002,Bree,"well, what kind of a favor?"
2907,Bree,"susan! look, i don't mean to pry, but given what i know about you and adam, i'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving."
3362,Bree,"lynette, i am really not able to deal with that right now."
2567,Bree,she's not here?
1404,Bree,"you know, the affair."
3084,Bree,thank you.
1705,Bree,"eleanor,please--"
1279,Bree,"okay, well, uh, i will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time later in the week."
116,Bree,he got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in philadelphia. take your seats.
3968,Bree,death?
2516,Bree,"well, clearly no tips are needed. as my friends said, ""best pie ever made."""
565,Bree,"oh, okay, um, maybe it's better that i don't know."
558,Bree,"yes. you know that's one of the things i hated most about our separation. not being able to throw dinner parties. there's just something so civilized and elegant about them, don't you think?"
2568,Bree,it is?
350,Bree,"oh, good nannies are so hard to find."
822,Bree,what is going on here?
2815,Bree,and some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
2199,Bree,"i had to tell her. she hurt me, so i hurt her back. if anything should happen to julie or lynette--"
2380,Bree,orson! not on the duvet!
511,Bree,"i'm still married to rex. i mean, we're not even legally separated yet."
1370,Bree,"well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all. anyway, uh, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so i wanted you to hear it from me first."
2414,Bree,"oh, thank god."
3815,Bree,isn't it noon?
894,Bree,wait a minute. what in the world are you talking about?
1358,Bree,''thank you very much.''
2558,Bree,ah-choo!
3204,Bree,"please, danielle, we can have any arrangement you like. please, just don't take him! for god sakes, orson's gone. you kids are grown. benjamin's all i have!"
3241,Bree,what are you doing here? you were disinvited.
3041,Bree,"yes, i can smell the thinking on your breath. are you insane, driving in this condition?"
1081,Bree,andrew!
777,Bree,"reverend, i don't mean to criticise. but it sounds like you're giving up."
3133,Bree,"it's tomorrow! a hundred gay men are descending on this street, and they're expecting a fabulous party."
112,Bree,"well, it's now or never. i saw what he's asking for the place it's going to sell really quickly."
2091,Bree,so you could do something.
729,Bree,bring them in.
1193,Bree,george--
701,Bree,"what i want, what i have always wanted is for you to be happy. and you're not. and i have no idea how to help you."
2406,Bree,"orson, i know you're embarrassed, but what they did to you was a crime."
1470,Bree,except for you.you're really good at it.
1956,Bree,"wow, we certainly devoured that ice cream.can i get you anything else?"
1551,Bree,"honey,you can't.they're at work."
4084,Bree,you would actually send your wife to prison?
3672,Bree,bring it.
3541,Bree,"oh, orson, i can't help but take issue with your sarcastic tone."
3640,Bree,"actually, you're right on time. we're just about to eat. shall we?"
665,Bree,"oh. we're gonna act like nothing is happening, and then, when we finish eating, we're going to walk out of here with all the dignity that we can muster."
2788,Bree,"um, tom, may i ask you something? did you and lynette do the family bed when your children were babies?"
636,Bree,"better still, be brutal."
1549,Bree,there. is that better?
3143,Bree,"all right, so i will call the ice sculptor and see if we can--"
1296,Bree,"well, i don't know what to say."
1944,Bree,yes.
1220,Bree,exactly. you're a mother trying to protect her child. it's a natural impulse.
2480,Bree,perhaps i need to make my point a little more clearly.
3824,Bree,bruce. hello. come on in. thank you so much for joining us tonight. may i take your coat?
2966,Bree,that would be lovely.
4001,Bree,lovely. i'll make out a check.
4097,Bree,"i don't know. but i swear to you, we may have our differences, but i would never hire someone to attack you. you have to believe me."
2068,Bree,i cannot thank you enough for getting danielle interested in history. she has never worked so hard on a project before.
2205,Bree,"andrew, it's etiquette. nobody wants to read the truth at christmas."
2834,Bree,it was just an observation.
533,Bree,because you were unfaithful.
766,Bree,i may be freaked out. but that doesn't change how i feel about him.
2187,Bree,"sorry, no. turns out he has an explanation for the police report."
1624,Bree,what do you think you're doing?you're supposed to be grounded.
1211,Bree,"george. i know what you want from me, and i, i thought i wanted the same thing, but i keep getting those rashes because i still feel married."
764,Bree,"our son has just told us that he might be gay. there are two hundred other boys in this kamp. now i could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but i'm a lady and i don't use that kind of language."
1991,Bree,the buffet is open.
341,Bree,it's just not right.
3264,Bree,"yes, i'm aware of that. i picked it. i'm just concerned people might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect."
1670,Bree,hmm. some muffins?
2298,Bree,"well, needless to say, i won't be cooking dinner for ian's parents."
69,Bree,it's just-i miss you.
453,Bree,ah. shall we?
969,Bree,i do want you to come to the funeral.
3651,Bree,you know it.
118,Bree,open the door please.
725,Bree,i don't feel guilty.
3591,Bree,he's a plastic surgeon.
3597,Bree,"well, if you'll excuse me, i am going to go get a pie that you are going to love. and you two are going to help me."
2635,Bree,"yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine."
2911,Bree,damn right.
3256,Bree,"please, just don't take him! benjamin's all i have!"
246,Bree,"thanks. i was hoping you'd notice."" ""well, it certainly isn't the ritz, but it has all the essentials."
1650,Bree,oh.
3981,Bree,orson's lying to me again.
947,Bree,"well, um, he's being buried in a blue suit."
2921,Bree,there. you have your answer. now sit.
2372,Bree,you're my husband's ex-wife. you disappeared so people would think he killed you.does my discomfort really need any further explanation?
1725,Bree,"oh,they,uh,they already left."
3467,Bree,orson! you can't be serious! here?
2902,Bree,"oh, sweetie, you're okay."
1553,Bree,"all right,boys,let's have it."
394,Bree,"uh, the situation is, um, fluid. i'm not certain what his plans are yet."
356,Bree,why are you smiling?
830,Bree,"well, i decide who i need in my life, and i've decided that i need you. and that's all there is to it."
2770,Bree,"no, he'll be sleeping with us."
1722,Bree,"oh,shoot! i wish you hadn't gone through that.now we have to have an unpleasant conversation,and we were having such a nice time."
3891,Bree,andrew.
4,Bree,"of course, i will need the baskets back once you're done."
3779,Bree,he's exaggerating. they're children. it just looks like a lot of money to them.
3645,Bree,yes. a good opportunity for andrew to commute five hours to his job.
3644,Bree,"uh, thinking about it. they're thinking about moving to oakdale."
2055,Bree,"andrew. andrew! andrew, please! andrew!"
3778,Bree,"oh, look! there's pretzels and cereal. i can see why they call it ""party mix."" it's like a party in a bowl."
4077,Bree,my salad has plenty of bite. so--when are you moving out?
1391,Bree,i did.betty never rsvp'd.
575,Bree,"why not? rex, please tell me. let me prove to you how much i love you."
3607,Bree,why would he--
2099,Bree,i just--i've tried so hard to set a good example. i've done the best i could to teach you kids right from wrong. why isn't it taking?
3629,Bree,"well, at least gloria had the good taste to have a paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her."
1064,Bree,"um, um, during the test, they asked me some questions about you and, um, us and whether we had a relationship and i said yes, because it's true. and then they asked me something else, something i hadn't considered."
2061,Bree,"yes, they are, aren't they?"
2773,Bree,"this isn't just for me and benjamin. this will help you bond with him, too."
2708,Bree,"do not test me, young lady, or i will drag you out of here myself."
1280,Bree,"oh, honey, there's no reason why you and carlos can't try again."
2575,Bree,"oh, susan, i am so sorry, and, of course, i will pay for the slashed tire and the stolen cell phone."
3261,Bree,"lovely to meet you, leo."
3132,Bree,hey. what's going on?
1728,Bree,"well,now that you can't afford to become emancipated,i guess you're gonna have to stay here with me."
278,Bree,"um, all this, um, wine is, uh, giving me a headache."
61,Bree,how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?
3382,Bree,"uh, would anybody like some more frittata?"
2004,Bree,"clearly, i do."
2477,Bree,"the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.i mean,i'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if i really was 8-12 months pregnant."
7,Bree,"so susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?"
2419,Bree,"oh, that's right. is orson here?"
3782,Bree,i like the way you think. what would we do without him?
3722,Bree,"my book just made the ""times'"" best seller list. now they're talking 3-book deal, so i got the urge to splurge. and look what just blew on my windshield at the stop sign! life is good."
1200,Bree,i was saying i think we should go horseback riding.
1598,Bree,"perception is reality,andrew.and if people perceive me to have a drinking problem,then i do.and i certainly don't want some idiotic judge using my hobby as an excuse to make you rich.so i'm simply going to give up my wine and become a recovering alcoholic."
2851,Bree,we're giving you shelter. you could at least be gracious.
1502,Bree,hi. come on in.
904,Bree,it doesn't matter.
2545,Bree,"well, none that i recall."
2685,Bree,how many times have i told you to stay away from the windows?
2096,Bree,"danielle! danielle, he is your history teacher, and he is 35 years old!"
1204,Bree,"oh, well, i'm drinking wine. i don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol."
1224,Bree,"oh, my god! congratulations. oh george, i didn't even know you were looking."
863,Bree,"miss it, miss it, miss it."
3322,Bree,so you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
1823,Bree,oh.okay.
4086,Bree,"orson, please don't do this. i don't love you."
2515,Bree,"well, did we or did we not agree that i would bring the dessert?"
3079,Bree,what does that mean?
425,Bree,"fine. i will see him through this, but after that, your father can rot in hell for all i care!"
517,Bree,"oh, george."
1361,Bree,''more?''
3525,Bree,"hello, dr. cominis. how's my husband doing?"
591,Bree,what's the matter with boise?
1170,Bree,"oh, ah, ah, it's starting to spread to my face."
2614,Bree,excuse me?
1514,Bree,who told you that?
3663,Bree,"what exactly are you saying, alex?"
3770,Bree,my car!
2682,Bree,"oh, well, thank you. orson and i would be delighted."
3289,Bree,no! of course not.
180,Bree,"zach,she would be very proud of you. what happened to your varnish?"
2203,Bree,this is so sudden.
225,Bree,connected?
681,Bree,take your time.
2292,Bree,"oh, me, too. there's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk."
1589,Bree,"for the record,i did not punch my son.i slapped him with an open palm."
3170,Bree,"well, that's no surprise. my pies are always perfect."
3383,Bree,"andrew, please."
3197,Bree,i can see that.
708,Bree,it just isn't you. and we feel that you need to spend some quality time thinking about the goals in your life and what kind of person you want to be.
3686,Bree,"this won't take long. i don't want to fight anymore. please, just take the house."
136,Bree,he hung up on me.
179,Bree,"wow,this place is just immaculate."
942,Bree,"no. no, i can't afford to fall apart right now."
4072,Bree,"well, that part's non-negotiable."
1328,Bree,"ah, i'm not sure."
2006,Bree,he did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
3977,Bree,"hmm. and that's all you were doing, just going out for a walk?"
2281,Bree,"well, i will take that under advisement."
1067,Bree,"but according to the polygraph, that wasn't exactly true."
4041,Bree,"well, i wonder if the victims of your kleptomania felt the same way."
1771,Bree,i don't care.
3044,Bree,"no, it's a pathetic fantasy fueled by cowardice and amaretto sours. you committed a crime, orson. face it."
2117,Bree,"i'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub. i waved to her, and she looked right through me. true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift--"
2144,Bree,danielle is applying to colleges. i do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.
2979,Bree,"katherine, a waldorf salad is made with apples. it's tradition."
107,Bree,"if you would just tell me what he told you, then i could fix the problem."
2046,Bree,"oh, thank you, miss--"
3529,Bree,"occasionally, but never quite this--"
1522,Bree,"so take good care of your looks, danielle.you don't have any other weapons at your disposal."
169,Bree,"oh,rex! that's not the point."
1948,Bree,"well, um, i wanted to invite you to a dinner that orson and i are having this saturday."
3905,Bree,"well, i'm all for saying a few nice things--but you were never really friends. you and edie clashed right from the start."
2231,Bree,"paprika! there, it's out!"
1241,Bree,hi.
3195,Bree,"katherine, i'm sure your wrist is just fine."
157,Bree,are you okay?
3986,Bree,i-i may have overstated things when i described my husband as a decent man. he actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.
3742,Bree,"oh, that sounds nice. can we walk and talk?"
821,Bree,"well, you have to bring ginger, because if rex sees the two of you together, then he'll relax."
3992,Bree,"oh, right. karl's a divorce lawyer."
1457,Bree,"i am not sure,but i think there was a compliment in there somewhere,so thank you.but i am not an escort."
3954,Bree,how can you just decide something like that?
3198,Bree,sorry. oops!
3263,Bree,"""danielle""? did he just call you ""danielle""?"
2577,Bree,it's private.
3533,Bree,"yes, it is. sit down. we need to talk."
392,Bree,trust is overrated.
1346,Bree,yes.
2658,Bree,"you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!"
401,Bree,"um, excuse me, i'm here to see rex van de kamp. apparently, he had a heart attack. i'm not sure when -"
3012,Bree,"oh, sure, you can. whenever i feel my emotions getting the best of me, i simply picture an empty box, and i take whatever i'm feeling and put that in the box, and then i picture myself putting the box away in a big, empty closet and closing the door. then if i have time, i go back and open the box and deal with the emotion--in private, like a lady."
3960,Bree,"well, i can understand why you're a bit cynical, but i'm giving him another chance. he's my husband, and i still love him."
1464,Bree,"actually,my car has been impounded by the police."
29,Bree,these need water.
1764,Bree,you can't possibly be turned on by what's going on out there.
3237,Bree,"orson, please don't be hurt. i am under so much pressure and so terrified i'll fail that i don't even know what i'm saying half the time. just let me get through this. as soon as the plates go out tonight, i will come home and cook you that pot roast i promised. okay?"
2859,Bree,thank god.
706,Bree,come along.
3725,Bree,"was it just me, or was that a little abrupt?"
1374,Bree,yeah. they found data in george's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
124,Bree,"well, it's just temporary and-i thought it would upset you, so i was protecting you."
3347,Bree,"oh. well, i'm familiar with that award. in fact, i'm this year's recipient."
1844,Bree,"um,you can just--leave that there,and i'll, um--clean it up later."
4128,Bree,that's very sweet.
331,Bree,"what i'm worried about, andrew, is that you don't seem to have a soul. give me one good reason why i shouldn't call the police!"
1139,Bree,"oh, please don't talk to me about tests. rex was not poisoned and no one i know believes that he was."
581,Bree,it's a perversion.
979,Bree,thank you.
1018,Bree,i was simply asking when you were planning to leave. there was no agenda behind the question.
524,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken.
2993,Bree,"oh, no one would expect you to do that in your condition. you know what? um, i could do it."
3298,Bree,it's how i'm known.
923,Bree,how did you know that?
2128,Bree,i have never in my life used the word retard.
4005,Bree,"i need your help, karl. i really do, but i am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old."
1234,Bree,"well, obviously there's a downside to having good manners."
3677,Bree,"you know what else would be nice, alex? showing gratitude when people have been generous with you."
3577,Bree,i'm just trying to understand how my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.
3557,Bree,that's all right. i'll just drink this tea.
3434,Bree,"well, where did you meet?"
1703,Bree,"oh,but not you.with you,i had to work for every kind word i ever got."
1851,Bree,"because when i sleep,i dream,and when i dream,i keep seeing andrew's face in that rearview mirror."
2832,Bree,"well, you're only human."
1735,Bree,oh.
951,Bree,"anyway, i'm afraid that my visit has an ulterior motive. the organist at our church is on vacation, and edie britt mentioned that you used to be a concert pianist, and -"
147,Bree,so what's your strategy? are you just never going to speak to me again?
1599,Bree,"oh,andrew,you don't think i love you enough to give up alcohol?"
3823,Bree,i hope you enjoyed that.
1412,Bree,andrew--i want you downstair-- now.
3675,Bree,"well, it's just that grilling is such a manly pastime. if i suggested that orson somehow failed to produce the perfect steak, you might see it as another example emasculation."
2591,Bree,"oh, my god."
3506,Bree,check and check.
3881,Bree,would you excuse us for moment? this just became a private conversation.
3260,Bree,i've already started. danielle! what a delightfully ethnic ensemble.
3253,Bree,"i am so sorry. i-i lost all track of time, and linda had so many questions about the food. i'll make you that pot roast tomorrow, okay?"
810,Bree,"really? well, okay. you know what i'm going to miss most about him? george always has a way of making me feel good about myself."
2093,Bree,"yes, absolutely."
695,Bree,"well, think about how good men are at lying on the spot. i mean, god forbid, you should give them time and a pen!"
1576,Bree,hmm?
1645,Bree,"well,it's just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done for me over the past few weeks.what's-- wrong?"
63,Bree,"rex, wasn't that a lovely?"
1700,Bree,absolutely not.
2598,Bree,"this is what we get for having kids at our age--anxiety, terror."
1731,Bree,you making fun of me?huh?
3245,Bree,you're still here? dinner is about to be served. whose seats are you in?
43,Bree,"good, i'm gonna go make myself some, uh, warm milk. would you like something to drink?"
4092,Bree,"isn't it? i'm being blackmailed by a man i'm starting to despise, and if i don't pretend to love him, he can have me arrested."
50,Bree,of course not.
2563,Bree,"danielle, what if your reckless behavior had hurt the baby?"
1915,Bree,"anything at all.as you said, i--i have a lot of issues."
698,Bree,"now, not five hours from now."
2016,Bree,okay.
1511,Bree,oh! what is it?
3369,Bree,"for god sakes, lynette, stop calling me a success. there's nothing successful about me. my friends think i'm gonna drop them, my partner resents me, and my husband--has moved into the guest bedroom. everything i gain comes at some horrible price, and i'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it."
378,Bree,"hello? yes, this is she-- marijuana in his locker? oh, i'm just--horrified. there must be some sort of terrible mistake. um, yeah, okay. well, i will be right down."
778,Bree,"then what are we supposed to do? just stand by while he starts dating boys? and by the way, the correct word is not gay, it's sodomy."
1459,Bree,"well,how am i supposed to get home? i don't have any money."
1313,Bree,what?
3940,Bree,"if you'd like, we could give you a moment."
944,Bree,"yes, that is rex's mother."
3850,Bree,"yes, i, uh-- remember that."
3275,Bree,"i am sorry, but am i supposed to sit by while she degrades his body and his mind?"
312,Bree,"all right, then what's the appropriate punishment for a child who drives over a woman?"
3542,Bree,"oh, god, susan. can't this wait till after my nap?"
2169,Bree,i'm so happy we did this.
2793,Bree,"oh, he just adores it. the three of us are such a happy little family. aren't we?"
2047,Bree,how very saucy.
486,Bree,"damn, i have to take rex to his angiogram."
597,Bree,"well, then, whose is it? it didn't just magically appear in my laundry basket."
661,Bree,oh?
2975,Bree,it's interesting. i can't really picture that though.
1610,Bree,"gosh, um--i'm not exactly sure."
699,Bree,no!
1304,Bree,no.
40,Bree,"we sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine. and when we finished it, you turned to me and you said, if you marry me, bree mason, i promise to love you for the rest of my life. and even though i was engaged to ty grant, and even though my father didn't like you, i said yes."
414,Bree,i have. i was so afraid you were gonna die. there were so many things i haven't had a chance to tell you.
1765,Bree,yes.why would you wanna come to a place like this?
1000,Bree,"no, no, not at all."
1140,Bree,what?
2405,Bree,"okay, this is no joke. she raped you, and your mother helped. look, after we get dressed, we're going to the police."
3240,Bree,gaby?
3664,Bree,"well, we've got 15 minutes till the news is on. why not? i still can't get over the way alex behaved this morning. ""emasculating."" i' never heard such nonsense. don't you think so?"
1075,Bree,of course. you remember mr. williams.
3433,Bree,is he gay? ugh! i knew he had too much product in his hair.
2077,Bree,"how does this dr. keck fit into all of this? i mean, is he treating andrew for some awful disease?"
4060,Bree,"no, he thinks i filed it."
1774,Bree,"yes.betty,i am serious.either you do something,or i will."
1659,Bree,do you have any idea what you might say?
2560,Bree,what is it?
3039,Bree,very well. so do you want the cat or not?
4123,Bree,"george, i can't feel my legs."
413,Bree,it went well. the surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
100,Bree,"i'm packing your swimsuit. there's a pool there, and i know how swimming relaxes you."
1059,Bree,"so because of the anomalies in rex's blood, the police started to wonder if i'd been poisoning rex."
583,Bree,try what? hurting you? you actually want me to hurt you?
3709,Bree,why wouldn't i be? people are always complimenting me on my cooking.
2744,Bree,please feel free to show her this letter and assure her of its wide distribution to hospitals and physicians across this and two neighboring states.
3564,Bree,"well, my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested."
3427,Bree,"oh, that's nice. hey, was there a blue convertible parked in front of katherine's?"
2041,Bree,i left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes.i didn't tell you because i was afraid of what you would think of me.
2243,Bree,because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink. a warning you've chosen to ignore if the--lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
997,Bree,"that darn insurance company is dragging its heels on paying rex's policy, and i don't understand why."
388,Bree,"why, are you feeling ashamed?"
2604,Bree,yes?
2818,Bree,i can't believe this.
1030,Bree,you talked to phyllis.
405,Bree,he said that?
1843,Bree,what the hell is wrong with you?!now it's ruined!everything is ruined!
516,Bree,"well, i mean, wouldn't you keep hoping that in time i would feel the same way about you as you feel about me?"
207,Bree,"oh,sweetie, i was just coming over to talk to you. i'm so sorry, but something really important came up and i have to cancel."
1646,Bree,and that's a--a real thing?
3206,Bree,"yes, it is."
1114,Bree,"thank you, george."
3514,Bree,"andrew, please. the machine can get it. we never answer the phone while entertaining. so rude to one's guests."
3655,Bree,"of course this will require an updated irrigation system, which i'm happy to take care of."
807,Bree,they did?
3973,Bree,wonderful.
1997,Bree,and what mistake would that be?
1242,Bree,hello.
1729,Bree,"oh,i,um,had a chance to have a nice chat with justin the other day.he really seems very sweet.i've invited him over for dinner tonight. i hope you don't mind."
3999,Bree,"karl, if we move forward, i will insist you handle our divorce with dignity."
765,Bree,"exactly. so we'll get him home, we'll get him into christian counselling so it won't become a lifestyle."
3674,Bree,no. i wouldn't want to upset anyone.
3337,Bree,"he gets it, dear. honey, you're my partner in life. but if we want to keep it that way, we shouldn't mix marriage and business."
1044,Bree,thank you.
3628,Bree,"for melina? she'd probably blow her nose on it. no, i will not let that woman defile nana's lace."
4119,Bree,"well, who says he has to know how i spend my free time?"
456,Bree,"me, too."
3626,Bree,"look, i know it's very difficult for two families to negotiate the holidays, but i feel strongly that this is not the best way to handle it, and i'm sure that the boys would agree with me."
3899,Bree,"actually, no. i'm not selling."
2296,Bree,"we all have convictions, susan. i believe mike's last one was for manslaughter."
3276,Bree,"oh, just some old pictures. can you guess who that little girl is?"
2095,Bree,what is?
1302,Bree,"well, she did, and she said some pretty horrible things about you."
1554,Bree,boys?boys?
2960,Bree,"how's catholicism going, by the way?"
1837,Bree,was it you? or you?!who was it?
2880,Bree,walter recently split up with his life partner todd. they were gay.
3632,Bree,ah! here you are.
2710,Bree,"oh, dear heavenly lord."
2846,Bree,so this is why you moved back to fairview?
1827,Bree,she said she doesn't want balloons.i'm fine.
1750,Bree,"it's just awful, isn't it?i mean, you never know what people are doing behind your back.would you like some milk with your cookies?"
1688,Bree,she's so adorable and i just love the name lily
3405,Bree,you work here?
1492,Bree,it's the applewhites. i don't want you to go near them.
763,Bree,"we made our decision, let's just stick to it."
3321,Bree,i don't understand. you said the job was going so well.
1691,Bree,"um,i'm sorry,dad,but i think my relationship with andrew is just a bit more complicated than--"
3802,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less."
2440,Bree,"and miss gaby's wedding? no, i'll be fine."
1600,Bree,"because i'm not done with you yet.it's my job to teach you,and you are not half the mani know you can be."
3810,Bree,tom has a lot on his mind. i'm sure he didn't mean it.
3643,Bree,guess who just called the burnt lamb chop?
3592,Bree,i hear the gym is a popular meeting place.
909,Bree,"no, you're not."
2197,Bree,"i'm fine. i just, i'm running out of food, and it's not as if i can go to the grocery store."
3705,Bree,"and i think you would appreciate my value more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and wash your own clothes."
1622,Bree,"andrew,there may be a judge out there stupid enough to emancipate you,but until you find him,i retain all my parental rights,one of which is to ground your sorry behind until kingdom come.mr bormanis,nice to see you again.and,um,please don't get crumbs on my carpet."
1192,Bree,"i know, and you have every right to be mad, but, george, i am really starting to itch."
3468,Bree,"ooh! oh, this counter's hard on my head."
1568,Bree,"now that you're speaking to me in a fairly accusatory tone,may i remind you that i was doing you a favor?"
3667,Bree,i don't think i do that.
2929,Bree,"well, it's just that in our church, people don't talk back to the minister."
741,Bree,"well, porter was misbehaving so i had to punish him."
1175,Bree,"actually, i have not considered that because that's idiotic!"
2266,Bree,andrew brought her wine.
3605,Bree,a video store i will never return to. are you aware that one of the stars of this film is--
900,Bree,i was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.
2757,Bree,"yes, bree hodge--born rabinowitz."
462,Bree,"andrew, your father and i are separated and you know it."
2397,Bree,"andrew, i need you to come over here right away--and, um--bring the wheelbarrow."
1487,Bree,"hi, betty."
2918,Bree,what are you doing?
549,Bree,"oh, he's chaperoning. he called a couple of hours ago and volunteered."
1453,Bree,"a sobriety test? i'm not taking any sobriety--test.this behavior stems from the hurt feelings of a man with very low self-esteem.the world is a big place,and i'm sure there is a woman out there somewhere who'll respond to your macho posturing."
3335,Bree,"not a good time, orson."
2449,Bree,this might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
1713,Bree,"oh,honey,it's all right.i mean,with the new baby at home, i'm surprisedyou made it at all."
313,Bree,"""you know, no matter how the kids turn out, i still love them.''"
2674,Bree,tell your stepfather i'll be right out.
2365,Bree,everybody has questions. susan and i aren't even speaking because of it.
3025,Bree,who could that be at this hour? susan. what on earth?
2875,Bree,"dinner will be ready shortly. oh, and, julie, i fixed the hem on that blue skirt of yours. it's on your bed."
1393,Bree,"not exactly, anyway."
924,Bree,and do you know why i save it for last?
2990,Bree,you really should have more faith in people. excuse me.
1168,Bree,i don't know. i'm just really starting to itch.
508,Bree,#name?
702,Bree,i will not. we're gonna talk about this now.
977,Bree,""" hyllis, we've only been waiting here for two minutes."" \"
4034,Bree,"i do the bare minimum. no more, no less."
1340,Bree,"good, good. seeing friends. i just started co-chairing a charity event for the junior league and um, and i broke up with george."
2058,Bree,"no, i don't think he will. i failed him."
3647,Bree,i bought you the adams house!
2268,Bree,what?
237,Bree,"well, what a coincidence. so am i. it seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves. shall i, pull up a chair?"
1154,Bree,"yes, because he left a note. and it said, and i quote, ""bree, i understand and i forgive you."" i spent eighteen years of my life with this man. how could he not know me?"
2508,Bree,"yeah, let's do it. um, gaby, why don't you bring your vegetable lasagna? susan, you do beverages, and, uh, katherine, why don't you bring a simple green salad?"
1710,Bree,yes.i'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
1855,Bree,i think i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
1316,Bree,"ty! ty grant. oh, hi! what are you doing in town?"
1858,Bree,"well, it seems that my son stole it from your yard."
624,Bree,yes. well -
3924,Bree,"what are you up to, edie?"
2698,Bree,really? i thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.
133,Bree,where's your cell phone?
1468,Bree,"you know,you sound like you don't believe me."
1883,Bree,"you know, i really don't have time for this nonsense.are you going to give me some serious drugs or not?"
3800,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less. i'm sorry, honey. i'm just being honest."
1219,Bree,"well, i think mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses."
1096,Bree,andrew is being polite and engaging. he's even laughing at george's jokes.
826,Bree,"rex, have you lost your mind?"
373,Bree,why did carlos have to back out?
359,Bree,really?
371,Bree,rex!
3446,Bree,"a cosmopolitan. that's your favorite, isn't it?"
3120,Bree,aah!
2159,Bree,no! i have no idea. what?
3356,Bree,where are you? it's after 2:00.
2847,Bree,"well, katherine, for what it's worth--i would've spit in her face, too."
2264,Bree,andrew!
3904,Bree,so you've said.
2982,Bree,"oh, dear. well, i should throw this dip out."
1333,Bree,"why don't you all take your seats? uh, dessert is about to be served."
2318,Bree,so you deliberately framed orson?
3011,Bree,no. never.
1319,Bree,let me take your coat.
735,Bree,"don't be common, young man. now come on, if you play around with those cookies one more time i'll have to spank you."
3176,Bree,"okay, katherine. i know this book has been monopolizing my time, and you feel overworked and undervalued. but i do appreciate you. in fact, i have a gift for you. it's the galleys of my new book. read page 2."
3847,Bree,"i don't need to walk in your shoes, orson. what you did was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again. understood?"
3167,Bree,"leave the galleys in my office and tell the woman from ""the times"" to call me back in the morning. i'm gonna have a nice bubble bath with my husband. coming, orson!"
2536,Bree,"well, you've certainly mastered that, dear."
4081,Bree,jail?
1301,Bree,"i'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but i just had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours. a leila mitzman."
3402,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
4000,Bree,i just want to protect what is rightfully mine. can you help me?
2840,Bree,"she's over there, first door on the left, and please hurry."
3015,Bree,"oh, how sweet."
114,Bree,"that being said, i do love what he've done with that lawn."
881,Bree,"no, and i know guns and that wound was not self-inflicted."
3199,Bree,"and now to finish, you simply transfer your spun sugar to the croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl. did i mention that you--probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar? um--well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil. i mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white--ribbon. turn off the damn camera."
1813,Bree,"oh, my god, danielle.i am so sorry."
834,Bree,rex just hates these cooks tours. he likes to stay at home with the same old spaghetti and mug of root beer.
2183,Bree,why would she attack you?
3415,Bree,"katherine, you are a vibrant, attractive woman. you--"
2173,Bree,is this why you apologized?
2552,Bree,but you don't mind orson being your dentist.
1540,Bree,tony?do you have to rush off?i thought maybe we could just chat for a minute.
815,Bree,it doesn't matter.
3888,Bree,"thank you, dear."
3154,Bree,"was i lucky, or were you following me?"
1510,Bree,"well, i'm not sure,but i think maxine had a slave."
3965,Bree,katherine. hi. what are you doing here?
3036,Bree,turn yourself in to the police.
990,Bree,"so am i, but no one would ever know it with your incessant caterwauling."
2861,Bree,"you know, maybe a moment of silence wouldn't be such a bad idea."
1690,Bree,that's your solution?
3903,Bree,"know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, i really do want to find some way for you to be happy."
790,Bree,because if you don't change who you are then you won't go to heaven.
87,Bree,"fine. oh, and doctor. if what he's about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution or internet pornography, i would really appreciate you taking a moral hardline."
3918,Bree,every week? what's her name?
1146,Bree,thank you.
212,Bree,this is not up for discussion.
3759,Bree,excuse me.
915,Bree,hi. what are you doing here?
753,Bree,"yes, is it our turn?"
221,Bree,have fun.
2904,Bree,i'll be right back.
3255,Bree,"orson, i've been cooking all day. i-- i'm so tired, i can barely stand up. you really want me to make you a pot roast now?"
757,Bree,yeah.
2927,Bree,"well, last sunday, when you kept raising your hand--we don't really do that. the church isn't a place for questions. it's a place for answers."
1365,Bree,''what is that?''
1203,Bree,"oh. well, okay."
2037,Bree,"some reporter.all she could tell me is what neighborhood they found him in.they don't have any contact information, no phone number, no address."
3831,Bree,maybe we should slice the tart in here. i don't want to bring a large knife in this.
2736,Bree,that's why the procedure should be done on babies. they won't remember. now can we please just drop this?
2877,Bree,"oh, sure. just, uh, leave your trays in the hall when you're ready."
594,Bree,i do. would you mind if i ran these through the dishwasher once?
2229,Bree,"orson, why does she have to have an ulterior motive?"
1968,Bree,oh!um.i don't do that.
344,Bree,"well, maybe if we take it away from him, then he'll start to understand what he did! he has not shown an ounce of remorse since the accident."
2472,Bree,that is so kind of you.
1084,Bree,"all right then. george, we'll see you friday for dinner. i'll be serving fish."
2556,Bree,"no. you know, i usually just call him ""doctor""."
3173,Bree,"katherine, hi. what are you doing here?"
3077,Bree,how did you--
751,Bree,brown or green?
2262,Bree,"gloria, i've been thinking and--"
3374,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
393,Bree,fine. why do you ask?
1532,Bree,"oh, my god!sweetheart,i don't understand.why in the world would your mother treat you that way?"
1143,Bree,how can he have believed this?
1147,Bree,i'm sorry. i was just attending to some last minute details. right this way.
2311,Bree,i am no longer interested in your opinion. i thought i made that clear.
838,Bree,"i can't go on a trip with you, george."
528,Bree,you only demanded the good china because you know i love it.
3613,Bree,just take it back.
634,Bree,"uh, actually, i would prefer if you didn't."
3713,Bree,you were there?
3898,Bree,"orson, think about how i built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment. is that really something you want me to give up?"
696,Bree,"so, susan, what are you gonna do with the letter?"
2103,Bree,does she know you killed your wife?
1609,Bree,you're awful.
3455,Bree,sit.
227,Bree,she!
2233,Bree,"well, then talk to me. i know you're upset, but don't shut me out. please. please, gloria, let me in."
694,Bree,"well, you should assume that it is."
3807,Bree,"well, take it back now. they're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get."
2389,Bree,hi. sorry. my book club ran late. didn't orson make you dinner?
2461,Bree,"look, i am gonna say this one last time. you are gonna stay put until that baby is born. now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and i am bringing your favorite--lemon squares, and--"
1471,Bree,"well,you moved into your house in the middle of the night.god knows what you moved in that you didn't want anybody to see.people hear sounds coming at all hours from there.and,oh,what was the last one?oh,right--they found a dead body in front of your home.everybody talks about the applewhites,but nobody can figure out exactly what you people are hiding.so congratulations.your secrets are safe--for now."
37,Bree,"it's the age-old question, isn't it? how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?"
3767,Bree,"well, i'm not the one who needed $20,000 to keep my business afloat."
1065,Bree,they asked me if i loved you.
3146,Bree,"yes? oh, there you are! where is my ice sculpture? no! no,6:00 is too late. i need it now. oh, forget it. i'll pick it up myself."
3159,Bree,i did not tell you to put mums in that arrangement! and don't point your finger at me or i'll snap it right off.
2458,Bree,"hello? hodge residence. oh, hi, danielle. listen, i am sending julie mayer an e-mail from you. now would you say that your school was off the hook?"
389,Bree,"lynette, for the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids."
2518,Bree,i'm not. that despicable woman was just supposed to bring a simple green salad. she not only brought a pie--she hid mine and served hers.
1850,Bree,"because, um, i can't sleep just yet."
293,Bree,"oh my god, thank god you're here. will you go take care of gabrielle? i have to go home for a minute."
2909,Bree,"orson, i don't want to be late."
3572,Bree,"oh, we feel the same way about you. you've been lovely."
884,Bree,"i don't know why, but i have this overwhelming feeling that you're gonna be just fine. i really do."
2195,Bree,"uh, yes, um--i just-- ran into her this morning."
1658,Bree,"yes,and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if i am a fit parent.and considering that mishap that i had with your kids,i,uh,i imagine he'll be anxious to talk to you."
1102,Bree,george! george!
2357,Bree,"well, are you aware of its history? the previous owner was harboring a murderer."
1767,Bree,peter--
2517,Bree,"well, i would be more than happy to go with you."
1708,Bree,i'm so sorry. i know that you're good friends.
1668,Bree,"it's not a good time for change in my life,peter.terrible things are happening.i'm headed to court.i need your support now more than ever."
1187,Bree,"i don't know. i thought maybe we could go antiquing."" ""i hear you have some lovely museums nearby. do you have any brochures?"
1980,Bree,yes.
3113,Bree,reverend green!
3526,Bree,wonderful. the house was too quiet without him.
2431,Bree,gloria? what are you doing here?
1989,Bree,"no, of course not.i love you."
2629,Bree,"it's a surprise party, you daft woman! what makes you think i had a hand in the guest list?"
3763,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
2315,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
78,Bree,is there somebody you'd like to invite?
617,Bree,"well, good. but why on earth would you need a condom?"
2672,Bree,"oh, look, they have water aerobics. you should sign up."
1521,Bree,"when i was young, my stepmother told me that i was very lucky.i possessed beauty,wit, cunning and insight.these were weapons all women needed to survive in the world."
1124,Bree,"he is not a corpse. he is a man named rex van de kamp. he was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a successful doctor. so successful, in fact, that he left me enough money to sue the city, this precinct, and you two gentlemen personally just for the fun of it."
3108,Bree,"would you mind terribly if i took your hand? maybe that way, he'll finally get the idea that i've moved on."
1945,Bree,"yes, i will marry you, orson."
2443,Bree,i'm so sorry to be putting you through this. i-i wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
2062,Bree,"a reporter just did a story on homeless teens, my son is one of them."
3102,Bree,"come on. you have to do something. i mean, that name is practically abusive."
370,Bree,i never pushed you around. we always made our decisions together.
3181,Bree,"well, it's certainly nice to meet you, dave, and let us be the first to welcome you to wisteria lane."
3057,Bree,"good night. okay, back to business. how do you feel about parker house rolls? i mean, personally, i think they're played out."
4015,Bree,what are you doing up so late?
3997,Bree,"i'm bringing you business, karl. try not to insult me."
349,Bree,how many nannies did you interview?
4033,Bree,that is none of your business.
557,Bree,rex and i are hosting a dinner party for ten next week. we're using our best china and serving duck.
662,Bree,"rex, this might sound silly, but are people staring at us?"
1191,Bree,"oh, please. it's not gonna help. george, clearly, this is psychosomatic. we need to go home."
3500,Bree,"fair enough. but just be careful, i mean, this is very complicated. i'd hate to see it end badly."
2247,Bree,"yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year."
4018,Bree,you want me to rob my own house?
902,Bree,"rex, everybody is talking about our sex life. every sordid little detail right down to that box of perversions you keep in your closet."
2828,Bree,"well, i know katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person i've seen her reduce to tears."
2163,Bree,"hello.i'd like to make a reservation for this evening under the names hodge and bigsby, and, um, we'll be needing a table in the center of the room."
2107,Bree,"no, no, no, no. i'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so i can walk in unannounced."
3436,Bree,"my god, orson. what kind of criminal is he? a killer or a rapist?"
1593,Bree,"well,that's the silliest thingi've ever heard of.how would he support himself?"
3037,Bree,and you'd probably go to prison.
2161,Bree,"that is ridiculous.orson did not kill alma.and besides,carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday."
3061,Bree,"what were you thinking, edie? we're supposed to be friends."
782,Bree,i'm upset because there is a problem here and no one seems to notice it but me.
840,Bree,"oh, don't worry about it. here i want you to try one of these clams. i bet they're as good as the marinara sauce."
3928,Bree,"that jail is--it's disgusting. all those men in cages, like animals. even to step foot in that place is humiliating."
3166,Bree,i'm home!
2427,Bree,"susan, stop. mike is innocent. he had nothing to do with monique polier's murder."
3165,Bree,then he raised the gun and came toward us. thank god katherine grabbed his arm and got the gun away. that lunatic would've killed us all.
431,Bree,"do me a favor, rex. please don't mistake my anal retentiveness for actual affection."
967,Bree,"it's true rex and i did not have the perfect marriage, but for eighteen years i tried my very best, and for that i am entitled to your respect."
937,Bree,hello?
1002,Bree,do i?
3956,Bree,"i hope so, because i just cannot take any more lying."
2866,Bree,"walter, i can't find a contractor now. everybody is booked for the next year."
823,Bree,"it's okay. george has a girlfriend. you brought her, didn't you?"
3394,Bree,and how is word going to spread?
1144,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i, i have to go. i have some things that i need to take care of."
1632,Bree,no one is ever gonna believe a word of that.
755,Bree,"he blames me for his being here. he blames me for everything, and he's probably right."
2868,Bree,this is a nightmare. what is going on?
3252,Bree,it's after midnight. haven't you eaten?
1954,Bree,"whatever you're alluding to, no."
412,Bree,they sure did.
2003,Bree,"men have lied to me before. believe me, it'ill never happen again."
199,Bree,"girls,you don't understand. this poor kid is scared out of his mind."
3988,Bree,"well, clearly, i like to think of myself as a rich person even more."
3520,Bree,"oh, dear god. this woman is determined to make my life sound ten times worse than it actually is."
625,Bree,why would you say that?
3242,Bree,"well, i know nothing. just keep me out of it. what is carlos doing?"
1745,Bree,"well, aren't you the renaissance man."
104,Bree,dr. goldfine.
1263,Bree,motherhood.
3594,Bree,say anything about what?
2039,Bree,"ah, she's right.this is all my fault."
3441,Bree,then why are you whispering?
1022,Bree,unless what?
1418,Bree,you would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
1513,Bree,can we talk about this later?i-i have ice cream in here.
1400,Bree,hi!
926,Bree,i know.
2769,Bree,addicts are experts at deception.
1762,Bree,"peter?peter, it's bree.are you in there?"
3906,Bree,"uh, gaby, before we learn what edie tastes like--"
703,Bree,you have to hand it to gabby and carlos. they do grieve better than anyone.
948,Bree,"i don't think so, but thank you, though."
1592,Bree,emancipated?
711,Bree,"sorry, honey, but you don't have a choice."
692,Bree,you talk to him all you want. i'm gonna check out the place with the electrified fence.
2445,Bree,"well, hello there, julie."
1386,Bree,nothing. i just sat there and let him die.
3851,Bree,i'm sure it'll turn up somewhere. well--i'm off.
787,Bree,"about four weeks old. i never told you this, but when i gave birth to you, there were complications. the umbilical chord wrapped around your neck and you stopped breathing. the room got very quiet, and i knew you were in trouble. so i turned to the doctor and i very calmly said that he was not to worry about me, that his job was to save your life. when i say i would die for you, that's not just an expression. i mean it."
1656,Bree,"i know that you're still angry with me,and,i wanted to tell you that i have,joined a recovery program.a.a.i just wanted you to know that--and to tell you i'm sorry.you are--a real friend,and i value your honesty."
480,Bree,i'd love to.
3100,Bree,it has a very distinct ring.
3845,Bree,"so say something. stand up to him. but stealing? honestly, orson, why would you do something like that?"
3821,Bree,"you know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation."
452,Bree,"oh, these flowers are stunning. they're the best ones i've ever gotten."
1903,Bree,"i am trying to ensure that they turn into responsible adults.trust me, rex, in the end, we will be rewarded."
1743,Bree,"because when it comes to sex,i have an unwavering moral compass.truly. a man could beg and plead all day long,and it wouldn't make any difference.so since i have such strong self-control,there's really no reason for us to end our friendship."
2337,Bree,"now that we're all assembled, i'd like to introduce the guest of honor. i hope you'll all be as delighted to meet her as i was. you can come in now."
2800,Bree,"hey, andrew. what are you doing?"
2554,Bree,"it does sound fun, but i don't think my doctor's taking on any new patients."
3081,Bree,yeah.
3765,Bree,"well, i've always believed that we create our own luck."
290,Bree,"darned if i know. uh, danielle, everything in the north quadrant of your side is clothes and books and such, and the south side are miscellaneous items."
1270,Bree,weird?
2129,Bree,andrew! not in front of the therapist.
210,Bree,"zach,why did you do this?"
3932,Bree,you have every right to hate me.
2650,Bree,"it's just a little, uh--"
2719,Bree,"push, baby, push."
1421,Bree,my son is trying to blackmail me.and i want you to stop the little sobdo you think you could do that?
587,Bree,"so, it's like we're in a little play."
256,Bree,"how many years have we been making love, and you've started to ask me something, but then you stop?"
3731,Bree,"we just went to a second printing, and now they're talking a 3-book deal. so seriously, i am not gonna miss that money."
1773,Bree,"needless to say,the agreement between us is off.caleb is dangerous,and i want him put away.if he is not gone by tomorrow,i am calling the police."
940,Bree,"oh, do one of you drink soy milk? i was cleaning out the fridge this morning, and rex is the only one who drinks it. i just bought it on friday. i'd hate to throw it away."
287,Bree,"it's in new york, for god's sakes, why on earth would you suggest that?"
58,Bree,good.
744,Bree,"sorry, i didn't know. it won't happen again. of course, i'm a somewhat surprised you don't hit them, i mean everyone knows they're a little bit out of control."
3063,Bree,i'm bree hodge.
2387,Bree,are those shoes suede?
420,Bree,"well, then he can go to a motel because he's not allowed back in my house."
2241,Bree,of course.
607,Bree,so should i just dial nine one one?
2843,Bree,just come out! i'll get rid of her!
223,Bree,"thank you, i feel really good about it."
1769,Bree,"get away from her!danielle,i want you to pick up the phone and call the police."
1249,Bree,"well, he knows me, and certainly better than you do."
637,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
53,Bree,"uh, yeah, i'm sure."
4053,Bree,"and do you say that to every woman, too?"
4088,Bree,"you have no idea. now he's saying if i try to divorce him, he can go to the police and report me."
2854,Bree,"she said that she and adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and--"
2717,Bree,i am going back to get adam.
3829,Bree,"i'm going to put some coffee on. orson, would you give me a hand? let these three chat."
3228,Bree,"but in regards to my husband, i should make one thing very clear--his passing had nothing to do with my cooking."
1880,Bree,i have aspirin at home that packs more of a punch.
2668,Bree,"she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her. her heart is not very strong."
3401,Bree,"orson, i should have never offered you that job. it wasn't fair to katherine."
3691,Bree,"i don't know. what do you think, gaby? gaby?"
1300,Bree,george.
890,Bree,why are you shopping here? you live on the other side of town.
2313,Bree,that's our gift to them.
1770,Bree,what?
1069,Bree,"that's why i need you to take the test and answer the detective's questions, because i'm not going to know exactly how i feel until we put this behind us, but then, once we do--"
1231,Bree,#name?
2125,Bree,"this was a cry for help, and if we don't listen, the next time she could do something even more dangerous."
89,Bree,"well, i wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night."
920,Bree,thank you.
2148,Bree,yes. i wonder where she gets it.
2020,Bree,how do you know him?
146,Bree,"and-now she treats herself the way that other mean treat her. like an object, a piece of meat."
257,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life because you're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask."
3353,Bree,"hi, everybody! you having a good time?"
3111,Bree,"oh. how, um, colorfully put."
3477,Bree,"obviously, you turned it back on."
1442,Bree,"uh,no.i just wanted to ask you a favor."
345,Bree,"well, he's doing a fabulous job!"
494,Bree,"it's so lovely. i mean, look at the handle. is that mother of pearl?"
2376,Bree,"well, okay-- i have to go."
440,Bree,i'm keeping my eyes on the horizon. please tell me if i'm about to step on a body part.
1444,Bree,"no,no,no,i think given the misunderstanding that i should get the bill."
482,Bree,"oh, packages! thank you."
178,Bree,"oh.well,, i guess i can do it by myself."
154,Bree,three months.
1450,Bree,what do you think you're doing?
1100,Bree,well. what did he say?
2513,Bree,this is not my pie.
1578,Bree,"oh,well,if you need a ride to school, i'm happy to drive you."
2042,Bree,"there won't be, not anymore."
2864,Bree,"hello, boys. bob, lee, i baked you some muffins to thank you for introducing me to walter here. and, walter, i decided you're absolutely right. dark shingles are the way to go. why are you all staring at me?"
1626,Bree,you took that out of my purse.
907,Bree,i don't believe you.
2728,Bree,wait. did you have that final scan?
1574,Bree,"well,good. i mean,i just--i really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.well,i'm--i'm going to the mall.they're having a white sale today.i think i'm gonna get a new bath mat.oh,does anyone need one?"
327,Bree,"no, i won't, not until you tell me."
1698,Bree,"eleanor,i thought you'd gone to bed."
1525,Bree,i know. um--i came to see you.
3476,Bree,i didn't see you do that.
1715,Bree,"i just got a massage at misty spring.things have been a little tense at home, and i needed an hour to relax."
1530,Bree,"caleb, have you been down here all these months?"
19,Bree,andrew. this is family time. i think we should all--
471,Bree,"andrew, you will not speak that way about your father in front of me."
77,Bree,so how many will i be cooking for?
259,Bree,"why not? we haven't had sex for months, rex. most normal, red-blooded men would be climbing the walls by now."
2071,Bree,"orson, i saw the two of you whispering right after dr. keck ran off. what happened?"
143,Bree,"i'm curious, andrew, as you fantasise about this woman, do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?"
1955,Bree,"true, i have in the past, given myself away too freely.how charming of you to bring that up while i'm announcing my engagement.but i'd like to think that i've learned from my mistakes.so the dinner is at 8:00 and when we make the announcement, please, everyone look surprised."
1590,Bree,this is ridiculous.can't you see this is a performance?
2124,Bree,they're sticking a tube down her throat. do you still think this is funny?
800,Bree,"it's true that we dated during the separation, but george and i are just friends now, aren't we?"
3945,Bree,do we really need to do this tonight? they're ashes. it's not like they're gonna go bad.
2224,Bree,and i can't believe you told me that she was senile! you lied to me.
1376,Bree,"andrew, that is not fair."
3178,Bree,andrew-- do we have a backup pie?
3385,Bree,"andrew, really."
1975,Bree,"well, that's the odd thing.i mean there was no pain, per se, in fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant."
893,Bree,i'm sorry?
641,Bree,i can see that tisha is making the rounds. she must have some juicy new anecdote.
1123,Bree,"the police dug up your father today.they think that somebody was poisoning him.apparently,i'm a suspect."
1012,Bree,and i appreciate that.
2106,Bree,"actually, gus, um, i'm here to see one of your guests-- a gentleman named faladi."
538,Bree,"i'm not. the coffee is just dreadful. well, it's late, and i needed to get out of the house, and it was the only place still open."
2368,Bree,why not? and what the hell was that on the porch?!
3266,Bree,"all right, orson. don't overexcite him on the upholstery. so, danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish for your welcome home party? i can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin."
3890,Bree,"oh, shoot. i left them upstairs."
3238,Bree,hmm.
1339,Bree,"i just hope you don't expect too much from this relationship. i mean aside from dna, you might find that you don't have that much in common."
868,Bree,"george, do you have an erection?"
2869,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. tell him to put on his big boy pants and find another girl."
400,Bree,"hello. this is she. yes, he's my husband."
743,Bree,"lynnette, is there a problem?"
734,Bree,"well, then i will fix you a very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese."
2374,Bree,that's not true.
4102,Bree,not by resorting to physical violence. i would never have given my permission for that.
2748,Bree,they're-- unsightly. i do not want our son to be teased--for being different. do you?
1352,Bree,why are you telling me this?
2474,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
2355,Bree,what?
3086,Bree,did you hear something?
870,Bree,i was teasing you.
1826,Bree,"well,i'm sorry about the noise.it's just that danielle doesn't want balloons,and i'm kind of pressed for time."
3756,Bree,we'll chat later. roll out some dough and show me where the basil is. we'll be serving three cheese pizza tonight.
3300,Bree,hi! come on in!
1028,Bree,am i a suspect?
2135,Bree,so--what do we owe you for all this progress?
1156,Bree,right this way.
1559,Bree,"oh,thank god! i'm so sorry.i don't know what happened.i was in the kitchen cleaning up after making cookies,and i looked in the living room,and they were gone."
2114,Bree,remind me to buy paper plates. we'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.
3854,Bree,"i want you to explain to me why this insanity is still going on. when you stole that tape recorder, you said it was a onetime thing, an impulsive act of revenge."
3584,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, orson. let it go."
4058,Bree,that is not a doormat. that is a handwoven kurdish kazak rug.
3757,Bree,"if this doesn't stop your mother-in-law from criticizing your cooking, i will give you a full refund."
2837,Bree,"sylvia, where are you going? sylvia, you need to come out of there."
82,Bree,"well, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week. tennis lessons are a plausible alibi."
243,Bree,the man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms. mind if i bunk with you?
3579,Bree,well--
2220,Bree,and--
3027,Bree,will someone please tell me what's going on?
1548,Bree,"for god sakes,it was an honest mistake.i thought i could have just a little bit of wine with dinner,but, apparently,my body couldn't handle it.fine!if it makes everybody happy,i will just suffer through my sneezing fits and my hives on my own."
1970,Bree,but orson!
2661,Bree,what's so funny?
3507,Bree,"only that her name is sandra birch. we just spoke, and she seemed very nice."
1759,Bree,"no, no, i'm--i'm good.i'm just, um, here to pick up my friend peter.he's locked himself in your bathroom,and i'm here to take him home."
3835,Bree,but what about the job?
2348,Bree,"boy, when it comes to mike there's no one you won't betray."
265,Bree,i will be right in.
1913,Bree,i beg your pardon?
3910,Bree,"you know, edie used to live around here when she moved away from wisteria lane."
3302,Bree,these are advanced copies. i wanted you to be the first to have them.
3425,Bree,"well, that's what's so great about it. technically, it's a business dinner. it has all the potential upside of a date while still being tax-deductible."
1561,Bree,no--no harm done.
669,Bree,"i will scream about your cruelty. then i will scream about your infidelity. and then, just to make sure it really hurts, i will scream about your distasteful sexual habits. you want to know what true humiliation is, you just take one step."
2215,Bree,"thank you. well, hello there! how pretty you look today! it's wonderful that you're up and about! you must be enjoying these colorful balloons!"
1555,Bree,"okay,we're done playing hide-and-seek!boys?!"
2499,Bree,"because i'm her mother.and i know what i've created,and that's the real humiliation.orson.this child deserves better.and i know what to do now. please,please let me try."
1889,Bree,"um, we, uh, just came over to introduce ourselves, but we can, um, do that at another time."
1436,Bree,"oh,betty,if there's anything i can do,anything at all--"
2490,Bree,"no,it's nothing!"
46,Bree,"oh, have i?"
2910,Bree,"yeah, but i'm sure edna fletcher has been there since 9:00, kissing up to reverend sykes."
3728,Bree,thank god i didn't show her how the car parks itself.
2958,Bree,"yes, i do. you were right. faith shouldn't be blind. you don't threaten it by asking questions. you make it stronger, and i lost sight of that."
242,Bree,"""i love everything about it. the sensations, the smells. i especially love the feel of a man. all that muscle and sinew pressed against my body. and then, when you add friction. mmm -- the tactile sensation of running my tongue over a man's nipple ever so gently. and then there's the act itself - two bodies becoming one in that final eruption of pleasure. to be honest, the only thing i don't like about sex is the scrotum. i mean, obviously it has its practical applications, but i'm just not a fan."" "
1354,Bree,"i want to help you, but in order to do that, i need to forgive you, and, i can't do that until you admit what you've done."
3583,Bree,"andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and then deny me the chance to make up for it. orson and i will expect you at 8:00."
2523,Bree,"orson, what am i gonna do?"
3889,Bree,"that's sweet, but i've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment."
1788,Bree,"sorry,i don't know what's taking danielle so long to get dressed."
3051,Bree,"oh, come on, edie. you know, carlos, mike, karl-- you do have a way at picking at other women's leftovers."
2808,Bree,"oh, dear god. at least let me buy you some decent furniture."
45,Bree,"and so, there's just the four of us. my oldest son andrew is 16, danielle is 15, and?"
1814,Bree,"honey, you've gotta let me make it up to you.i-i'm gonna throw you a birthday party with all your friends, okay?"
1995,Bree,"well, orson and i talked about it and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait. and with your help, i'm sure we can get it all done."
3211,Bree,"orson, i adore you, but your name-- our name-- it has no music. ""van de kamp"" trips off the tongue. ""hodge"" sounds like the noise a plunger makes."
1021,Bree,"well, i got that, but why? why would they do that?"
938,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree. i do hope i's not calling too early. hmm? oh, of course you can borrow that scarf. i'll press it for you. um, i have, uh, some news. rex died."
2994,Bree,"katherine, no one expects you to be a martyr. why don't you go home?"
1262,Bree,do you ever think you might like it?
918,Bree,"you know what? i am so happy that you guys came here, i really am, but i am trying really hard to be strong, so if you keep comforting me--"
599,Bree,andrew is still a child.
646,Bree,"uh, what just happened?"
277,Bree,"is, is that what you would prefer, danielle? to live with your father."
3998,Bree,"yes, i know that comes as a surprise."
3361,Bree,"lynette, you're drunk."
3059,Bree,"ah, the key is to keep one car between yours and hers at all times. have fun."
1776,Bree,--the courage to change the things we can--
3817,Bree,yeah.
2683,Bree,"uh, no, my daughter is in switzerland, at boarding school."
3842,Bree,we will talk about this later.
1839,Bree,you look like a girl who enjoys her frosting.
3646,Bree,you're gonna have kids?
3943,Bree,"lord, lynette. you nearly gave me a heart attack."
1164,Bree,"well, i thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more, but what the heck."
3481,Bree,"no! i-i refuse to pay blackmail to some hooligan who's stolen from us twice! andrew--all my life, i have done my best to teach you to respect god and the law and never to harm another living thing. i want you to forget every one of those lessons if it'll help you get that tape back."
772,Bree,"i'll get the door. honey, you pour the wine."
3615,Bree,it's a pleasure to meet you.
2079,Bree,"this is a nightmare, an absolute nightmare."
962,Bree,"oh, yes, i am. i am going to hire security, and those security men are going to have sticks and if you so much as set foot in that sanctuary, they will be instructed to beat you with those sticks"
551,Bree,maybe he's just trying to be supportive.
819,Bree,"oh my goodness, well, this changes everything. a friend of mine is having a barbeque for her husband on saturday and i think you should come."
3785,Bree,"honey, please don't do this."
3858,Bree,i'll take care of it.
111,Bree,just some more about her nightmares and this girl she was afraid of.
2223,Bree,"well, i have a better idea. why don't you tell him yourself?"
2896,Bree,"oh, so why don't you take this piece of pie upstairs to julie?"
1718,Bree,"yeah,apparently you gave her a gift certificate."
4010,Bree,"oh, no. deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked."
1161,Bree,"uh, no, go ahead."
376,Bree,"hi, danielle, how was school?"
3343,Bree,"oh, lynette, i appreciate everything you've done. but i've actually approved the old campaign, and i can't just tell them i've changed my mind."
3743,Bree,you know what might be even better? my publisher has been begging me to do a local launch for my book.
464,Bree,"no, we are not going to have sex!"
876,Bree,i told you in confidence. how dare you throw it back in my face.
1079,Bree,"actually, it is getting late, and i am tired, so--"
2138,Bree,"yes, danielle made it quite clear that i'm powerless to stop this relationship, and since she assures me that you love her. you do love her, don't you?"
3193,Bree,"ah! oh, god. are you all right?"
1166,Bree,i don't know. i felt something weird.
898,Bree,"couldn't sleep, so i was just sitting here thinking."
2401,Bree,"oh, dear. i'm not sure how to tell you this, but--after alma knocked you out, she assaulted you."
1286,Bree,"yes, we did. now, when the time comes to go public with our relationship, i need you to discuss it with me first. i'm the bride, after all. it's only appropriate."
1581,Bree,"not until you're 21.and if i had my way, you wouldn't get your hands on it until you're 50.i mean,we both know you're gonna waste every penny of it."
1183,Bree,"paul, we've called the police."
2616,Bree,"orson, just five more minutes! that's all you're getting! i tell you what. why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, i'll have a christening party? what do you say?"
3535,Bree,good point. snoring is too mild a word for what you're doing. imagine a terrified elephant summoning his herd.
1269,Bree,how was your little reunion?
1189,Bree,i can't stay in a hotel room with you.
442,Bree,"not that it's any of your business, but, i have a date."
1537,Bree,"aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?the name, um--melanie foster came up.i'm gonna pour you a drink now, betty,because we're about to have a very honest discussion,and i think you're gonna need a little help getting through it."
3669,Bree,where's katherine?
3914,Bree,that would be lovely. oh. you were being sarcastic.
1914,Bree,"well, there's nothing like being tied to a bed to change a girl's mind."
872,Bree,"i don't know. um, um, think of something unpleasant."
3840,Bree,you took it. i saw you.
2873,Bree,"oh, hi, susan. i hope you don't mind that i made dinner."
3746,Bree,"well, technically, i'm she, but yes."
1845,Bree,yeah.
2017,Bree,"orson, you look so serious."
2154,Bree,"well, thank you, darling. but if you think for one second that i'm gonna break bread with that malicious, pill-popping shrew, you're out of your mind."
1106,Bree,"because. ever since i found out what andrew said, i've been doing some soul searching and i realize that everything that's happened is completely my fault."
3538,Bree,you don't have an uncle!
666,Bree,"oh, no. i refuse to give them this kind of satisfaction. open your menu."
970,Bree,"i left him an hour ago, and he was wearing ralph lauren."
2057,Bree,"yeah, it's nice to know that i can raise some things correctly."
4038,Bree,"oh, thank you."
2917,Bree,presbyterian.
3656,Bree,nonsense! it's a small price to pay to make your home more beautiful. i insist.
1664,Bree,"i got,uh,your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started."
2919,Bree,what? no. put your hand down.
1895,Bree,i can tell by your tone that you don't believe me.
1663,Bree,i actually don't want anything of the sort.
3671,Bree,and bring some steak sauce.
3654,Bree,"oh, don't worry about us. jackson is so great. you are making the right choice."
1982,Bree,"hi, can i help you?"
3092,Bree,i know no such thing. now be quiet. i'm done talking to you.
4027,Bree,wipe your feet first. i just had the carpets cleaned. just because we're thieves doesn't mean we need to be untidy.
2831,Bree,really?
3307,Bree,"they've come up with this whole marketing plan--radio, print, book signings."
1527,Bree,"so, caleb,besides your mother and brother,does anybody else know that you're here?"
988,Bree,"for god sakes, phyllis, don't you ever worry about dehydration?"
3299,Bree,"no, uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
3670,Bree,"uh, yeah. in the test kitchen."
1972,Bree,"ah.oh, no!"
3355,Bree,"actually, stu's company is doing all my advertising."
2858,Bree,the fire captain said they have to go slowly. they don't want debris suddenly collapsing into the basement.
2044,Bree,"excuse me, ma'am? i mean-- miss. i'm looking for someone. uh, his name is andrew. have you seen him?"
1335,Bree,so stalking me is plan b?
1660,Bree,"i could not ask for anything more.thanks.see you around,i hope."
2827,Bree,would you like a nice cup of tea?
1920,Bree,probably because i'm ashamed.
1796,Bree,"andrew?honey,where are you?i got your message.what's the emergency?andrew?andrew?"
2497,Bree,and then what would happen to the baby?
3463,Bree,"well done, orson!"
1538,Bree,"yes, i did.i also noticed that you had him chained in the basement."
2358,Bree,"they had a dungeon in the basement.i mean, people say they still hear groans coming from the house at night."
1623,Bree,"oh,no,thank you.i have to run. just the check.i have a charity event this weekend,and i have to find a cocktail dress before the store closes.but everything was just yummy."
3885,Bree,all the while thinking i had your support.
2059,Bree,"and you're not being hard enough. stop saying that what i did was understandable, i'm a mother who abandoned her child.that's-- unnatural."
2542,Bree,"yes, and get this--when adam said dylan was just going to keep asking questions, katherine said-- and i quote--""well, we're just gonna have to find better lies."" oh, hang on. i've got another call."
2385,Bree,i wouldn't worry about orson's soul. he won't be sleeping with alma.
1323,Bree,"see, the thing is, i don't think we are anymore."
319,Bree,i see.
3789,Bree,coco saugatuck. happy now?
2583,Bree,"orson, honey, where have you been?"
3284,Bree,"well, what do you think?"
1179,Bree,"you can think whatever you want, but to be honest, i don't believe in the subconscious."
2624,Bree,i have been awful. i wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
2716,Bree,how many rum punches did you have?
2336,Bree,"well, when you're wrong, you're wrong."
2779,Bree,so you'll replace it for free.
175,Bree,paul?
3703,Bree,such as?
2792,Bree,"okay. thanks. yes, um, we'll be going now."
3933,Bree,"i meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in. oh. now that i see this place, i don't know what i were thinking."
2588,Bree,i have to bring this dvd player to danielle.
542,Bree,that i don't know. what do you think i should do?
2423,Bree,and you think--
3638,Bree,what are you doing?
3462,Bree,"oh. well, are you sure she's trustworthy?"
3291,Bree,"i gave him a hot dog, all right? he liked it so much, he asked for another."
656,Bree,"maisy, i didn't mention it when you were having financial troubles because i thought it would embarrass you."
1498,Bree,i don't know what you mean.
102,Bree,"there. obviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can, um, come right back and get it."
375,Bree,"gabrielle, you have to change the lineup. susan has to go last. nothing is going to top this."
2226,Bree,"orson, it's implied! now get out there and show her some respect!"
3652,Bree,"well, maybe they were only together a short time, and she didn't mean anything to him."
3207,Bree,"now it's just a mock-up, but this is what the book is going to look like."
467,Bree,"andrew, i'm so sorry that i said anything."
2048,Bree,"uh, excuse me. i'm looking for my son. have you seen him? have you seen him?"
2939,Bree,which is just down the street. i'll be right back.
2366,Bree,"i try to hold my head up and smile and just bake more pies for the church social. but now your ex is camped out on our doorstep like i am hosting some kind of mormon slumber party, and i do not know how i am gonna bake my way out of this one!"
2931,Bree,"or, uh, the unitarians. from what i hear, those folks are ""anything goes."""
2014,Bree,did you kill your wife? susan talked to that carolyn woman. why didn't you tell me that the police searched your house?
2171,Bree,what is all this?
3612,Bree,"yes. which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3:00.could you?"
1864,Bree,"well, now that we've finished with all this unpleasantness, i want to assure you that we are going to be good neighbors, and i hope in time, great friends."
3720,Bree,i don't think i do that.
3160,Bree,"no, i did a bang-up job. katherine bailed on me and left town last night."
1267,Bree,positively glowing.
3397,Bree,"look, if we can't agree on something this basic, maybe we shouldn't work together."
1994,Bree,i mean i was lucky to find these. it's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
3504,Bree,good. i can check that off my list.
1519,Bree,"what did this caleb do,exactly?and why on earth are they hiding him?"
1367,Bree,"''i don't understand. i mean what would george be doing with a life-size doll?oh,dear lord.''"
2085,Bree,"be that as it may, do we all agree that i should tell this man's wife?"
4120,Bree,what is he wearing?
5,Bree,"oh yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook."
1490,Bree,"well, how about some old-fashioned chaperoning?that way they can, um,still see each other,and we won't have to be the villains."
633,Bree,"oh, i see."
2473,Bree,what a beautiful family.i feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
3702,Bree,"if you would just take on a few more patients, we could afford it."
959,Bree,the happiest time in rex's life was not his childhood. he loved being a husband and he loved being a father.
1013,Bree,"i'm, uh, i'm going to see rex's lawyer. we're going to go over some details involving rex's will. phyllis, obviously, i'm just mortified over slapping you. i, i've just been in a weird place since rex's death, but, that's no excuse. i'm very, very sorry."
1684,Bree,what are you doing here?
2780,Bree,"oh, give it some time. we're still adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly."
3047,Bree,"orson's car is still parked at my house. um, did he mention when he'd be coming back to pick it up?"
993,Bree,excuse me?
348,Bree,it's just a fact. i'm his mother. he lived inside of me.
3796,Bree,"that's why you wanted to know the names of my pets? orson hodge, you are shameful."
3407,Bree,80?!
2763,Bree,it's just a little unsightly foreskin. he'll never miss it.
2248,Bree,"oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach."
1543,Bree,"oh,no,no,no,no.i'm okay."
1326,Bree,"george, i don't want to!"
1285,Bree,"well, fortunately, people only read the announcements when there's nothing in the front page, and the headline today was about some catastrophic flood in sri lanka."
316,Bree,we just want you to know how much we care.
2952,Bree,it did. it did help me.
479,Bree,"it'll, um, it'll be a lot easier once he gets well enough to move out."
1373,Bree,he hasn't got a clue.
2664,Bree,and a retirement village is fun?
2524,Bree,what? surrender? debase myself?
2731,Bree,"and you'd better apply now. debbie gottlieb had her baby the same day i did, and she could only get wait-listed at her first three choices. oh, by the way, we were invited to her bris this saturday."
3641,Bree,"hmm. excuse--excuse me, melina. that's my chair."
2691,Bree,"you know, danielle, i just want you to be aware that giving up this baby might be harder than you think."
850,Bree,thank you. i'm glad we cleared this up. i know that it must have looked strange and i didn't want you to think that i was cheating on my husband.
346,Bree,"well, if it insures he grows up with some trace of humanity, then that's a risk i'm willing to take!"
1714,Bree,"so tell me,how are you doing?i mean,your entire world must be turned upside down.you must be exhausted."
3777,Bree,a tiny salary bump.
80,Bree,"because when you drink, you get chatty. no one needs to know that we're seeing dr. goldfine."
99,Bree,"hotel by the interstate has better rates, and, uh, it's closer to your work."
839,Bree,because i'm married! people would talk.
1683,Bree,eleanor!
330,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being."
264,Bree,"more wine? so, uh, reba, emma and lori-- why don't you girls come to the kitchen and help me with the snacks?"
1430,Bree,"well,once he stopped suspecting me of murdering rex he was delightful,but,um--i don't really know him."
3258,Bree,i do not require lectures on tact.
2319,Bree,"yes, i know--with monique polier."
1529,Bree,downstairs?
1546,Bree,"i do not have a hangover,andrew,because i was not drunk."
2489,Bree,"no,no,no!it's just,uh--oh,it's a little barbecue sauce."
802,Bree,"do you know, i've finally convinced rex to buy his first orchid."
4107,Bree,you're fired.
882,Bree,"well, i guess it wouldn't hurt to sit her down and share our concerns."
3095,Bree,those with roasted green beans as our side dishes. nice tight grouping. you are not rusty at all.
1088,Bree,part of the reason i'm having him over is so that you can get to know him.
2303,Bree,orson. why haven't you returned any of my calls?
3485,Bree,"oh, my."
306,Bree,because i have faith in the poor.
512,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken. we tend to lie.
1427,Bree,what noises?
1902,Bree,"they also get pregnant and become drug addicts, and that color hair is the gateway.would you please, uh, add that to our bill?"
3247,Bree,you can fix this. just tell them that you're at the wrong table and then slip out the side door.
1865,Bree,come on.
3794,Bree,"okay, fine. if i had to pick a favorite, i guess it would be munchy. she was a bit rambunctious. father sent her to a farm so she'd have room to run. i cried for weeks and weeks."
1479,Bree,"oh, honey."
3296,Bree,"orson, you weren't here. she came back. she was married to a lawyer. and don't forget, she is his mother! i tried to fight, but--"
2947,Bree,"well, i was at the service this morning, and it's just not the same without you."
2306,Bree,you had a child?
1938,Bree,do i know you?
3963,Bree,orson's not exactly the bar-fight type. he's more of a raised voices at-a-cheese-tasting type.
322,Bree,i feel awful for carlos. that talk about children was obviously coming from his grief.
3028,Bree,what?
125,Bree,"andrew, just because i chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give you the right to be rude."
2184,Bree,carolyn.
2384,Bree,thanks for the heads-up. now off you go.
2787,Bree,"no, thanks. i'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone. he forgot it again."
2482,Bree,are you gonna back off now?
3323,Bree,honey--i'm not angry. i'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
3554,Bree,fine. i just know i need my sleep tonight.
3927,Bree,"oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after benjamin."
2420,Bree,suicide? no.orson would never try to kill himself.the police are wrong.it must have been an accident.
3690,Bree,"oh, i think it's saturday."
2456,Bree,do young people still say awesome?
3076,Bree,family?
309,Bree,they sure didn't turn out like we expected them to.
2493,Bree,"oh,my baby!"
4070,Bree,"my lawyer says you're entitled to half of everything we've acquired during the marriage, so i was trying to hide some of those things, since--let's face it-- i paid for them."
12,Bree,"it's ok? andrew, i spent 3 hours cooking this meal. how do you think it makes me feel when you say it's ok, in that sullen tone?"
2639,Bree,you wouldn't. think of danielle!
2620,Bree,it seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
1460,Bree,i have been through enough humiliation for one day.i hope you have a better suggestion than that.
2844,Bree,that she had an affair with adam.
286,Bree,"yes. gabrielle, did you, or did you not offer to sponsor her?"
44,Bree,"hi, i'm bree, and this is my husband rex. and i brought you some homemade pot pourri."
2645,Bree,thank you for the gift.
1108,Bree,"thank you, george, for being so understanding."
3116,Bree,ohh!
930,Bree,"and for the record, you are gonna come through this operation just fine."
411,Bree,hey.
2334,Bree,"oh, okay, just one minute. that'll be susan."
3183,Bree,you read it ready?
3717,Bree,that was a lovely service.
218,Bree,it just doesn't make any sense. zach is such a sweet kid. i can't imagine him doing anything that terrible.
3704,Bree,i have a job. i'm a homemaker.
3957,Bree,he sounded very sincere.
3540,Bree,"orson, if we can't share a bed, it's going to hurt the intimacy of our marriage."
141,Bree,fine.
500,Bree,"now before i fire a handgun, i like to go over a few of the basics just to make sure i'm ready. okay? so, number one, a strong stance."
2530,Bree,which is what? vanilla? nutmeg? cardamom?
803,Bree,george. what about him?
1449,Bree,i am not giving you anything.except the bill.
1910,Bree,"oh, well, i certainly would not want that to happen.what's your name?"
138,Bree,"you think that's bad? tomorrow morning i'm cleaning it! oh, by the way keith, i didn't get the chance to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week in church."
3180,Bree,so you're back?
167,Bree,did you hear there was a break in at mrs fome's the other night?
2170,Bree,no. why?
2984,Bree,"thank you, mrs. downing. listen, when i present the founder's award tonight, i was wondering--"
786,Bree,your baby pictures. look at that one.
2375,Bree,i'm so sorry. i br--broke a glass.
305,Bree,"this is the most impoverished neighborhood in the city. trust me, somebody will steal the car."
2013,Bree,"before we do this, there's something i need to ask you."
152,Bree,neither do i.
1411,Bree,"wake up, sleepyhead.i brought fresh croissants for breakfast!"
3884,Bree,that's not true!
2249,Bree,"right, from here i can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop."
484,Bree,"i mean, what are the odds? first mary alice and then mrs. huber? i mean, it's shocking."
577,Bree,huh?
2686,Bree,"oh, we've been invited to bob and lee 's for halloween."
1869,Bree,"yes. uh, excruciatingly so."
2509,Bree,"oh, no need, dear. i always bring dessert. oh, i'm thinking my lemon meringue pie."
173,Bree,that is for the kids' trip.
3676,Bree,"well, for all i know, telling orson his steak tastes like charcoal might be deballing him."
1739,Bree,edie!
3781,Bree,"oh, thank god."
3495,Bree,i said..let's not dwell on it.
3283,Bree,you have to promise not to tell your mommy.
1258,Bree,"gaby, if i make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down."
3384,Bree,"uh, yes. he's going to read a lot of classic books, maybe study a language."
3130,Bree,"well, i admit she plays her cards close to the vest, but some of you could benefit from that kind of quiet dignity, miss i-chew-gum- like-a-1930s-gun-moll."
2742,Bree,"yes, um, can you tell me who i would talk to about having my baby circumcised?"
160,Bree,"oh,you want me to recommend the twins?"
3140,Bree,"why are you here? and don't say for the pizza, because i know you're lactose-intolerant."
74,Bree,really? wouldn't that be in poor taste?
1621,Bree,"well,i'm still appalled that you're helping my son with this ridiculous emancipation scheme,but you are a guest in my house,and guests get sandwiches."
2784,Bree,"and if you're as tired as you say you are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight."
3558,Bree,what?
2455,Bree,andrew?
874,Bree,"i kept this friendship going because i though rex's dislike of you was paranoid, but you had feelings for me all along. god, this is just such a betrayal."
209,Bree,what is it?
3935,Bree,"my theory--edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see."
3930,Bree,so--how are you doing?
1138,Bree,"well, i know, but rex died in his care. of course he'd like to blame someone else."
922,Bree,"no, and i need to clean out our rain gutters, and, uh, beneath the refrigerator, and i can't tell you how long it's been since i've replaced the shelf liner, so--"
1643,Bree,i don't know.i guess i'm just impatient to get on with my life.
1798,Bree,did you forget that we're supposed to take that tour of perkins college today?
732,Bree,"well, art is subjective."
520,Bree,"why can't we talk this over? george, i -"
3469,Bree,no. get me an oven mitt.
3673,Bree,"oh, i really couldn't say."
2115,Bree,the oddest thing happened at the club today. tish atherton--
1107,Bree,"no, it's not. all the things that andrew's been saying, the way he's been acting, it's all connected to his father's death and it's clear to me that i need to spend more time focusing on him and his needs."
14,Bree,you'd rather i serve pork and beans?
3513,Bree,"of course they can. if they read my book, that is. okay, truth be told--i'm far from perfect. only yesterday, i burned a whole tray of biscotti."
2713,Bree,not on the couch. i just had it reupholstered.
950,Bree,"hi. i would have been over sooner to introduce myself, but i'm afraid there's been a death in my family."
2612,Bree,"uh, it's a lovely thought, but i really don't want a baby shower."
3202,Bree,"please, danielle. you have no right to take him."
3127,Bree,"no, that's all right. let him rest. but please take excellent care of him. he's a good man."
2063,Bree,"oh, i'm not talking about a lie--just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where you've been. i mean, we can't possibly tell them that you've been living on skid row, sleeping in a cardboard box."
3894,Bree,"mr. dinsmore, would you mind if i speak to my husband for a moment?"
3387,Bree,i'm too tired. can you do it?
1848,Bree,"it was the oddest sensation.i was fine,and everything was fine,and then suddenly i was on the outside of my body watching a woman who looked like me becoming a raving maniac."
485,Bree,i'm gonna miss her.
1516,Bree,don't brush your hair at the table.
2293,Bree,"what?! no, i did not, and i don't plan to."
3547,Bree,no.
2514,Bree,what happened to the pie that i brought?
3088,Bree,"i reject your peace, and i demand you stop stalking me."
2656,Bree,what?
570,Bree,"yes. and i suppose we'll make love tomorrow night, too."
1962,Bree,"okay, so we will see you saturday and please pretend to be surprised.bye."
461,Bree,yes.
3684,Bree,"andrew, please. you were there. alex started the whole thing. you need to tell him to stop criticizing me."
3448,Bree,"oh, i am so, so sorry."
3740,Bree,okay.
1784,Bree,"well,he did falsely accuse me of child abuse.i would say we're even.wouldn't you,andrew?"
2285,Bree,actually--i could probably use the distraction.
406,Bree,then why is he so unhappy?
2024,Bree,we know what you think. now would you please leave us alone?
488,Bree,"oh, and we got so lucky with the weather, it's just absolutely -"
2198,Bree,"thank god i found this stale baguette so i can make bruschetta, and there's shrimp in the freezer, so i'm gonna make my rice and seafood dish."
1748,Bree,excuse me.excuse me.may i ask you something?
644,Bree,"no, i can't."
1048,Bree,yes.
194,Bree,"zach,i won't tell your father."
1149,Bree,i'm changing it.
13,Bree,excuse me?
1545,Bree,"oh. in that case,why don't you bring me another bottle of the pinot grigio?and please hurry."
1364,Bree,"'""unsavory items'?well,what does that mean?''"
3750,Bree,"well, you might have to. excuse me."
1808,Bree,"absolutely not.just give me an hour or two to straighten up andrew's room,and then you can bring your-- selves over."
3828,Bree,"well, i just wanted to get you together with tom here. i thought you two might hit it off."
1900,Bree,"oh, it's not for me, it's for danielle. that hair is going back to the color god intended."
3530,Bree,robustly.
676,Bree,that is obviously different.
638,Bree,"ida! ida greenberg,that is not your paper!"
1800,Bree,"there's so many things i wanna say to you,andrew.but mostly,i just want you to know how sorry i am."
3606,Bree,you do?
3912,Bree,is that the visitors' room?
433,Bree,you always say the nicest things.
2409,Bree,"yeah, but you weren't just trying to protect me, were you?"
3364,Bree,you need to leave now.
3825,Bree,it's orson.
697,Bree,"andrew, i need you to take out the trash."
3574,Bree,he helped you through a very difficult time. the least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate--what the hell is this?
3398,Bree,"i'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company."
2415,Bree,"make no mistake,our friendship is over."
1979,Bree,"oh you know, that warm sensation, that tingling feeling of relief when it's over.no, no, this was much--"
2785,Bree,you're leaving our bed?
1157,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna lay next to someone for eternity who thinks i'm a murderer, you're crazy. as far as i'm concerned, let him decompose with strangers."
2043,Bree,we'll talk in the car.
4106,Bree,"what? karl--if i have not been clear about how i feel about you, i apologize for any ambiguity. understand this--i detest you."
149,Bree,i shouldn't have lied to you about your father. you and your sister are old enough to handle the truth and i'm sorry.
2971,Bree,you are such a scamp.
360,Bree,"no, i don't."
2533,Bree,"no. no, i am not upset. i'm just confused as to why you seem so determined to get off on the wrong foot. first you bring a pie to lynette's, when i clearly assigned you the salad--"
2021,Bree,mm-mm.
984,Bree,"phyllis, there are people waiting, so--"
4054,Bree,charming.
3422,Bree,"my, that's a nice little terrace. we, we will throw you a party so special that you'll want us to cater your anniversary, too."
4116,Bree,andrew.
3790,Bree,of course it could just as easily be munchy cedarhurst.
2008,Bree,i can't talk to orson. it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding!
513,Bree,oh george! what - what a surprise!
2094,Bree,oh?
1717,Bree,are you sure? i was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes.
224,Bree,"oh, really. like what?"
1783,Bree,"your brother and i had a talk,and we've come to a detente of sorts."
3453,Bree,no.
101,Bree,"umm, i can tell them that you went to tennis camp. that was a joke."
1756,Bree,"peter,let me be your rock.taking care of people is what i do best.drink your milk."
2666,Bree,"oh, darn, i forgot the napkins."
2251,Bree,you cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood. it's filled with junkies and who*es.
3804,Bree,and admirable.
652,Bree,i have some money that i've been putting aside for emergencies. it can be all yours if you just--
2565,Bree,"well, i was hoping that you could use these last few weeks for reflection and personal growth."
3075,Bree,"well, good, when they drop by for their inspection, i'll just have to have a nice little chat with them, too."
2928,Bree,"well, typically, we sit there and let the preacher preach, and eventually, our questions are answered, and no one is humiliated."
334,Bree,lynette? honey?
2895,Bree,susan.
1389,Bree,what kind of friend is he?
4028,Bree,"uh, yes. as i recall, it's quite valuable."
721,Bree,"well, i don't understand why."
3244,Bree,i would be happy to. i just want to make sure it's the kind you like.
337,Bree,i used to get so upset when andrew and danielle were little. i used their nap times to cry.
983,Bree,"come on, phyllis. let's get you something to eat."
2991,Bree,"katherine, darling, are you okay?"
2108,Bree,"yes, i know. she's my daughter. my 17-year-old daughter."
447,Bree,"oh, my, they're exquisite. compost and eggshells?"
760,Bree,"well, he was right. i'll be waiting in the car."
2722,Bree,"he's perfect. he's, um, he's all cleaned up now, if-- if you want to hold him."
3312,Bree,"girls, you are making way too much of this. i am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you. excuse me."
289,Bree,"oh, i'm throwing you out. i've separated all your things into two sides. one side is yours, danielle, and the other one is andrews."
689,Bree,"""well, you have to admit that's an efficient way to teach respect for boundaries. okay, how about this one. it's perfect for andrew. it's a ranch in montana. it has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces and daily classes in anger management."" "
2072,Bree,"well, of course not. what is it?"
3497,Bree,meaning susan is your oldest friend on this street.
1334,Bree,"don't lie to me, george. you've been riding up and down this street for the last hour."
1711,Bree,"you know,it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.i mean--but it happens every day,doesn't it?"
2822,Bree,"good, because i already--told him."
1573,Bree,"because what happened was,i accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with,you know, a little glass of wine i was having, and i-i fell asleep, you know,while i was--watching her kids.i mean,i like a little wine with dinner,i mean,now and then. you know,who doesn't?but,uh,i mean,you know, to trash my entire reputation--"
1071,Bree,i think the machine picked up on something that i wasn't aware of.
561,Bree,"i do want to forgive him doctor goldfine, but, there's something he's still not telling me."
1180,Bree,i don't believe him. he is so brazen.
3788,Bree,"orson, i'm preparing a buffet for 200. i don't have time to explore my hypothetical career in the adult film industry."
1877,Bree,why would you assume that?
1095,Bree,i can't believe how well those two are getting along.
1648,Bree,so-- how long has it been since you--
2786,Bree,"oh, thank you."
1833,Bree,"sweetheart,this is your special day.all of your candless should be lit.it'll just take me two seconds."
3233,Bree,"and waste valuable airtime? the show was about my cookbook, not about my tortured marital history."
2992,Bree,"oh, no. no, dear. just you. maybe you should go home."
226,Bree,and what would this sexual surrogate person do?
73,Bree,lynette!
518,Bree,i don't think you're pathetic. it's just that--i can't.
2,Bree,"it was no trouble at all. now the basket with the red ribbon is just for you and zachary. it's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things."
1063,Bree,it's the quickest way to prove to the police that they're wrong.
2688,Bree,"you are due in three weeks. until then, no windows and no parties."
3175,Bree,"look, i'm sorry. i didn't know a photo shoot would take this long. i mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?"
1297,Bree,"yes, it is. to have a complete stranger come into my home, drink my tea, and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men i have ever known."
368,Bree,"yes, i am."
187,Bree,"most of my family went to the hospital, but i stayed home because i was so young.when i looked out the window i saw all my mother's blood on the street and nobody was doing anything about it. so i got a hose and i washed it off. and once it was clean, i felt so much better."
1232,Bree,okay.
1651,Bree,see?i think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
2505,Bree,"so what did julie say, exactly?"
2962,Bree,this is not my pie.
1,Bree,"paul, zachary."
3392,Bree,i don't know if i can make it this time.
498,Bree,"well, we sure have had some fun."
3265,Bree,"um-- let me be clear. i do no want him calling me ""bree."""
1129,Bree,"you know, mostly i'm annoyed that the whole thing happened in the first place. i mean how in the world can anyone accuse me of murder?"
493,Bree,"i can't accept this, george! this is an antique. it's too valuable."
2998,Bree,"ever since i started working with that obnoxious backstabber, she's done nothing but try to take the spotlight off of me and put it onto her."
1873,Bree,and seriously-- i am not like these other people.
2949,Bree,"well, yes."
2436,Bree,what?
1194,Bree,"please. i mean, clearly, you didn't come here to shop."
1060,Bree,"well, that's why i took the polygraph, to prove to them that i was innocent."
409,Bree,"i see."" ""you know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband. if i told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again."
1882,Bree,what do you mean?
2484,Bree,surely not over food.
2549,Bree,"i'm getting good at props. no,no."
3792,Bree,"well, i didn't really have a favorite. i loved them all equally."
2626,Bree,he wasn't banished.
3313,Bree,"what is it, andrew?"
630,Bree,really?
1794,Bree,"well,i guess that's important,so--"
2590,Bree,it's the only thing she asked for.
3616,Bree,"oh, alex mentioned that you were laid off from your job. i'm so sorry."
4029,Bree,"oh, god, no. that's orson's dental innovator of the year award. i've always hated that thing. oh, here."
3226,Bree,"well, i think a lot of people miss the way life used to be--back when women had more time to cook. it's always been important to me to have the family gather around the table every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals."
2578,Bree,itch. itch.
648,Bree,"hello, maisy."
3603,Bree,"no, no, no. this can't possibly be true. the man is a doctor. are you sure?"
2310,Bree,"well, first you pack up your things and come home, and then we toss your mother out on her evil ass."
251,Bree,i'm repairing a chipped mug.
2535,Bree,just--give me the recipe!
2520,Bree,"it's true. everyone thought so. even me. oh, and that simple green salad--mache and baby arugula with duck confit and candied walnuts!"
1235,Bree,"that's why i wanted to talk to you. i mean, part of me just keeps thinking maybe i should just do it."
530,Bree,"you know what? at our next settlement talks, i plan on asking for your golf clubs!"
2150,Bree,it's a souffl. and timing is everything.
38,Bree,good. i have a question for you.
2585,Bree,i can't wait that long. i have to be with her.
572,Bree,"well, it's just that i know that i don't please you sexually, so i was wondering if you really were looking forward to being with me."
220,Bree,"oh, hey there, you two!"
2462,Bree,that would be lovely.
1020,Bree,"oh, my god. what happened?"
1371,Bree,"well, we'll never know."
2267,Bree,"okay, look, i know you're upset, but don't blame orson. it's not his fault."
2402,Bree,sexually. she had sex with you.
1591,Bree,and what might that be?
632,Bree,"oh, are you going steady?"
424,Bree,you wouldn't be saying that if you knew what -
1137,Bree,"yes. this is rex. i, i want to thank you again for what you did. it was so refreshing to be treated with kindness after weeks of just ludicrous accusations."
1482,Bree,"danielle, that's ridiculous,sweetheart."
1644,Bree,i was just giving you a little kiss.
509,Bree,"hey. hi, george. i'm so sorry you lost your toe. the doctor said it's your middle one so your balance shouldn't be affected. i mean, this really won't change your life one little bit. please say something."
1836,Bree,"somebody ruined your cake,and i wanna know who could be that thoughtless."
3483,Bree,ha. you got the tape!
2702,Bree,"cher, the beloved pop diva."
2383,Bree,what's a garden without a snake?
3887,Bree,"oh, andrew. i didn't hear you come in."
201,Bree,"hello,zachery. are you free for dinner tonight?"
595,Bree,"you promised the cheating had stopped, rex. you promised."
3913,Bree,"you don't happen to have a private room, do you?"
4118,Bree,"andrew, honey, hurry up. dinner's ready."
3950,Bree,do you at least know why he steals?
2325,Bree,"actually,there is. i'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend. there are some friends that i'm just dying for you to meet."
2729,Bree,"oh, she adores him. she just felt terrible that she had to leave for school so soon."
2088,Bree,"yes. yes, we do."
2725,Bree,"okay, baby. it's okay, little one. here we are. here we go. yes, here we go."
3326,Bree,looks like somebody's job interview went well.
267,Bree,this was the johnson boy?
2221,Bree,and how do you disappoint him?
1775,Bree,we ask god to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change--
2891,Bree,"well, say no more. one slice coming right up."
2937,Bree,"you don't say that. i've--i've never heard you say that, not once."
2186,Bree,"all right, i accept your explanation. i just wish there were fewer things for you to explain. by the way, to remove a red wine stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it."
3826,Bree,"oh, that's them. wait till you meet tom. you'll be so glad you had that tape recorder. he's just bursting with ideas."
3649,Bree,"oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do."
3376,Bree,"um, actually, dear--"
2245,Bree,i have done everything i can to make you happy and comfortable. what do you want from us?
2912,Bree,"i am sorry, but i have to make sure that he doesn't let her chair that committee."
3350,Bree,me? snoring?
2823,Bree,last week. i was afraid that mike might go to orson for pills.
2759,Bree,"i would love that, but my husband orson --big, stubborn, goy. he says we should do nothing and let the child decide when he's grown. we don't pick our parents-- we should pick our religion?"
399,Bree,"sure! why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?"
1881,Bree,"oh, they're fine.andrew is backpacking through europe, and danielle is away at cheerleading camp."
2067,Bree,mr. faladi.
1604,Bree,"my name is bree,and i am an alcoholic."
3456,Bree,you don't feel you've been underpaid?
3937,Bree,i don't know. can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
4056,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed."
704,Bree,"i don't know. i mean, maybe it's part of the ritual."
1229,Bree,"see, i thought we were going to a yard sale."
2331,Bree,"i'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but i don't want to introduce you until all my guests are here."
2328,Bree,would you join orson and me for dinner tomorrow night?
2181,Bree,"no, it's the police report from the night you beat your first wife. i'm still working on the menu."
1941,Bree,that is so adorable but i don't think i can eat another bite.
3373,Bree,who?
2412,Bree,"i don't care if you go to jail. you have done a horrible thing, and you have to make it right. i mean it, orson. if you don't fix this, i will."
2889,Bree,bless you.
2594,Bree,"okay. um--i haven't told anybody this, but--it's, uh, about the baby. there have been some complications."
2454,Bree,did you find him?
443,Bree,"rex, i don't want to say anything that might upset you. the doctor says any undue stress could cause another heart attack."
416,Bree,i know you still love me. maisy told me.
2434,Bree,your mother--she tried to kill me.
1041,Bree,"well, apparently, i'm a suspect. well, they always look at spouses first. it has something to with statistics. it's just a formality. i'll be cleared in no time. would you two please stop looking at me like that? obviously, i did not kill your father. i loved him deeply."
79,Bree,"well, given that we're hosting it, i say so. by the way, you won't be drinking at this party."
1952,Bree,"i know it's quick but it's just feel so right.orson is just the most warm, wonderful, generous man."
3368,Bree,but that doesn't mean i look down on you.
3870,Bree,what were you doing at bob and lee's?
3119,Bree,"oh, reverend green, please don't be upset."
1307,Bree,"that's true, in the beginning."
72,Bree,works for me. should we all make something?
1809,Bree,i think it's gonna be a kick having susan and julie stay with us.it'll be like living in a sorority.we'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores.doesn't that sound like fun?
3774,Bree,thank you for having us over. we are so honored to be the first guests in your new home.
529,Bree,hardly? how about never!
3464,Bree,"oh. ""the new christian reader"" just published an advance review of my cookbook. listen! ""mrs. van de kamp's colorful stories of her upbringing show her upstanding values, but her recipes are sinfully delicious."" they gave me four halos!"
439,Bree,"oh, him. well, we're separated."
2599,Bree,dead?
2969,Bree,good morning. what's going on?
3662,Bree,do--do what?
895,Bree,you heard that?
1924,Bree,"danielle, i don't know what you're planning, but i need to talk to you right now."
3531,Bree,"well, if it's so simple, what are we waiting for?"
3406,Bree,i don't recall ever hearing that name before.
668,Bree,"rex. if you walk out of this restaurant, i will scream."
2812,Bree,"i just don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did two years ago."
3819,Bree,great. i'll call bruce this afternoon.
1528,Bree,thank you.that's very sweet.so where have you been living this whole time? upstairs?
2126,Bree,"orson's right. we need to support each other as a family. in fact, i say we all go for counseling."
2330,Bree,"oh, susan, you know, i feel exactly--"
3543,Bree,i didn't think it was my place. i thought katherine should tell you.
3864,Bree,"why are you, uh, calling juanita?"
3936,Bree,i think we're here.
3131,Bree,hi! we were just talking about you.
308,Bree,i remember telling them when they were babies that they weren't allowed to get any bigger because they were so adorable. and we were so happy.
3136,Bree,"so after the ceremony, we'll open up the buffet--"
4048,Bree,"and i'm thinking i may have acted rashly. i mean, every marriage has its rough patches. orson loves me, and deep down, he's a good man. if i stick with this, maybe we can make it work. are you even listening to me?"
853,Bree,"what do you think, rex? i chose green so that it will work whether gabrielle has a boy or a girl."
844,Bree,edie! hi.
3762,Bree,"fine. i'll reimburse you, if that'll make things right."
436,Bree,so i hear.
3951,Bree,really? that soon?
2333,Bree,and orson didn't kill you.
2510,Bree,"will not be needed. as i said, i always bring dessert."
3288,Bree,"no, um, you take benjy upstairs. i'll get it. orson, could you get the mop, please?"
1085,Bree,andrew! you are not leaving the house dressed like that.
3318,Bree,what kind of meeting is it?
1462,Bree,"oh,oh,i'm fine.i just,um,had a flat tire."
2080,Bree,please don't cut into that pie. i made it for mike.
3741,Bree,"oh, that sounds lovely."
3438,Bree,are you telling me that i set katherine up with a convicted graverobber?!
2986,Bree,no! that's--that's my job. i always do it.
2870,Bree,walter's gay?
3869,Bree,orson? orson! orson! orson! orson! no!
2605,Bree,"no, it's for danielle. there you are. thank you."
3203,Bree,"danielle, we agreed i would raise him. we agreed it would be best!"
4003,Bree,so?
1407,Bree,i shouldn't have said anything.
928,Bree,"it doesn't matter. from here on in, can we just say that we're even?"
1503,Bree,"um, about that-- um--"
3701,Bree,"mine is so erratic. i'm not even sure what the real temperature is. of course, if a certain doctor would loosen the purse strings--"
2174,Bree,"well, somebody just bought her old house. maybe that triggered something."
3209,Bree,"well, you knew what the book was gonna be called."
2422,Bree,for what?
3867,Bree,"gaby! aren't you being a little harsh? i mean, perhaps she didn't take it."
848,Bree,you've got the wrong idea. that man is my pharmacist!
3381,Bree,"careful, dear. you don't want to be ill tomorrow."
3892,Bree,it was my idea. my work has been compromising my marriage. i didn't realize the toll it's been taking on orson.
239,Bree,"of course, that's fine. shall i include the meal?"
4129,Bree,"oh, my--"
2382,Bree,"well, we have to do something."
1857,Bree,"hello. i'm bree van de kamp, your new neighbor.is this your frog?"
806,Bree,he does not seem desperate to me.
716,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessy.
875,Bree,"well, you shouldn't be doing that. in case you've forgotten i'm married."
419,Bree,"i'm here to see rex van de kamp.apparently, he had a heart attack."
1901,Bree,"oh, i will tie her down if necessary.i'm also thinking of checking her body for piercings while i'm at it."
2212,Bree,"but if she's only thirty minutes away, why haven't you been visiting her?"
1169,Bree,what is it?
119,Bree,can i come in?
2066,Bree,we'll need a name for this drama camp.
2584,Bree,"oh, my god."
3445,Bree,"well, if he tries, just promise you'll call."
1586,Bree,"oh,okay.are you a friend of andrew's?"
1825,Bree,"oh, susan,did i wake you?"
3367,Bree,you have nothing to be jealous of.
3911,Bree,"um, i ran into her once, unexpectedly--in a place i never thought i'd be."
18,Bree,"andrew, danielle, napkins?"
2642,Bree,then why did he always avoid you? why were you barely ever here?
574,Bree,you had an affair. you went to another woman for sex to give you something i couldn't. at least have the decency to tell me what that something is.
2479,Bree,there's no need.the baby's just not kicking right now.
435,Bree,"oh yes, he'll, he'll live. but the doctor said he's at risk for something called pericarditis. do you know anything about that?"
3492,Bree,"yes, in the, uh, test kitchen."
3544,Bree,i'm sorry.
620,Bree,john rowland? i thought you broke up with him.
2521,Bree,"i have been here for hours trying to replicate her recipe, and nothing has even come close!"
2976,Bree,"well, they're certainly--assertive. my only fear is--"
198,Bree,"and tell them what? we don't even have the note anymore, we gave it to paul."
2662,Bree,then why would she want the child?
1368,Bree,"oh, hold it. what are you gonna do with that?"
1226,Bree,"uh, i do, i really do."
2040,Bree,he didn't run away.i kicked him out.
2789,Bree,"so, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, uh, issues for you?"
3618,Bree,thank you again for making the long drive down from oakdale. it's high time our families got together.
2413,Bree,"no, you're not."
1875,Bree,"you, too?"
1501,Bree,what are you talking about?
3783,Bree,i'm not discussing andrew's salary with you. it's none of your business.
712,Bree,"honey, it's going to be okay, i promise."
1985,Bree,"orson, what is she talking about?"
584,Bree,fine.
3967,Bree,"i'm surprised. i knew she was a bit dotty, but didn't think it was that serious."
3876,Bree,"this isn't my problem, dr. bernstein. he's the sick one. fix him."
1337,Bree,all ready?
1829,Bree,"well,i just keep messing it up.i don't know what's wrong with me."
17,Bree,"rex. seeing as you're the head of this household, i would really appreciate you saying something."
3110,Bree,"now, now. we mustn't play favorites, although i will take that as a compliment."
1001,Bree,"um, i'm all right."
3304,Bree,mmm. oh. mmm. you have a good day.
423,Bree,andrew!
4007,Bree,"well, hello there, m.j. i was baking this morning, and like an idiot, i made too many macaroons. would you be willing to take one? i would hate to see them go to waste."
1964,Bree,you don't have to wash those.i already did them.
2491,Bree,yes.
2239,Bree,why? what could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?
3715,Bree,"i can't believe you saved this. of course, i'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook right now."
1734,Bree,"oh, your a.a. sponsor?"
1950,Bree,"oh, all right.i wanted to wait and make a proper announcement, but--"
2367,Bree,"oh, you're a good husband."
1727,Bree,"well,actually they can.i mean,it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.i know it doesn't seem fair,but--"
1893,Bree,because my daughter is in danger.
3293,Bree,"well, i've apologized till i'm blue in the face, but they're still leaving in the morning. now you're not speaking to me, either? they're just mad. things will be better next time."
1047,Bree,yes.
219,Bree,"i must say, i'm jealous of how much time you two spend together. my mother-in-law would never want to hang out with me all day."
2801,Bree,you're moving out? but you can't afford an apartment.
4021,Bree,i was kidding!
3733,Bree,"then it's not a loan, it's a gift. don't you have a birthday coming up?"
1197,Bree,okay.
4035,Bree,must you be so crude?
1394,Bree,"yeah, but to be fair to lynette, you are an ex-model.and surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands."
3637,Bree,"who, undoubtedly, already have doctors, just like your patients in fairview have you."
745,Bree,i never said i was perfect.
358,Bree,"charming. what i was wondering was if you've bothered to spend any time reflecting on the reasons that you've been grounded, and all the pain that you've caused the solis family."
27,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that. i told you, mrs. huber came over and i got distracted. it was a mistake."
2753,Bree,"susan, addicts are experts at deception. my advice to you--trust--but verify."
2813,Bree,you forgive me?
1887,Bree,"i don't need that much help, because i am not like your other patients."
1931,Bree,if that's what it takes-- to get my daughter--
1830,Bree,it just keeps coming out too thick.
3908,Bree,wow. it sounds like she gave you just what you needed. good for edie.
332,Bree,"there's lynette's car, she's gotta be close."
514,Bree,and-?
4122,Bree,oh my god. you're bleeding
3588,Bree,"well, i just want you boys to know that i am comfortable with your lifestyle. now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?"
1614,Bree,exactly.
2727,Bree,"shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
968,Bree,"well, then why did you say those things to me?"
1847,Bree,i take it you heard what happened.
2782,Bree,"i was going to say angry, and perhaps that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery. i'm just trying to learn from my mistakes."
3139,Bree,"uh, why don't i let you two work this out?"
2503,Bree,no more secrets.
1252,Bree,"it's not just that, george. dr. goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and i'm starting to think he's right."
1958,Bree,ummm.ummm.i thought we--orson?
3516,Bree,why were you talking to that woman?
1259,Bree,do you actually think they're gonna make fun of you?
364,Bree,it's the container you'll be urinating into.
1113,Bree,"george, what are you doing here?"
430,Bree,and why do you think that?
505,Bree,"oh, i was making macaroons before i left the house."
1310,Bree,"i don't think so. but thank you, though."
1388,Bree,george paid for what he did to your father.
667,Bree,"well, you should have thought of that before you left a personal check on maisy gibbons' nightstand."
3403,Bree,i hope you didn't mean what you said earlier. you just don't understand what i owe to katherine.
2137,Bree,"oh, mr. faladi, i'm not here to threaten you. i've come to give you my blessing."
1772,Bree,"if i hadn't been in the house,he could've raped her--or worse."
2360,Bree,don't i wish.
1824,Bree,"honey, i can't possibly put it in the garbage as is."
913,Bree,i never leave the house with an unmade bed. you know that.
2825,Bree,"katherine, are you all right? i- i couldn't help noticing-"
1721,Bree,"oh,dad,i-i forgot to warn you.these are some of andrew's adult videos.i don't approve,but boys will be boys."
1127,Bree,"detective barton, you are clearly a gentleman."
3758,Bree,now? people are waiting.
567,Bree,and the dinner parties. don't forget the dinner parties.
3861,Bree,close enough.
3388,Bree,"when orson left, i--began having a glass of white wine now and then. then when danielle took benjamin, i didn't see any reason to stop at just one."
123,Bree,"andrew, don't change the subject."
1917,Bree,"well, i'm glad that you're having fun."
3269,Bree,would it be more acceptable if i shopped for a suicidal pork loin?
2705,Bree,"let's go get some cake, dear."
2820,Bree,here. i brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
964,Bree,"i am not kidding. i will go nondenominational so fast, it will make your head spin."
2790,Bree,"apparently, ""not to pry"" wasn't necessary."
3556,Bree,i'm so thirsty.
1372,Bree,that's andrew back from camp hennessey. i've got to go.
4012,Bree,"m.j., there's someone in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single day. and you are the only one who can help me. please, please invite evan to your party."
3787,Bree,what's that?
2418,Bree,"andrew, you're here. what happened to me?"
21,Bree,um. think i'll go get your salad for you.
671,Bree,"gabrielle, is everything okay?"
2764,Bree,orson.
2432,Bree,i'm so sleepy.
1526,Bree,"yes.your mother told me all about you and i thought it it might be nice if, um,we had a little visit.i brought you some homemade cobbler."
2794,Bree,bye.
986,Bree,my electrician? why were you on the phone sobbing to my electrician?
4022,Bree,"well, i just never know with you. and don't call me ""freckles."""
2280,Bree,i don't think that's any of your concern.
1838,Bree,you!
2655,Bree,"well, good. you can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent."
1377,Bree,"andrew, george williams fooled a lot of people."
1045,Bree,i would like to submit myself to a lie detector test to eliminate any uncertainty about what happened with my husband.
1244,Bree,"if you'll excuse me, i, uh, i have to go."
3665,Bree,but?
153,Bree,yeah?
3454,Bree,"you are a vibrant, attractive woman, you--"
1583,Bree,"you know,on second thought, i won't be driving you to school.the walk will do you good."
866,Bree,hurry up. there're people waiting.
1248,Bree,"no. dr. goldfine, my therapist."
3681,Bree,orson burnt the steaks.
1655,Bree,"uh,sure. help yourself.there's also frosted glasses in the freezer."
2416,Bree,"she raped you,and your mother helped."
2065,Bree,"well, that would certainly spare the family some embarrassment. why not throw in a killing spree, too?"
9,Bree,are you ok?
2255,Bree,is anything broken?
2574,Bree,"edie, is that an engagement ring?"
2811,Bree,"oh, andrew."
1738,Bree,"no, he did not say."
1272,Bree,"well, maybe susan, lynette, and i have had a good influence on you."
647,Bree,"yes, yes, they were. i fold."
1132,Bree,thank you. you don't know how much this means to me. i've realized looking back that i was still in shock during rex's first funeral. i don't think it had quite hit me yet what had happened so that's why this small ceremony means so much to me. because i realize now that this is the last chance i'm gonna have to say goodbye.
3685,Bree,i tried. he won't listen to me.
1716,Bree,"oh,by the way,while i was there, i saw your,uh,your housekeeper.xiao-mei?"
321,Bree,thank you so much.
3559,Bree,"enough coffee. it's not working, anyway. it must be decaf."
3983,Bree,"my husband is a decent man, and i want to do right by him."
3537,Bree,very routine and--and practically outpatient.
83,Bree,"my backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve."
1273,Bree,"come on. when i finish up here, i will come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that."
326,Bree,"honey, you put a woman into a coma. surely that arouses some kind of emotion!"
2898,Bree,"walter, wait!"
2766,Bree,of course not.
770,Bree,it's for his own good. you'll see.
579,Bree,what the hell did your mother do to you?
1933,Bree,#name?
182,Bree,"zach,do you have any plans for dinner?"
1908,Bree,"well, i'm only supposed to be restrained until 7.you see, i have a problem with sleepwalking.they just tie me up so that i don't wander off and hurt myself."
3103,Bree,"maybe not. we call gabrielle ""gaby."" i mean, perhaps there's a shortened version of ""maynard"" you could live with."
353,Bree,lynette--
831,Bree,who says he has to know how i spend my free time?
3692,Bree,"what does that mean, ""an entrance""?"
1673,Bree,"well,i just really feel likei'm jeopardizing my recovery by switching--"
2817,Bree,you're leaving fairview?
1484,Bree,all i ever wanted was for you to be happy.
266,Bree,"god, i couldn't wait to get rid of them! so, lynette said that you found zack."
2972,Bree,"you know, susan, sometimes i climb into a warm bath with a romance novel. just a thought."
1811,Bree,"you know what? maybe andrew leaving will be good for us.you are all i have left,and i am gonna be the best mother that i can be."
2478,Bree,"well,hello,mrs.mckeever."
3818,Bree,"i tell you what. i will invite bruce over for dinner, you and tom can join us, and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview."
3393,Bree,you would do that?
1633,Bree,"on second thought,i will have another glass of wine.you can leave the bottle."
2835,Bree,"okay. this has been-- lovely. we really should, um, do it again sometime."
1250,Bree,"well, for starters, he knows the last thing i'd ever want to do is have more children."
408,Bree,and have you fulfilled those needs?
129,Bree,you know it's leaking.
585,Bree,so? was it good for you too?
2339,Bree,"oh, about that apology--any time you're ready."
1852,Bree,"andrew, didn't run away.i, dropped him off in the middle of nowhere,told him that i couldn't be around him anymore,and then--i drove off.so i just need a little time to forget what i've done,and then i can sleep again."
2737,Bree,"so, susan , you mentioned something about bringing dessert. what is it?"
793,Bree,"thank you for a wonderful service, reverend."
2657,Bree,"""emotionally unavailable."" gosh, i wonder where she picked up that little phrase."
1571,Bree,"i'm really well.um,i just saw you all talking before lynette went off to work.what were you all talking about?"
3208,Bree,"thank you, dear. orson, what do you think?"
2959,Bree,"and it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance, and--i'm sorry that i wasn't there for you. i want you to have faith in me and our friendship."
2529,Bree,excuse me?
1719,Bree,"all right,here we go.this is the last of andrew's things.once we tape up these boxes,we can start loading the car."
1054,Bree,what?
3949,Bree,perceptive.
1681,Bree,"hi. um,i need some advice from a professional.i'd like to get stinking drunk.do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?"
3553,Bree,since when have you become such an expert on chamomile?
1025,Bree,suspicious?
3694,Bree,"and then there's church, of course."
2746,Bree,what's that supposed to mean? you don't trust me?
878,Bree,"george, i do love you as a friend. i wish you could love me the same way back, but since you can't, goodbye."
4089,Bree,"filing a false insurance claim. he's the one who filed it, but he's gonna say that i told him to."
3962,Bree,"hello, my love."
1874,Bree,"well, that was-- very sweet."
3106,Bree,"i didn't know she left you. yes, for our korean grocer. i'll tell you, sometimes this merciful god of ours has one sick sense of humor."
975,Bree,you look magnificent.
2230,Bree,okay! maybe i will share my secret ingredient.
2053,Bree,"andrew, you have every right to be angry with me, but if you knew how sorry i am--"
3764,Bree,caught a couple of breaks? i've worked my ass off to get where i am.
301,Bree,"it has to be, i don't want gabrielle and carlos coming home to this ugly reminder in front of their house."
1073,Bree,exactly. i hope you don't mind.
1493,Bree,do you remember the man they arrested--the one that broke into gabrielle's and escaped from the mental hospital?he's there.i saw him in their window.they're hiding him.
2027,Bree,i'm fine. let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
2465,Bree,"oh,andrew,i'm having problems with my strap.could you help me?"
320,Bree,we should probably be going.
503,Bree,"okay. now when you're firing a semi-automatic, you want the web of your hand all the way up against the edge of the back strap."
3249,Bree,"okay, you can fix this. just explain you're going to a different party here at the club and that you got confused. mrs. downing never has to know."
3958,Bree,i did not raise you to be bitchy.
3210,Bree,"my company, which i formed when we were separated, is called mrs. van de kamp's catering. it's how i'm known."
515,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
1399,Bree,"i may not be able to control what you do outside of this home,but while you are under this roof,you will not mock my values.if you so much as smile at that boy,so help me, i will ship you off to camp hennessey and i will not pick you up again until you are 18.do i make myself clear?"
434,Bree,"listen, i have a prescription here for rex. i don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack."
1579,Bree,"well,then i suggest you get a job."
1831,Bree,"people care about details.someday when danielle looks back,i want her to remember just how perfect her cake looked and how hard her mother worked to make her happy.this cake is a symbolof my love."
2034,Bree,"orson! my child is in trouble.don't make me choose between the two of you because believe me you will lose! now please, get your ass in gear!"
2978,Bree,who put pear slices in the waldorf salad?
1807,Bree,i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
2593,Bree,it's not about you. i've just been going through some things.
3680,Bree,"if by ""strings,"" you mean i won't let you be rude to me in my own house, then yes."
427,Bree,your adultery? no. i decided to keep that little gem all to myself.
2001,Bree,"well, i don't pay attention to gossip."
3897,Bree,"just give me one year. that's not asking too much, is it?"
2466,Bree,"oh,for heaven's sakes.orson,could you come help me,please?i'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants."
2332,Bree,"by the way, when my friends ask you what happened--and they will--i don't think it's necessary to go into all that unpleasantness about orson and monique. all they need to know is that you're back and we're on good terms."
3085,Bree,"i told them everything, edie, about orson, benjamin, everything."
2961,Bree,"well, if you ever wanna try us again--"
2136,Bree,hello.
829,Bree,"well, that's not his choice to make."
2955,Bree,"hey, lynette."
3185,Bree,excuse me?
3501,Bree,"all right, then, we'll see you soon."
592,Bree,hmm. how about palestine?
563,Bree,"once, and you should've seen the look in his eyes. he was terrified that i'll figure it out. you know what it is, don't you?"
110,Bree,8 o'clock. sorry to interrupt. bye.
785,Bree,"andrew, come here, i want you to see this."
3115,Bree,no!
1413,Bree,"okay, first of all, i want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house."
2592,Bree,i am so sorry that i snapped at you tonight.
3478,Bree,"we need to, um, get that tape back."
1174,Bree,"yes, it was the strangest thing. and so inconvenient. to be honest, i think we were about the make love for the first time."
3442,Bree,"oh, my god. you slept with him?"
1687,Bree,"dad,you don't understand.this has gotten really ugly."
1049,Bree,yes.
851,Bree,excuse me?
623,Bree,"honey, i am looking out for your happiness. now, i understand what it's like to be young and feel urges, but i waited until i got married, as did your father, and it was so much better."
1321,Bree,"no. george, i don't want to."
1746,Bree,"not yet.you obviously have an encyclopedic grasp of everything deaved.but clearly, you don't have the slightest idea about the power of a loving relationship."
2777,Bree,"oh, hello, dear. andrew, get orson's plate from the oven."
2457,Bree,off the hook? that doesn't even make sense.
469,Bree,no. that his father's only human.
477,Bree,sorry i can't invite you in for coffee.
1035,Bree,"i'm not refusing anything. all i'm saying is stay away from phyllis. she's a, she's a raving loon."
640,Bree,still? did you talk to him about that?
3375,Bree,aren't you dapper?
2151,Bree,"well, orson tells me that the two of you were very close, and out of respect for that friendship, i'm all ears."
1011,Bree,"i do. i'm just, i'm just not ready yet. but it was very sweet of you to think of me."
2236,Bree,"gloria, stop!"
418,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
1309,Bree,"no, no, i'm just tired, that's all."
3105,Bree,"i did, but, um, i'm afraid it hasn't worked out. it's been rough."
3306,Bree,"isn't this nice? they're running it next month in ""woman's day."""
1292,Bree,"uh, yes, i am."
1126,Bree,"yes, and i'm sure you will bury him with all the dignity of a dead hamster. no, i want rex released to me and i will make all the arrangements."
1247,Bree,and i'm not the only one who thinks that. other people have said the same thing.
691,Bree,"it's easy for you, isn't it? you're not the one he's openly rude to. you're not the one he challenges every day. you're not the one he hates."
3479,Bree,"$2,000?!"
2035,Bree,so you can't tell me anything about my son's whereabouts?
2878,Bree,puff pastry?
2935,Bree,"oh, is that happening now? i'd forgotten all about it."
3706,Bree,"i want a new stove, rex, and if i need to get a job to pay for it, so be it."
1128,Bree,"well, i have some good news. the police are finally releasing rex's body."
3748,Bree,my food? what are you talking about?
1432,Bree,"oh,hi."
910,Bree,"um, all right. you, uh, go downstairs and i will be, i'll be right there."
3010,Bree,no. never.
718,Bree,"rex, i'm not going and that's all there is to it."
1213,Bree,mmm.
3921,Bree,i wanted to see you.
1726,Bree,"uh,yeah,they wrote you a letter.it seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um,upset them."
862,Bree,"okay, okay, i'll be good."
3365,Bree,hi.
1477,Bree,"danielle, question?is there a black man hiding under your bed?"
2894,Bree,"exactly, and now, um, his tastes have gone to the more mature, cultured types, like, uh, walter here."
1185,Bree,"well, great. um, how would you feel about the two of us checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow?"
1840,Bree,"it's just a cake, for god sakes.will you please just cut it?"
1201,Bree,what's wrong?
2900,Bree,leave us.
2580,Bree,no talking.
1932,Bree,--to see who you really are--
1475,Bree,"oh, while i'm here i might as well grab some of your laundry."
674,Bree,"are you and carlos having some sort of money trouble? gabby, it's okay if you are."
1804,Bree,i have to.i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
3268,Bree,oh. well-- since when?
3225,Bree,"hi, linda."
1268,Bree,"honey, it's open. come on in."
985,Bree,who was that?
1077,Bree,"you know, we've been eating out a lot lately. why don't you come over friday for a home-cooked meal. wouldn't that be nice?"
2833,Bree,"well, they seem-- content."
297,Bree,"oh, andrew, i need your help, honey."
3058,Bree,"well, of course. is everything all right?"
925,Bree,"because it makes me think of my aunt fern. on the day we got married, i told her how happy i was, and she told me that even during bad times to always remember that the best was yet to come. and so as i polish it, i think about you and the kids and our life and how right she was."
2346,Bree,i told you that in confidence.
2925,Bree,"oh, so you're--coming to bible study."
3980,Bree,orson's lying to me again. so i think i have to divorce him.
4067,Bree,so you wait for an opportunity that you can use to your advantage while at the same time appearing supportive.
2586,Bree,something's come up. we'll talk tomorrow.
1930,Bree,"danielle!i'm serious, go."
3104,Bree,"they'll love that. this is gonna be the best seniors' brunch ever. i'm so glad you're back. between you and me, reverend sykes tended to pander to the congregation's progressive element. i prefer your more muscular brand of christianity."
3688,Bree,"yes, i did."
2654,Bree,"cram it, phyllis."
4126,Bree,"i'll get back to you, uh, later."
2884,Bree,i'm just trying to stay out of the way of all those sparks that are flying.
2359,Bree,"don't worry, alma, i'm sure that, uh, edie can find you a house that won't give you nightmares."
2756,Bree,"i know it might seem tacky piggybacking on deborah's bris, but-- we could do it in the den very quietly."
1866,Bree,what?
460,Bree,"well, um--"
1396,Bree,get over here.now.
275,Bree,"but whatever problems your father and i have, it doesn't change the fact that we love you very, very much,"
148,Bree,i suppose i do owe you an apology.
1488,Bree,i wanted to talk to you about what happened the other day with the kids.
2755,Bree,"do you think, while you're here, do could do a bris for my baby, too?"
2254,Bree,are you all right?
4069,Bree,i want a divorce.
3419,Bree,yes. he said you were roommates back in college.
955,Bree,"phyllis, these are all things that happened to rex before he went to college."
3082,Bree,"there's something i've been--keeping from all of you, and, um--we need to talk."
1474,Bree,really? because i'm holding your backpack with all your schoolbooks.
4101,Bree,are you insane? your thug tried to strangle him.
3049,Bree,"well, um, just so you know, in the future, i'm not comfortable with that. this can't happen again."
1320,Bree,"george, would you please sit down? you're being rude."
48,Bree,what? i-i'm sorry.
1927,Bree,his mother told me what happened. it's true.
3761,Bree,"hey, you made me partner. i can change 15%, and i chose the parmesan. and i don't know if you've heard, but people are raving about my pizza."
3994,Bree,you don't say.
3875,Bree,"you'll see when he leaves, and your lamp is missing."
135,Bree,"no, he won't. just act normal."
342,Bree,"a woman is in a coma, because of andrew. and there he is, happy as a clam!"
3074,Bree,what on earth could you possibly want?
3907,Bree,i think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
2803,Bree,"is this about the other morning? oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious."
1891,Bree,you let go of me right now!
4026,Bree,we should probably break a window to make it look more real.
1131,Bree,"look, i know it's an imposition, but danielle is away on a class trip and andrew is back at camp hennessey for a little refresher course. well, it's just gonna be a very brief and, and dignified ceremony and i was hoping that you could say a few words and, um, i'm gonna read a poem."
86,Bree,"why? i'm your wife, you can say anything in front of me. all we need is a few more sessions, and i'm sure we can."
1254,Bree,i'll talk to dr. goldfine about it tomorrow.
1416,Bree,i didn't kill george.
3219,Bree,"oh, gaby, it's just one party. i'll save you some cake."
60,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that."
161,Bree,so you want me to lie?
2464,Bree,"yes,but the good news is she's gonna live."
2963,Bree,"oh, and, listen, bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
619,Bree,who were you planning on having sex with?
1171,Bree,"oh, i don't think so. i've made duck, l ate a thousand times."
1009,Bree,"i, i, i don't know how to bowl."
481,Bree,pick me up at one and we'll do something fun.
2407,Bree,"orson, your ex-wife is a homicidal rapist, and your mother is straight out of ""i, claudius."" why do you refuse to deal with them?"
3474,Bree,how could this be happening?
1481,Bree,"oh, honey,why would i want that?"
3624,Bree,"melina, this is childish!"
3003,Bree,"here's the thing you need to understand about me and my friends. we each have our niche. gabrielle's the glamorous one. susan's the adorable one. lynette's smart. edie's--edie. and i'm the domestic one, the organizer--the one who knows that there are three tines on a dessert fork. i'm the one who gets teased for that. that's who i am. and that's also who you are."
2640,Bree,you think i don't know i'm a failure as a parent? that's why this child means so much to me. it's my second chance.
113,Bree,gabby!!
3480,Bree,"okay, this is not a joke. my book comes out next month--my old-fashioned, traditional cookbook! this could ruin me!"
2179,Bree,"then again, he probably wants some time to unpack."
1473,Bree,"danielle?honey, are you in there?"
3035,Bree,there is one thing.
2676,Bree,that's a nice picture of rex.
2660,Bree,"i'm just so mad at myself. i should have realized that the maternal instinct is so strong, that even danielle would develop it."
2252,Bree,of course she likes it. there's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
3107,Bree,"oh, this is a bit awkward, but my soon-to-be ex just walked in. he's been following me everywhere."
933,Bree,oh?
3308,Bree,"thank you, katherine. i will never become stuck-up and full of myself."
94,Bree,"for what, zach?"
2860,Bree,"edie, if you say that to lynette, so help me god, i will wring your neck."
522,Bree,you can lean on me.
1899,Bree,"good, add that on."
1182,Bree,i think so.
612,Bree,"oh, uh, andrew, i'm gonna want you home by eleven on saturday."
3555,Bree,9:15? huh? 9:15. i'm supposed to be at the mall. did i forget to set the alarm?
379,Bree,i take it you've met maisy gibbons.
3201,Bree,"well, i think what gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again."
4045,Bree,"oh, that's right."
2314,Bree,i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing.
188,Bree,i've never told anyone that story before.
808,Bree,i don't remember that.
1121,Bree,andrew! andrew!
3634,Bree,hi! what have you two been up to?
1431,Bree,bye.
1984,Bree,"oh well, come on in.let's dry you off and get you a drink."
4024,Bree,what? no!
1518,Bree,"if the applewhites go to the police and tell them that your brother ran over mrs. solis,he could go to prison.how can you not understand that?"
2539,Bree,"yes, and it has nothing to do with pie."
843,Bree,"oh, it'll just take a second. i need to um, to get a recipe."
1101,Bree,"george, i can't allow you to discipline my child if you won't even tell me what he did."
3805,Bree,"my, what an interesting coat hanger. it's shaped like a sofa. please put it in the closet."
4037,Bree,"you wanna be a neanderthal, karl? that's your choice. i prefer to behave with class and dignity. now may we please finish robbing my home?"
6,Bree,"this is half the reason i joined the nra. well, when rex started going to those medical conferences, i wanted at the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home, with a loaded smith and wesson."
70,Bree,"lynette, these cards are sticky."
916,Bree,"um, he's stable, but, um, they have to put in a pacemaker, so they're gonna need to operate. how did you guys know?"
2064,Bree,"this is a family event, and we're all gonna enjoy it together. now, danielle, stop sniping and start thinking of an alibi for your brother."
693,Bree,"well, does it?"
3991,Bree,oh. who--who's that?
1754,Bree,because i can be very strong for those people that i really care about.
1040,Bree,"well, apparently, they want to do an autopsy. they don't think that he had a heart attack. they think that somebody was poisoning him."
1130,Bree,"anyway, i was hoping that you were all free friday morning because that's when i'll be hosting the re-burial."
2571,Bree,"oh, hi, gaby. katherine and i were just talking about the old days. so when you were living with your aunt, was dylan's father with you?"
2242,Bree,"mother hodge, your food will get cold!"
2218,Bree,"well, how can he feel that way? you're his mother."
2665,Bree,"you know, phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology."
3995,Bree,we--we should go.
2398,Bree,we have to do something.
677,Bree,"well, then, good luck on your remodel."
3879,Bree,"really? and--and yet he keeps charging me. so, doctor, what's this ""revelation"" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?"
660,Bree,"serena, hi. how are you?"
2566,Bree,"clearly, it would be time well spent."
470,Bree,"that's sweet, but i'm taking care of him because it's the right thing to do."
1305,Bree,"fluoxetine, one hundred milligrams. risperidone, two fifty milli-- i'm sorry. what is this?"
2087,Bree,"hello, vera. i made you some of those, uh, shortbread biscuits that you like so much."
995,Bree,people have said that?
280,Bree,wait a minute. what's all this about a modeling academy?
1685,Bree,it's a recent development. where's dad?
593,Bree,"so i guess we should, uh, get started. what do you want me to do?"
611,Bree,"you've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
728,Bree,if it were any other day.
2651,Bree,"hi. it's, uh, mrs. hodge. may i please speak with danielle?"
1981,Bree,"oh.well, i'll be darn."
4050,Bree,"so i'm just like everyone else, and you know everything i'm going to say."
115,Bree,dinner is on the table.
2130,Bree,"danielle, how can you think i don't care about your feelings?"
1455,Bree,started?
1290,Bree,"maybe, but why risk it?"
2531,Bree,"well, that, um, hardly seems neighborly. after all, i just gave you the recipe for my mincemeat pie."
1753,Bree,"well, if you were in trouble,i could handle it."
550,Bree,"why, what's wrong?"
738,Bree,"porter, i warned you."
3812,Bree,i'm sorry you have to go through this. it must be so hard.
1534,Bree,oh.
1426,Bree,"yeah, it seems obvious."
1042,Bree,"yes, we had issues, but i would never have hurt him."
747,Bree,i wanted to wear andrew's favourite colour. then i realised that i don't know what it is.
2396,Bree,were you expecting this?
1245,Bree,"i am taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and i'm going home."
4016,Bree,why not?
2439,Bree,"oh, i didn't."
3776,Bree,this is a delicious snack. did you make this?
383,Bree,i could ask you the same question.
1422,Bree,andrew?would you mind turning off your video game?my lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
1778,Bree,"honey,you've got to eat something."
3872,Bree,what are you hiding behind your back?
1478,Bree,"i just thought you should know that i came home to find your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed,and it just seems to me that--"
365,Bree,your son's urine.
3278,Bree,"oh! uh, a hot dog."
1999,Bree,don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
1051,Bree,what does that have to do with anything?
3267,Bree,excuse me?
589,Bree,"well, it's just that my aunt fern lives in philadelphia and i don't want to be thinking about her while i'm spanking you with a leather strap."
2153,Bree,that sounds lovely.
302,Bree,how is juanita doing?
215,Bree,"oh,well, okay. i'll see you tomorrow then."
1638,Bree,"i'm raising a monster,is what i'm raising.it's no wonder i drink.i don't know why i said that."
2430,Bree,so we're back to being friends?
3589,Bree,"well, orson and i thought it would be nice to share this special occasion with some dear friends."
1606,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
562,Bree,i think it has something to do with why he had the affair.
2076,Bree,i'll never forgive myself. it's all my fault for pushing him away.
1362,Bree,'those are my panties.how did you--''
3475,Bree,"before anything got serious, i made a point of turning the camera off."
1701,Bree,"do you really think that i am enjoying airing my dirty laundry in public?this whole situation is mortifying.but i can't back down because he is my son,and i need more time to get through to him."
3522,Bree,"spare me your ""darling,"" sandra. i know you've been trying to dig up dirt on me."
1763,Bree,what are you doing here?
269,Bree,is that relevant?
3186,Bree,"oh, don't be silly. i may have based a few on your recipes, but i always changed something."
526,Bree,i want to keep the club membership. rex is terrible at tennis. and he hates buffets.
3744,Bree,"oh, you can just put that on a hanger in the back. what i want is to make this an opportunity for you. we can turn one of your dismal thursday night seatings into a real event."
2572,Bree,"we, we certainly didn't mean to pry. let me just tinge that up for you."
2711,Bree,"danielle! we agreed to save that till the end of the night. the best part of the costume, and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking. orson! andrew!"
3295,Bree,and you think that's my fault?
3922,Bree,it isn't that kind of visit.
2933,Bree,benjamin doesn't love matisse. he loves purple. oh. please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual.
3993,Bree,but i thought you just split everything done the middle.
352,Bree,why?
466,Bree,i'm packing up your father's things for when he eventually moves out.
2778,Bree,all right. how was it?
145,Bree,"god only knows what she's had to deal with in her life-abject poverty,drugs, domestic violence. maybe even molestation."
1463,Bree,"you know,thank you,but i think it's actually something more mechanical.my car has been making just a terrible noise."
519,Bree,"oh, george, please don't go!"
3695,Bree,now that's how you make an entrance.
1699,Bree,really?and whose idea was that?
228,Bree,"oh. so she would be in the room with us, while we make love?"
3803,Bree,"you know, katherine, if you need any help, i would be happy to make my fam--"
3002,Bree,"i misunderstood the situation, that's all. can we just leave it at that?"
1937,Bree,how sweet and-- unexpected.do you wanna come in?
95,Bree,"hey, where've you been?"
132,Bree,i am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.
1679,Bree,"okay,peter,i just really--need us to be friends.when i'm with you,i'm not myself,which is a good thing."
42,Bree,you promised.
949,Bree,"mrs. applewhite, hi. i am bree van de kamp, and this is my daughter danielle."
3458,Bree,"you're more than ""like"" fired. you're fired. and, of course, we want our money back."
2191,Bree,okay. does the name monique mean anything to you?
158,Bree,"oh,please! i would have hosted it myself, only the kids are going away to the mountains tomorrow and there's camping equipment everywhere."
1625,Bree,with what?you don't have any money.
2403,Bree,your drink was laced with pills for--erectile dysfunction.
1523,Bree,caleb? is that you?
55,Bree,take off your coat.
2821,Bree,an educated guess.
3222,Bree,oh. i'm a little bit nervous. this is my first national interview. and i am a huge fan of your cookbooks.
3080,Bree,edie--please.
2809,Bree,"andrew, i understand you're angry with me about what i said, but--i do have a good reason for wanting to raise benjamin differently. i mean, let's be honest. you put me through hell."
3246,Bree,"yes, and i'm pretty sure that elderly woman with him was his mother!"
3232,Bree,what?
805,Bree,no. he just wants to be friends. he told me so.
380,Bree,maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
756,Bree,"one of us should go talk to him, see how he is."
3766,Bree,"well, not completely, but let's face it. you do cut corners. i mean, one of the things i can teach you is the importance of the attention to detail."
2652,Bree,"what do you mean, she's gone? and you believed her? you idiot! i should sue your irresponsible ass off for this. yeah, well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!"
1176,Bree,why should i feel guilty?
1282,Bree,we discussed this. we agreed to go slowly.
2783,Bree,don't be so sensitive. we'll find something to help you sleep--maybe some warm milk.
1629,Bree,so? you had one of the loveliest childhoods i've ever known.
2617,Bree,"oh, dear god."
1153,Bree,"yes, the cardiologist shared this moronic theory with rex and rex believed him!"
4124,Bree,"i don't think it was the wine, george. i think it was the antihistamines."
2235,Bree,what are you doing?
3487,Bree,you watched it?!
421,Bree,that's - between your father and me.
3878,Bree,"i'm sorry, but this is unacceptable. do you at least know why he steals? if there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors."
176,Bree,"oh, hi,zachery. i'm sorry. the door was open and-"
3976,Bree,oh. and then you bumped it on that nasty curb.
3837,Bree,"uh, bruce, why don't i wrap up a piece of that tart to go?"
1596,Bree,"your lawyer left a message on my machine.it seems we have a hearing in four weeks,and i wanna be ready."
4066,Bree,"well, the key is to not let them know what you're doing. this requires observation, cunning and manipulation."
4013,Bree,"thank you. oh, thank you, sweetheart."
3849,Bree,"oh, dear. what happened?"
3608,Bree,and you're okay with this?
3822,Bree,see a perfectly innocent--bald-faced lie.
2193,Bree,"oh, it's just awful. deviled egg?"
2496,Bree,we're already in too deep.
1916,Bree,"saw right through that, did ya?"
1446,Bree,"detective barton,is this some sort of high school ploy to get me back to your place?"
2916,Bree,"oh, don't go catholic. all that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--i go for worship, not a workout."
2983,Bree,she's not my boss!
3031,Bree,i assume you'll want the pewter cat.
3162,Bree,it was an accident.
446,Bree,hi.
2217,Bree,"well, i must say, i'm surprised at how lucid you are. orson led me to believe--"
472,Bree,"yes, i'm angry with him. i am going to divorce him. i may even marry someone else, but make no mistake about it, your father is, and always will be, the love of my life. he gave me the best eighteen-year marriage that i could have ever hoped for. for that, you will respect him."
255,Bree,"""see, but i don't think that's the reason. after i left the motel, i um, did some thinking about us and our sex life, and i realized there has been a disconnect, but it's coming from you."
2905,Bree,we brought you muffins.
2361,Bree,i will not have that woman as a neighbor. you have got to do something.
2997,Bree,used to be. not anymore. things change.
1082,Bree,george.
249,Bree,"okay, baby, where were we?"
4020,Bree,wouldn't it be easier to just have him killed?
2528,Bree,"well, as long as we're swapping pie recipes, i would love the one for your fabulous lemon meringue."
2253,Bree,"orson, what if something should happen to her?"
2636,Bree,"she's not in switzerland. she's at the sisters of hope convent. look, phyllis, i'm sorry. i know this is upsetting."
369,Bree,"not all of us! rex, i thought you moved back home to try and straighten andrew out! to, to teach him the consequences of his actions. i don't understand why you're fighting me on this."
650,Bree,"i heard that there is a, um, little black book with the names of your clients in it."
315,Bree,are the lady fingers okay?
2816,Bree,"oh, my god. this is gonna kill edie."
1070,Bree,no.
2222,Bree,"yes, i see. well, surely this rift isn't irreparable."
3451,Bree,"well, what could be more sisterly than that? i know i'm not the most--demonstrative--person, but i care about you deeply, and if you were to just walk out of my life, i would be very--very unhappy."
2116,Bree,"andrew, would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things? anyway--hmm. tish atherton--"
2543,Bree,another one? it's time for an anonymous letter.
1595,Bree,"uh,mr. bormanis,i'll need a little time to think about this."
3360,Bree,"would you excuse us, please?"
2532,Bree,that recipe is not from a book. that recipe was handed down to me from my mother.
3227,Bree,"no. uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
3220,Bree,"oh, hon, i don't think that's gonna fly. he's already rubbed too many members."
2033,Bree,my son is eating out of dumpsters!
723,Bree,no.
3217,Bree,you can't come. sorry. i just had to rip the band-aid off.
3327,Bree,aw.
387,Bree,"oh, okay. i tell you what then. why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over. i'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there. andrew! danielle! daddy's gonna fornicate for us!"
3008,Bree,"susan, i'm just going across the street. there's no need to act like a silent movie heroine."
2260,Bree,"i know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion. the woman watched a dream die yesterday. i'm taking her dinner up."
2897,Bree,"well, he doesn't mind."
1438,Bree,"although,i have to confess,i do have an ulterior motive.i need to ask you a favor."
1802,Bree,"i packed up some of your things.there's also,um,an envelope in here with some money,and that should tide you over until you get a job."
1506,Bree,"maxine, once again,this entire lunch was just out of this world. i just have to get the number of your caterer."
1222,Bree,um hmm.
2957,Bree,i suppose. i just wanted to let you know that. and also to-- apologize.
6848,Gabrielle,really? 'cause i just did.
7876,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch."
6841,Gabrielle,"oh, this morning, i got in a fight with a parking cop over a ticket, and the guy was a total jerk."
4461,Gabrielle,"betty, listen to me."
6521,Gabrielle,one million dollars.
5328,Gabrielle,"no, it's not, because i know what you're thinking."
6763,Gabrielle,"it's not going very well, is it?"
5584,Gabrielle,did you make all of this?oh!for me? okay.
7261,Gabrielle,"well, it'd be easier to talk if we were back on shore. what are you doing?"
4792,Gabrielle,i promise.
8218,Gabrielle,what the hell do you think you're doing?
6409,Gabrielle,what?
4135,Gabrielle,"i'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation."
5113,Gabrielle,"yes, and i have to say she's old enough to be your mother. hell, she's old enough to be my mother."
4662,Gabrielle,"but, we will do whatever you want us to do."
6790,Gabrielle,what kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?
7259,Gabrielle,i'm not?
6354,Gabrielle,you always do the chips!
4474,Gabrielle,"no, not really. you were always a giver."
8512,Gabrielle,"okay, great. now if you'll excuse me have to get back to my gardening."
8597,Gabrielle,"wow, it's been years! the last time i saw you was at that charity fashion show. wasn't that fun?"
6085,Gabrielle,who says it has to end?
5488,Gabrielle,"see? i don't care.that's--just a waste of time--and spit.oh. okay.okay, okay, okay."
8314,Gabrielle,"well, i'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to maria is despicable."
7424,Gabrielle,it's a new recipe for beef stew. i think you're gonna love it.
8011,Gabrielle,that only covers 85%. and we are broke.
7000,Gabrielle,no!i would rather try and work it out with victor.
6580,Gabrielle,date's over. what do you want?
4594,Gabrielle,i promise.
4596,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son.but, helen, it's over now."
6798,Gabrielle,since you started doing things to piss people off.
7944,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. we're not going to europe with grandma nutjob."
4210,Gabrielle,"well, you know what you need to do. you need to get there early, spend a little time with mike before little barracuda gets there."
5087,Gabrielle,"well, i do think it's silly to give someone seven thousand dollars if they don't want it."
5152,Gabrielle,"you have some nerve, leaving that message on my machine."
6154,Gabrielle,"yes, you saw my boobs, and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life, but that is all you're getting!"
4202,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?"
7727,Gabrielle,"i got it all figured out. we duck inside, make sure we're seen by all the right people--except mrs. downing--and then after about 20 minutes, we cut out."
6485,Gabrielle,and let me guess--now you're my upgrade?
6621,Gabrielle,bless you.
7937,Gabrielle,"rise and shine, girls. rise and shi--oh, my god! what are you doing?!"
5210,Gabrielle,"yes, you did, and i considered it for about a second."
7040,Gabrielle,or maybe a coffeepot or scented hangers or--a nice clock radio.
4530,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me!"
7581,Gabrielle,"ellie, it's getting cold!"
4699,Gabrielle,we're all in denial about something. but you're finally facing the truth and i think that's sort of brave.
4459,Gabrielle,"oh, i know i shouldn't complain. it's just there's something missing, and i don't know what it is. do you ever feel that way?"
8537,Gabrielle,"well, for the record, you're growing on me. you know what? i'm thirsty. let's start a book club."
8037,Gabrielle,"oh, please. this is important."
7845,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!"
8472,Gabrielle,you do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
4663,Gabrielle,"well, it's not really an emergency."
5173,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, if you don't mind the hemorrhoids and the nausea, it's quite the party."
7142,Gabrielle,that's the tension--leaving your body.
6625,Gabrielle,"well, hang in there as long as you can, 'cause i still need you."
6667,Gabrielle,"shh! they can hear you. oh, my god! there's another rack back here! this all your ex-wife's stuff?"
8558,Gabrielle,i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup so i can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside. i don't actually look this hideous.
5505,Gabrielle,"oh,carlos,i love you so much."
4765,Gabrielle,"carlos, we're not exactly flush with cash right now. let her be true to her roots. she was born humble and barefoot."
5905,Gabrielle,i'm sorry?
8222,Gabrielle,"well, frankly, some of them need it. i just came for a little remodel, and there are some real teardowns out there."
7108,Gabrielle,what do you mean by that?
7692,Gabrielle,"oh, don't make me pull out the solis family photo album. it's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock."
6220,Gabrielle,there was nothing you could do.
6414,Gabrielle,why? they're just flowers. they're not government secrets.
4897,Gabrielle,"yes, yes, i know. my husband and i went through a downsizing phase. but we've snapped out of it. life is good. and this would make it so much better."
6713,Gabrielle,"yeah, in the fridge."
8614,Gabrielle,now--i just wanna make sure that you're not gonna--you know--
6089,Gabrielle,"yeah, that can happen."
5263,Gabrielle,"i have to fit in this, so for god's sakes, put some muscle into it."
5597,Gabrielle,"hmm, you like that?no.an old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.it's not worth anything.you can have it."
5219,Gabrielle,"why don't you ask mike? he overheard everything, right?"
4544,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money. in a couple of weeks, i'm gonna be screwed."
7070,Gabrielle,don't answer it! it's susan. she's hosting another game night.
8552,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. your daddy's just being silly. can i talk to you for a second, silly daddy?"
7020,Gabrielle,that old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
4198,Gabrielle,"oh, well, don't-- worry about it."
5691,Gabrielle,we're gonna have to stare at this face for the next 18 years.i don't think now is the time to skimp on quality.
5127,Gabrielle,really?
6821,Gabrielle,"stop it! carlos, put me down! how dare you maul me like that!"
7242,Gabrielle,the girls are gonna be so jealous.
7204,Gabrielle,milton-- you scared me. i thought you were in washington with victor.
5447,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes,come here.now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,forgive us."
5553,Gabrielle,you're kidding me. why?
4608,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, i'm, i'm sorry i haven't returned any of your calls."
8621,Gabrielle,"well, no, but--"
7518,Gabrielle,"oh, roxy, this way."
4299,Gabrielle,i'll be outside doing my yoga.
6574,Gabrielle,is that your office?
6371,Gabrielle,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
8077,Gabrielle,"me, too. me first. remember bradley scott? i ran into him today, and he's giving you a job."
8350,Gabrielle,"you're putting me in a tough spot. carlos is under a lot of pressure now, and he's not really in a position to be taking big risks."
6357,Gabrielle,orson was slipping it to the dead chick?
8499,Gabrielle,"well, that's three. who else can we get?"
5994,Gabrielle,susan! we don't know that! all we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
4377,Gabrielle,"i didn't realize how late it was. they're only holding the suede mini for me until two. if we stay, i'll never make it. we'll just have lunch at the mall."
5863,Gabrielle,"and,uh,give xiao-mei a kick in the pants.i haven't seen her all morning."
4458,Gabrielle,my life. it hasn't turned out like i thought it would.
8582,Gabrielle,it is such a stunning piece. it's simple and elegant. don't you think?
5285,Gabrielle,"all right, but hurry up, because i've been having to pee since hors d'oeuvres. are you free to go shopping tomorrow? i figured it's probably time i bought some clothes that actually fit."
4525,Gabrielle,hey! hey! what are you doing? where are you taking my car?
7294,Gabrielle,you don't?
5645,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
4913,Gabrielle,you are out of toilet paper. bree i'll call you later.
5019,Gabrielle,aaah. carlos!
7607,Gabrielle,"well, isn't her room enough?"
4613,Gabrielle,"john, what opportunity is more important than college?"
4978,Gabrielle,"well, if you saw what he did to our pogonias you'd slap him too."
8675,Gabrielle,"i care about the message it sends to my little girls, and i'm starting to care a little bit about your tone."
5765,Gabrielle,it was my grandmother's name.
5150,Gabrielle,"but, i-"
5735,Gabrielle,"wait,if it's not frank's,then whose is it?"
8054,Gabrielle,there.
4384,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, it stopped working. that thing has, like, a $15,000 credit limit."
4359,Gabrielle,"doesn't it make you nervous, a boy alone upstairs with danielle?"
7365,Gabrielle,"well, i guess there's nothing disrespectful about a ballpark figure."
7678,Gabrielle,"juanita, this dress is awfully tight. i don't think you can get into it."
8187,Gabrielle,"no, no. this'll be way more romantic. i'm one good colonic away from being the old me!"
5330,Gabrielle,ramos. here is one thousand dollars. i won't tell carlos you didn't stick around. it'll be our little secret.
7775,Gabrielle,that m.j.'s getting beat up by a little girl.
4646,Gabrielle,people keep coming and talking to me asking me questions. that is not my job.
4753,Gabrielle,put me down.
4217,Gabrielle,carlos!
8013,Gabrielle,"well, i have turned over a new leaf. i'm sorry about the timing, carlos, but it is what it is."
6875,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! congratulations!"
7436,Gabrielle,"good. to avoid future confusion, i love you, and i want to spend the rest of my life with you."
6361,Gabrielle,"amy, you are so lucky to have such a nice dad."
6493,Gabrielle,you son of a bi*ch. you were there?
6445,Gabrielle,nothing. just having you here helps.
8116,Gabrielle,"oh, yes, i will. my rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine."
5556,Gabrielle,i heard you were being transferred so i came to say good-bye.
6577,Gabrielle,of course you are!
6373,Gabrielle,"well, that's true--"
6915,Gabrielle,"so after an hour of this, i suddenly heard myself say--"
6936,Gabrielle,"and, of course, it's the hottest day of the year. all the guests are out there sweating like pigs. god, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the boston marathon."
8029,Gabrielle,why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses? the doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light. i can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.
6425,Gabrielle,it's okay. i'm probably not ready to date.
6683,Gabrielle,"okay, you're mad, so i'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack."
6187,Gabrielle,what do you think their secret is?
7763,Gabrielle,damn you.
7019,Gabrielle,affair?i thought we were talking about runng away together.
8494,Gabrielle,that's a bit that i never get tired of.
7885,Gabrielle,"oh! you are the mrs. hildebrand. well, you're carlos' favorite client. well, mine, anyway. i bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him."
4420,Gabrielle,"you should go home and get some rest, eat something. you have a ton of messages from work--tanaka called; said it was urgent. carlos, i can stay here with your mother."
6016,Gabrielle,yeah.
5931,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.it's just, she's been having pain-- down there.so if you could take a peek, it'd make me feel so much better."
4509,Gabrielle,i think--
7741,Gabrielle,what? i was just trying to salvage what's left of our social life. now just let it go and start thinking about where we're gonna move.
7851,Gabrielle,this isn't a miracle. this is a disaster. my husband's blind. neither one of us have jobs. my husband's blind.
7389,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
6273,Gabrielle,fine. i just need a moment to get into character.
5699,Gabrielle,yeah. when did they stop hating each other?
8162,Gabrielle,really?
8564,Gabrielle,"seriously, we cannot allow this photograph. next time there's an epidemic, people are gonna think i'm patient zero."
5552,Gabrielle,who was that?
8466,Gabrielle,"what the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?"
6952,Gabrielle,"honey, he's a multimillionaire. he runs my league."
5420,Gabrielle,"yeah, and you?"
5188,Gabrielle,"by the way, he was wearing a suit. how do you know he had a good body?"
4598,Gabrielle,"helen, uh, what are you doing here?"
6387,Gabrielle,where the hell are you?
4260,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, he's just always given me the creeps. haven't you guys notices that he's got this ""dark thing"" going on? there's something about him that just feels-"
4140,Gabrielle,"no, if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
8310,Gabrielle,"okay, let's just take a deep breath here--let's not do anything we're gonna regret."
7711,Gabrielle,carlos? kitchen. now.
5082,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
6113,Gabrielle,"hey, carlos. what's up?"
7133,Gabrielle,you are still sleeping with edie?
4790,Gabrielle,"well, that's a ridiculous thing to say. i'm not going anywhere."
5123,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i almost left my husband for someone who calls me mrs. solis."
4933,Gabrielle,what?
5966,Gabrielle,"i can't wait for you to pop out that baby because when you do i am putting you on the first plane back to shanghai, and you're going to be on all fours in a rice patty before the epidural wears off!"
6455,Gabrielle,this jerk has been terrorizing me. he broke into my house!
4314,Gabrielle,she's watching her mexican soap opera. the reverend's virgin daughter is about to be seduced by the escaped desperado. so until she puts out juanita won't even know that i'm gone.
5196,Gabrielle,you're a lawyer. you lie to juries all the time. can't you just make something up?
4220,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
8117,Gabrielle,my rage just needs to catch its breath. okay. okay. i am willing to forget this entire incident if you just go jump in that bathtub right now. what do you say?
4968,Gabrielle,"john! stop! shut the hell up! listen to me, you are never going to be the father of this baby. no matter what the paternity tests say, it is carlos' child."
7175,Gabrielle,"but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet."
6840,Gabrielle,"well, it is ending a lot better than it started."
4675,Gabrielle,have you seen our checking account lately? we're broke. and then we have the mortgage payment coming up. we have property taxes..
7850,Gabrielle,i don't care. you told me this couldn't happen. you said it was impossible!
6100,Gabrielle,who is it? it is sharla banning?
8285,Gabrielle,how about we let it ride? double or nothingmccluskey slugs someone by 5:00.
7685,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? we should have a dinner or something."
5998,Gabrielle,there was a time you thought i belonged in your family. and you got over that!
5453,Gabrielle,"you know,we were just having fun,entertaining the crowd."
5908,Gabrielle,"fine, if you feel that way about it. hey, i'm sorry. i'm just a little on edge today."
5349,Gabrielle,hello.
5267,Gabrielle,"bree, it's still too easy to breathe. you've gotta make it tighter."
8373,Gabrielle,"juanita, you play with it every time we go by mrs. mccluskey's. now either tell me the truth, or i'm gonna cancel your birthday party."
4174,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass!"
6484,Gabrielle,you've heard about my divorce.
6399,Gabrielle,"uh, there's no signature. sorry. this is kind of awkward."
6973,Gabrielle,fine. i get it. but why would i want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
8627,Gabrielle,"as in ""moo goo gai pan"" chinese?"
7829,Gabrielle,"hi, bethany. i'm here to pick up juanita. is she around?"
4583,Gabrielle,"maybe. but having a baby, that, i can control. you, i can control."
8427,Gabrielle,juanita! celia! get your coats on! we're going to see daddy.
6207,Gabrielle,the whole divorce thing. maybe we shouldn't go through with it. it's not like we're gonna find this kind of passion with anyone else.
6912,Gabrielle,"no, not exactly. just a--small change of plans about the wedding."
5696,Gabrielle,nope. latino.proud of it.
6475,Gabrielle,thank you. oh.
6645,Gabrielle,"you can chase me all you want, but trust me, i'm way too fast for you."
6706,Gabrielle,sorry. excuse me. excuse me. excuse me. sorry. i'm afraid mr. lang has to take an important meeting in his limo--now.
6551,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's a regular. california kings are much longer. is your--wife particularly tall?"
7341,Gabrielle,"edie, you thief! open this door now!"
7943,Gabrielle,i don't know. make an excuse. say you ha some blind thing you have to go to.
5591,Gabrielle,what?
4456,Gabrielle,hmmm? what is?
6300,Gabrielle,"stop, stop."
4282,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
4177,Gabrielle,damn it!? come on.
4391,Gabrielle,who the hell's dana?
5955,Gabrielle,"no, you can start dinner."
5971,Gabrielle,"oh, generous.that means he's good in the sack."
7492,Gabrielle,"there you are! oh, you must be roxy! aren't you the cutest thing! oh! okay, not too close. it's silk."
6252,Gabrielle,"well, i fell in love, got married and moved to the suburbs for the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing. that was a crock."
7467,Gabrielle,"let me go! well, it's official. i'm going to hell."
7842,Gabrielle,"hey, beautiful!"
4823,Gabrielle,"well, that's too bad. cos i'm not signing that piece of paper."
6555,Gabrielle,no. moment's gone. you killed it.
6550,Gabrielle,hello.
4327,Gabrielle,i don't know. how do you usually manipulate rex?
7007,Gabrielle,new neighbors.what do we know?
5180,Gabrielle,we would love to come.
7702,Gabrielle,"18 to zero! 2 more points, and you'll break the record."
5819,Gabrielle,"no, it doesn't have to be, okay?just do the right thing and sign the release form."
6831,Gabrielle,oh! hi. don't worry. i'm here now.
5008,Gabrielle,there's no way i'm dressing him.
7832,Gabrielle,"she didn't wanna hear it not with bethany running around the house, screaming ""intercourse!"" at the top of her lungs."
8335,Gabrielle,okay.
6670,Gabrielle,so?
8261,Gabrielle,"no, we can't tell her. we'd have to give the money back."
7888,Gabrielle,two whole months?
6045,Gabrielle,"carlos, i am so sorry about the--"
4748,Gabrielle,we're gonna pay you back every cent. i promise.
8273,Gabrielle,"shut it, bitch."
7264,Gabrielle,he was going to kill me! he had a gun.
6518,Gabrielle,no?
4794,Gabrielle,"yes, hello, again."
7927,Gabrielle,"carlos, she is just a lonely old woman yearning for some friendship and human contact. and i, for one, am happy to be that human."
5496,Gabrielle,"ralph,if this is about luis overwatering the hydrangeas again,i told you,no one likes a tattletale."
4154,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
4288,Gabrielle,i think he's lying.
8504,Gabrielle,"edna, here's your diet soda. try to keep your pants on."
4740,Gabrielle,"well, uh, there's a simple explanation for that. i, um--"
8295,Gabrielle,it means--tomorrow i'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
8509,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--i gotta warn you. patty's kinda got a thing for married men."
6874,Gabrielle,i see you've picked up the pieces.
8150,Gabrielle,not the jimmy choos. they're the only friends i've got.
6092,Gabrielle,"i need cash, and you don't expect me to sell my stuff, do you?"
4661,Gabrielle,"we know that you want to trust mike, but he had a dead woman's jewelry in his garage."
4496,Gabrielle,"you know, i think that's a great idea! okay, let's go!"
4403,Gabrielle,"what? uh, yes, no, um, is that how she heard it?"
7974,Gabrielle,"well, thanks, but the girls already have a school."
4914,Gabrielle,"yes. and its impossible, i'm on the pill-which you probably think is a sin, but it works. it's a 99.9% effective sin."
5727,Gabrielle,you said we could give her gifts.everybody loves getting cash.
6729,Gabrielle,shouldn't there be an emergency light? sometimes in these elevators there's a. . .
4308,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, this is so like you. i take you on a nice shopping trip and you find ways to upset me."
6139,Gabrielle,"oh, i think it is. you know, introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with? there's only one reason to do that--pure hatred."
5329,Gabrielle,"you know what? i am tired of you judging me. what is it gonna take to get rid of you, hmm? what's your last name?"
8214,Gabrielle,don't take that tone with me. i am paying.
7611,Gabrielle,"okay, when this thing is over, let's not do the whole christmas card thing."
5936,Gabrielle,what's so funny?
8591,Gabrielle,i don't have to get you anything. and stop acting like a spoiled brat. i am not spending a fortune on a bed you don't need.
6686,Gabrielle,could you help me with the clasp?
4460,Gabrielle,"""that must be a nice feeling.''"
6562,Gabrielle,"yeah. that isn't a problem, is it? 'cause this is what friends do. they talk about each other's dates."
8476,Gabrielle,pfft.
5864,Gabrielle,"honey,come on.we're gonna be late."
7407,Gabrielle,"hi, babe. i'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy."
5286,Gabrielle,i like the sound of that. thanks.
6650,Gabrielle,he's married.
5024,Gabrielle,do you have any idea what you've done? that little stunt you pulled yesterday in the courtroom could get carlos sent away for eight years!
6716,Gabrielle,"well, stretch, of course. i'm not a complete slut. point is, he hasn't called since."
5899,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop with the dance.it's already in the wallpaper."
4695,Gabrielle,"so, have you been acting on these feelings?"
7526,Gabrielle,"she ran away. when i opened the door, she saw a squirrel, and she took off."
4498,Gabrielle,"tom, say something!"
5509,Gabrielle,i gave these pictures to him as a gift.he owns them.
4704,Gabrielle,"then what? huh? finish the sentence, carlos. we've tons of legal bills, you've lost all your clients and even with our savings, we're screwed."
5609,Gabrielle,"what?he was worth,like,$6 million."
7742,Gabrielle,you wanna know what's humiliating? waking up one day and finding out you're invisible. now it's official. i've lost everything.
4436,Gabrielle,"keep working! what were you thinking, showing up at the hospital?"
5891,Gabrielle,"yes, xiao-mei,that would be good."
8421,Gabrielle,not my problem.
7760,Gabrielle,"fine. okay, fine. knock off $200, and we'll give you cash."
7545,Gabrielle,"no, it's gutsy. well, we like you, ellie, and if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
5270,Gabrielle,"when i decided to marry carlos, i told these girls i would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless, and they laughed at me, and they said i would just end up being another fat hausfrau living a life that i didn't plan. i'm not gonna give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right."
8260,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
7559,Gabrielle,"exactly. you people are theatrical, and i need someone i can count on to give a decent performance."
8189,Gabrielle,that would be cheating. i'm gonna try to go pee again.
4289,Gabrielle,no.
6540,Gabrielle,that's not true.you'd have me.as a friend.a friend friend.not a girlfriend. really cannot overstress that.
6966,Gabrielle,"well, here's one less thing you have to worry about-- our wedding."
5236,Gabrielle,what?
4815,Gabrielle,exactly and then you would have blown all the money on the lawyers.
7459,Gabrielle,"and how is he gonna park a car if he can't see? feeling pretty stupid now, aren't ya?"
5166,Gabrielle,obviously are.
8007,Gabrielle,"hi, dr bach! how are you?"
4627,Gabrielle,"honestly, no. john, you're a toy. a sweet, dumb toy, so you might as well go to college, because you and me, no future!"
6469,Gabrielle,so what does this diary look like?
7969,Gabrielle,virginia. what are you doing here?
4155,Gabrielle,i do.
8355,Gabrielle,i don't care! why couldn't you have told me this before she's about to appear on my doorstep?
4489,Gabrielle,"john, your timing is impeccable."
4231,Gabrielle,"well, get here as fast as you can. my husband says i need to relax."
6346,Gabrielle,i've got the restaurant thing down. i can't bring myself to cook for one. not that i ever cooked for two.
5090,Gabrielle,this isn't about that.
5909,Gabrielle,"you pay six bucks an hour. it's all about the perks, honey."
6835,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was leaving. stop writing!
8385,Gabrielle,"oh, well, you know me."
8400,Gabrielle,"right, that's why i didn't suggest a longie. oh, come on. i'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat."
4828,Gabrielle,you have some nerve talking about trust when you have a secret bank account in the cayman islands.
4442,Gabrielle,have you lost your mind? what did you tell him?
6533,Gabrielle,"uh, yes, it is. you just vacuumed my tonsils. i deserve to know where that mouth has been."
5483,Gabrielle,"oh, whatever,close enough."
6090,Gabrielle,"we got ties here, people! designer ties, two for a dollar! ooh, do you like those barbells? make me an offer. i'm feeling generous. here's the customer i've been waiting for."
6896,Gabrielle,my flowers!
4252,Gabrielle,"oh my god, when did this happen?"
4144,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
4382,Gabrielle,"well, how much did you have on you? it couldn't have been much."
7847,Gabrielle,"uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month, and she's late, and that's bad."
4957,Gabrielle,"i'm going to freshen up, and i'll be right back."
5436,Gabrielle,"really? oh, don't write that down. i wasn't being specific. he's allergic to fish eggs."
6743,Gabrielle,we're having a good time. why risk ruining it?
7837,Gabrielle,so--do you think there's any chance juanita could rejoin your playdate?
6736,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, that's amazing! what are you doing?"
5491,Gabrielle,#name?
5417,Gabrielle,"she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and i know what i'm capable of."
4656,Gabrielle,okay but -
6398,Gabrielle,you didn't?
7529,Gabrielle,"i'm not sure. why don't i go look? huh. no. oh, wow. it's the scavo dog--way down in their yard. i guess it's true - lose one sense, all the others get heightened. okay, you get that. i'm gonna go find your dog."
6034,Gabrielle,"no, carlos!"
6088,Gabrielle,"well, that's what i thought, but trust me, marriage is hard."
7016,Gabrielle,yeah?prove it.
7661,Gabrielle,how about we split it 50-50?
6431,Gabrielle,"i mean, you saw me. i went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can. it was horrible."
6866,Gabrielle,oh. that's what i was trying to tell you. the meter man--he grabbed my arm and twisted it.
7414,Gabrielle,"wow. that's-- a really long time. but for better or worse, right?"
4475,Gabrielle,have a seat. you can start by helping us alphabetize the donation cards.
7660,Gabrielle,what's wrong with my voice?
5414,Gabrielle,"sister mary, will you excuse us, please?"
4375,Gabrielle,"she has a major weakness. honey, oh,"" ""it's okay. you were right to tell me this."
4267,Gabrielle,try to hurry. i have stuff to do.
8664,Gabrielle,"uh-huh, and how long do you think that will last?"
4988,Gabrielle,away.
4677,Gabrielle,when?
5247,Gabrielle,"no. you just agreed to an affair. a cheap, illicit affair with the woman you love? carlos would never share me. he's looking at eight years in prison because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage. that is love. this is, this is just lust, mixed with posttraumatic stress. i will see you in court tomorrow at ten a.m. and don't be late, or else i'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment."
6286,Gabrielle,"you're opening up a salon? god, could you get any gayer?"
8645,Gabrielle,"no, i'm thinking about our children. they're so happy. taking in a kid we don't even know? that's a huge risk."
8226,Gabrielle,"okay, be honest. here i come. so what do you think?"
6909,Gabrielle,"oh, yes! let's celebrate. more chocolate. and just so you know, if i was a lesbian, i'd totally do you."
4633,Gabrielle,"yao lin? you missed a spot. no, spare me the lecture and just book me another job quick. carlos and i are up to our asses in bills and we can't pay them. fine. bye."
6108,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, put some pants on!"
6388,Gabrielle,what are you doing at mike's house?
4810,Gabrielle,"oh, have we met?"
8455,Gabrielle,wow! you were right about this place.
6568,Gabrielle,"just finish your soup, and we'll get naked."
7422,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm calling dr. dunlap."
7821,Gabrielle,honey! what are you doing home? i thought you were at bethany's.
7501,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa! no more doggy treats. she's had enough."
4779,Gabrielle,a crypt? you bought your mother a crypt?
6353,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, it's totally my fault. i'm sorry, sweetie. go outside and do it again. i promise this time we're gonna watch."
7448,Gabrielle,it's a black-tie fund-raiser that bree organizes every year.
4170,Gabrielle,what's that?
8605,Gabrielle,no! i didn't want to embarrass her.
7767,Gabrielle,what jug?
8609,Gabrielle,she never missed bingo night at immaculate heart-- and she was lutheran.
7388,Gabrielle,"well, look at me, monopolizing the widow. you go mingle. i'm gonna get you a cracker."
4618,Gabrielle,i'll talk to john tomorrow and give back the ring.
8078,Gabrielle,"fantastic! well, you didn't sign a contract or anything, did you? 'cause maybe we can get them into a bidding war."
5960,Gabrielle,"you know, that's all i got."
5779,Gabrielle,"the baby won't stop crying, and i haven't slept for two days.will you please take lily for a while?"
5888,Gabrielle,"well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?"
6630,Gabrielle,"five? well, sure, i guess."
4593,Gabrielle,"okay, carlos -"
5746,Gabrielle,"oh,we missed it!"
7001,Gabrielle,what's going on here?
4644,Gabrielle,"very impressive. so, where does the photographer want me for the shoot?"
4763,Gabrielle,"well, it's awfully hard to like someone who actively hates your guts. she always thought you married beneath you and she let me know it."
5954,Gabrielle,"forget the hotel, carlos.get a lease."
7112,Gabrielle,i guess you--saw what happened down there.
5253,Gabrielle,vern.
5757,Gabrielle,read the instructions!
5057,Gabrielle,"honey, you and your macho pride. just tell him you're flattered, but you don't swing that way."
4648,Gabrielle,"honestly, yes. i am a model."
4203,Gabrielle,"you better hurry, we don't have a lot of time."
5676,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies,carlos.it just might cost us."
7961,Gabrielle,delightful. now leave before there's a terrible misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.
4205,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a rose."
5094,Gabrielle,hey--
5959,Gabrielle,"we're out, but i got you a pickle."
7651,Gabrielle,crap. ya had to play the daddy card.
5940,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad, because this can never happen again."
5764,Gabrielle,"oh,we just needed the one."
5140,Gabrielle,"it couldn't hurt! ever since you've been in here, all we do is bicker!"
8201,Gabrielle,"whatever. i used to be a model, and you don't know what war is until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake. i am plenty tough."
5581,Gabrielle,"well, they should've called ahead."
6144,Gabrielle,"no! ooh, i remember. carlos was so annoyed. what did you say, hon? ""he may have that trophy, but i've got you."" ain't life funny?"
8560,Gabrielle,"oh, thank you. i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup."
5892,Gabrielle,fine.you can use our toilet.
6231,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm helping you pack. think of all the money you're gonna save on bubble wrap."
7418,Gabrielle,"it's not a big deal. carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months. four, tops."
8481,Gabrielle,"we, uh--also came to give you your mom's ashes."
7569,Gabrielle,"ellie, wait. i made a mistake. can we please talk about this?"
7453,Gabrielle,this place is huge! would it kill them to have valet parking?
4754,Gabrielle,i think that's pretty reasonable considering you're guilty as sin!
5312,Gabrielle,"inside what? you mean, you mean, in prison?"
6119,Gabrielle,"oh. it was a swat. ted, does this hurt?"
6433,Gabrielle,"i'll give you this--you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos."
8414,Gabrielle,even if you're tired and get home late?
5595,Gabrielle,"oh, this isn't about me.this is about our great nation.and i have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for and help spread the ideals and values of the united states of america."
4838,Gabrielle,"huh, you moved the money?"
4443,Gabrielle,including in the alley? behind the truck stop?
4307,Gabrielle,here we go.
6215,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
7192,Gabrielle,"oh, let it go! john rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to victor."
6758,Gabrielle,"okay--yeah. but guard them with your life. yeah, especially that one."
7525,Gabrielle,"well, you know how you like it when i read you the box scores? when i went out to get the paper - only thinking of making you happy-"
7031,Gabrielle,what the hell's the matter with you?
4533,Gabrielle,sooner is better than later!
6107,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was having friends over!
8144,Gabrielle,"you never buy me a present unless i'm mad or about to be mad. and i don't think i am, so why am i about to be?"
8134,Gabrielle,"it's out of my hands, girls. word got out that you were disobeying, and they sent reggie over."
5459,Gabrielle,"oh, come here,you sweet little thing."
6419,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, stop by. we'll hot tub."
6709,Gabrielle,music. loud music.
8665,Gabrielle,ha. funny.
8053,Gabrielle,get your boss.
7234,Gabrielle,and i told you it's over.
4585,Gabrielle,the man of the house?
8270,Gabrielle,shh.
7807,Gabrielle,"honey, she's only been here 20 minutes. we invited her over to play, so go play."
4755,Gabrielle,that was before i knew we could trade a couple months in prison to keep it!
4389,Gabrielle,"fine, to heck with it. i'm not gonna risk my neck to protect you. i'm calling carlos."
5221,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, i'm your first visitor? you've been here two days."
7067,Gabrielle,oh. right. guess it's time for another one.
4383,Gabrielle,"okay, well, how much did you charge?"
5549,Gabrielle,"and if that wasn't enough, he is saying her name in his sleep. it's disgusting.he's like a lovesick puppy."
5801,Gabrielle,"no! no,no,no.we're doing just fine.aren't we,lily?"
7042,Gabrielle,"not the same girl like she's changed, or not the same girl because she's been replaced by a robot?"
7736,Gabrielle,which we're not on.
4187,Gabrielle,i know you're a jerk.
4244,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you'll be cruising so fast on this, no one will even notice. what? what's wrong?"
7619,Gabrielle,hey! lunch is almost ready. i'm making your favorite. i take it you're still mad at me.
7817,Gabrielle,"sex as a blind man. i mean, you used to be so visual. is it still as good?"
4160,Gabrielle,why??
6631,Gabrielle,opponent?
5606,Gabrielle,"carlos,what are you doing?"
6988,Gabrielle,i just got married.there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
6244,Gabrielle,okay.
5985,Gabrielle,don't you dare give me that attitude.you have no idea what i've been going through this past six months.
8142,Gabrielle,i just wanted us to have a normal life.
6888,Gabrielle,"""yeah. listen, about that--"
7634,Gabrielle,"about how you snitched on me to carlos? no, thanks. i'm all caught up on that."
5444,Gabrielle,18?
4801,Gabrielle,"mr. hartley, i have a hypothetical question for you. i like to play the lottery and i - yes, i know what the odds are, but i just love those scratch-offs. say i were to win, i don't know, a million six hundred thousand dollars. would the government be able to take it? like they took everything else?"
4919,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just didn't realise how disgusting meat could be."
8255,Gabrielle,are you sure about that?
7570,Gabrielle,look at it from my point of view. you're an attractive woman. guys are coming and going. i saw you take money from one of 'em. what am i supposed to think?
7740,Gabrielle,poor blind bastard. i'll meet him outside.
5333,Gabrielle,"you don't have a door handle, either."
4306,Gabrielle,what's your point?
7561,Gabrielle,"well, i really don't care who does it. just get it done. and--don't wear that."
5205,Gabrielle,"but, carlos-"
5370,Gabrielle,really? when did they start doing that?
6937,Gabrielle,are you out of your mind? i can't get married without my something new.
5089,Gabrielle,"we are both controlled by our husbands, which is idiotic because they're both behind bars. we should have all the power."
7437,Gabrielle,"i know, but like i said, ""for better or for worse."""
7216,Gabrielle,"carlos, you're not working right now, and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke. we need this."
6878,Gabrielle,"no, i really can't."
7179,Gabrielle,what about your wife?
4959,Gabrielle,i'm turning on some music.
8165,Gabrielle,"oh, clothes said that, not me."
4721,Gabrielle,hope he's more innocent than you are.
5142,Gabrielle,"oh, don't judge me! you're not in here because you got caught helping the poor."" ""see, we'd be enjoying this argument more if we had something to look forward to!"
5889,Gabrielle,it's right down the hall.
4364,Gabrielle,why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
8551,Gabrielle,"okay, see? your daddy's got a great idea."
7675,Gabrielle,"okay, my friends are gone. i'm ready to fix you dinner. what the hell are you doing?!"
7476,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i told you, i had errands to run first."
7051,Gabrielle,"well, it just seemed like people had it pretty well covered."
5921,Gabrielle,"well, i am gabrielle solis."
6410,Gabrielle,"i--am fine. yes,i just remembered today's my mother's birthday. can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?"
4556,Gabrielle,"uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting good, cool car things."
4623,Gabrielle,"love is not enough. where would we live, here with your roommates? the only decoration in the bathroom is a bong!"
8330,Gabrielle,"oh, hi."
4995,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
5287,Gabrielle,wait.
4505,Gabrielle,"no, it's okay, people didn't even notice."
5185,Gabrielle,"oh, bob, you beat your wife. you are so not allowed to gasp."
4768,Gabrielle,"no, you see my husband and i still don't have a clear account as to how juanita passed."
6673,Gabrielle,"hi. remember me? i had dinner here the other night. anyway, i was driving through your neighborhood after having, like, three iced teas, and i really have to go to the bathroom. do you mind?"
5012,Gabrielle,"all right, there we go. so we're good? see you in court."
8233,Gabrielle,"oh, i'll be more willing to forgive once his bonus check comes in."
7311,Gabrielle,"boy, let me think. uh--mm--no. no, i haven't."
5494,Gabrielle,betty! matthew.
7653,Gabrielle,"over here, carlos."
6846,Gabrielle,"well, well, well. who do we have here?"
4223,Gabrielle,mary alice was so excited about it. so sad.
7779,Gabrielle,"susan, i saw that! kids, get inside!"
7765,Gabrielle,you sold me a lemon. that's what's up.
6096,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing here? i mean, besides lowering my property value."
5028,Gabrielle,"well, up until the point that you told my husband we were having an affair, i was quite fond of you. since then, not a fan!"
4820,Gabrielle,"no, i know what a post-nup is, what is it doing on my coffee table?"
4148,Gabrielle,let me see.
4335,Gabrielle,"yes, apparently they found a blouse in her bag-oh, i don't know, carlos. at some point older people just start to get confused. she probably thought she paid for it. no. no charges."
7503,Gabrielle,"carlos, i said no--fine. one treat. that's it. those things are expensive, and until your disability kicks in, we have to tighten our belts."
5334,Gabrielle,you're not gonna kill me?
6126,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing? carlos! what are you doing?! carlos! you can't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere! ah! carlos!"
5347,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. i can't see him."
8440,Gabrielle,i got it.
6566,Gabrielle,no.
7632,Gabrielle,"i got news for you, carlos. you're blind. you don't have a choice anymore. you have to believe what i tell you. just like when i hand you the deodorant, you have to believe it's not oven cleaner. i know it's not fair. i know it gives me absolute power, but tough. you're screwed. deal with it! are we good?"
7028,Gabrielle,are you serious?
4427,Gabrielle,"oh, they're terrific. we just appreciate you all stopping by."
4343,Gabrielle,this is getting really weird.i think we should go to the police.
5314,Gabrielle,"no! uh-uh! i can take care of myself, okay?"
8570,Gabrielle,"ugh. was it the ""chop chop"" thing? fine. i'm sorry. now can i borrow some blush?"
4930,Gabrielle,look! it's been pulled apart and glued back together.
5684,Gabrielle,"no, plain i can handle.carlos,since that woman has walked into our house,the clocks have stopped working."
6208,Gabrielle,"yeah.yeah,i guess i am.why don't we just put all of this behind us and stay together?what do you say?"
7794,Gabrielle,maybe you're right.
8081,Gabrielle,"carlos, i've spent the last five years working with the blind. trust me, it's not that fulfilling."
5052,Gabrielle,"be careful, carlos. up until now, i've been really lonely in that big bed of ours, but when you're rude to me, it makes me wanna be not so lonely."
6466,Gabrielle,ooh-kay.
6396,Gabrielle,okay.
5818,Gabrielle,"no, no, no.i am not letting that idiot use my baby as a bargaining chip."
8359,Gabrielle,now i know why you wanted to hire her. she's a force of nature.
5516,Gabrielle,i'm living with it!
6869,Gabrielle,"no. i can't find a good flower girl. lynette keeps hinting for me to use penny. but i saw her in that preschool sing-along, and i am sorry, but we are talking zero charisma."
8104,Gabrielle,you know what would lift your spirits? we should all do a spa weekend.
8378,Gabrielle,"say, ""how do i thank you, greatest friend in the world? what's your birthstone?"""
7452,Gabrielle,i'm poor now. remember? i have to mingle with the unwashed masses. what are you doing here?
4898,Gabrielle,"oh, i would love to have this in my driveway by saturday. i'm having a big barbeque and i want everyone to see it."
6647,Gabrielle,i can't believe you bought another bustier.
4964,Gabrielle,"john! john, you,you can't."
4228,Gabrielle,says the prince as he rides off into the sunset. boy did the movies ever get that wrong.
5080,Gabrielle,"honey, he's in jail. how far is he gonna go? maybe it's time you stood up for yourself. tell him you don't need the surgery."
5697,Gabrielle,yeah. my little girl's gonna inherit some wonderful genes.
7083,Gabrielle,she's got a ring!
8341,Gabrielle,"well, how many seconds did the kiss last?"
6148,Gabrielle,"yoo-hoo! carlos! i'm making a snack for phil.do you want something to eat? some sour grapes, perhaps? maybe a little crow? okay, we need to move this over there."
6007,Gabrielle,"fine. you can come to bree's wedding reception, as my guest."
7203,Gabrielle,"sorry about that, victor. uh, anyway, it's over. uh, we both know it wasn't working. uh, good luck on everything, and you don't have to call me back. okay, bye-bye."
5674,Gabrielle,"look,carlos--it doesn't matter what we've done in our past.being a parent means rising to the occasion,and that's exactly what we're gonna do when we bring our baby home."
6481,Gabrielle,"here, let me get it."
5623,Gabrielle,"off the top of my head,you're on medicare?"
6974,Gabrielle,he did?
7945,Gabrielle,"carlos, it's not worth it. she's really starting to freak me out."
7351,Gabrielle,"no, you!"
6386,Gabrielle,carlos?
5084,Gabrielle,"well, it's not my fault. she didn't want the money."
5154,Gabrielle,no. i like to keep a clear head when i'm telling people off. what makes you think you know anything about me or my husband?
6658,Gabrielle,you will never be my boyfriend.
8360,Gabrielle,i'll bet. so were you surprised when the door opened?
5963,Gabrielle,"oh, cut it out, xiao mei.the doctor didn't say anything about me rubbing your chubby stumps.rub'em yourself."
8435,Gabrielle,"well, can you at least put the radio on? i won't feel like bitching if i can sing along to something."
5659,Gabrielle,"yeah,that was a good trip."
6911,Gabrielle,i hope i didn't wake you last night. i was at susan's till midnight.
4257,Gabrielle,"that doesn't make any sense. i've seen her driver's licence, it does not say angela."
5577,Gabrielle,"really? baby, can i talk to you for a second?"
5883,Gabrielle,all of it?even my hair pomade?
4952,Gabrielle,john!
8689,Gabrielle,"forgive me,father, for i have sinned."
8339,Gabrielle,"susan, if you're not sure what she meant by it, why don't you just have a talk with her?"
7272,Gabrielle,"aah! victor! oh, my god! victor! oh! oh, my god!"
6060,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.it's just that i'm waiting for carlos' lawyer to call.spousal support has gotten ugly. hello.oh hi, tom!"
6837,Gabrielle,you can't talk to me like that!
7155,Gabrielle,ooh! they're coming.
4142,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, i'm not going."
5990,Gabrielle,"once that baby comes,i'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone."
7580,Gabrielle,she's amazing. i don't know where she gets all her energy.
8326,Gabrielle,"you know, jody, i really don't think this is the time or place to discuss gory details."
5062,Gabrielle,"oh, right. sorry."
5977,Gabrielle,i did not lose our baby.stop saying that!i know exactly where it is!inside some crazy chinese woman!who also stole half a chicken from my fridge!
7444,Gabrielle,"i know you are, babe. and i know it's hard, and i'm gonna try to be more sensitive to your needs. now hurry up and finish. i have to go to the store."
6184,Gabrielle,i'm just gonna say it. tequila makes me happy.
8055,Gabrielle,fell off a table. don't want to talk about it.
7235,Gabrielle,i don't know. i'm taking it one day at a time. but what i can say about victor is he doesn't lie to me about how much money he's got.
5096,Gabrielle,you know me.
4910,Gabrielle,excuse me. this home pregnancy test-is it a good one?
6964,Gabrielle,"oh, so i don't even get a vote?"
6131,Gabrielle,it's over between us. just move on already. forget me.
4484,Gabrielle,"it's just sex, it's totally harmless."
5778,Gabrielle,"psst,xiao-mei.psst,wake up."
6448,Gabrielle,what?! you can't abandon me! there's a madman stalking me. my life is on the line. do you know how scared i am?
8382,Gabrielle,"yeah, okay. what are they paying?"
6494,Gabrielle,i can't believe you followed me.
4809,Gabrielle,"hi honey, i'm back."
8678,Gabrielle,"you wanna see crazy? make one more statement like that, and i am throwing your ass out on the street. you care to test me?"
7739,Gabrielle,thank you. mm-hmm.
5469,Gabrielle,lynette thinks i was hitting on you at bree's party.
7725,Gabrielle,"oh, it's just the caterers putting glasses and silverware on the tables. they make some racket, huh? but the decorations are stunning. especially that waterfall effect."
5501,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
7901,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. nobody used the ""o"" word."
7575,Gabrielle,"we like you. if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
6101,Gabrielle,"i mean, that's how bunny connors got chlamydia."
7998,Gabrielle,"oh, boy! who knew healthy food could look so tasty? okay, dig in. what's wrong?"
7924,Gabrielle,"why not? i mean, look at this place. it's like shangri-la."
5005,Gabrielle,then we won't comfort.
5493,Gabrielle,"bree,maybe you should call in a favor from your police detective pal,have him poke around."
8121,Gabrielle,it's your children. they've run amok.
5224,Gabrielle,you're not gonna eat?
8357,Gabrielle,"well, you can beg all you want. i am not on board with this!"
7899,Gabrielle,"they both did. you should have seen the woman, looking at carlos, gushing like crazy."
6374,Gabrielle,that's a good point. now i wish i hadn't told amy.
5800,Gabrielle,"oh,that's my little girl.your chakra lining up nice for mommy?that's my girl."
5560,Gabrielle,ah! oh.that was a mistake.
7025,Gabrielle,you're right. i'm not happy.let's talk.all i'm saying is i just wanna know that i come first with you.sometimes i feel less like your wife than a possession.it's demeaning.it's--it's--why are you smiling right now?
6474,Gabrielle,is it?
6014,Gabrielle,"hey, look at you."
8245,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, you heard maria the other night. your hard work is what's brought them so much closer."
5228,Gabrielle,"sure. now, open up."
7044,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. have you been there this whole time?"
4138,Gabrielle,hmm.
4853,Gabrielle,obviously a few more.
7302,Gabrielle,"can we at least have a drink before we go? calm our nerves? i mean, you can't talk to the cops the way you've been babbling to me."
6329,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm unbelievable.close your mouths."
8590,Gabrielle,"well, mommy shouldn't have said that. just, when aunt bree started bragging about her prada bag, mommy kind of lost it."
6839,Gabrielle,thank you. your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
5033,Gabrielle,"hi, uh, i need a paternity test."
8018,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about me. i may have lost my luster."
5153,Gabrielle,i will tell you what is inappropriate. you making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.
4159,Gabrielle,"well, yeah."
7510,Gabrielle,no way. that mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
8138,Gabrielle,easy for you to say. they told me they love you more than me.
6394,Gabrielle,"that's right, carlos. we have had some pblems with raccoons getting into the trash. so why don't you just put a lid on it?"
4604,Gabrielle,john and i made a clean break. i think it's best if we just keep our distance.
5650,Gabrielle,"wow,did you smell the alcohol on her breath?"
6995,Gabrielle,"finally!carlos,where the hell are you?"
6302,Gabrielle,"have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup? well, trust me, they're not that special, but the one thing that they do have is attitude. you have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?"
5776,Gabrielle,every 40 minutes? when am i supposed to have a life?
4761,Gabrielle,"well, i'm saying your mother was a sensible woman. she wouldn't be comfortable with all these bells and whistles. maybe this one. wood veneer!"
4842,Gabrielle,yeah.
5669,Gabrielle,preston!the other one's name is preston.
4882,Gabrielle,return the shoes? i can't talk to you when you're being hysterical.
5762,Gabrielle,"look,just buckle up!"
8668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. ana, the houses so clean."
6887,Gabrielle,"oh, what, now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips?"
7102,Gabrielle,"tom, watch it!"
8555,Gabrielle,"i was in labor for 20 hours. she still owes me for that! fine. i will make the ultimate sacrifice, and i will be ugly for my daughter. but if she ever needs a kidney--"
6692,Gabrielle,guess so.
7156,Gabrielle,"well, we're not saying that."
7674,Gabrielle,she was always telling us how terrified she was.
5849,Gabrielle,"uh-- well,there's just one little thing--the immigration laws have gotten really tough in this country,so we're a little behind the eight ball going in.but we pled your case,and we fought tooth and nail,and the law says you can stay--but only if you have our baby."
5755,Gabrielle,"do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!huh?well,come on,then."
5043,Gabrielle,"no, we're not."
7768,Gabrielle,"okay, i-i can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun."
7223,Gabrielle,"well, it matters that you lied to me. i can't trust you."
6661,Gabrielle,boring.
5010,Gabrielle,"well, i'm about to be the mother of your child, which means a lot of responsibility and little time for myself. so if i'm gonna get you out of this mess, you have to reciprocate."
7126,Gabrielle,"okay, not smart."
6256,Gabrielle,"you look great.well, apparently, taking a .38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you."
6316,Gabrielle,"vern, what are you doing here?"
5652,Gabrielle,so how does this work?do we flip through a catalog or something?
5536,Gabrielle,sure.
5389,Gabrielle,really?
5747,Gabrielle,"no,thanks.you guys look like you got it covered."
6319,Gabrielle,those damn tobacco companies!
5661,Gabrielle,"so we like to have fun. i mean,who doesn't understand that better than an unwed,knocked-up teenager?"
5802,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5813,Gabrielle,like hell!
6623,Gabrielle,"it's my fault. i should've known he couldn't handle the whole ""let's be friends"" thing."
8046,Gabrielle,really? that makes me feel so much better. you wouldn't believe all the stupid things i've been worried about.
5215,Gabrielle,he's just mowing the lawn like nothing ever happened. what should we do? should we call the police?
5362,Gabrielle,so pretty much just you.
5973,Gabrielle,but you're gonna get married.you wouldn't buy a car without at least taking it for a little test drive.it's not like you've never slept with a guy you weren't married to.
6309,Gabrielle,"honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture, and the parties were just this side of gomorrah. you don't know what gomorrah means, do you? good."
4715,Gabrielle,"so, uh, mike. the suspense is killing us. why don't you just tell us the bad news?"
4550,Gabrielle,yeah. so what do you got?
8493,Gabrielle,"gee, this bit just gets funnier and funnier."
7904,Gabrielle,where? where does she live?
4928,Gabrielle,i am pregnant and it is all your fault.
8324,Gabrielle,"hello? maria. calm down. calm down. okay, we're coming over."
7894,Gabrielle,"and so what if he fires you? once virginia tells all of her rich lady friends about what you did for her, they'll be lining up around the block."
4423,Gabrielle,john!
4401,Gabrielle,i sure would.
5988,Gabrielle,thank you.
7900,Gabrielle,"why should i be jealous? the woman's, like, 60. if she gets off on carlos' magical touch, what do i care?"
6415,Gabrielle,"well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain."
4993,Gabrielle,i just left my husband.
4405,Gabrielle,"it's her dream, and don't you want her to be happy?"
7352,Gabrielle,"you! aah! oh! oh! no! no! what did you do?! what did you do, edie?!"
6959,Gabrielle,polling data? why are you polling? the election's over.
4670,Gabrielle,"i'm flattered, but no, thank you."
7959,Gabrielle,"well, maybe that's because the last time we spoke, you called me a greedy bitch, and i called you a scary old hag."
5167,Gabrielle,"carlos, are we gonna make it?"
7494,Gabrielle,"well, i have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here."
7307,Gabrielle,"detectives! any, uh, news on my husband?"
5781,Gabrielle,"well,she's a baby.you hold her.you bounce her and, i don't know,maybe sing a little something."
5479,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pragmatic.because once you finish your fling,we'll be equals again.and then you won't be able to judge me.and we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.oh, just do me a favor. don't bring back any diseases."
5079,Gabrielle,"not that it's any of my business, but it's your body. i wouldn't change anything unless i really wanted to."
7933,Gabrielle,"the girls wanted to watch it, so we're kind of having a family movie night."
6681,Gabrielle,"wow, good eye."
7003,Gabrielle,i still have a lot of stuff here.
6297,Gabrielle,"hey, girls, let's talk beauty."
6925,Gabrielle,how about the bride?
4417,Gabrielle,"no, no, you go home. i'll take care of this. and you were never here. go. go."
7759,Gabrielle,i mean it. this is it.
6762,Gabrielle,is there anything i can do?
7593,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
6513,Gabrielle,"wow, you have your own recording studio in your house?"
4242,Gabrielle,"okay. well, you enjoy your new girlfriend. and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know."
6517,Gabrielle,"he's in jail--for murder. but susan swears he's innocent, and she wants you to get him a good lawyer. all right, we have a deal?"
7277,Gabrielle,we looked for six hours. he's gone.
6265,Gabrielle,"well, i guess you're all set then."
7586,Gabrielle,"what the hell? ellie, your door is locked! ellie! oh, shut up already."
8491,Gabrielle,"ugh, and i have a garden club meeting."
6028,Gabrielle,what were you thinking? i didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
7744,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, they're unhappy? they're rich! they have jewels and cooks. they use ""winter"" as a verb."
4625,Gabrielle,i've tried poor but happy. guess what. it wasn't that happy.
4954,Gabrielle,don't get out.
5725,Gabrielle,"libby,you didn't tell us you had a boyfriend."
7604,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
7415,Gabrielle,"okay, padre. we're ready. let's take it from the top."
7308,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. so ask away."
7786,Gabrielle,come on in.
8328,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i have a feeling most of these vultures didn't come to pay their respects to brad. they're just here to pump us for dirt about his murder."
5001,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
5853,Gabrielle,"well,uh,maybe just a little light dusting.nothing major."
4455,Gabrielle,i know.
7455,Gabrielle,"no, i think you have to have a wheelchair to get one of those."
6600,Gabrielle,where are you going?
4893,Gabrielle,"i don't need your credit cards, carlos. and i don't need your money. but if our marriage is going to work, i need your respect."
7164,Gabrielle,h-hi. look at you. what a surprise.
6899,Gabrielle,the hell i don't. those peach tulips belong to you--and so do these.
5206,Gabrielle,where are we going?
5081,Gabrielle,there you go. i am so proud of you.
6528,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?!
6071,Gabrielle,really? then why are you smiling?
7197,Gabrielle,how long are we talking about?
5821,Gabrielle,"signed, sealed, delivered.lily's ours."
6049,Gabrielle,you know what else would have been wise? sticking the right baby in the right belly!
8441,Gabrielle,maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
7158,Gabrielle,"i'm leaving in five minutes. uh, brett, could you come here a second? how long has that van been parked over there?"
6792,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah. why else would she have hid the body?"
8430,Gabrielle,"well, i'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?"
7045,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. she doesn't want to talk about that."
6347,Gabrielle,"aw, that's sweet."
6217,Gabrielle,i'm gonna have to call you back.
5822,Gabrielle,"who's the pretty girl?oh, looks like it's daddy's turn."
5626,Gabrielle,"i have a migraine.i'm gonna go lay down upstairs.then when i get up,i hope we can all talk about this like rational human beings."
8526,Gabrielle,"so i assume you fully disclosed your little ""friendship"" with patty rizzo."
4831,Gabrielle,"i know baby, it hurts to lose."
7616,Gabrielle,"i know, it's crazy. you wouldn't believe the passion. i mean, i was powerless to resist."
7931,Gabrielle,"anyway, we're good. so have a nice night."
8666,Gabrielle,"and if you don't mind, will you make sure juanita and celia do their chores, too?"
4410,Gabrielle,i don't want us to end on a bad note. carlos has this black tie thing tonight. i could slip--
4269,Gabrielle,he was late.
5296,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
5995,Gabrielle,"you heard me. and i want the bedroom stereo,want the marble console and that painting of saint augustine."
4486,Gabrielle,whh--how can compare me to karl? it's not fair. you have no idea what my life is like.
6605,Gabrielle,but i am guilty. i don't remember how we ended up in bed together. maybe i led him on. i gotta be sensitive here. could you threaten him for me?
4472,Gabrielle,john!
5644,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son,but it's over now."
8022,Gabrielle,you know when i decided i wanna be with you forever?
6142,Gabrielle,"really? well, that's weird. when?"
5660,Gabrielle,fine. we won't use it.
5986,Gabrielle,i have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress.i mean imagine if the day after you found out about john rowland you had to make his lunch and rub his feet!
7657,Gabrielle,hello?
5439,Gabrielle,"oh, honey. i'm so sorry. oh, maybe that stupid nun is right. maybe i am trying to stop you from becoming a better person. it's just that i love you the way you are, greedy, selfish, and insensitive. i'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize i still am, and then you won't want me."
7008,Gabrielle,and money.they've been remodeling for weeks.
4526,Gabrielle,you call this a paint job?! i don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
7513,Gabrielle,"carlos, no!"
6922,Gabrielle,that's your problem?
6955,Gabrielle,"well, the feeling wasn't mutual. you think i enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits? you know how many times i just wanted to scream, ""vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!""?"""
5632,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,no one asked you.and the only reason you care about my mother is because of that ridiculous suggestion she offered."
8563,Gabrielle,the newspaper? forget it.
5458,Gabrielle,"oh,oh!it looks like you could use a hand."
7724,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be silly, carlos. we're still on everyone's list."
6844,Gabrielle,you ready to be the mayor's wife?
5615,Gabrielle,"okay,you can think she's charming.but don't forget for one second that she is a monster."
5428,Gabrielle,what happened to sister greta?
5625,Gabrielle,"carlos,you are not seriously considering this."
7274,Gabrielle,"what, are you crazy?!"
7605,Gabrielle,"oh, no, thanks. i gotta make sure my handyman gets his wiring done. he screwed it up the last time. you realize we could've had a fire?"
7243,Gabrielle,you're so blessed. makes me wanna have another one myself.
7287,Gabrielle,"he took the lord's name in vain. look, we have a good plan. let's just stick to it."
6814,Gabrielle,what are you two doing here?
8369,Gabrielle,"unbelievable. juanita, get your butt down here."
8464,Gabrielle,"see ya in an hour, loser."
7572,Gabrielle,you've been running a tattoo parlor out of my house?
4301,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, whatever. it's rude."
6253,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no, no, no."
8433,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
7968,Gabrielle,"i'm planning on having a massive hangover tomorrow, so keep the girls up late so we can all sleep in."
4565,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. did the lawyer tell you the good news? you're gonna make bail. i found your passport."
8114,Gabrielle,"you've seen it a hundred times. she loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story. let's go."
5435,Gabrielle,"honey, he's going to a remote village in africa. does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?"
5946,Gabrielle,"so i'm gonna go shopping and then i'm gonna see my trainer, and i'll definitely be gone for, like, three hours.okay. well, i gotta go.have fun."
4707,Gabrielle,exactly.
4258,Gabrielle,so what the hell do we do now?
6167,Gabrielle,"so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
5900,Gabrielle,"oh, it's perfume,not toxic gas."
6884,Gabrielle,i'm kind of in the middle of something.
6001,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, have some more fries."
7865,Gabrielle,"i am done fighting off your bionic sperm. you're getting snipped, and that's final."
7673,Gabrielle,what's going on?
4546,Gabrielle,"i'm just so angry with carlos. what was he thinking, exporting goods made from slave labor? why couldn't he have embezzled like other white collar criminals?"
4664,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. do i know you?
6585,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay?"
7738,Gabrielle,that's mrs. downing. how am i gonna fix this?
8223,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, edie, it's a stupid exercise class. i tried it. it sucked. i don't want to do it anymore. lighten up."
7752,Gabrielle,"okay, that one hurt."
6863,Gabrielle,"constantly? aside from today, give me one example."
7376,Gabrielle,kinda.
4833,Gabrielle,"yeah, i'll do it."
5529,Gabrielle,now that's my guy.
6099,Gabrielle,wait! you can't stay here!
6027,Gabrielle,"lynette scavo, i want to talk to you!"
4355,Gabrielle,she sounds nice.
4432,Gabrielle,we'll talk about this later.
8343,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, i'm flattered, but i only did that to help susan out."
4229,Gabrielle,where are you?
4939,Gabrielle,"yeah, but i wanted to talk to you in person. i have some potentially upsetting news."
6907,Gabrielle,"oh! no, stupid. i mean, a double wedding!"
8624,Gabrielle,"honey, you're 6 now, so i think it's time we had a little mother/daughter talk. your father's side of the family's trash. any questions?"
7329,Gabrielle,"yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his disposal, carlos and i thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge."
6025,Gabrielle,"yes, i've been watching you make your new friend and it's disgusting!"
4921,Gabrielle,"i think i can honestly say, no, i'm not."
6422,Gabrielle,"what?! no, he's obsessed with me."
4692,Gabrielle,then why did you?
6723,Gabrielle,just trying to get your attention.
5277,Gabrielle,bree.
5192,Gabrielle,"i don't want a new lawyer. i want you. so does carlos, he just doesn't realize it yet."
7183,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't think we need to get into that."
8129,Gabrielle,fine.
5958,Gabrielle,not to sleep with a woman carrying on a child.
8566,Gabrielle,"oh, can i at least use the bathroom first?"
5250,Gabrielle,but zach was starting to obsess with julie again.
8546,Gabrielle,why?
6245,Gabrielle,he's cute.
6549,Gabrielle,"no, thanks. but i do need a, uh, liquid soap dispenser. go."
6845,Gabrielle,my city. it's like i'm seeing it for the first time. everything looks different now that i'm first lady of fairview.
8318,Gabrielle,shayla? she has a hello kitty tip jar.
5938,Gabrielle,"oh, no.no, i mean, i guess it was, well, weird when you started naming the american presidents in order."
6212,Gabrielle,you did this just to get me in bed?
5732,Gabrielle,"i'm thinking $12,000."
5978,Gabrielle,"hi, hi, lee wang, right.remember me.xiao mei lives with me.you came over, we had lunch."
7291,Gabrielle,"oh, no. they did?"
5048,Gabrielle,"you know, taking away my access to our account, that's just vindictive."
8236,Gabrielle,so this was his bonus? a salad and a stuffed chicken breast?
5229,Gabrielle,"david, where are you going?"
4194,Gabrielle,stop.
5741,Gabrielle,because i remember being 17.and i would've done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
8065,Gabrielle,"carlos, you don't just quit a job because of a few moles and a little back fat."
6880,Gabrielle,"oh, i see you got the invitation!"
8105,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, you're moving?"
6544,Gabrielle,"a ""friend"" friend,not a girlfriend."
5759,Gabrielle,"oh,for god's sakes.just take the baby."
6160,Gabrielle,i never said that.
6900,Gabrielle,"well, we got chocolate and wine.your place or mine?"
7320,Gabrielle,"well, who cares? the important thing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nurse you back to health, and i think that would happen a lot faster if we all clear out. thank you."
7970,Gabrielle,"no, uh, what i remember was you asking me to the movies tonight, and me saying i couldn't because i was going to watch carlos' band play. you got invitation out of that?"
7099,Gabrielle,working out.
4501,Gabrielle,"because she'll tell carlos, and he'll divorce me!"
8288,Gabrielle,"really, susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what ""i broke it dusting"" means."
4397,Gabrielle,"well, i have a problem with you seeing other girls."
7224,Gabrielle,"if i can't trust you, i don't think i can be with you."
6169,Gabrielle,that's the thing.carlos doesn't fold. that son of a bitch is up to something.
5055,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is this big emergency? i had to cancel my hair appointment with eduardo today. baby, what is it?"
6391,Gabrielle,i'm gonna hang up now.
5682,Gabrielle,"okay. okay, look, we have to find another mother."
6348,Gabrielle,oh. it's nothing.
7470,Gabrielle,i'm just dropping off a few letters. you might as well just wait here.
8607,Gabrielle,i bet i know what happened. she drank it away. that one new year's eve where she got so plowed she fell in the koi pond--
4945,Gabrielle,"yeah, that would have been helpful."
4974,Gabrielle,"so, how's your roommate doing?"
8075,Gabrielle,"so long, sucka."
5234,Gabrielle,"look, i know the timing is bad."
4178,Gabrielle,"come on, come on, hurry! let's go, let's go!"
8584,Gabrielle,"so when daddy finds out how much i spent, would it be okay if i used you as a human shield?"
5426,Gabrielle,huh?
6970,Gabrielle,you only suggested it. you can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
8688,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!!!
7978,Gabrielle,"you know something? i like money. i like it a lot. a couple years ago, you could've bought me with that big fortune of yours. but i'm a mom now, and i make the decisions for my kids. and that is something that cannot be bought."
7446,Gabrielle,just eat them. carrots are good for your--just eat them.
6976,Gabrielle,so how do i look?
5850,Gabrielle,"so we thought,you need a baby in your belly,we need a surrogate--win-win-win."
6496,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--um, i'm installing an alarm system tomorrow, so i'm not gonna need you to look after me anymore."
4600,Gabrielle,"i haven't seen john in weeks. he's called and left messages, but i haven't returned any. it's over, i swear."
6588,Gabrielle,right after what?
5379,Gabrielle,"well, sure it can. that's just a lie we tell poor people to keep 'em from rioting."
7504,Gabrielle,"carlos, remember what my fingers look like? just picture the middle one all by itself. besides, you're the one who married me for my looks."
7988,Gabrielle,"and, what, you're afraid it's gonna impair his vision? i'm sorry. you were saying-?"
8268,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. uh, but i'm not enjoying it as much as i thought i would."
7641,Gabrielle,it's a sting. go out the back now.
8517,Gabrielle,"i was gonna say ""die of gonorrhea,"""
4197,Gabrielle,hello jonathan.
4628,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money.in a couple of weeks, i will be screwed."
5937,Gabrielle,you were a virgin?
6470,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
4668,Gabrielle,"that's very generous of you, but i don't think so."
8271,Gabrielle,the federal deficit.
5703,Gabrielle,"what?! why,i--that's discrimination.it's illegal.we could have her arrested."
8221,Gabrielle,"oh, really? well, try this on for size. i'm going back to bed, because i'm tired. and when i wake up, maybe i'll have some cake, and you can't stop me."
5541,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6042,Gabrielle,you and tom will survive this.
5175,Gabrielle,he's quite the shark. you're gonna love him. he hasn't lost a case in six years. he argued in front of the state supreme court and he made our conjugal visit happen pretty damn fast.
6064,Gabrielle,thank you.
8437,Gabrielle,"and after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?"
4980,Gabrielle,she found out it was in self-defense. i think they've cleared everything up.
7118,Gabrielle,see you thursday.
6031,Gabrielle,carlos! no!
6143,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's right! that's right! you were up for the latino businessman of the year award that phil won."
8404,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you realize since bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once? i miss you. i wanna spend time with you. now move the creamed corn and do me!"
6733,Gabrielle,exactly. going down. . .
4463,Gabrielle,"hi, helen!"
6720,Gabrielle,aren't they all? so what should i do to make him jealous?
6816,Gabrielle,is that what our friendship is worth to you--twenty pizzas? we had a pact!
8231,Gabrielle,"boy, dinner without the kids--it's nice to eat without having macaroni thrown at you."
4506,Gabrielle,it wasn't susan. it was me.
5006,Gabrielle,we're just gonna talk about non-crisis things.
8374,Gabrielle,that's it. party's over!
5629,Gabrielle,i'm going home.
5737,Gabrielle,"well,you take care now."
6916,Gabrielle,wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out.
6461,Gabrielle,he says i know him and that he wants to reintroduce himself at dinner.
5004,Gabrielle,"honey, the doctors here are great!"
7805,Gabrielle,"no, it's horrible! she's gonna become this famous author and have no time at all for us."
4971,Gabrielle,"he, uh-"
5418,Gabrielle,"carlos, where are you going? carlos!"
5345,Gabrielle,"and a girl, aurora."
7903,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet he does! where is he? is she here now?"
7143,Gabrielle,and we can rinse it off--in three to five minutes. but before we do that--
7382,Gabrielle,excuse me. are you al's wife? i'm gabrielle lang.
5588,Gabrielle,they put them in forced labor camps.isn't that awful?
6011,Gabrielle,things i'll do for jewelry.
4947,Gabrielle,i plan on getting really fat as a tribute to your mother.
4676,Gabrielle,"no, it's not. we are seriously screwed, and i am freaking out that you're not freaking out."
5726,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,he's right,okay.that trashy girl has been lying to us from the get-go.let's just walk away while we can. it's not worth it."
5841,Gabrielle,i don't understand.it's from the government.
4369,Gabrielle,hey! so what did i miss?
7843,Gabrielle,her place makes the best pizza in town.
6920,Gabrielle,"how? look i know i shouldn't have offered, but i did. i can't just take it back."
4318,Gabrielle,so why do you want to go back to something you don't want?
8074,Gabrielle,yeah.
7971,Gabrielle,"well, here's the thing. i'm supposed to go with my girlfriends."
7358,Gabrielle,you really hate me?
4987,Gabrielle,"ah, ah, ah, pregnant, cave man, remember?"
5718,Gabrielle,i always hated math.
6271,Gabrielle,"people aren't gonna buy that, so here's what i was thinking. i slap on one of those gowns, i play tanya's big sister home from college to raise a little hell."
4438,Gabrielle,why would you say that?
5506,Gabrielle,"scott's web site,with pictures of me on it.well,say something."
8217,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer. here he is."
5769,Gabrielle,"no,it's okay.i'll win this battle later."
5951,Gabrielle,good.i have a little project for you.
7833,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. way out."
8111,Gabrielle,"hey, what did i say about that kind of language?"
4719,Gabrielle,it's definitely on the short list.
6757,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm gonna hang on to these. they're a little revealing."
7914,Gabrielle,"gosh, that's a--a hell of a sweet offer, but i've--got the girls, and, um--"
7012,Gabrielle,"really? because she thinks you're getting married.everyone else thinks you're getting married.so,again,best wishes."
4398,Gabrielle,"hey, danielle."
7552,Gabrielle,"okay, that was weird."
4626,Gabrielle,"i don't know. you know, every once in a while, even i want to do the right thing."
7154,Gabrielle,i say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras. i think we're about to get punk'd.
8108,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is going on? you're gonna miss your plane."
7683,Gabrielle,"my daughter does not have a weight problem. she has a little baby fat, that's all. in fact, the only problem she has is this store being completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl. just ring it up."
7719,Gabrielle,"i heard. i can't wait. ooh, i was gonna ask you should i wear the navy blue chanel or the red sleeveless dress?"
5400,Gabrielle,"what the hell kind of nun are you? look, if you try to come between me and my husband, i will take you down."
4325,Gabrielle,"okay, this is getting really weird. i think we should go to the police."
7743,Gabrielle,"first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
8123,Gabrielle,"o-okay. i'm gonna put you on speaker, and i want you to rip 'em a new one."
4361,Gabrielle,are they having fun?
8141,Gabrielle,just for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door. then it's carlos time.
5284,Gabrielle,i doubt that.
5702,Gabrielle,why?
4161,Gabrielle,it's dark; you just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.
7096,Gabrielle,"okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as a clue?"
7076,Gabrielle,"okay, but if you did have a choice, would it be a hard one? i mean, it's not like you're in love with edie, is it?"
7057,Gabrielle,it's good. are you cold? they keep it cold in here.
8275,Gabrielle,shh. hi!
8475,Gabrielle,isn't that weird? she knew she was gonna die young.
5462,Gabrielle,i'm honored.
7199,Gabrielle,"yeah. i do. you're such a good guy, carlos. i really hate that about you."
5979,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!hey, what happened to that famous chinese hospitality?"
7858,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant!
6785,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. don't worry. you're gonna find someone soon. i just know it. what?"
6230,Gabrielle,"come on, just give me one clean shot at him. i'm willing to do the time!"
4946,Gabrielle,i can't get it hot enough. my hormones are killing my taste buds..
6775,Gabrielle,i don't know my own strength..
6421,Gabrielle,"no, no, no! wait, wait, wait. i just need a couple more minutes. i need to know the truth."
6998,Gabrielle,in a few weeks? what?no! it has to be tonight!victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
7079,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right. i was reading about that in politics is boring magazine."
8240,Gabrielle,"oh, will you excuse me a minute?"
6901,Gabrielle,"me, too, and i'm so sorry about that comment i made about mike. it was way out of line. you guys are gonna be insanely happy."
5481,Gabrielle,all done.
5324,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
7701,Gabrielle,"it's a new game i invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!"
4250,Gabrielle,"yes, i, i went jogging today, and i think i just pushed myself too hard."
8292,Gabrielle,what? you can't do that. you'll lose your job and all that money.
8145,Gabrielle,carlos!
7774,Gabrielle,and don't worry. no one will hear about this from me.
6632,Gabrielle,"i think i'd rather vote for the other guy--you know, the one who didn't wreck my car?"
8332,Gabrielle,"that was my guess, too."
7910,Gabrielle,"and it never will, because if you think i'm gonna let you drag carlos off to europe, you're nuts."
7979,Gabrielle,and that is your right as a crazy old rich lady.
6306,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know."
8439,Gabrielle,"okay, my hour's up. someone else hold edie now."
8250,Gabrielle,"uh, sure."
5698,Gabrielle,"yes, it's all natural,from her straight teeth to her ""c"" cup.and i know she's athletic because she's a pole dancer,so i really hope that my little girl inherits that as well.no, the athletic gene,not the pole dancing gene."
5870,Gabrielle,"no, no, xiao-mei,i've told you a million times.no red meat for mr. solis."
7205,Gabrielle,"well, if he really wanted me to stay, he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me."
5974,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry, i'm just going to replay the look i had when i found out you hadn't banged him yet."
6385,Gabrielle,hello?
5304,Gabrielle,"i go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall. different strokes."
5729,Gabrielle,thousand?he's a bouncer in a strip club.offer him eight.
6531,Gabrielle,how much did you pay them to say that?
4886,Gabrielle,"oh no, you shouldn't."
4975,Gabrielle,"well, uh, i had to, um, tell him some news that was a little bit upsetting for him."
5427,Gabrielle,what?
6040,Gabrielle,what?
7696,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons, but you had a lot of cake, so i was thinking i'd take you to the park. that way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise."
4277,Gabrielle,"yeah? well i don't like your ironing, so there."
6847,Gabrielle,"vern, you're just awful. and as it happens, so am i."
4549,Gabrielle,"of course. i made ten thousand dollars a day. i don't expect to, to make that here."
8581,Gabrielle,we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby.
5375,Gabrielle,you said she touched your soul so i just want to make sure her hands are clean.
7440,Gabrielle,"and in a surprise move, the spurs announced a trade that will send perennial all-star to the--"
5258,Gabrielle,"because i wear a double zero, you twerp!"
8442,Gabrielle,do you wanna tell what it is.
7951,Gabrielle,"you sure are making this hard. i have tried to be nice, but i am running out of polite here, so i'm just gonna say knock it off."
7395,Gabrielle,"no, we thought that you just might need someone to talk to."
5766,Gabrielle,"you know,i'm a little tired, but it's not too bad."
5374,Gabrielle,"oh, i invited sister mary hot pants over for lunch."
6183,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i was trying to do that with exercise,but why risk a heart attack? make mine a double!"
5071,Gabrielle,"oh, don't even think about it."
7804,Gabrielle,"look at you, right on the cover!"
7980,Gabrielle,"sorry about the tip, but i just lost $50 million."
5860,Gabrielle,"well,what kind of husband do you want?do you want a rich husband?well,then,rich men don't marry virgins for the same reasons they don't hire chauffeurs who can't drive--they value experience."
5830,Gabrielle,"carlos!no!carlos, what's happening?"
4680,Gabrielle,"justin, what are you doing up here?"
7167,Gabrielle,that's right. you're a hotel heiress.
5085,Gabrielle,because it's for a boob job.
7995,Gabrielle,"thank you. god, what am i gonna do?"
7189,Gabrielle,"yes, i had an affair. old news. move on. where's that room service?"
5000,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
6883,Gabrielle,susan. hi.
8506,Gabrielle,"patty, do you mind if i steal tom for a sec?"
5774,Gabrielle,"no,i got up twice already.it's your turn."
7146,Gabrielle,yep.
7100,Gabrielle,a blister. sounds like blister.
6660,Gabrielle,i mean it this time.
4915,Gabrielle,"you couldn't wait to throw that in, could you? look, god is screwing with me! he doesn't like the way i live my life, so he's punishing me."
6552,Gabrielle,"oh. well, why don't you try it out?"
7191,Gabrielle,i shopped because i was bored and lonely--same reason i had an affair.
6886,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go."
8040,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know what? i'm gonna have to call a big, fat per nulla on that one."
8690,Gabrielle,"well, now, this i can work with."
7789,Gabrielle,"susan, it's not your fault."
7690,Gabrielle,"well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster. have you tried to lift her lately?"
5834,Gabrielle,"carlos, do something!"
7592,Gabrielle,"so that's when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed. i mean, i-i mean, i think it was cocaine, and i think they're called bricks. i'm just a simple housewife. i don't know what i'm saying."
7688,Gabrielle,really? are you okay?
5715,Gabrielle,"well,my husband and i can expose you to a lot of nice new things."
7451,Gabrielle,lynette!
7384,Gabrielle,"that sucked, too. so what happened to al?"
5767,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,please.do i look like a masochist?first thing tomorrow,i'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse."
6452,Gabrielle,he's here.
7535,Gabrielle,we're fine. this is who we are. this is our relationship.
5992,Gabrielle,"yes, it would look perfect."
7430,Gabrielle,"ooh, i meant to move that. hang on. let me just pull my panties up so i can help you. okay. here. let's go do it over here."
7152,Gabrielle,ooh.
5694,Gabrielle,"no! no, actually, all we think about when we look at you is how pretty you are."
6611,Gabrielle,what?
5630,Gabrielle,"here's how it's gonna work--you're gonna check yourself into the hotel,and then tomorrow,you're gonna plant your child bearing hips on a plane,and you're gonna leave our lives forever."
7716,Gabrielle,"bottom line, i miss our life. i miss shopping. all i have to look forward to is the occasional invitation to a fancy party. and i can't even afford a dress to go to it. carlos, please, i am begging you."
4769,Gabrielle,"yes, did she die quietly in her sleep?"
4348,Gabrielle,you expect me to take care of this place all by myself?
8482,Gabrielle,are you sure?
8216,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah, i quit that."
8093,Gabrielle,excuse me.
7733,Gabrielle,what kind of man leaves his sick wife at home to go party with mommy?!
7925,Gabrielle,what is your problem?
6602,Gabrielle,"look, zach, i'm glad you're here. i've been wanting to talk about us."
5917,Gabrielle,"well, carlos, they had your name."
7629,Gabrielle,"that little snitch. i can't believe she did that! well, thanks for letting me know."
7844,Gabrielle,"oh, wait! no, honey. why don't you wait till after the ceremony?"
6249,Gabrielle,i should know. i was on the cover.
4669,Gabrielle,"because my husband is home quite a lot these days. if any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it."
7750,Gabrielle,"god, isn't there any way we can keep it? i mean, this car's the last thing i have that tells the world, ""i'm better than you."""
6860,Gabrielle,um--doesn't ring a bell.
5392,Gabrielle,she can wait five minutes. we're giving her a car.
7923,Gabrielle,what? you heard the woman. she wants children's laughter. and i want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner. it's a win-win.
6579,Gabrielle,"i still got a lot of kick for an old broad, don't i?!"
6924,Gabrielle,so all of this planning and attention to detail--that's all been about your image?
7350,Gabrielle,no!
8115,Gabrielle,"it is for you. now move! juanita solis, i am not kidding. okay. that does it. juanita. if you think i'm not gonna drag you to the bathroom, you are sadly mistaken!"
7475,Gabrielle,i don't believe this. i was worried sick about you!
7209,Gabrielle,hold on. this check is dated for next year.
7728,Gabrielle,"oh, they are fun. mm-hmm. but i enjoy my intimate lunches with michelle even more. we have intimate lunches. we're friends."
8274,Gabrielle,"they had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled. we're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours."
8158,Gabrielle,"church. oh, you're serious."
5935,Gabrielle,the best you've ever had.
7469,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see handicapped people out and about all the time. in fact, i met two feisty men in wheelchairs yesterday at the mall. they were living their lives--so it's time for you to live yours. come on. come on."
8484,Gabrielle,"well, edie once told me she lost her virginity in cow pasture. if we can find that exact field--"
8073,Gabrielle,i'm now speaking for carlos. he'll take it.
5797,Gabrielle,what?
8497,Gabrielle,"and she's the one i'd kill. i mean, really, who died and left her in charge?"
5095,Gabrielle,ralph.
8633,Gabrielle,"because all she ever does is put me down. if you'd pay attention, you'd see what i'm talking about."
4937,Gabrielle,"reaching out from the grave to screw with me. god, she's good."
4201,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, i'm not dumping you. lately, you're been the only thing keeping me going. it's just, we can't do it at my house anymore."
5338,Gabrielle,"okay, that's ridiculous. besides, i don't feel what you think i'm feeling."
8308,Gabrielle,"well, call the vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay."
5693,Gabrielle,"yeah, we'll do that.so, libby, who's the father?"
5326,Gabrielle,so what if it is?
5292,Gabrielle,thanks. thanks for understanding.
6991,Gabrielle,nope.
7435,Gabrielle,"wow. thanks for the vote of confidence. y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out, but i would have come around. if you had just had a little faith in me, i could have proven to you that i was up for the challenge, but you robbed me of that chance."
8209,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah, yeah. time-out."
6802,Gabrielle,"look, edie, just find your own men and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!"
7357,Gabrielle,"well, i thought just in case we-"
7115,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're upset."
5523,Gabrielle,"it doesn't work that way.okay,look,i'm really trying to understand your moral dilemma here,i am.but if you don't get my pictures back,i'm gonna be humiliated.you think our gardener is the only local pervsurfing the web?"
6072,Gabrielle,gabrielle. i think that's the first time you've ever called me that.
6801,Gabrielle,"it's awkward! it's--it's like if i donated a dress to charity, and i went to a party, and you showed up wearing it."
6151,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, let's get something straight. you and i are not gonna have sex tonight."
4641,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8277,Gabrielle,"oh, that shayla."
8211,Gabrielle,yeah. are we gonna get a break soon?
8379,Gabrielle,"well, un-accept it. you have to take this job. it's essential that you be there."
7247,Gabrielle,what? who's gonna bring us umbrella drinks and salute us when we walk by?
4139,Gabrielle,"what kind of problems could she have had? she was healthy, had a great home, a nice family. her life was? -"
4610,Gabrielle,"oh, no. john. i, uh, i didn't come here for that."
4944,Gabrielle,forget about it.
4182,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early!"
4888,Gabrielle,aren't they gorgeous?
7681,Gabrielle,"look, my daughter was invited to a princess party, so i can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress."
6849,Gabrielle,just stand back and enjoy the carnage.
4575,Gabrielle,"hello. hi, bree. what?"
7490,Gabrielle,"bree, what's up? i thought giving out this award was your thing."
6822,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. betrayal makes me a little cranky.
7137,Gabrielle,yeah.
4781,Gabrielle,"go to hell, carlos!"
7429,Gabrielle,"can't. my legs are in the air. just follow the sound of my voice. there you go. i'm over here, sweetie."
4141,Gabrielle,you can't order me around like i'm a child!
7860,Gabrielle,"oh, gaby, why do i need to wear a condom? there's no way lightning's gonna strike twice."
7170,Gabrielle,"oh, i plan to. good to see you."
7420,Gabrielle,i don't believe you.
7784,Gabrielle,"you can dye that hair all you want, but the gray's just gonna keep coming."
7253,Gabrielle,"well, if he's so mad at me, why would he take me on a boat trip?"
5885,Gabrielle,"you're not a model, carlos. maintenance is my only skill."
6526,Gabrielle,"you researched me? that's sweet! in a, uh, stalkery kind of way. thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night. see you around."
8278,Gabrielle,"two. two.there's, uh, shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other shayla i know who's a home-wrecking whore."
6440,Gabrielle,hi. you're sleeping at my place tonight.
7549,Gabrielle,"hey, ellie, you got a sec?"
8126,Gabrielle,"okay, girls. pick up your toys and put 'em in the basket before dinner."
4453,Gabrielle,"thank you, father crowley. you have been a tremendous comfort. um, i will let you do your thing."
4934,Gabrielle,"oh, please!"
4983,Gabrielle,susan's coming.
7709,Gabrielle,"carlos, we got invited to michelle downing's party! i'm gonna have to buy something nice to--aah!"
4393,Gabrielle,"it's me. don't turn around, my mother-in-law can see you."
5318,Gabrielle,"look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream. i don't think i'm in any danger. so you can go. i don't need you."
6807,Gabrielle,"i can't believe you're not furious at this. before she sank her fangs into carlos, she was dating your ex-husband and mike."
7849,Gabrielle,"i don't care. oh, sorry. it's just--mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon. now go downstairs and play. mommy has some praying to do."
8637,Gabrielle,"trash don't change, sweetheart. she's up to something. now come on, let's go grab a lawn chair before we get stuck on the grass with the fire ants."
7487,Gabrielle,you look very handsome.
8303,Gabrielle,"well, maybe i am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch."
7635,Gabrielle,let me guess. this story ends with you throwing your boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
5535,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!
5244,Gabrielle,then it's nothing.
4655,Gabrielle,i wanted to call you. i felt terrible about how we left things.
6591,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, stop talking. i'm getting nauseous."
7186,Gabrielle,and i will see you later.
8608,Gabrielle,"well, then it must've been a gambling problem."
6030,Gabrielle,no!
6665,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
8416,Gabrielle,"yeah, i should get back."
6210,Gabrielle,"you got a new job? honey, that's wonderful!"
8630,Gabrielle,isn't it just easier to shut down your hoo-ha until he gives in?
6222,Gabrielle,keep talking.
6791,Gabrielle,why should we be embarrassed? we're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.
7940,Gabrielle,"uh--next weekend, uh, carlos and i have plans."
4589,Gabrielle,"uh, uh, uh! mmmm. mmmm. you're the man of the house? you can't even leave it!"
4512,Gabrielle,i uh.
7275,Gabrielle,where'd he go?
7749,Gabrielle,"what? no! no, no deal! the nondriving blind guy does not speak for me."
7015,Gabrielle,"yeah,well,i--kind of thought about you,too."
4380,Gabrielle,"juanita, what's wrong?"
4424,Gabrielle,"um, no, i think i will stay here with mama."
4829,Gabrielle,i'll bet.
4350,Gabrielle,"god, i'm gonna miss this, carlos."
4949,Gabrielle,really? why?
7182,Gabrielle,"well, i think you're paraphrasing. okay, seriously, you have to go."
6978,Gabrielle,mrs. mccluskey! enjoy the wedding?
7601,Gabrielle,i'll try.
6078,Gabrielle,"uh, you--you're engaged? to who?!"
8636,Gabrielle,fine. ok.
7859,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come back from the dead after i kill you, it'll be three."
4567,Gabrielle,"hi, honey! welcome home!"
5074,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6325,Gabrielle,"i don't think i'm better than you. hell, i envy you."
4962,Gabrielle,stop it.
4834,Gabrielle,"oh honey, nobody's blaming you."
8342,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes. was it this--or was it this--"
8488,Gabrielle,edie would so not be surprised you're welcome.
5243,Gabrielle,i thought this was what you wanted.
8644,Gabrielle,so what's one more? they'll never know the difference.
8500,Gabrielle,how about the woman in the overalls?
4977,Gabrielle,it is a complicated situation.
7086,Gabrielle,"oh, you gotta be kidding me!"
4483,Gabrielle,"okay, yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody."
4835,Gabrielle,"lynnette, will you go after her?"
4900,Gabrielle,it's-it's a sort of- a government sponsored sabbatical-
7672,Gabrielle,excuse me. susan!
7790,Gabrielle,"well, if it's any consolation, carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad, and i still feel like i'm not getting the job done, like--i'm not preparing them enough."
5671,Gabrielle,will you shut up?
6759,Gabrielle,how was i supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?
6512,Gabrielle,how can you be so sure zach's gonna go along with this?
7229,Gabrielle,"well, i'm-- sort of leaving you."
5075,Gabrielle,"uh, they're, they're nice."
6975,Gabrielle,"he blew off eighty million dollars? well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am i not hearing this from him?"
8651,Gabrielle,"oh, i doubt it. you haven't seen her since she was 6."
5565,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's about right."
6930,Gabrielle,"me, too. i think it would've been so much fun."
4492,Gabrielle,some work emergency. he wouldn't talk about it. sometimes i could just kill him.
7827,Gabrielle,"what, that sometimes mommy rides daddy like a mechanical bull to get jewelry? she's 5. she's too young to understand either half of that."
7066,Gabrielle,a charades party? didn't you just throw one?
7643,Gabrielle,"name one, and keep in mind that ""aloof"" and ""unfun"" have already been taken."
6696,Gabrielle,what happened? did you have some little mistress on the side?
7508,Gabrielle,put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport. what do i care? just get out of my kitchen--whoa. what is this about?
6771,Gabrielle,"the only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own, and that's the kind of man you marry. that's the kind of man you vote for."
4358,Gabrielle,of course you do.
5866,Gabrielle,"well,honey,she's a virgin.who knows why virgins do anything?"
6573,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you've got lots of choices. here's one of them."
8606,Gabrielle,remember that dinner party she gave? she had 20 place settings of tiffany china. how does this happen to someone who has tiffany china?
5618,Gabrielle,what does it matter whose dna it is?the diapers are still gonna smell the same regardless.
8045,Gabrielle,oh. i had to sell it a few months ago so i could make the mortgage. i'm sorry.
6542,Gabrielle,sure. why not?
5117,Gabrielle,"how many times did you say it? how many times did you whisper in my ear, ""you're the only woman i'll ever love?"""
8486,Gabrielle,and then we dump her?
7218,Gabrielle,"how much is ""a little""?"
6935,Gabrielle,"god, i should have my head examined for even agreeing to this. who the hell cares about swiss jewelry anyway?"
8639,Gabrielle,sorry. bad heart. floor's all yours.
7383,Gabrielle,so i was shocked to hear about al. i can't remember the last time i was so devastated.
5783,Gabrielle,okay.
5568,Gabrielle,"you made me a promise, carlos,a long time ago--till death do us part.and one day you just come home and start throwing words around like annulment.how do you think that makes me feel?"
4595,Gabrielle,i've gotta go.
6986,Gabrielle,"trust me,victor.this will be a night you'll never forget."
7288,Gabrielle,"carlos, if victor had lived, he would've killed us. i'm thinking we already had our miracle."
6236,Gabrielle,if only you'd come ten minutes earlier.
5624,Gabrielle,"look,i don't care if she shot triplets out of her ass.it's not gonna happen.can you believe this?"
5928,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, do you have a second?this is probably silly, but it's been bothering me.when you said,""please don't kill him,"" did you mean carlos?"
7788,Gabrielle,but that's okay. mike's a great dad.
5259,Gabrielle,because you just called me fat!
4800,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, care away."
7895,Gabrielle,"hey, clay. is mr. banks around?"
7707,Gabrielle,"no, carlos. i mean--sometimes i'm glad you can't see me. five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym. it just-- takes a toll. and when edie same the other day, it was like she didn't even recognize me."
7497,Gabrielle,don't give me your blind sarcasm. i saw a collie on tv who could push a lawn mower. do you have one of those?
6483,Gabrielle,"well, john rowland was a mistake. i was lonely."
4309,Gabrielle,no.
4511,Gabrielle,carlos.
7534,Gabrielle,"thanks for the biscuits, edie."
6876,Gabrielle,really? same day?
6204,Gabrielle,sure. why not? for old time's sake.
4447,Gabrielle,that's good to hear.
8367,Gabrielle,"yeah, no problem. two eggs coming right up. wait. i made omelets this morning, so i'm all out."
6997,Gabrielle,"okay,that's all right.i'll just take a cab and meet you."
7450,Gabrielle,it'll start with hair pull and end with detectives taking our statements. remember the pie thing?
5547,Gabrielle,because she's ruining my marriage.
7036,Gabrielle,"carlos! he's at your house. oh, he just let himself in. there you go. he's home."
8619,Gabrielle,"oh, fran, i'm so sorry. you didn't have any family to turn to? any friends?"
7891,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what's to discuss? for that kind of money, you can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts."
6381,Gabrielle,but that doesn't prove he had anything to do with monique's murder.
5308,Gabrielle,"well, let's get you another round."
7720,Gabrielle,what? she's disinviting me?
8384,Gabrielle,i just wanted to see how your first day went. sit. take a load off. spill it.
6616,Gabrielle,"no, there will be no clapping! you, moron, come with me!"
4868,Gabrielle,"i'll figure something out. i'm sorry. i'm not much fun today, i'm going to go."
5376,Gabrielle,"so sister mary, tell me what's it like meeting men in prison. do you bond with all the convicts or was carlos just special?"
5464,Gabrielle,hey!
4562,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, you know, i wanted to match the shoes to the dress. this is, uh, sarah, my shopping buddy. we like to hit the boutiques together."
7370,Gabrielle,"well, they should give you something for the pain."
7151,Gabrielle,and i was married when we got together.
4419,Gabrielle,call 911.
6224,Gabrielle,"yeah, let's give him the scoop on the neighborhood."
4845,Gabrielle,"no, you're not going to do anything."
7766,Gabrielle,"your car! i took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot."
6619,Gabrielle,"i want you to leave me alone! this friends thing isn't gonna work 'cause you're always gonna want more, and i'm never gonna love you-- ever."
5898,Gabrielle,"yeah, sure,knock yourself out."
8361,Gabrielle,"well, she's obviously stopped counting calories since the last time you saw her."
4950,Gabrielle,"no, nobody expects you to do the right thing."
5610,Gabrielle,"for some people,but we're talking about you now,mother."
7372,Gabrielle,yeah--
7403,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago, and we just fell in love all over again."
7428,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry. i forgot that was open. let's do it over here, on the table."
6524,Gabrielle,i know! you're such a good dancer! where'd you learn how to salsa?
5002,Gabrielle,hello?
7425,Gabrielle,skip straight to dessert?
6675,Gabrielle,i feel ten pounds lighter. thank you.
5970,Gabrielle,oh my gosh!
4766,Gabrielle,"hi, i'm gabrielle solis. you're nurse heissel?"
4573,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, no! that's unreasonable. what do they expect us to do for money?"
8353,Gabrielle,lucy blackburn? please tell me it's a coincidence that your new vp has the same name as your ex-girlfriend.
7983,Gabrielle,crap!
8269,Gabrielle,"so, brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
5051,Gabrielle,"i'm getting really tired of this song, carlos. isn't it about time you forgave me?"
5108,Gabrielle,"no, it's our anniversary. we're just reliving the good times."
7938,Gabrielle,"you're both stupid. stop it! um, mrs. hildebrand, this is really nice of you. but why would you want to ruin your beautiful room?"
4273,Gabrielle,"no, she dusts with them."
7872,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. he's a professional. he'll keep it confidential."
4960,Gabrielle,"um, carlos is unavailable at the moment."
4240,Gabrielle,"hey, ash. i was at the mall, and i saw this. thought you might like it. she's hawaiian. her name is princess kahaluia. and, and i think it means little waterfall- or big pond-or something."
5101,Gabrielle,you are clearly determined to ruin this special day for us.
7612,Gabrielle,"no, he's at braille school."
5163,Gabrielle,"no, susan, come on. zach attacked felicia. he, he blew up your kitchen. evidently he tried to kill mike. we can all agree this kid's a freak!"
7723,Gabrielle,what's happened to my life? we used to have help. now we are the help!
4473,Gabrielle,oh! finally got the charity bug?
7982,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
7300,Gabrielle,"okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story--"
5906,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, i'll just call the country club and cancel our lessons."
6369,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i think dedication should be rewarded, so i have a little surprise for you."
6957,Gabrielle,"yeah, i was trying to respect tradition--but i got horny."
7864,Gabrielle,i got news for you. we just converted to judaism. problem solved. mazel tov!
7034,Gabrielle,sorry. haven't seen him.
8008,Gabrielle,"friday?! but you said it would be at least a month. i mean, that's so soon."
4439,Gabrielle,we weren't driving the car. we didn't chase juanita into the street!
7226,Gabrielle,"oh, so you want me to sleep with you and take your money. gee, if that were a job, what would they call it?"
5745,Gabrielle,i forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
7202,Gabrielle,"hello? hey, carlos. yeah, i can't talk right now. i'm breaking up with victor. no, he's not here. he's in washington. yeah, okay, i'll explain later."
8647,Gabrielle,she's two blocks away. she'll be here any second.
4387,Gabrielle,"of course i would, why wouldn't i?"
6227,Gabrielle,you recorded our lovemaking?
7631,Gabrielle,"oh, you moron! there was no affair! that was the cop. ellie caught us putting the bug in her room. that was just an excuse we used as a cover."
7646,Gabrielle,"okay, when you yell at me, i get upset. and you know what i do when i get upset? i shop. so if we do end up homeless, guess whose fault it'll be."
4819,Gabrielle,what's that?
7305,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know, but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off."
6341,Gabrielle,vern! he is so competitive. i constantly have to remind him they're just kids. when did you lose the joy?
8052,Gabrielle,right. damn.
6395,Gabrielle,really? i only counted half that.
7385,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie, don't. i want you to remember al like i do-- at his desk, with a big smile on his face, surrounded by all his files. by the way, where are those files?"
5336,Gabrielle,"you're kidding, right?"
7071,Gabrielle,probably. why?
5172,Gabrielle,"well, that settles it. when this baby's born, i'll be in charge of putting on the socks."
7771,Gabrielle,"damn it, andrew. you tell bree to call me by the end of the day."
7536,Gabrielle,not that much. just his eyes.
5283,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that's the thing. they haven't changed. that's who they've always been. i've changed, and i honestly don't know how."
7419,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
6462,Gabrielle,i would not feel comfortable meeting for dinner.
5982,Gabrielle,"oh, don't give me that we are the world' crap!that woman's uterus is harboring a stolen baby!so if you know where she is you'd better start taking, or else i'm going to get the health department down her and get a closer look at what you're serving as moo sho pork!"
5246,Gabrielle,making my point. you don't love me.
7144,Gabrielle,"you know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, you ask a lot of questions."
7624,Gabrielle,wow. interesting.
5739,Gabrielle,so you think bree punched andrew in the face?'cause i don't.
4741,Gabrielle,is that so?
7236,Gabrielle,"oh, that's great. yeah, well, i-i gotta go, bree."
7882,Gabrielle,"and until we get a box of condoms in that house, that's all you're gettin'."
8163,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star their midst."
5456,Gabrielle,you see?
5856,Gabrielle,"mm hmm.well,if we are so friggin' close,what's the big deal?it's nine months out of your life."
5016,Gabrielle,"anyway, he was placed under house arrest, and he being the jealous man that he is, got a little crazy every time i left the house."
4337,Gabrielle,"okay, suit yourself."
8315,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i'm not that person anymore. i've changed."
7232,Gabrielle,you mean that?
6593,Gabrielle,no!
7577,Gabrielle,"you know, i've been hitting you a lot less lately, and i don't feel like i'm getting enough credit for that."
7808,Gabrielle,"honey, we want bethany to be our friend, so if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin."
4942,Gabrielle,i wanna make sure you'll let me protect you.
6255,Gabrielle,"well, now that my divorce is final, i need a reason to wake up in the morning. i have this hole in my life that can't be filled by shopping. that's right, i said it."
7918,Gabrielle,"ooh, we'd love to."
5107,Gabrielle,"let me count the ways. um, gently, savagely, frequently, upside down--"
4580,Gabrielle,"no, you promised, no babies!"
7375,Gabrielle,"i know, but edie was trying to steal the papers from me, and we got into this fight, and then the tornado just took them away."
8311,Gabrielle,this is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
5770,Gabrielle,"yeah,you should go."
8492,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just joined."
7293,Gabrielle,"well, he took it pretty hard. oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?"
8317,Gabrielle,deal's over. i'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
8428,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette! great office. i see you're busy. don't let me disturb you. i just wanted to drop off the girls so i could talk to carlos for a sec. all right, girls, have fun with aunt lynette."
5136,Gabrielle,it wasn't a riot. it was more of a melee.
7810,Gabrielle,bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate. i'm trying to get juanita an invitation.
4749,Gabrielle,who? who blinked?
5482,Gabrielle,"yes, it is.we worked it out."
6164,Gabrielle,you know what? i'm tired. can we talk about this in the morning?
7778,Gabrielle,yeah? or maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!
4294,Gabrielle,"honey, trust me. when they're not staring at me, i notice."
6929,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's okay. victor was kind of on the fence about it, too."
8574,Gabrielle,"you know, for a woman who has a purse full of dinner rolls, you sure have a lot of attitude."
6438,Gabrielle,there's no signature.
4219,Gabrielle,absolutely!
6877,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i can't make it. i have plans that day."
4524,Gabrielle,huh? that's my car! oh my god!
7926,Gabrielle,says the man who massaged her into an orgasm.
4732,Gabrielle,you know what? i don't have time to fight right now. i have laundry to do.
4519,Gabrielle,"yao lin, listen to me. it's very important that we find carlos' passport. i've already looked through his office, so i need you to search the bedroom."
7599,Gabrielle,and we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius knows the kind of crap you pulled.
4214,Gabrielle,"yes, i am having some new bushes planted outside, and he gave me that as a colour palette."
6365,Gabrielle,what?
6062,Gabrielle,she's right here. did you say something?
6726,Gabrielle,good.
7301,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go.
6687,Gabrielle,"hey, victor. you're probably wondering why i've been in here so long. funny story. i ran into your ex-wife."
5631,Gabrielle,i'm pulling out.watch your boobs.
5466,Gabrielle,is there a problem?
6506,Gabrielle,"listen to me, you pimply psychopath. you and i are never going to party. in fact, the only reason we're ever gonna be in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader and i wind up on the jury!"
6800,Gabrielle,"edie, there are a thousand single men in fairview. why do you have to date my ex-husband?"
6793,Gabrielle,"but once they defrost the body and do an autopsy, i guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic."
6299,Gabrielle,"remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square. look left, look right, whip and walk. yes, i'm unbelievable. close your mouths."
7123,Gabrielle,"honey, it's okay. you look cute in a scarf."
6592,Gabrielle,"oh, god. here it comes."
7249,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right--those two boring hours i'll never get back."
5288,Gabrielle,aah!
6338,Gabrielle,then i will jump in and defend you.
7987,Gabrielle,that's it? no concussion?
4931,Gabrielle,you can still see the glue marks!
5159,Gabrielle,"i'm not stuck, mr. bradley. believe it or not, i love my husband."
4230,Gabrielle,you free at 4?
7141,Gabrielle,that's the fennel.
4989,Gabrielle,i know. that's why i only packed one bag.
4136,Gabrielle,absolutely. wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
6293,Gabrielle,"i'm here to teach fashion, so i'm fashionably late."
6951,Gabrielle,i'm hardly flawless. i'm sure i have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
8023,Gabrielle,"about two seconds ago. up until then, it was pretty touch-and-go."
7029,Gabrielle,"yeah. unfortunately, it's my sweat. when are you gonna dump her?"
7663,Gabrielle,"yes, officer. i see you. thank you for coming. now remember, ellie's dangerous. so if she shows up, feel free to use excessive force."
6522,Gabrielle,"okay, deal, you little skunk."
5901,Gabrielle,"because i see the writing on the wall,and it scares the hell out of me."
8238,Gabrielle,"oh, put it on and have a good time. turns out i'm no gonna be able to afford it right now--unless you can help me out on the price."
8090,Gabrielle,hahaha--
5162,Gabrielle,thank god you were in flats.
8345,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. how's that going?"
8554,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation, you may want to rethink that."
6153,Gabrielle,"no, no, i'm not talking to you. back off!"
5512,Gabrielle,"well,when you left prison,did they leave you a contact list?"
5868,Gabrielle,"oh! okay,honey,only good swimmers now."
6383,Gabrielle,"back off,you son of a bi*ch!"
4871,Gabrielle,you mow lawns!
6984,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
8348,Gabrielle,i guess.
5851,Gabrielle,"oh,well,it would be our baby.it would just be growing inside of you."
4539,Gabrielle,"carlos, did you know what tanaka was doing?"
4279,Gabrielle,"it's okay. it was a close call, but i managed to cover. i got you these, so from now on, we can't let carlos see you around the house wearing anything that resembles a gym sock."
4452,Gabrielle,"well, let's say i don't die. i do yoga, i eat well. if i wait, does my repenting still count?"
8265,Gabrielle,"oh, whoa."
8340,Gabrielle,"okay, we're gonna figure this out for you. were her eyes open or shut?"
7697,Gabrielle,you sure? running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
8368,Gabrielle,where did that come from?
7058,Gabrielle,"you must be freezing. you know, i have the cutest shawl in the car, so i'm just gonna run out and get it for you."
6267,Gabrielle,mom?
8034,Gabrielle,"i don't know. some italian guy. hey, mike's into baseball. he must know someone who can track down this lou gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one. what?"
5880,Gabrielle,carlos--what's going on?
7233,Gabrielle,"for the last time, carlos, stop calling me."
5030,Gabrielle,"honey, we are so sorry."
7255,Gabrielle,"oh, i-i was just talking to-- bree."
4535,Gabrielle,"oh, i, i moved all our stuff, to keep it from the feds."
6689,Gabrielle,"oh, cheese doodle."
5093,Gabrielle,"careful, carlos, you're not in a position to argue."
5587,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's nice.do you know what they do to people in china who speak out against the government?"
4394,Gabrielle,so meet me at the motel in an hour? john?
5144,Gabrielle,"you were about to turn me down, then you reconsidered once you realized i was gonna throw a ton of money at you. which i am."
8039,Gabrielle,what?
6906,Gabrielle,get married together!
4193,Gabrielle,let go of me.
6897,Gabrielle,"honey, i am so sorry. i hope you don't hate me."
6168,Gabrielle,you're giving me everything i want? just like that?
5041,Gabrielle,"you knew the one thing i didn't want was a child, and you still tricked me into getting pregnant!"
6029,Gabrielle,that's it! i take my invitation back! you are no longer welcome in my house!
4875,Gabrielle,"what? oh, no. that's impossible. it's a new card, i just went shopping with it. try it again."
7813,Gabrielle,bethany's mom will take juanita once a week for two whole hours. that is sex and a nap.
8302,Gabrielle,and he has kidstwo adorable little kids.
4574,Gabrielle,"carlos, this is not like new york where i made thousands of dollars a day modeling haute couture. i'm doing boat shows. i spend eight hours a day doing this!"
5550,Gabrielle,yeah-- yep.they're having sex.carlos confessed everything--right before he asked for an annulment.
6463,Gabrielle,how about lunch?
7283,Gabrielle,"carlos, why are you calling me? i told you we can't be seen together."
8479,Gabrielle,she should be. she's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
6655,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
8160,Gabrielle,"oh, i got it. i got it. go, go, go, go, go."
8413,Gabrielle,really?
6510,Gabrielle,"susan, do you know what your obsession with mike has cost you? first you piss off bree and then ian, and now you're pimping me out to a teenager!"
5961,Gabrielle,you did not just to that!
8634,Gabrielle,"no, it's not just you."
5653,Gabrielle,really?
6750,Gabrielle,do i look like the maid? give me that!
4522,Gabrielle,here. three weeks in advance.
7392,Gabrielle,"i'm so sorry, honey. i-i know this is bad, but we have each other. we'll get married again, and everything will be fine. for richer, for poorer, right?"
4854,Gabrielle,if you want back in this bed you know what to do.
4208,Gabrielle,so now you're taking julie on your dinner date with mike?
4840,Gabrielle,"oh, no. stop, carlos, stop it. put me down. put me down. let me go. argh! stop, you're hurting me. carlos!"
7265,Gabrielle,"no, he's mad, but he wasn't dead."
6881,Gabrielle,"well, you canceled, and victor was kind of in a rush because he didn't think it'd look good for the mayor to be shacking up. and every day we tried, someone had a conflict. and then your date opened up, and we knew all my friends were available, and, well--you know, you, too."
5690,Gabrielle,"if i wanted to catch flies,all i would have to do is call up one of these girls.trust me, the flies would follow."
4551,Gabrielle,"uh, what else do you have?"
6240,Gabrielle,"i keep thinking about that crazy lady in the market, and--i understand her. i could be her."
6710,Gabrielle,not a peep. twenty-four hours.
7251,Gabrielle,knows what?
8485,Gabrielle,i don't think edie would want us to get all sappy.
7048,Gabrielle,"oh, no cream for me, thanks."
8092,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you remember bradley and his wife maria. they dropped by for dinner."
7985,Gabrielle,"eh, it was worth a shot."
7756,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that price--you're gonna have to drop it. i mean, look at all these dents."
7562,Gabrielle,target in place. we're a go.
4716,Gabrielle,and how much is this gonna cost?
5628,Gabrielle,"oh,it's in the hotel lobby.so go ahead,i'm right behind ya."
8319,Gabrielle,"well, at least be man enough to tell maria, because if you don't, i will."
8112,Gabrielle,and the best part is you get to spend a whole day with just mommy!
8683,Gabrielle,"if you say, a grandchild, so help me, god!"
8085,Gabrielle,"it was tom scavo, wasn't it?"
8456,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, don't take it personally. we're just different types."
4132,Gabrielle,ralph has a little crush.so?
6749,Gabrielle,okay.
5386,Gabrielle,"i have to, uh--"" ""uh, here have some of this. no one needs to know."
7703,Gabrielle,"really? well, i thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you. now come on!"
8097,Gabrielle,"so, bradley, if carlos were to come work for you, what would a typical week look like?"
4966,Gabrielle,it's just salsa.
5216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, susan's home."
4166,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about edie. she's a strong lady."
8127,Gabrielle,i've had enough of your crap. now pick up these toys!
6304,Gabrielle,"you were totally walking! good job! all right, donna, you're next. get up there and make me hate your beauty."
5442,Gabrielle,"the tuba, huh?"
6193,Gabrielle,"oh! oh, sweetie!"
6105,Gabrielle,why?
5233,Gabrielle,"okay, yeah, david, if you don't get back in there right now, i will go get a gun and shoot you myself."
5187,Gabrielle,i'm not discussing this anymore. you can rot in here for all i care.
5777,Gabrielle,"fine,fine,fine!"
5814,Gabrielle,let's talk turkey.what is it gonna take for you to give up the baby?
6069,Gabrielle,"so i guess, uh, there's no chance of getting you over to the house to pick the dead leaves off my ficus."
7093,Gabrielle,orson.
8520,Gabrielle,"look, i love you, tom, but you're my friend with a small ""f."" my friend with the big ""f"" is lynette. so if i see something that could hurt her, you bet your ass i'm gonna do something about it."
5521,Gabrielle,what?
7558,Gabrielle,"well, i've got no solid evidence, and she's got a lease. so, bob, i was hoping you could ""solicit"" her services. that way i'll have proof."
6545,Gabrielle,"no, zach, i only accept jewelry from men i plan on sleeping with."
5692,Gabrielle,"wow, that--that sounds like interesting work."
6006,Gabrielle,and what?
4158,Gabrielle,"i found my earrings, we can go now."
5032,Gabrielle,"no, okay. that was a stretch. i'm sorry. carlos, wait! come back. look, i wanna start over. we're gonna have a baby. isn't that what you always wanted? carlos, wait! i said i was sorry and i love you! what more do you want?"
7493,Gabrielle,"ah, nice to meet you. carlos told me how much he enjoyed taking classes with roxy."
5580,Gabrielle,"when he turns our house into a catholic underground railroad, yes!"
5989,Gabrielle,here you go.
6862,Gabrielle,he was mean. he deserved it.
8294,Gabrielle,or we can--make someone else do the right thing.
4271,Gabrielle,that's a sock.
5410,Gabrielle,"not god, my husband."
5895,Gabrielle,"that is not the point. we are a week into this pregnancy,and you're already putting xiao-mei's needs before mine."
8655,Gabrielle,"oh, well, not to push my luck, but i was thinking you could sweep the front porch and take care of the guest bathroom."
7822,Gabrielle,"well, how long have you been standing there?"
5200,Gabrielle,"hey, that's my wine!"
7266,Gabrielle,"it's in there. well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun."
5533,Gabrielle,"babies, babies, babies.you sound llike a broken record.i just had a miscarriage.it's gonna take some time before i'm ready to get pregnant again."
4275,Gabrielle,he's on his way over.
8014,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, let's keep our fingers crossed. ow!"
6229,Gabrielle,i said dead!
6377,Gabrielle,"hi. bill? i was wondering, do you have plans saturday night?"
6515,Gabrielle,"yeah, here's how it's gonna work. we drive to the restaurant separately, we will not have dessert, and under no circumstances will you touch me. capisce?"
6666,Gabrielle,look at this! there's lacroix and ungaro and vintage gaultier.
4802,Gabrielle,"that's what i thought. the bastards. so, what if we won the lottery after carlos went to jail? could the government touch the money then? hypothetically. i see. and we could keep the house."
4172,Gabrielle,do you think this is why she--?
7449,Gabrielle,"ooh, i say we nominate the woman who gives edie her bikini wax."
4940,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant and it might be yours.
6564,Gabrielle,don't get too full. you have to leave room for dessert.
4226,Gabrielle,awww.
5190,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
7648,Gabrielle,"ellie, you can't call me! the cops are all over my ass because they think i helped you escape."
7652,Gabrielle,hmm.
5657,Gabrielle,so?
8556,Gabrielle,"oh, fine. as long as you don't mind people thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister."
7706,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm protecting her. she doesn't know the truth yet. women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful, and then it's gone. and then before you know it, we're old and fat and married and wondering where our beauty went."
4500,Gabrielle,i can't do that!
6459,Gabrielle,"that's very sweet of you, but i am not the most beautiful woman in the world."
4863,Gabrielle,"no no, keep going."
7831,Gabrielle,"so apparently, after we had our little chat with juanita, she went straight to bethany and passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail."
6701,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks,and this is the first glimpse of a guy could actually like."
7486,Gabrielle,"if it were anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it. you ready to go to the party?"
4469,Gabrielle,what's wrong?
8098,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? five-star hotels."
6211,Gabrielle,what?! why would you do that?
8327,Gabrielle,i want to go home!
8569,Gabrielle,"yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either, but i can only deal with one disaster at a time. ooh. asian girl. close enough."
4682,Gabrielle,"no, that means i'm all alone. you're leaving."
7718,Gabrielle,bree! what's up?
5007,Gabrielle,"i'm here to testify for you, carlos. can you take those off?"
7571,Gabrielle,you do what?
7465,Gabrielle,"jeez. what, is there a telethon going on around here?"
6480,Gabrielle,you got a little chocolate on your shirt.
5515,Gabrielle,"well,i thought about what you said--about the pictures--and you're right.it was my mistake and i have to live with it."
6450,Gabrielle,"carlos! carlos, wake up! i need you!"
7734,Gabrielle,right.
5331,Gabrielle,and then you'll leave?
7666,Gabrielle,what?!
8175,Gabrielle,"oh, it's only temporary. juanita needed her coloring book back."
5158,Gabrielle,i'd say i'm pregnant!
7290,Gabrielle,i guess two days ago. why? what's wrong?
6111,Gabrielle,"yeah, the cap was loose, and i know how your sick mind works."
6559,Gabrielle,zach!
7873,Gabrielle,why the hell not?
5590,Gabrielle,"don't you think xiao-mei would like it better here in america?i mean,where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?"
5619,Gabrielle,"fine.what about surrogacy?i mean,i know it's pricey,but at least the baby would look like us,and i wouldn't get stretch marks.it's a win-win."
6367,Gabrielle,what about your dad? don't you care what he wants?
6145,Gabrielle,"mnh-mnh, not right now. phil and i are getting in the hot tub. ooh, phil, did you bring your suit?"
6057,Gabrielle,this is exactly what we needed.especially after everything i've been through lately.i am all about relaxing and rejuvenating--
5340,Gabrielle,"okay, should i say something?"
7557,Gabrielle,"there have been men coming out of her room at all hours of the night, and i saw her counting a wad of cash. so long story short, i need your help to get that hooker out of my house."
8672,Gabrielle,did she?
4976,Gabrielle,excuse me?
5364,Gabrielle,what the hell did they do to you in that prison?
4559,Gabrielle,uh! i guess i am.
5118,Gabrielle,so were you lying to me? were you just trying to get me into bed?
7149,Gabrielle,"playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite."
7427,Gabrielle,"i'm right here, babe."
4693,Gabrielle,why?
6420,Gabrielle,"this is totally her fault. i mean, i simply asked her if carlos sent me the flowers, and she refused to show me the order slip."
6538,Gabrielle,"forget about it.give a horny kid a couple million bucks and the yellow pages,and stuff is gonna happen."
6340,Gabrielle,i have no idea where you're going with this.
7466,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, no, no. wait! okay, you know what? this is getting ridiculous."
7334,Gabrielle,they said victor's getting out of the hospital--tomorrow.
7343,Gabrielle,"oh, good. you're home."
7024,Gabrielle,"me,too."
4262,Gabrielle,i love taking baths. especially with you. it's like taking a vacation from the world.
4207,Gabrielle,"it's just beautiful. i, uh, i gotta go."
6246,Gabrielle,"i had a career and a future,but i gave it all up for you,and what did i get in return?"
5805,Gabrielle,"yes, she needs the bonnet.it completes the outfit."
4772,Gabrielle,thank you so much. that's all i needed to hear.
5688,Gabrielle,"these can't be our only choices, mr. beale.i mean, come on.each girl is uglier than the next."
6332,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a trooper. let's dump her."
6432,Gabrielle,so you are dating. that's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
4508,Gabrielle,almost a year. but it's over now.
4620,Gabrielle,"i guess. i understand if, uh, you hate me just a little."
4408,Gabrielle,i'm not jealous. i just don't like to share.
6858,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you look handsome in a tux."
6055,Gabrielle,"you can call it blackmail, carlos, but the court calls it ""spousal support"".so unless i get a check by monday, your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a welcome back party."
7880,Gabrielle,of course i can't. it's just--how could you have lied to me?
4213,Gabrielle,"oh, john gave it to me."
6780,Gabrielle,what are you waiting for? get the champagne.
5293,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem, why don't i just figure out a time and call you?"
6824,Gabrielle,yeah. i had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.
6323,Gabrielle,"okay,just give me a minute.i'm sorry about what i said to the girls,and it won't happen again."
8174,Gabrielle,i'll go get it.
5847,Gabrielle,mmm hmm.
7228,Gabrielle,"this is nice. i didn't order a stretch, but i'll take it. victor."
8161,Gabrielle,okay. thank you.
4803,Gabrielle,are you trying to buy us off?
4924,Gabrielle,yeah.
6330,Gabrielle,"amy, small steps. small! little miss snowflake glides. she doesn't stomp."
5061,Gabrielle,why would he think you have that kind of money?
6082,Gabrielle,don't laugh.i saved a bundle on airfare.
8220,Gabrielle,"oh, don't get all holier than thou, mona. i saw you pull into the doughnut shack yesterday."
4688,Gabrielle,"well, now we have something to talk about. you."
8573,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, look. i'm sorry. you're right. i never should have asked."
8452,Gabrielle,and susan?
5634,Gabrielle,"the only reason she offered up her dusty womb is because she's screwed.her latest sugar daddy gave her the boot,so mom needs a place to stay and money.so trust me,if she carried our child,we'd be footing the bill for years."
7478,Gabrielle,"move it along, pops. we're gonna be here a while."
4238,Gabrielle,"hi, ashley. remember me? we met earlier?"
7369,Gabrielle,hey. how you feeling?
8436,Gabrielle,it's a 4-hour drive. we have to do something to pass the time.
5319,Gabrielle,shopping. not that it's any of your business.
5421,Gabrielle,"well, bon voyage, father."
4448,Gabrielle,"no, me? no, no. confession is not really my thing."
5911,Gabrielle,okay.
8454,Gabrielle,all right. come on. let's go.
8044,Gabrielle,"oh, i told you."
7511,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's not. i read the pamphlet steve left. these dogs are not allowed on furniture."
7421,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no. this can't be true."
4611,Gabrielle,"well, i heard that you're going full time with your gardening business. what happened to college?"
6894,Gabrielle,"yeah, on and off. mostly off. what if you tie the knot in a month and realize that you miss ian and mike misses the coma?"
4467,Gabrielle,"believe me, it's been my pleasure. how's he doing?"
8312,Gabrielle,"jeez, bradley, you scared me!"
8548,Gabrielle,"because i'm an adult. and besides, i hardly wear any."
8534,Gabrielle,it was like i was invisible.
6982,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. didn't know you were in here."
5143,Gabrielle,what?
8649,Gabrielle,"well, i didn't say i wasn't sedated."
6992,Gabrielle,come on!
5957,Gabrielle,"i don't know what that meant, but i didn't like the tone.so just remember, am the boss of you, or else i'm gonna make this the worst nine months of your life."
6436,Gabrielle,"hey, guys--"
7212,Gabrielle,can't say hello to a girl?
6739,Gabrielle,you have no idea.
7059,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. it's just hospitals are hard for me.
5261,Gabrielle,i'm just not gonna eat for two days.
5670,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,it was statutory,and it happened so long ago."
5655,Gabrielle,"so just to be clear,some slutty cheerleader gets knocked up by the soccer coach behind the local gas 'n gulp,and she is going to make sure we're quality people?"
6093,Gabrielle,"and it pains me to sell it. it's just that my lawyer told me what you're offering for spousal support, and i can't get by on that."
4685,Gabrielle,do you know how easy it would be for me to call my husband and tell him what you just tried to do?
5724,Gabrielle,"look,we spent a lot of money on that.the least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression."
4446,Gabrielle,"listen, since you're here, there's something i've always wondered about. that whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions, is that a hard rule, or just a general guideline?"
8681,Gabrielle,welcome home.
7332,Gabrielle,"i know. this is-- a lousy way to say good-bye. and i'm sorry, but i don't have a choice. do you guys have any idea how much i'm gonna miss you?"
4457,Gabrielle,"oh, no."
6266,Gabrielle,i've got some wardrobe choices. i want to be buried in this dress!
6435,Gabrielle,"susan, please. we look stupid enough for suspecting him. just let it go."
8109,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, girls. it's not like he's going off to war. he's gonna be back tomorrow."
5160,Gabrielle,i'll pay you six and i expect a conjugal visit tomorrow by noon.
6622,Gabrielle,he's devastated.
6903,Gabrielle,"honey, please. if anyone should be nervous, it's me. i met victor three months ago. i mean, i'm crazy about him. it's just, the thought of saying those vows again? that's scary."
8246,Gabrielle,"oh, brad. come on. saving a marriage? you can't put a price on that--at least not a small one."
6590,Gabrielle,please tell me that once contained a mint.
4806,Gabrielle,"most men would leave over something like that, and you're still here. i'm grateful. i know the sacrifice you're making."
6375,Gabrielle,"she was so excited. well, she's your best friend. why don't you just tell her the truth? she'll understand."
5531,Gabrielle,she's okay.
5964,Gabrielle,"would you rather go live with mr. solis in a dingy one bedroom apartment with no air conditioning and no cable?huh?no, i didn't think so."
5596,Gabrielle,"you like nice things? that's why i think you're stupid,for not wanting to stay here.you could be around my nice things all the time,taking care of them--how fun would that be?well,i'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that tiny,godforsaken village of yours.you know,we're probably more alike than people would guess.i'm from a small town, too.my folks had nothing.that's why i love america.anything is possible."
6919,Gabrielle,so what do you think?
4134,Gabrielle,"there's no way i can just work that in, carlos."
8397,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you have to go back to work?"
7113,Gabrielle,"look, it was a long time ago, and--and it didn't mean anything."
7398,Gabrielle,why?
7101,Gabrielle,all right. ready? get set--go.
6570,Gabrielle,guess someone's in a hurry to get on with the evening.
6376,Gabrielle,"well, friends come and go, but a crown is forever."
7528,Gabrielle,"how dare you. i have looked from one end of town to the other, and i'm telling you, she's nowhere to be found. but since you love her so much, i'm gonna keep looking."
7198,Gabrielle,"six months? nobody takes that long to heal anymore. it's a breakup, not a face-lift."
6473,Gabrielle,please. kids don't watch videos anymore. everything's digital.
6561,Gabrielle,"oh, well, um, luke's gonna be here in twenty minutes, and that kind of will be a date."
8213,Gabrielle,i said time-out!
6872,Gabrielle,"i love that you're so into this wedding. most men would be like, ""yeah, yeah, tell me where the church is,"" but you're as obsessed as me. you're like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one."
6751,Gabrielle,you! blackmailer!
7268,Gabrielle,"and tell them what, i knocked my husband overboard because he was coming after me with a sweater? no, come on. we gotta go back out there."
8101,Gabrielle,"hang on. before you do that, let me lay it out for you. either you let your family continue to sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself, or you grow up and make real money and look after us like we've been looking after you for the past five years."
8514,Gabrielle,was that patty rizzo?
6760,Gabrielle,"you know, you're a single guy. maybe people won't care."
7310,Gabrielle,"oh. well, you tell edie britt, just because carlos dumped her doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputation, especially when she's the slut."
7047,Gabrielle,wow.
4972,Gabrielle,"i'm pregnant, and it might be yours."
5273,Gabrielle,no.
4137,Gabrielle,hi susan.
7297,Gabrielle,great.
8489,Gabrielle,you're good at this girl talk thing.
8377,Gabrielle,"hear about it? honey, i did it. i talked to carlos. you're in."
7846,Gabrielle,damn.
6074,Gabrielle,"except now when we're done, i don't have to proofread your essay on ethan frome'."
7689,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's with all the cheese?"
5461,Gabrielle,"uh, i think she got sick."
5685,Gabrielle,"with her dna,the only thing that kid's gonna be winning is best in show.look, carlos, i am sorry,but i want a pretty baby,so let's find another mother."
7687,Gabrielle,i had two children.
6008,Gabrielle,here.
7916,Gabrielle,he's giving her orgasms?!
6492,Gabrielle,"oh, some global financier, saw me on the cover of paris match. good-looking, just not my type."
7912,Gabrielle,"no, but i just think we should end things before they get any weirder."
6133,Gabrielle,"she promised to stand by him, and once you make that commitment you have to see it through."
8320,Gabrielle,what you reading?
5356,Gabrielle,"well, what did they do?"
7803,Gabrielle,i prefer cash.
5222,Gabrielle,oh.
8232,Gabrielle,please. it was our pleasure. how did we do that again?
5069,Gabrielle,"i'm, uh, i'm gabrielle solis. our, our husbands are roommates at the prison."
7292,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i hope this isn't--last time i saw him, i told him i was leaving him."
6112,Gabrielle,"to answer your question, no, we are not getting back together."
7004,Gabrielle,"i'm just not in a rush to unload this house,okay?this was my home.i was very happy here."
4847,Gabrielle,"because one day, when the time is right i'm gonna tell him how he drove me into your arms and that's going to kill him."
6350,Gabrielle,"oh, honestly? um, i hate it. it's like i've forgotten how to date."
6527,Gabrielle,"right, the kiss. sorry. i didn't mean to welsh on ya. all right. pucker up."
7165,Gabrielle,"wow, look at you. congratulations."
7879,Gabrielle,we can't handle another kid. we're living hand to mouth as it is.
6718,Gabrielle,"god, i'm such an idiot. i gave it up way too fast. now i've lost all the power."
6834,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's the best part. he lets me be me. all right, i gotta get going."
5397,Gabrielle,huh?
8426,Gabrielle,"carlos, get back here! carlos! could you at least scratch my nose?"
6613,Gabrielle,"is it really good, or are you just pretending you had a slice? you and i did not have sex. admit it!"
5592,Gabrielle,"well, first of all,that was her idea.second of all,i can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs."
5490,Gabrielle,so are we thinking this is paul?
6781,Gabrielle,"hi, edie!"
6460,Gabrielle,"yes, i-i may be in the top ten."
8363,Gabrielle,so don't get me wrong--she's attractive. it's just-- she's not really your type. your type is skinny model.
8157,Gabrielle,"there are no good nightclubs, no theater. what do you do for a good time?"
4621,Gabrielle,"that's sweet, you're, you're very sweet."
7107,Gabrielle,"look, lady, you need to calm down. you're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up your ass."
8641,Gabrielle,"we love you, aunt connie! yeah."
7219,Gabrielle,you embezzled $10 million?
5811,Gabrielle,"no, you listen!we were granted custody.if you want her,you talk to the judge."
5327,Gabrielle,"you know, i also got a facial, and later on, i'm gonna get a pedicure and an eyebrow wax, so there."
6223,Gabrielle,you can stop now.
5495,Gabrielle,count me in.
5009,Gabrielle,"yes, well, carlos, in some circles, beating people up at all is frowned upon."
8449,Gabrielle,"oh, be nice! there are lots of attractive women on the street."
8445,Gabrielle,is this too red? i think i need something pinky
8110,Gabrielle,because daddy has a new job that's gonna make us lots of money.
7637,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie, i'm so sorry. i had no idea."
6963,Gabrielle,"fairview is my home, and i don't want to leave it. and you can't make this decision without me. i'm gonna be your wife."
7139,Gabrielle,"well, the doctor says you need to relax, and i know just how to relax you."
8469,Gabrielle,"oh, please. you're gorgeous. and you are going to stay that way forever."
5276,Gabrielle,ah. how do i look?
5967,Gabrielle,"tell it to my chinese friend, sue me!!"
8122,Gabrielle,"now that you've gone back to work, they won't listen to me. they know you're not in the next room, ready to drop the hammer. help me!"
5044,Gabrielle,me too. look on the bright side. at least we're still rich.
8244,Gabrielle,like a great jumping off point.
5357,Gabrielle,mmm. i guess i owe the pope a thank-you note.
4362,Gabrielle,isn't it sexist of us to generalize like this?
5036,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
4319,Gabrielle,maybe you're tired of me.
4249,Gabrielle,"well, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school."
5789,Gabrielle,"hi. hi,pretty girl.oh,yes,mommy has to go.mommy has to go,so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her."
6303,Gabrielle,"now i want you to pretend you're on the runway--flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing--isabel horowitz is smoking hot! go, isabel! go! you're doing it! isabel, you're doing it! that's it! keep going!"
4540,Gabrielle,"she's a talented girl, our edie."
4653,Gabrielle,"oh, god."
6519,Gabrielle,a whole day?
5405,Gabrielle,"sweet, little george williams."
5141,Gabrielle,"yeah, but when we would finish arguing, we had this great sex! now all we do is fight and there's no payoff and it sucks! you and i need to get laid!"
6589,Gabrielle,"okay,listen to me very carefully,and this is no time to be vague.what exactly was i amazing at?"
7797,Gabrielle,i want my 300 bucks.
6061,Gabrielle,yeah!
4873,Gabrielle,i'll pay it off.
6345,Gabrielle,"oh, um, the grass, honey, and my allergies--go ahead and practice. i'll watch you from here. are you sure i can't help with anything?"
5454,Gabrielle,nothing.
7094,Gabrielle,why?
5962,Gabrielle,pick it up!
6471,Gabrielle,this is adorable! you think maybe i could
6943,Gabrielle,i haven't gotten your reply card back yet. so chicken or fish?
5361,Gabrielle,who is sister mary bernard?
5111,Gabrielle,"hello, john. long time, no see."
6702,Gabrielle,i had such a good time tonight. who knew you could dance?
4553,Gabrielle,"this, um, buick thing. does it include lunch?"
8656,Gabrielle,"oh, that's a pretty dress. oh, my god, it's versace!"
6327,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you ladies talk it over? and i'm gonna work on posture with the girls."
5468,Gabrielle,"damn it, lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night,i'm gonna lose it!"
6672,Gabrielle,i just wanted a moment to say good-bye.
5076,Gabrielle,you're right. that was weird.
5969,Gabrielle,"if you don't tell us, we're not coming."
5730,Gabrielle,"are we talking about the same idiot?i think for $8,000,he'd throw in a kidney."
7174,Gabrielle,"uh, okay. you know that old friend i ran into in the lobby? it might have been john rowland. maybe. i'm not sure."
6768,Gabrielle,"my name is gabrielle marquez, and i want you to know, right before those photos were taken, victor asked me to marry him."
6260,Gabrielle,did i say that? water under the bridge. i thought it was funny.
7863,Gabrielle,"oh, cram it, you fertile freak. you're getting a vasectomy."
7941,Gabrielle,i--don't think that's such a good idea.
8153,Gabrielle,hello there. welcome to my home.
6934,Gabrielle,it is after three o'clock! where the hell is bree with my something new?
4342,Gabrielle,i don't know why you're telling me this.
4846,Gabrielle,"if you really want to get back at him, kiss me."
4780,Gabrielle,"oh, that's it. i cannot be a part of this! i can't do it!"
5231,Gabrielle,yeah. why not?
5859,Gabrielle,"are you kidding?no one cares about virginity in this country.it went out of style in the '50s,and trust me,honey,it ain't making a comeback.seriously,no one cares."
7110,Gabrielle,bree saw you slap your daughter.
7063,Gabrielle,"but on the plus side, i made a pretty good career out of knowing how to smile when i didn't really feel like it. but i can't pretend with you. not when i'm scared i'm gonna lose you."
7318,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, what?"
8266,Gabrielle,"do you hear that, carlos? godparents."
5240,Gabrielle,there are some ground rules first. i'm not leaving my husband. carlos is looking at spending eight years in jail because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener. i can't let him rot in there. i'd be filled with guilt.
4199,Gabrielle,"oh yes, i heard that. uh, john, we need to talk about what happened the other day."
8358,Gabrielle,you can call me gaby. come on in! i'm on board.
5622,Gabrielle,"mother,no!"
5538,Gabrielle,i'm sorry.i can't promise that.
5744,Gabrielle,"exactly. we're not ready!you know,this is a total inconvenience."
7614,Gabrielle,we weren't expecting you back so soon.
7285,Gabrielle,let them ask. no one knows we were on that boat. let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
5279,Gabrielle,bree? it's gabby!
6103,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't. women always say they wanna know if their husband's cheating, and they always resent the person who tells them."
7574,Gabrielle,"well, i suppose i could look the other way for a few months. it's the least i could do for thinking you're a whore. forgive me?"
7588,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
7538,Gabrielle,"yeah, come on in. so because of my husband's disability, our financial situation has changed, and we have this big house."
4607,Gabrielle,"hi, um, i don't know if i have the right address. does john rowland live here?"
7747,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. it's already priced way below blue book, not to mention it's mint."
4528,Gabrielle,why? what else could they take from us?
4317,Gabrielle,"but i thought teenage girls bored you, john? i thought what we had was beyond that."
8462,Gabrielle,"well, it's one more than you got."
4578,Gabrielle,"well, dig in. i am way too tired to eat."
8103,Gabrielle,"emphasis on the word ""laid."""
8545,Gabrielle,"yes, i do. do you have any idea how humiliating it was for me to get that call today? now every parent in town is gonna think that i let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school! and i want my makeup back. is it in here? why do you have this? juanita."
5838,Gabrielle,"i don't think i could go through that pain again.i did freeze some of my eggs,so we might do the surrogacy thing,but i don't know."
4468,Gabrielle,i hear he's dating danielle van de kamp?
7717,Gabrielle,thank you.
7194,Gabrielle,hey. what's going on?
4908,Gabrielle,"and another thing, i don't want a four door. i want a sexy little convertible. and i want to buy one. right now."
4683,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
7161,Gabrielle,no way. it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock and key. i'll be there as soon as i can.
5857,Gabrielle,"""ruined""?"
4169,Gabrielle,"you guys check out mary alice's clothes? size 8, hah! she always told me she was a size 6. guess we found the skeleton in her closet."
4329,Gabrielle,"go on, try it on."
7708,Gabrielle,"edie, this is not a ""we're sorry"" party. this is a ""we forgive you"" party."
4750,Gabrielle,and that's - good?
6882,Gabrielle,i am so throwing the bouquet to you!
7482,Gabrielle,"oh, you bet i am! every morning, the toothpaste has to be to the left of the sink, because if it's not, you can't find it, and i have to put it there. and--and sometimes-- i don't know--i'm driving, or i'm in line at the bank and i think, ""is the toothpaste there?"" so then i have to run home and check because i don't want you reaching for the tube and not being able to find it. i just didn't think this was how it was all gonna turn out, carlos. i didn't think that every day for the rest of my life, a part of me is always gonna think, ""where's the toothpaste?"""
5886,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll learn to live without product.but when my hair starts smelling like hair,i don't wanna hear a word."
5668,Gabrielle,"parker and,uh--porter,uh--and,uh--well,they're all p's.it is super cute."
8381,Gabrielle,"yeah. yes, and then i went home and ought, what a horrible thing to say to such a dear, dear friend who's probably really, really good at her job. so--i said, ""carlos, you have to hire lynette."""
4173,Gabrielle,"if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
5865,Gabrielle,oh. and were you planning on setting her straight?
8415,Gabrielle,huh. that's good to know. you're good at this girl talk thing.
8662,Gabrielle,"and so-- they give you designer clothes, and you give them--"
8646,Gabrielle,"yeah, and knowing aunt connie, she's waited all these years to call that favor in. she's probably dying on purpose."
4789,Gabrielle,you are so brave.
5262,Gabrielle,ralph! i need help getting dressed. get in here! now!
5271,Gabrielle,"bree, my friends are models. they're never happy for anyone."
8152,Gabrielle,"yeah. they came by, brought muffins. one of 'em wants her basket back."
4145,Gabrielle,john. we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.
5593,Gabrielle,"well, who's forcing her?we'll pay her whatever she wants.and the best part is,with her resum,any wage will look good."
6754,Gabrielle,give me the pictures!
6748,Gabrielle,he's not here. is that for him?
7506,Gabrielle,"carlos, i'm getting my hair done! end of discussion! what are you barking at? you got your damn treat. you know, if we really want to save money, you could cut down on those cuban cigars."
4222,Gabrielle,"gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with."
8588,Gabrielle,"then go move in with heather, 'cause i'm not getting you one."
6859,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know you're mad, but wait till you hear what that jerk did to me--"
7596,Gabrielle,and edie threatened to use that to--
8267,Gabrielle,how could we say no?
7671,Gabrielle,police! police! get in here now!
8380,Gabrielle,because it's a great opportunity.
5498,Gabrielle,why?
8383,Gabrielle,"i don't think that'll be a problem. by the way, you're gonna be reporting to this woman lucy. she's a real star, so you're gonna wanna keep an eye on her."
5133,Gabrielle,you can't tell me no.you work for me. you will make it happen!
7327,Gabrielle,oh. right. it's nice.
7644,Gabrielle,"okay, so here's the deal. bree needs all of these wedding favors wrapped by tomorrow, and she's really counting on me, so-- i'm gonna need you to hurry."
4163,Gabrielle,"oh, excuse me."
4859,Gabrielle,you want my respect? then tear up the post nup!
4538,Gabrielle,i'm going to kiss my husband now!
4981,Gabrielle,maybe this is a mistake. if there's one thing i've learned men can't be trusted.
7781,Gabrielle,"that's your defense? you were only assaulting her ""a little""?"
8617,Gabrielle,"well, then what the hell happened? this doesn't make sense. i was at your house. you had such lovely things."
6046,Gabrielle,i forgive you. it's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
4165,Gabrielle,what happened to him?
5198,Gabrielle,are you gonna help me or not?
5232,Gabrielle,what?
8203,Gabrielle,excuse me?
4869,Gabrielle,what's this?
7185,Gabrielle,"yeah, good times. anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair--"
7620,Gabrielle,"well, i couldn't risk doing it in my room. ever since carlos went blind, he's developed a strong sense of smell. i don't know if you happened to catch a whiff of roy, but that is one telltale odor."
5022,Gabrielle,john! how did you get in here?
4865,Gabrielle,dammit john! what is our new rule?
8375,Gabrielle,"well, then how else did it get here?"
6678,Gabrielle,hey.
6243,Gabrielle,"and for what it's worth, i don't like what it's turned you into either."
7965,Gabrielle,"right, and in exchange, when she finally kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp. i'm sorry, carlos."
8446,Gabrielle,this is gonna be fun. i can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
5359,Gabrielle,wait! i'm not done with you yet.
7128,Gabrielle,"i'm saying men are visual. hell, i have a whole closet full of costumes. you need to give tom something to look at, something spicy, like--"
7394,Gabrielle,so we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.
4412,Gabrielle,of course!
6238,Gabrielle,"yeah, everything's fine. having a little squabble. give us a minute. carlos, where do you think you're going with that?!"
8042,Gabrielle,what?
5772,Gabrielle,"we have the money. what is wrong with getting a little help?then i'll be able to relax once in a while,and i'll be able to be a better mother."
6529,Gabrielle,"yes, my lips, not my esophagus!"
6961,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, well, let's explore it now. nope, not gonna happen."
8622,Gabrielle,we're going to a family reunion at aunt connie' and i want to look my best.
8297,Gabrielle,"well, shaylait is shayla, right?"
6714,Gabrielle,that's toby. he's fixing my closet.
4451,Gabrielle,"so what happens if i repent, later, like, say, when i'm 75?"
8691,Gabrielle,can we object to that?
7098,Gabrielle,that's not fair. she's like the charades ninja.
7662,Gabrielle,"okay, we really need to get caller i.d."
6467,Gabrielle,and you were valedictorian. what were you up to that your mother didn't know about?
7886,Gabrielle,"oh, that's carlos for you. mr. magic hands. he hits the ol' sweet spot every time."
6516,Gabrielle,"great. in order for this magical night to occur, you're gonna need to help mike delfino."
7461,Gabrielle,"you know, the quicker i can run my errands, the faster i can get home to my husband, who needs me, because that's the kind of person i am. w-what are you doing?"
8392,Gabrielle,"oh, were you, miss ""they offered me $100,000 a year""?"
7245,Gabrielle,i thought you kept your boat at the yacht club.
4760,Gabrielle,"no, honey, these funeral homes make a fortune trying to convince people to overspend."
8084,Gabrielle,"okay, let's skip to the important part - who was it?"
6283,Gabrielle,"yeah, me, too."
6612,Gabrielle,"little zach young? well, just how much would i have remembered?"
7010,Gabrielle,he's a cutie.what does he do?
4673,Gabrielle,have you seen these? five more past due notices.
7457,Gabrielle,"i know. primo spot, isn't it? what? i have a thingy."
5791,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?xiao-mei?i'm late to meet mrs. van de kamp.i'll be back in a little while.
6368,Gabrielle,"you're working so hard, sherri. you must really wanna win this pageant."
8156,Gabrielle,"get out of bed in the morning. i've only lived here a month, and i want to put a gun to my head. you know what i mean?"
5944,Gabrielle,"well, since this is our last time, i guess we can make the most of it."
8443,Gabrielle,yeah. edie britt shamed you into being a better human being. that is embarrassing.
4218,Gabrielle,"god, it's beautiful!"
6201,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, this old thing? you've seen it all before. i'm just gonna wear the little blue number. will you hand me those stockings? oh, i've got a raggedy nail. you're gonna have to help me put those on."
6279,Gabrielle,i don't believe that.
6928,Gabrielle,mike said no?
6695,Gabrielle,she threatened me with mace and then slugged you. now you're on her side?
4286,Gabrielle,yeah.
4816,Gabrielle,you had laotian convicts sewing casual wear for 2 cents an hour. don't you think you deserve a time out?
8393,Gabrielle,"honey, i've played poker with you for the past nine years. i think i can tell when you're bluffing."
7947,Gabrielle,"virginia! what, uh, are you doing here?"
4255,Gabrielle,it's so weird to hear mary alice.
7564,Gabrielle,"must he put his hand on his hip like that? butch up, for god sakes!"
5193,Gabrielle,"look, to be honest, carlos is a little threatened by you. he thinks if we spend too much time together that something might happen."
7667,Gabrielle,wait! she's gonna steal our money!
5191,Gabrielle,"yeah. i thought you'd schedule an appointment later. right now, i'm, i'm sort of disgusting and sweaty."
7489,Gabrielle,"you and kathere did an amazing job. boy, we didn't think you guys could work together."
6910,Gabrielle,morning.
6106,Gabrielle,"uh, would you excuse me?"
4347,Gabrielle,i supervise.
4916,Gabrielle,"no, it was-you just had to be there. but, my point is, that i'll be an awful mother. i'm selfish and i'm self-centred. and the only person more self-centred than me is carlos! i mean, he's so self-centred that he doesn't even know how self-centred i am! we'd be terrible parents!"
8096,Gabrielle,"carlos, be nice."
8185,Gabrielle,"honey, we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby. you know what? i'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed."
7649,Gabrielle,"oh! ellie, i don't know. what is it?"
6370,Gabrielle,"well, you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number? this year, all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs, and i've arranged for you to dance with your best friend amy!"
6360,Gabrielle,i'd love to grab a cup of coffee--or something.
4366,Gabrielle,"well, before you get any friendlier, let me remind you, i can do things to you she can't even pronounce."
6942,Gabrielle,chicken or fish?
7014,Gabrielle,you were not.
6981,Gabrielle,"no, i'm still looking, but i'll let you know."
4490,Gabrielle,"susan mayer saw us last night, and she knows everything."
6502,Gabrielle,"oh, zach. what are you doing here?"
5855,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei?i made you some hot cocoa.i guess the baby thing didn't really appeal to you,huh?i know it's a lot to ask,it's just,carlos and i think of you as family.don't you think of us as family?"
6927,Gabrielle,good.
6861,Gabrielle,that explains it.
5031,Gabrielle,"so you're just not gonna talk to me, is that it? fine. i don't need to talk. okay. yes, i had a little affair. it wasn't the best thing to do, and i'm not proud of it. but it's not the worst thing that could have happened. nobody died. oh, don't be such a martyr, carlos. okay, it takes two people. how many times did you go off on your little business trips and leave me alone? see, so technically, you cheated, too. it's just your mistress was your work."
4515,Gabrielle,"just know that whatever happens, i love you very, very much!"
5112,Gabrielle,"well, someone had to tend to the yard. you were busy elsewhere."
8180,Gabrielle,mommy needs to lose a few pounds. you wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
6457,Gabrielle,"this is gabrielle. who the hell is this? yes, i got your token of esteem,' and i'm not impressed. because you're freaking me out, that's why! no, i don't care how much it cost. that's beside the point. really? that much?"
5298,Gabrielle,"jeez, how are you feeling today?"
7576,Gabrielle,don't. we're waiting for ellie. she's finishing up with a customer.
4851,Gabrielle,what do you think you are doing?
5907,Gabrielle,i don't wanna go alone.it was your idea in the first place.
4730,Gabrielle,"yes. if you hadn't gotten yourself indicted, we would have pipes right now."
5912,Gabrielle,make me something strong.i have nine more holes with that guy.
4328,Gabrielle,"oh, mama, you're in a rut! we need to spice up your wardrobe. oooh, try this one on."
4435,Gabrielle,"i know, i've been watching. i came to talk to you."
6125,Gabrielle,"no, if i wanted to hurt you, i would tell you about last weekend when i slept with john rowland."
7038,Gabrielle,"edie! edie, wait! wait, wait, wait! don't go! don't go!"
7751,Gabrielle,here. take good care of her.
8403,Gabrielle,"right. well, we'll create new table memoes."
4431,Gabrielle,it's a fairly recent development.
5875,Gabrielle,oh!
5337,Gabrielle,what's this for?
8444,Gabrielle,"yeah, i do. i spent a night with her right after carlos and i got divorced."
7022,Gabrielle,best wishes!
6191,Gabrielle,"nah, i already paid a lawyer. i'm taking him down."
6076,Gabrielle,what?
4630,Gabrielle,"you know, i never thought i'd say this but i kind of feel sorry for paul."
7650,Gabrielle,"teddy bear? what is that, code for ""a pound of blow""?"
6983,Gabrielle,yes. i can see that.
6767,Gabrielle,standing by my man.
7869,Gabrielle,okay. but i'm gonna talk to bob.
8309,Gabrielle,i'm just trying to protect you here.
5355,Gabrielle,what happened?
6157,Gabrielle,always happy to help a brother out. hold on.
8686,Gabrielle,what? that the card was cancelled by my lover's mommy?
4867,Gabrielle,"no, 'cos if i leave then i'll be broke, and that would be awful. and if i stay he'll be in control and that's horrifying. and he cut up all my credit cards, which means i'm married to him and unable to shop, which is probably the worst of all possible worlds."
4709,Gabrielle,bigger.
7074,Gabrielle,"well, victor has a teachers' union thing on thursday. guess i'll see you on thursday. carlos, what's happening here? i mean, with us. why are we still sneaking around?"
7824,Gabrielle,"no! no, that wasn't real. sometimes i fake it when i wrestle with daddy."
7116,Gabrielle,"victor, really, i don't think it's a big deal."
8005,Gabrielle,huh.
6548,Gabrielle,"it means something to me.being alone at this age, it's hard,and it's only gonna get harder.i'm so depressed."
4994,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
5404,Gabrielle,you do not want to start a war with me.
8283,Gabrielle,"4:00? let me think. actually, noon would be better for me. could you do noon?"
5756,Gabrielle,hurry up!
5809,Gabrielle,"well, it's a good thing he's here.we can take him to the lawyer's office,and you can sign over full custody to us. okay."
6258,Gabrielle,"that's great! well, i have some fun news of my own. i'm ready to model again."
8173,Gabrielle,"and by ""we"" and ""food,"" you mean bree, right?"
7732,Gabrielle,"that was mr. bowman, wasn't it?"
6077,Gabrielle,oh! your fiance?
4211,Gabrielle,attagirl. i'm just gonna take these upstairs.
4599,Gabrielle,hi! so nice to meet you.
7699,Gabrielle,"hey, juanita. you wanna play a new game on the way home? winner gets a new doll."
5139,Gabrielle,"not just for me. for us. in case you haven't noticed, carlos, our marriage is still on shaky ground."
6239,Gabrielle,you know what the weird part is?
4712,Gabrielle,what?
4204,Gabrielle,i'm glad i could help. education is very important.
4713,Gabrielle,i can't hear you!
4378,Gabrielle,"well, if the mall is crowded, it might take over an hour."
5890,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.that's why i had the movers put it in here, where we sleep."
8685,Gabrielle,"boy, with all this passion, isn't it too bad we're not having sex?"
8680,Gabrielle,she turned me in.
6147,Gabrielle,"well, now you know."
4720,Gabrielle,why?
4858,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to do for money?
8448,Gabrielle,we're an unstoppable team.
8067,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah. i'm comin'."
4513,Gabrielle,i'm going to bed.
7852,Gabrielle,"well, i hope to god you're right. and what does this number mean anyway?"
4874,Gabrielle,"well, far be it for me- to stand in the way of a young man's dream."
7890,Gabrielle,"well, pip-pip and arrivederci!"
4635,Gabrielle,are you gonna clean that spot?
7595,Gabrielle,"okay, look, i'm all for doing my civic duty, but this woman-- she's-- sort of a-- friend. and now you're asking us to trick her? i'm not sure we're comfortable with this."
6216,Gabrielle,"oh! hello? uh, there's been an accident. my husband--he--"
8653,Gabrielle,"you know, the girls have chores, too. it's how we teach 'em responsibility. speaking of which, uh--curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends. does that seem reasonable?"
7905,Gabrielle,"hmm. well, when the time comes, an alibi would be nice."
7483,Gabrielle,"that's not the point, you blind idiot! i'm saying if all i get in exchange for this crappy situation is a nice parking spot for my $8 manicure, then i'm taking it!"
7658,Gabrielle,"oh. right. the bear. well-- i looked all over and just couldn't find it. i guess the cops took it. i'm really sorry, ellie. i know it was a gift from your dad. it just breaks my heart."
7462,Gabrielle,like hell i am! give me that.
6994,Gabrielle,okay.wait!aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
7078,Gabrielle,state senator?
8291,Gabrielle,"i know. just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too."
5015,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm talking about his other crime."
7005,Gabrielle,"yeah,it's a great house."
7046,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. let's dig into the pie. looks amazing."
6138,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's more than that. i think you really hate me."
5354,Gabrielle,it's so good to see you!
7091,Gabrielle,i'll do it.
4224,Gabrielle,we could all use a fun night.
4773,Gabrielle,"oh, you can just toss that!"
5485,Gabrielle,"no, not really.does it matter?"
4826,Gabrielle,"uh huh. i'll even give you an example. remember the time you were in jail and you told me about your secret compartment and you told me to burn the papers that i found in there. well, me being pretty and therefore stupid, i forgot."
5299,Gabrielle,honey.
5300,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
4248,Gabrielle,oh honey. these heels don't have another block in them.
6291,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll do it, but i want this dress for free."
4601,Gabrielle,"oh, okay."
7623,Gabrielle,he's so precious.
5751,Gabrielle,he's gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
7121,Gabrielle,"and we can play games, like ""how big is mummy's tummy?"""
6682,Gabrielle,"so you're--well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste. if we had met in any other context, we would so get along."
5065,Gabrielle,"you're a strong guy. you went to college on an athletic scholarship, for god sakes!"
6954,Gabrielle,"god, no. it's a complete snore. pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the fiftieth time?"
7069,Gabrielle,she slapped her kid?! no!
7162,Gabrielle,"boys, time to get paid."
8264,Gabrielle,"oh, really? what is it?"
8304,Gabrielle,"focus, shayla! we are talking about how i'm ruining innocent people's lives."
7342,Gabrielle,oh!
7540,Gabrielle,what was what?
4701,Gabrielle,did you feel anything?
8210,Gabrielle,"look, i appreciate this whole military commando act, but i'm new at this, and frankly, this is a bit much."
5639,Gabrielle,"i'm getting her luggage back to her,and that's the best i can do."
7861,Gabrielle,"put the baby down, carlos."
7324,Gabrielle,victor!
7035,Gabrielle,"uh, that's impossible, because he's there! there he is!"
7153,Gabrielle,what the hell is it?
6786,Gabrielle,"well, who is it?"
5282,Gabrielle,"well, allison's mad because she's losing jobs to fourteen-year-olds, holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables, and yasmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment that probably causes short-term memory loss. you know, i just stood there the whole night trying to remember why we were ever friends. and i couldn't."
7439,Gabrielle,sure.
6712,Gabrielle,"sorry, no poker today. lynette had to work. want a margarita?"
6596,Gabrielle,we had sex last night!
7023,Gabrielle,"well,not unless we kill you."
6950,Gabrielle,"well, i'm glad you could join us, milton. it's good to get to know you before the wedding."
7122,Gabrielle,"yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize."
4649,Gabrielle,i just met the woman today.
6146,Gabrielle,not in front of arlos-cay! go upstairs. i'll meet you there.
8049,Gabrielle,"yeah, and i know that now, but--juanita, dance for your dad."
4609,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you know me, i'll survive."
5924,Gabrielle,"four months, and i've dressed like this for two of 'em. he's insatiable."
5748,Gabrielle,"okay.hi.hi.oh,honey,you were right."
6500,Gabrielle,"i mean, i knew she had a shot at the top five, but to actually win?"
7782,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was too busy trying to explain to her why m.j. doesn't wear a dress like all the other little girls."
4336,Gabrielle,"mama solis, carlos is going to be late home for dinner. it's just the two of us.what would you like to eat?"
6865,Gabrielle,okay. i'm sorry i disappointed you. it won't happen again. i better get dressed. i don't want to be late to the victory party.
5761,Gabrielle,maybe.but we don't have to make it easy for them.
5182,Gabrielle,i don't know. i hired a brilliant lawyer to get my husband out of this hellhole and he fired him. for no reason at all.
8146,Gabrielle,you just got home!
5519,Gabrielle,"then you better think of another way to get my pictures back.because if you don't,people on wisteria lane are gonna be seeing a lot more of me!ralph,luis,feast your eyes!"
6829,Gabrielle,"well, i wanna look fabulous tonight when victor's elected mayor."
4371,Gabrielle,it turns out your mother is quite the card shark.
8242,Gabrielle,really?
6023,Gabrielle,"no, i'll drive."
8405,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired."
4920,Gabrielle,"carlos, you son of a bitch! i am pregnant and it's all your fault!"
4302,Gabrielle,"mama, i'll be right back. i'm going to the store."
7257,Gabrielle,"uh, actually, i'm really cold. maybe we should bail and do this another day. you know, when it's warmer."
5709,Gabrielle,"well,thank you,sweetie.i clean up well for a wetback,don't i?"
6294,Gabrielle,vern? a moment.
8587,Gabrielle,we just bought you a bed. it's not even a year old.
4636,Gabrielle,the one i told you to clean.
8172,Gabrielle,i sort of do. now let's play some poker.
4909,Gabrielle,"well, not this one. 'cos i vomited in this one."
7027,Gabrielle,how's next week?
4365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've seen who you've been busy with."
8391,Gabrielle,you needed a job. i did you a favor. and then i brought you hot cocoa. why don't you ever thank me?
8410,Gabrielle,"well, i am so pissed at carlos. he is never home. and when he is, he's too tired to do anything. and by ""anything,"" i mean sex. are you uncomfortable?"
4848,Gabrielle,"tonight just, whatever you do-don't call me beautiful."
5315,Gabrielle,okay?
7609,Gabrielle,"okay, first of all, you're a pig. second of all, don't say things like that. ellie's my friend."
4710,Gabrielle,what's that?
8372,Gabrielle,it's been sitting on mccluskey's porch for years. i keep telling her how racist it is. first the candy bowl and now this? how many times have i told you not to steal?
5449,Gabrielle,was that hysterical?the look on tom's face!
7426,Gabrielle,"i'd say i'm one step ahead of you. i have already slipped into my pink lace teddy, and i'm wearing those whorey pumps that you love."
5225,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not gonna let you starve to death. besides, you're gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail."
4785,Gabrielle,am i? all i want is the same respect that you gave your dead mother.
6118,Gabrielle,"whoa! whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't take sides! police officers aren't allowed to take sides.i pay your salary."
4569,Gabrielle,what's that?
5380,Gabrielle,it's a joke. lighten up.
5500,Gabrielle,"uh,ralph,why are you telling me this?"
7434,Gabrielle,leave you? do you really think i'm that shallow?
5945,Gabrielle,completely.
5502,Gabrielle,"well,um,thank you,ralph,for bringing this to my attention."
4465,Gabrielle,"sure, no problem. there you go."
7252,Gabrielle,"no, that's impossible. he hasn't said a word. in fact, i've never seen him so sweet and attentive."
5949,Gabrielle,"no, no, no!don't turn it off."
8082,Gabrielle,"hi, bradley, it's gaby solis. i just talked to him, and he's intrigued. how would you like to come over for dinner and seal the deal?"
5557,Gabrielle,"no, we've had our differences,but that doesn't mean i'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.brr."
8370,Gabrielle,to find out what mccluskey's sleeping mexican is doing in my house.
8643,Gabrielle,"well, luckily, it's a big family. let her go live with nina and luis."
6136,Gabrielle,carlos. no trishelle tonight?
6685,Gabrielle,go ahead. yell all you want. you can't force me to take off this dress.
8671,Gabrielle,all right.
6498,Gabrielle,i won't. but thank you.
7608,Gabrielle,"well, how long is that gonna take?"
6056,Gabrielle,"don't you love this?oh, god bless tom for taking the kids camping."
8659,Gabrielle,vera wang! where are you getting all these dresses?
6507,Gabrielle,no. absolutely not.
5551,Gabrielle,"mm, not that long ago.look, i sorta told a fib,so--how many ""hail marys"" is that gonna set me back?"
8496,Gabrielle,"oh, i'd kill for a margarita."
7704,Gabrielle,"looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points. come on, juanita. show mommy what a winner you are. juanita! what are you doing?! juanita, stop! juanita! juanita!"
4532,Gabrielle,"say, um, could i store some odds and ends in your garage?"
4979,Gabrielle,so is susan coming?
5566,Gabrielle,"i wasn't, but i was thinking about it on the way over here.and i realized the ass i should be kicking is yours."
7326,Gabrielle,"uh, you want the fondue set back? fine. but don't act like it cost a bundle, 'cause it clearly didn't."
8280,Gabrielle,you're using me as an alibi now?
8376,Gabrielle,great news! you got the job!
6317,Gabrielle,"is it about the girls' makeup? 'cause i got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone. and i got melina some wax. i know she's only eleven, but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now. what?"
7106,Gabrielle,what? i spilled my drink on him.
6284,Gabrielle,"well, i hope it's more fabulous than this dress. i look like something ike turner would hit."
6659,Gabrielle,not much longer. this is our last date.
5563,Gabrielle,are you okay?
4162,Gabrielle,"i'm not feeling the grass! let's just get going, come on! we're late!"
6264,Gabrielle,"you must be tanya. i'm gabrielle. we're gonna be co-models today. now i don't know if you've ever done one of these big shoots before, but don't be nervous. durkin and i are old friends. he's a sweetheart. now just remember, he's the king, do exactly what he says, and you'll be fine."
8066,Gabrielle,"yeah, it sure is. i'll get you the want ads."
5109,Gabrielle,uh-huh. brand-new. limited edition. a little anniversary present from my husband.
6541,Gabrielle,i don't know. maybe it's because i think we're both-- adrift. it'd just be nice to have a pal who gets what i'm going through. why don't you play me something you wrote?
5269,Gabrielle,trust me. they're merciless.
4303,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, i'm not going to the supermarket. i'm going to the lingerie store."
8508,Gabrielle,"anyway, i know you must be bored silly, so go ahead and make your escape."
5353,Gabrielle,what?
5827,Gabrielle,you?you don't even wanna be a mother!
6511,Gabrielle,"oh, fine, i'll do it."
5472,Gabrielle,i'll tell you.your wife doesn't trust me around you because i had an affair with my teenage gardener.
5021,Gabrielle,who ever said you were the father?
6742,Gabrielle,"well, just so you're prepared, consider this my pre-refusal."
8068,Gabrielle,"oh, right! how are you?"
5613,Gabrielle,whoa!
7111,Gabrielle,"yeah, she asked about her father and then you smacked her. why'd you do that?"
4911,Gabrielle,"okay, do you have a rest room?"
6390,Gabrielle,"well,as you can see, i have more pleasant things to focus on."
4941,Gabrielle,"we don't even know for sure if i'ts yours, so relax. okay, and i didn't come here to watch you freak out."
5149,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7441,Gabrielle,i did.
5749,Gabrielle,it was all worth it.
8091,Gabrielle,hahaha--aw.
6700,Gabrielle,"look who's back, mr. cocky."
6178,Gabrielle,"well, that's fantastic! i get half, right?"
5407,Gabrielle,"oh, i hope that little creep suffered."
4392,Gabrielle,so who the hell is that?
8196,Gabrielle,why not?
7306,Gabrielle,crap!
7404,Gabrielle,"boy, you are just determined to make this awkward, aren't ya?"
6158,Gabrielle,"oh,god,yes!oh,ride 'em,cowboy!oh,yes,god!take me home,philly!you should wear a saddle!yes! yes!"
8677,Gabrielle,of what?
5208,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you're hurt but are you sure you're not gonna change your mind? i mean, there's no turning back after this."
6624,Gabrielle,really? i think it's been nice.
5525,Gabrielle,or maybe you just don't love me as much as you used to.
5126,Gabrielle,"um, i've been thinking, you know, about, um, everything that happened with john, and, and, um, i was really selfish and stupid. and i'm sorry. i really am sorry. that's all i had to say, really."
4684,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not interested in becoming one of your friends. get out of my bedroom."
7976,Gabrielle,"no, i want them to be close by. they could need me during the school day-- get sick or something."
5486,Gabrielle,okay.what's the 1%?
8057,Gabrielle,what? we can't afford this.
6618,Gabrielle,i did not say to humiliate me!
8094,Gabrielle,"i know. just listen to what bradley has to say, and if at the end of the evening you're still not interested, i support you completely. deal?"
5722,Gabrielle,who's the father?
7260,Gabrielle,"okay. i am so sorry. but in my defense, you were always gone, and you knew how needy i was when you married me."
6162,Gabrielle,"well, then enlighten me. how can i hit you so hard that you will never recover?"
6070,Gabrielle,"actually, we're getting a divorce."
8205,Gabrielle,"you know, maybe i should give this a little gander."
6359,Gabrielle,this will blow over.
4895,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just pointing something out. i'm a pretty girl. and pretty girls are never lonely."
7854,Gabrielle,"what are you gonna do, take up piano and get a contract with motown?"
4622,Gabrielle,"please, calm down!"
8576,Gabrielle,"hey. i know i disappointed you tonight, and i'm really sorry."
8322,Gabrielle,i should have done it sooner.
6443,Gabrielle,"the guy broke into the house. he went from secret admirer to stalker. for all i know, he's trying to kill me so no one else will have me."
7284,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. and say what? ""yes, officer, my lover and i knocked my husband overboard twice and left him for dead. okay. bye-bye."" i don't think so."
8100,Gabrielle,so--is eye care included in the health plan? 'cause that's obviously a big issue for carlos.
7936,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah."
7591,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend."
6177,Gabrielle,so it's a job contract?
7999,Gabrielle,it's a recipe i got from a diet magazine. it's--it's fish and broccoli.
7230,Gabrielle,"victor, it's not that simple. we have major problems, and you never have time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em."
7225,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. after everything i have been through? no! no, get out!"
5983,Gabrielle,"boy, those people just don't have a sense of humor, do they?"
4487,Gabrielle,"no, he doesn't adore me. he adores having me."
8592,Gabrielle,that vase is not stupid.
6773,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs. victor lang."
6174,Gabrielle,"uh, it's just that they're filthy, and i was gonna wash 'em for you."
8307,Gabrielle,"oh, shayla, he's lying. she's pregnant."
6857,Gabrielle,"you know what that sound is, fat boy? the sound of your career circling the bowl. yeah, you're gonna find out what happens when you screw with the first lady of fairview!"
7087,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i am done with your explanations, and i am done with just give me two more weeks, baby. whatever games you're playing, i'm sick of it. we're through."
5706,Gabrielle,"because i've read the constitution,and it does not protect ugly people."
7584,Gabrielle,you guys going for another walk?
7412,Gabrielle,"okay, he's gone. what's up?"
6479,Gabrielle,i'm on a date with zach young. nothing's ever gonna seem weird again.
7345,Gabrielle,it's worthless to you!
7597,Gabrielle,i can. she went after carlos and mike and karl. the only person she hasn't gone after is tom.
5151,Gabrielle,"reservation! you're eating alone, remember? and i have a feeling it's not the first time!"
5579,Gabrielle,"oh, this time.you are quickly becoming father crowley's go-to guy for charity cases."
5812,Gabrielle,"what the hell are you doing here, frank?"
4291,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something.
6563,Gabrielle,"well, he seemed to like me in the mattress department, so here's hoping i like him the mattress department. what? friends say these things."
4652,Gabrielle,"oh, right. oh, here. here you go. thank you. come again."
8407,Gabrielle,mostly gossip. you got any good gossip?
4444,Gabrielle,damn you!
5825,Gabrielle,what?
5704,Gabrielle,"no! no,you don't just toss people aside because of the color of their skin."
4612,Gabrielle,why?
4537,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i love you so much! i would give up a house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us, and have you home with me."
4426,Gabrielle,i think i'll pass.
7920,Gabrielle,what's to get ready? you buy a $9 sheet cake and fling a piata over a tree and bam! party time.
4696,Gabrielle,wow.
5731,Gabrielle,"you know,that's your problem,carlos.remember when you bought your car? you paid sticker.nobody pays sticker!"
5226,Gabrielle,of course you were.
6745,Gabrielle,"look, victor--getting divorced really kicked my ass. i'm sorry. just--next time i get married, i've gotta be sure."
8256,Gabrielle,"well, ice is solid too, until it cracks and you're drowning in freezing water. i'd stay in counseling if i were you."
6871,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. she looks just like me when i was that age!"
8531,Gabrielle,"oh, phyllis got tanked on cosmos and threw up on edna--so now we're back to planting crap. look, i'm really sorry for sticking my nose into that whole patty rizzo thing."
7366,Gabrielle,"okay, i made a mistake. i'm sorry, but victor wasn't entirely blameless. he ignored me. he used me politically. oh, yeah, and he tried to kill carlos. so i think i'm entitled to whatever he had."
5707,Gabrielle,"no. no,no,no.i want that woman's baby,and i'm gonna get it."
7316,Gabrielle,"of course! i-i bet he's pretty delirious. i mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person!"
6091,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see you got my flier."
7136,Gabrielle,"okay, just don't panic, okay? we're gonna get the salve or ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine."
6035,Gabrielle,"give me those! get away, those are mine."
7585,Gabrielle,you're spoiling him.
5728,Gabrielle,how much are you gonna give him?
6446,Gabrielle,"because when he breaks in and starts hacking you up with his machete, your screams will wake me up, and then i'll be able to escape."
6156,Gabrielle,"really? oh, so are you, big boy! yes!"
4188,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i didn't marry you so i could have dinner by myself 6 nights a week. you know how bored i was today? i came this close to actually cleaning the house."
8550,Gabrielle,"sweetie, you're 6. there's a lot of things i can do that you don't."
8362,Gabrielle,what? but--you two used to have sex.
7201,Gabrielle,"victor, it's me. i got your message. i've gotta be honest, i'm very annoyed that you're not coming home today like you promised. i told you i have something very important to tell you, and i wanted to do it in person, but now you're gonna be home for another week, and i can't wait. victor, i'm leaving you. i-- can't believe i'm ending my marriage on a hotel voice mail. this is very tacky. you're forcing me to be tacky, victor. i am not a tacky person. i am very, very classy. oh! hang on one second."
4751,Gabrielle,"oh my god! honey, that means we can keep the house!"
4855,Gabrielle,why not?
7374,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. he did. it's just--remember how windy it was that day?"
5537,Gabrielle,okay.
8562,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. tell him no way in hell."
7215,Gabrielle,"i don't have to sleep with him, just stay with him for political reasons. it's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op."
5257,Gabrielle,good. you know what? it's a little snug.
6967,Gabrielle,"as far as i'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time."
8179,Gabrielle,eli would have said that's more than most people get.
6707,Gabrielle,your speech--i liked it.
6451,Gabrielle,what? no!
7109,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. tell me. what's my reputation? am i smug and holier-than-thou? oh, no, wait. that's you."
5305,Gabrielle,"oh, please. what do you think?"
4849,Gabrielle,i'm not signing this.
5388,Gabrielle,"no, i mean it. i'm sorry. i wanna be a better person, too. i'm sick of being bad. forgive me?"
8684,Gabrielle,"oh no, i'm just at the grocery store wondering if i should buy a ticket. thanks a bunch, mr. hartley. so what time should i bring carlos to the da's office tomorrow? great."
6444,Gabrielle,"oh, and tell them what? 9-1-1, somebody broke in the house and left a six thousand dollar dress!"
8281,Gabrielle,"why? so you can go get another ""haircut""?"
4586,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't go too much farther, you're going to end up back in prison."
5322,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7298,Gabrielle,"carlos, please."
7753,Gabrielle,be glad you're blind.
6098,Gabrielle,"really? wow. well, thank you. okay, you've seen my face. now you can beat it."
5289,Gabrielle,"hi, guys."
7172,Gabrielle,just an old friend and his idiot wife. come on. let's go.
5110,Gabrielle,more than he knows.
6019,Gabrielle,"guest, carlos. i said guest."
4951,Gabrielle,what? are you crazy? he would kill us both!
5681,Gabrielle,"right, uh, lots of love.honey, can i talk to you for a second?"
6893,Gabrielle,you are rushing into this marriage thing way too fast. why don't you give it some time and see if you and me work as a couple?
7399,Gabrielle,"oh, that. yeah, i was a little blue, but the good news is, i've bounced back."
4310,Gabrielle,"and for the record, i am not one of those women who has a hole in her heart that can only be filled by a baby. i like my life. a lot. it's very fulfilling."
5922,Gabrielle,"oh! no, no. i was-- just changing out of my sweaty clothes.i didn't realize moving was such great cardio"
5249,Gabrielle,"fine, i'm pregnant. whee! now come on, we are supposed to be cheering up susan. this is a time of crisis and i think you need another scoop of mint chocolate chip."
5635,Gabrielle,"maybe,but you don't know her like i do."
8371,Gabrielle,no. why would you think that?
4445,Gabrielle,"father, i'm so glad you could come and pray for mama. please, sit, sit."
4822,Gabrielle,you don't trust me?
5708,Gabrielle,"well,first of all,i'm gonna show her one of our tax returns.once she sees how much money we have,i have a hunch we're gonna look a whole lot whiter."
6235,Gabrielle,it's kind of on the fritz.
7791,Gabrielle,"for how hard life is. i mean, i have to admit, when you told me juanita was bullying m.j., my first thought was, thank god! let her do the pushing, just as long as she's not a victim."
8458,Gabrielle,"hmm. yes, i guess i am a little on the small side. that's the drawback to having ones that are real."
5332,Gabrielle,"you don't have a, a window thingy."
6581,Gabrielle,"ohhh, zach!"
5840,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei,i appreciate your grief,but,really,you're bringing everybody down.will you pull it together?"
5457,Gabrielle,i'm not worked up.
6594,Gabrielle,"i sort of threw myself a little birthday party.so if you don't mind,i'd like to get back to my dry heaving."
6068,Gabrielle,nothing. i just-- i can't get over how mature and confident you are. you've really changed.
5780,Gabrielle,"oh,come on. i won't make you do windows tomorrow."
6335,Gabrielle,we'll do it together. we'll be very diplomatic.
7498,Gabrielle,"really? well, for a dog who's supposed to help us, she sounds kind of limited. sorry, but it's true."
8171,Gabrielle,"actually, why don't you let me pay for it? it can still be from all of us."
7097,Gabrielle,yeah! let's play!
8168,Gabrielle,i brought muffins.
5238,Gabrielle,how dare you think that of me? i have been nothing but faithful to you! since you've been in here.
6753,Gabrielle,"i want all the negatives of those photos, or i start breaking fingers!"
4902,Gabrielle,it is. its is. it's just the smell is a little intense.
5275,Gabrielle,"maybe, but i doubt it."
7862,Gabrielle,"do it. i need to hit something, and it needs to be you."
7052,Gabrielle,"oh, that's sweet. but to be honest, i don't like hospitals."
6727,Gabrielle,you're in love with me?
8237,Gabrielle,we're ready for dessert now. wrap up ten lobsters to go.
6120,Gabrielle,get your hands off me! police brutality!
4316,Gabrielle,you can't be serious.
8305,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit. i'm not talking about me. i'm talking about you and bradley."
4572,Gabrielle,"but, how are you gonna work?"
5554,Gabrielle,"ah,vatican politics.what's wrong?"
8015,Gabrielle,yeah. it's my hamstring. i've just been working out.
8080,Gabrielle,who cares? bradley's offering perks. what kind of perks is this blind thing offering?
7222,Gabrielle,"carlos, we were married. i was entitled to half of everything you embezzled."
6827,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you in love with edie?"
6805,Gabrielle,so here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to edie anymore.
6575,Gabrielle,okay. so come back when you're done. i'll wait up.
7413,Gabrielle,okay.
4918,Gabrielle,i don't have time for this crap. i have a party to plan.
5675,Gabrielle,"well,this is the first time someone told me i couldn't have one."
8118,Gabrielle,"i am gonna scrub that smug look right off your face. oh, my back!"
8572,Gabrielle,that's 'cause i don't have any makeup!
5211,Gabrielle,"david, i know you're the lawyer and all, but trust me, it's never a smart strategy to cover this up."
6662,Gabrielle,is that supposed to flatter me?
4521,Gabrielle,"yao lin, your kids are in their twenties. if it'll make you shut up--"
7573,Gabrielle,"okay, ellie, wait. you don't have to go."
5068,Gabrielle,"hi, are you rita?"
8088,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
7628,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6508,Gabrielle,i don't care. i'm not going out with zach young!
4881,Gabrielle,why would they call your parents? it's your account.
8516,Gabrielle,"all right, look, tom, i'm sorry, but i got a responsibility here. i brought you into the club. i introduced you to the horny homemaker. i just don't want you to--"
5484,Gabrielle,okay.
6384,Gabrielle,"yes, keep it coming."
8600,Gabrielle,haha--ew
8424,Gabrielle,"tight, just the way i like it."
5956,Gabrielle,"you're not going anywhere, not as long as you have my baby in your belly."
7986,Gabrielle,"hi, sweetie. how's our patient?"
7705,Gabrielle,"carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards, no one could find the candles. wake up! we have got a problem!"
8228,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i've changed a little bit."
5339,Gabrielle,"fine, if i do this, will you go?"
5306,Gabrielle,"of course, i'm sad. it's a sad situation. now, let go of me."
4312,Gabrielle,now don't be mad.
4728,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i don't want to go to anybody's house anymore. i'm tired of knocking on doors and making up excuses as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing."
6965,Gabrielle,"okay, look, no! i already married a man who put his career before me, and i swore i wasn't gonna do it again."
8674,Gabrielle,"ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them. you don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid."
5128,Gabrielle,"actually, the one you gave me is really nice, too."
5795,Gabrielle,good for you.i love that spa.
6830,Gabrielle,"vern, focus. it's never bad luck when i look fabulous."
7783,Gabrielle,i did.
4504,Gabrielle,helen! do you have a minute?
4481,Gabrielle,"susan, hi! do you want to help with the seating cards?"
8301,Gabrielle,"oh, no. she does. she loves him plenty."
7853,Gabrielle,"i am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full. the glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account."
4344,Gabrielle,mama solis. what are you doing here?
6932,Gabrielle,that must feel really great.
4582,Gabrielle,"and who is going to be changing the diapers when you're pumping iron in a federal prison, huh? i like my lifestyle, and i don't want you to kill it."
7340,Gabrielle,"edie, what have you got there?! oh, crap!"
5678,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies, carlos."
7061,Gabrielle,"did i ever tell you about my father? he had cancer, too. started in the liver, went into his bones, and ten months later, he was dead."
8540,Gabrielle,was his name carlos solis?
7238,Gabrielle,that's amazing. where should we go?
5526,Gabrielle,"if you really loved me,i wouldn't have to ask!fine,forget it."
4234,Gabrielle,"you did. well, let's see what you've learned."
4811,Gabrielle,oh that. mr steinberg?.
8043,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's wonderful!"
6708,Gabrielle,"well, you laid out all your positions. don't you want to get acquainted with mine?"
4374,Gabrielle,"honey, it was only a small neighborhood game."
5794,Gabrielle,"you know,it's been challenging,but i-i soldier on. so what about you?you look so rested."
4617,Gabrielle,"obviously, i'm not leaving my husband and marrying john."
8130,Gabrielle,yeah. just my kids. they really know how push my buttons.
4225,Gabrielle,7. three couples and susan. does that sound right?
8212,Gabrielle,"oh, that sounds so yummy. you got any?"
6115,Gabrielle,can't be too safe. you never know when someone might move in on you when you're not looking.
6635,Gabrielle,"yeah. check, please."
6282,Gabrielle,"well, if something great comes up, i might fly out, but i'm pretty settled here."
4955,Gabrielle,because i was going to get in.
6066,Gabrielle,who's there? i can't see you.
5424,Gabrielle,"sister mary, what a lovely surprise."
6307,Gabrielle,"well,let me check my book.i might have to move some stuff around,but i think i can swing it."
8306,Gabrielle,"i'm a friend of maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person."
4331,Gabrielle,"yes, it's form-fitting. you're going to look great."
6403,Gabrielle,to sabotage my new relationship.
5683,Gabrielle,"okay, this isn't easy to say,so i'm just gonna say it,but have you taken a good look at her?"
4757,Gabrielle,"ah, thank you, yes."
6697,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse of a guy i could actually like."
8009,Gabrielle,"okay, i didn't wanna have to say this, but you should never have surgery on a friday. the surgeons are thinking about the weekend. they're all distracted. next thing you know, you come out of the o.r. still blind and missing your right leg."
5260,Gabrielle,but i'm only three months pregnant. women don't show at three months.
5711,Gabrielle,so is that what it's gonna take to change your mind--a gift?fine. what do you want?
4360,Gabrielle,the coffee is a little hot.
8505,Gabrielle,there's some seeds in this. knock yourself out.
7541,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, ellie. there's been some tension between my husband and me. see, the truth is, we could've had the room rented by now if my husband wasn't so paranoid."
7401,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know, but i'm no good single. honestly, i don't know how you do it."
6087,Gabrielle,"sure, and i was married when we got together."
5854,Gabrielle,"no,xiao-mei,you don't have a choice.it's either this or go back to china."
6972,Gabrielle,"so what are you saying, i should marry victor because you're a withholding father?"
4372,Gabrielle,"not that long, why?"" ""carlos, what is it?"
5829,Gabrielle,i don't want my money back.i want my baby!
7317,Gabrielle,"don't strain yourself, victor. there's plenty of time to talk later. what's important now is that you rest. just stay quiet and rest--quietly."
5750,Gabrielle,shh. in a minute.
4657,Gabrielle,"you must be loving this, huh? having me serve you must be a dream come true."
5341,Gabrielle,"not really, no."
8176,Gabrielle,"watch out, ladies."
5274,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not saying i'm not gonna grow attached to the little bugger. i just don't have the motherhood gene. i wish i did, but i don't. what?"
5534,Gabrielle,stop it. let's just enjoy the here and now.we're together. our marriage is back on track. life is good.
8559,Gabrielle,i can't help it. i don't want people thinking i condone this face.
7589,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! shouldn't we hear ellie's side of the story first?"
4984,Gabrielle,"i just want to say goodbye, because i'm leaving you."
8016,Gabrielle,"no, no, you rest. you're gonna have surgery in a couple days."
6362,Gabrielle,excuse me?
5402,Gabrielle,"yeah,that's him."
7068,Gabrielle,um--sorry. victor needs me at this--political thing. damn. damn. damn.
7431,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you what's going on. ""in three months. four, tops."""
6429,Gabrielle,"carlos, just tell me. i won't be mad.i promise."
4516,Gabrielle,huh?
5874,Gabrielle,carlos! her boobs are none of your business.
7464,Gabrielle,hang it up!
6053,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's something."
5871,Gabrielle,"sweetie,i need some more cream."
8325,Gabrielle,i guess bradley told her.
5567,Gabrielle,"yes!sister mary manipulated you into threatening me,but you're the idiot that fell for it."
7095,Gabrielle,good point. mike! yes! let's get started.
5504,Gabrielle,"remember scott,the photographer i was dating when we met?the one i dumped for you,who never really got over it and who i always said was gonna get back at me?"
5861,Gabrielle,would i lie to family?
6129,Gabrielle,"oh, right, right. you know, i may be living with you until the divorce is final, but it doesn't mean i have to put up with your cheesy come-ons."
4185,Gabrielle,"he's still mourning, susan, he'll probably freak out."
8515,Gabrielle,patty lives six blocks away. i live down the street. why didn't you ask me to take you?
5155,Gabrielle,would those be the same instincts that picked out that cologne?
7315,Gabrielle,how is he?
6393,Gabrielle,yeah?!
7519,Gabrielle,"hi. uh, i'm bringing roxy back."
5303,Gabrielle,we all grieve differently.
5919,Gabrielle,barefoot?
4876,Gabrielle,of course you may. if you will just give me a moment.
6755,Gabrielle,that's for calling me a maid!
6004,Gabrielle,or the stairs. what do you want?
4430,Gabrielle,"oh, that's very sweet, danielle, thank you."
7246,Gabrielle,where's the crew?
5721,Gabrielle,wow. you're a lot smarter than i thought.
5689,Gabrielle,"i don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.we are hemorrhaging money into your bank account,and i expect to see results."
4471,Gabrielle,i don't know what his problem is. he's making money left and right. i just wish he'd relax.
5993,Gabrielle,"yeah, bree, i always thought of you as a person who wants time to plan."
4191,Gabrielle,"i'm not in the mood. but, we could stay up and talk."
7138,Gabrielle,that's nurse gaby to you.
4739,Gabrielle,in what way?
4476,Gabrielle,so word on the street is you and danielle might break up.
6676,Gabrielle,you do not have to pay for my dress.
5996,Gabrielle,i know he matches the drapes!
6949,Gabrielle,reception starts at four.
4744,Gabrielle,and please tell rex i said hello.
7892,Gabrielle,"carlos, don't even think about saying no to this!"
4179,Gabrielle,"i'll find them, just get out!"
4905,Gabrielle,"what? wait? you think i'm pregnant? no, i'm not pregnant."
7381,Gabrielle,"oh, al."
7041,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, but don't go! i-i need a little more guidance!"
4736,Gabrielle,i'm the one who stole it.
5642,Gabrielle,what was that for?
7213,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, yeah, about that--what if we make it 13? okay, no, just go with me on this. what i'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom and-- help a conniving billionaire's dream come true."
4236,Gabrielle,hey! what's going on?
4723,Gabrielle,"obviously, someone who's not getting it at home."
5742,Gabrielle,what?
8406,Gabrielle,"i just can't get used to everyone working--first bree, then susan, now lynette. thank god for you. i just had to get out of that boring house."
6400,Gabrielle,that's sweet that you're not jealous. carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me--would you excuse me a minute?
5599,Gabrielle,"absolutely.xiao-mei,you are a very special girl,so--so you take care, okay?"
7456,Gabrielle,"oh, hey there."
7848,Gabrielle,because she's the one who assures me that you won't get a baby brother or sister.
5460,Gabrielle,"oh, god, um, tom?"
6447,Gabrielle,all right. don't take the big one. that's my favorite.
4985,Gabrielle,"you see, your health insurance sent us a letter because someone ordered a year's worth of birth control pills, and apparently our policy doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo."
8001,Gabrielle,see? delicious!
8477,Gabrielle,so are we ready for this?
5651,Gabrielle,oh.
7856,Gabrielle,"well, i wish he'd stop doing that. nobody likes a fickle god."
8323,Gabrielle,"well, that means a lot, coming from a united states marine."
6166,Gabrielle,"i got a second wind last night, so i went to a bar. that's where i met jason. we spent the whole night how did you put it? pulling the trigger. so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
5323,Gabrielle,he thought i was cheating with two gay guys. are you sure you want to go with perceptive?
5120,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
4651,Gabrielle,no!
8051,Gabrielle,i didn't sell your watch.
6595,Gabrielle,"uh, oh, yeah. um--he just came by to, uh--drop off a birthday card. really cute little cat with balloons. all right, bye."
5266,Gabrielle,oh! thank god.
5408,Gabrielle,you! what the hell did you do with my husband?
5352,Gabrielle,"no, of course not! he's a moron!"
8254,Gabrielle,"oh, you're in counseling. that's great."
5011,Gabrielle,"when the baby cries in the middle of the night, you're gonna get up without saying one word. doctors' appointments: you're driving. i'm not putting a car seat in my maserati. and you will also be on bottle duty. that means washing, sterilizing, and filling. that way i'll have some semblance of a life, and then maybe i won't hate you so much."
7447,Gabrielle,sorry i'm late. blind husband. you know the drill.
4658,Gabrielle,"that's the difference between you and me, yao lin, our dreams. close your eyes, please. thank you. you see i dreamed of pulling myself up from nothing, and i did. i dreamed about the things i wanted and i got them all: a high powered career, a handsome husband, an extravagant house. so, this is just a blip in the radar for me, because now, i know what i'm capable of and if i did it once, i can do it again. i'm never really down, yao lin, even when it looks like i am. so, enjoy this moment, enjoy your dream, because for you, it doesn't get any better than this. there. don't you look beautiful."
6504,Gabrielle,what did you do?
5972,Gabrielle,"oh my god, you're serious?no sex at all? no even-- um--"
5252,Gabrielle,it is glorious. i have to have it.
6218,Gabrielle,carlos? honey? carlos?
6810,Gabrielle,"she will show you later! the point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch. they share enemies, too. so are you with me or not?"
7217,Gabrielle,which he did.
5627,Gabrielle,"hey--i don't know about you,but i am tired of all the tension around here,so i was thinking we could go shopping,have some fun.then maybe later we can talk about the surrogacy thing,see if we can make it work."
5391,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. guess i am bad.
6259,Gabrielle,divorce.
6853,Gabrielle,"i can do whatever i want! in fact, my first official act of business as mayoress of fairview--is to declare today free parking day!"
5999,Gabrielle,stop eating my fries!
6987,Gabrielle,what?
8083,Gabrielle,how do you sleep with someone and not remember?
5833,Gabrielle,"--which is crazy,'cause if you knew me,i don't do that.i don't do that.and--and my husband--my husband, he sings to her. he sings,so you can't take her away.it's too late. we've already fallen in love with her!"
5832,Gabrielle,"no, we've been--we've been feeding her, and we--we've been bathing her,and we wake up in the middle of the night and we rock her--"
6134,Gabrielle,i'm done talking.
8503,Gabrielle,"ladies, start your blenders."
6487,Gabrielle,"well, they were wrong. thank you for lunch, zach."
5947,Gabrielle,but who has the ring?
6799,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know. off the top of my head--dating your friends' exes."
6198,Gabrielle,it'll just take a second. please?
6269,Gabrielle,"it's gaby. gabrielle marquez. you shot me in milan, remember?"
7730,Gabrielle,"well, it's the caterer! everything is fabulous. but would you be a dear and get me some more wine?"
7830,Gabrielle,excuse me?
5360,Gabrielle,what is wrong with you? you are totally useless after sex.
4660,Gabrielle,he was shot? how could you not tell us about this?
4256,Gabrielle,her real name?
8521,Gabrielle,"and by ""do something,"" he means having me slave over a rack of lamb all day."
5169,Gabrielle,"okay, enough chit chat. we only have thirty minutes left and i want to make the most of it."
5816,Gabrielle,so why do you want to be a dad?these are your glory days.a baby would ruin your life.
8611,Gabrielle,"it was tiffany china, carlos."
4892,Gabrielle,you know i forgot how generous men could be. i also forgot i have options. a whole bunch of them.
4190,Gabrielle,is that white gold?
6214,Gabrielle,you are a bastard!
5620,Gabrielle,"what i want is for you to lighten up.we don't have a lot of options, and you're gonna have to pick one."
7405,Gabrielle,"okay, look, in the eyes of the church, carlos and i were never divorced. technically, the affair was with victor, and god smote him. so we're good. all right, yes, i've been a bad catholic. enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?"
5844,Gabrielle,"bree,you heard what she said.i can't let this poor kid go back to china and become someone's slave."
8128,Gabrielle,"okay, juanita. what is going on here? why are you being so difficult? when daddy asks you to do something, you just do it."
8661,Gabrielle,"yeah, the economy has hit us all. so--what kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?"
6532,Gabrielle,no! you've paid women for--
7952,Gabrielle,"this whole creepy, clingy ""i'm your grandma"" routine."
5056,Gabrielle,why?
7124,Gabrielle,what?
8279,Gabrielle,come on in.
6232,Gabrielle,"do you know how much i was worth?! when we met, i was on the cover of magazines. i had a career and a future, but i gave it all up for you, and what did i get in return?"
6342,Gabrielle,"of course not, bill. can i call you bill? it's just we feel that amy would benefit from some private coaching. maybe i could come to your house? say, friday, five o'clock?"
5114,Gabrielle,joan? you're calling her joan?
8030,Gabrielle,it was? i didn't know that. i thought it was some stupid collectors item.
8510,Gabrielle,"yes, she's like that. she'll give you the bra off her back."
5843,Gabrielle,"oh,no,no,xiao-mei,you're not going anywhere.hey,you're much too important to carlos and me."
7131,Gabrielle,can't you just call me?
8249,Gabrielle,hey.
7698,Gabrielle,okay. why don't you go throw that in the trash? and i'm gonna get the car started.
6326,Gabrielle,"no, it's true. you have husbands and families and a reason to wake up in the morning. what do i have? him. teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing i've done since--i don't know when. and as much as i've helped them-- they've helped me so much more. so please, i need this. and i promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods. like the highly effective, non-f.d.a. approved diet pill i can get from my friends in zurich--in bulk."
7949,Gabrielle,"well, she's not gonna leave her party to go buy a doll."
6489,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. i really wish you would."
5214,Gabrielle,are you seeing this?
8041,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's wrong?"
8215,Gabrielle,what?
6582,Gabrielle,you did not see the look on his face when i tried to kiss him. it's like he was sniffing expired milk.
8364,Gabrielle,except maybe at an airport.
7512,Gabrielle,"well, if you ever want to bond with my boobs again, you'll get her off!"
5448,Gabrielle,"oh, here,let me take that."
4591,Gabrielle,what?
4345,Gabrielle,"thank you, yoa lin."
7578,Gabrielle,"no, seriously. we're getting along better. have you noticed that?"
5368,Gabrielle,huh?
7354,Gabrielle,move your ass!
8224,Gabrielle,"well, they're crazy. he yells, and they jump. he tells them to run all the way over here, and they do it."
7871,Gabrielle,"well, i'm gonna find out."
4862,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about my life."
4996,Gabrielle,"well, you sort of are."
8035,Gabrielle,"so you see, it belonged to my husband's grandfather, and if i don't get it back, i am telling you, i'm gonna be in the crapper."
4758,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
7776,Gabrielle,are you suggesting that juanita is fat for her age?
6557,Gabrielle,oh. you know my friend zach?
8125,Gabrielle,carlos? carlos!
6021,Gabrielle,"hi there. i just wanted to say you're doing a great job, tad. that's such a masculine name."
6038,Gabrielle,what were you thinking setting carlos up with that skank?!
5607,Gabrielle,"oh.hi,mom."
5423,Gabrielle,"i bet she did. how much cash are you short, father?"
8660,Gabrielle,boyfriends? how many do you have?
4776,Gabrielle,"eyes front, padre."
7834,Gabrielle,"i'm not going back, carlos. i can't. if juanita doesn't get her playdate, you're not getting yours."
5265,Gabrielle,"get me into this dress, and i will pay you ten more dollars a week."
8293,Gabrielle,i do-- and so does my personal shopper and pilates instructor.
4425,Gabrielle,come again?
5733,Gabrielle,"okay,we're done."
8102,Gabrielle,"it took a toll on us when we couldn't pay the gas bill, carlos. it took a toll on us when juanita was sent home from day care because the check bounced. but i handled it, and now it's your turn to handle it."
4870,Gabrielle,with your student credit card?
8289,Gabrielle,"fine. fine. i will do it, but you owe me. i gotta go."
7323,Gabrielle,what?
8329,Gabrielle,were your coworkers. bradley fired you. remember?
5828,Gabrielle,so?!
7248,Gabrielle,so you're gonna drive this thing by yourself?
4640,Gabrielle,anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong.
4239,Gabrielle,"wow, aren't you the little artist. what are those, flamingos?"
7445,Gabrielle,"oh, please, carlos. i have a million errands to run, and i'd do it a lot faster without you. plus i'm having lunch with the girls first."
6192,Gabrielle,"no! no, you're not! you're a great wife and a great mother. although-- don't you have children?"
8124,Gabrielle,but---
8135,Gabrielle,"well, i know how much you love him, but--it was your daddy."
5310,Gabrielle,"no, it's not cool! who the hell are you?"
7360,Gabrielle,aah! it's here.
7432,Gabrielle,"""uh-oh"" is right, you blind bastard!"
5382,Gabrielle,what?
5268,Gabrielle,i don't care. i can't have these girls thinking i'm pregnant.
6226,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, give it to me! carlos! yes! yes! carlos--"
8027,Gabrielle,"uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so don't take this the wrong way, but--"
4264,Gabrielle,it's the cable guy. he's three hours late.
8667,Gabrielle,"all right, i'll see you inside."
5758,Gabrielle,that is after the baby is in.you have to connect it to the car first!i told you we should've got an s.u.v.!
4192,Gabrielle,"yeah, right."
7700,Gabrielle,"well, come on, then!"
6378,Gabrielle,you're kidding. when?
7836,Gabrielle,it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
5179,Gabrielle,the what?
6572,Gabrielle,"but can't it wait till after dessert? and by dessert, i mean sex. you are clear on that, right?"
8169,Gabrielle,"playing poker, and i wasn't invited. i know. i get it. i just wanted to tell you guys i know i made a horrible first impression. now you know why models don't usually talk. because we say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to avoid us. what i should've said was--my husband's never home. i miss the city. i miss my life. i'm lonely all the time--and i could really use some friends. anyway, here."
8652,Gabrielle,brought you a laundry basket. you need me to show you how to use the washer? it's my clever way of saying you're gonna be doing your own laundry.
4263,Gabrielle,relax! carlos is at work and he doesn't ring the doorbell.
4642,Gabrielle,you are so fired.
4990,Gabrielle,"oh, your baby?"
5197,Gabrielle,"okay, skip it. i'm holding my marriage together by my fingernails. if carlos serves his full sentence, i don't think we're gonna make it. so please, i need you."
5920,Gabrielle,hi there.
4597,Gabrielle,i'm gonna go get the mail.
4747,Gabrielle,"oh, bree, i-i can't take that."
8650,Gabrielle,"yeah, when i think about everything that little girl's been through--her dad walked out, her mother's in jail, the way she bounced from relative to relative--i just want this to be the end of the line for her."
7227,Gabrielle,"susan, hey, it's me. um, sorry to leave this message on your machine, but can you tell the other girls i'm, uh, going to be by myself for a while? i-- just--going through some stuff and need to think. um-- oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport, so i'll tell you everything when i get back. okay? love you. bye."
6241,Gabrielle,"no,i mean it.the rage that i have felt in these past six months--if i had had a gun in the courthouse today--"
8568,Gabrielle,"oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone."
6913,Gabrielle,see--susan was really upset--
6188,Gabrielle,can i tell you guys something? something i can only tell you guys?
7761,Gabrielle,$100.00
8149,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? you've brought me to a place where people are named ""eli scruggs."""
6993,Gabrielle,"oh,focus,you idiot!come on.when are we leaving?"
4907,Gabrielle,i'm on the pill for god's sakes.
4396,Gabrielle,that sounds like a date.
6397,Gabrielle,look at you! who knew you were such a romantic?
8351,Gabrielle,well--
7160,Gabrielle,"brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone? i see a lot of lawn mowing in your future. hey, it's me again. you're not gonna believe this. before victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me."
5434,Gabrielle,here.
4948,Gabrielle,john! what are you doing?
8679,Gabrielle,just get here as fast as you can
7050,Gabrielle,i know. do you believe that pie business? i thought bree's head was gonna explode.
5542,Gabrielle,"you are threatening me with an annulment?that conniving little bitch put you up to this, didn't she?didn't she?"
5872,Gabrielle,excuse me. what?
4482,Gabrielle,"oh, that! uh-- he was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking, and from your angle, it must have looked a little weird."
4146,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go. but i'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.
8337,Gabrielle,"anyway, juanita went over before breakfast to invite m.j. to her birthday party, and, well, candy plus juanita. you don't have to be sherlock holmes to crack this case."
5492,Gabrielle,have you guys noticed how friendly betty's been since that body was found in front of her house?
5792,Gabrielle,bree--i'm so sorry i'm late.
8578,Gabrielle,"yes, i was. and my whole life, people told me how pretty i was. so you know what? i never--thought i had to work hard in school or work on friendships or my personality--none of it. and then i stopped modeling, and i realized i didn't have much on the inside. and i don't want that for you. i want you to be brave and funny and creative--to be more than just a shell. i want you to have the whole rich, gooey center. will you promise to do that for yourself?"
4890,Gabrielle,"sh! we'll talk later, you're watching the game."
6499,Gabrielle,shh! here it comes.
4563,Gabrielle,bye.
8648,Gabrielle,why would i be nervous?
7902,Gabrielle,no! he's giving her orgasms?!
4616,Gabrielle,john caught me off guard. obviously i'm going to give back the ring.
6313,Gabrielle,"well, some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes."
5478,Gabrielle,sure you do.knock yourself out.call up an old college flame.rent a call girl.fly to africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.i don't care!
7080,Gabrielle,"yeah, you're lucky."
7458,Gabrielle,i'm not. my husband is. he's blind.
5796,Gabrielle,"oh,no,you must be mistaken. i just left her.she's at home working."
8331,Gabrielle,"well, what did he say?"
4237,Gabrielle,"oh, oh, no problem. nice to meet you, ashley."
4502,Gabrielle,"i do love him! i do! it's just complicated! you know, there's, there's got to be another way to fix this."
6969,Gabrielle,why? what happened wasn't your fault.
8234,Gabrielle,beat it. what?
6356,Gabrielle,i'll get the ball rolling. anybody have a yeast infection?
7684,Gabrielle,"""we""?"
4541,Gabrielle,"hey, how creepy is mrs. huber's sister?"
5586,Gabrielle,i like a lot.
6958,Gabrielle,what are you working on so late?
4836,Gabrielle,i told you i'm not signing this.
5608,Gabrielle,"no,i'm just surprised you're here.it's valentine's day.don't you and mr. hedgefund have plans?i know carlos and i do."
8579,Gabrielle,i tell you what. you can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.
4338,Gabrielle,"juanita,i had no idea."
6363,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetheart. i have a feeling i know what this is about."
4341,Gabrielle,carlos said that his father left for a waitress in el passo.
7442,Gabrielle,there you go. all gone.
7081,Gabrielle,were you widowed or divorced?
7780,Gabrielle,really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.
8284,Gabrielle,nope. he is not to be believed.
4368,Gabrielle,now give me a boost.
7930,Gabrielle,you sure you don't want to shut your piehole?
4265,Gabrielle,use the side entrance.
6179,Gabrielle,"that conniving, underhanded snake! thank god i broke into his desk."
6486,Gabrielle,wait a minute. who says i need someone to take care of me?
6195,Gabrielle,see you later!
7694,Gabrielle,juanita!
8239,Gabrielle,"you give it to me, and then call your insurance and say it was stolen? i didn't think so."
8538,Gabrielle,"oh, i hate splitting the pot."
8604,Gabrielle,"can you believe this? seven years ago, evelyn did fran's house. now? nohouse."
4542,Gabrielle,you don't think she is--
5687,Gabrielle,sorry.
6472,Gabrielle,fine. why does julie have a vcr?
5807,Gabrielle,huh?
5621,Gabrielle,so?
6182,Gabrielle,hey! cocktails? nobody called me?
6520,Gabrielle,"not quite. the day starts with lunch, and that kiss, off the table."
4817,Gabrielle,and when you get out we're going to have money to start over with. thanks to me.
4603,Gabrielle,what do you want me to do?
4887,Gabrielle,"hi, honey, look at my new shoes."
5602,Gabrielle,shut up.
5291,Gabrielle,that sounds so nice. it's just i'm booked solid today. my head's gonna explode. can i take a rain check?
8106,Gabrielle,"absolutely. come here, you!"
4246,Gabrielle,"sure, one of these days."
5441,Gabrielle,"so i finally said,if i'm head cheerleader,then nobody wears panties."
5965,Gabrielle,"i am the meanest person.you've been in the country a year.modify your nouns, damn it."
5925,Gabrielle,trying to have sex with you.
8028,Gabrielle,"damn it, carlos. what are you, a moron?"
5443,Gabrielle,"no, no, not at all.as a matter of fact,all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks."
5396,Gabrielle,"oh, good. good. so it would really help our marriage if you just backed off for a while, okay?"
6809,Gabrielle,"don't even get me started about what i've done for you, okay? i'm still boycotting madame kim's day spa because of your botched bikini wax."
7312,Gabrielle,huh?
5583,Gabrielle,"no, this is couture!this rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.you can't just--holy crap!this stitching is perfect!"
6205,Gabrielle,i've decided i'd rather catch up with an old one.
8207,Gabrielle,"shut up, mona. i'm puking air."
6358,Gabrielle,nope.
5705,Gabrielle,"well,that's different."
7500,Gabrielle,"no, it's crystal clear. carlos gets a new best friend, and i get to check the sofa for ticks. yay for gaby!"
6173,Gabrielle,"uh, why did you put those shorts back on?"
7868,Gabrielle,"my period's late, and that never happens to me. i'm like a swiss clock."
4694,Gabrielle,oh.
4304,Gabrielle,i may be a while. and i may get a facial.
4406,Gabrielle,bree--
4938,Gabrielle,i feel a wave of morning sickness coming on and i want to be standing on your mother's grave when it hits.
5129,Gabrielle,i don't think a conjugal visit is such a ridiculous request.
8561,Gabrielle,gotta go.
4554,Gabrielle,ladies and gentlemen. i present to you the fabulous buick lacrosse.
8155,Gabrielle,"well, it was before my husband moved me here to east nowhere. seriously, i don't know how you girls do it."
4243,Gabrielle,"here you go. top of the line, free speed, aluminium frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell. and you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes."
6322,Gabrielle,"but i'm helping them.they love me!wait,please,vern,you have to give me a chance to fix this."
7857,Gabrielle,great. so do i have anemia? is that why i've been so tired?
5605,Gabrielle,i want to have a babywith you.
5348,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's him."
6048,Gabrielle,"excuse me, you screw up our lives and the best you can do is, 'that's the way the cookie crumbles?' and who is this guy? why is he writing down everything i say?"
7289,Gabrielle,of course.
7898,Gabrielle,"paying him a fortune. but he's worth it. i mean, what he's done for that woman, no one else has been able to do."
8522,Gabrielle,"really? any favorites, tom?"
5896,Gabrielle,like hell she is.that is my egg.
6610,Gabrielle,really? did he tell you that?
5415,Gabrielle,"we are supposed to be working on our marriage, carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans."
8258,Gabrielle,who? him and maria or him and the blonde i saw him kissing yesterday?
4477,Gabrielle,is that because of me?
4825,Gabrielle,"oh, but i'm not. i have flaws."
4295,Gabrielle,paul and zach are fighting again.
4808,Gabrielle,"no, sometimes you do."
5511,Gabrielle,"and i would love to,but i have the upper body strength of a kitten.i need a brute!"
7362,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm a mess-- you know, on the inside, where the mascara can't run."
8154,Gabrielle,"so i said, ""pumpkin""-- that's what i call jon bon jovi-- i said, ""pumpkin, even if i could steer a yacht, i'm certainly not about to do it in 5-inch heels."" true story."
4395,Gabrielle,so cancel.
6185,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're drinking on the porch. you got a problem with that?"
8032,Gabrielle,"oh, don't look at me that way. i did what i had to do."
4735,Gabrielle,why should i have to wait? it's my port-a-potty.
6774,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs.victor lang.."
7278,Gabrielle,"it was self-defense, right? i mean, he was trying to kill us."
8059,Gabrielle,you should know that watch is a knockoff. i sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.
7567,Gabrielle,"uh, he did the same thing to me. perv!"
7893,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about mr. banks. i'll take care of him."
4777,Gabrielle,what's going on? why are we slowing down?
6094,Gabrielle,"so i should be punished? attention, shoppers, for the next minutes, free golf club with every purchase!"
6428,Gabrielle,i know. so just admit you sent the flowers.
7075,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. don't you think it's time to move on?"
5309,Gabrielle,"ahhh! oh, my god! what do you want?"
7568,Gabrielle,here's the thing. i thought you were a hooker. so i had lee proposition you so i could catch you in the act. but guess what? you passed the test. everybody inside for margaritas.
4672,Gabrielle,he has a lot of anger toward the government right now and he's just dying to find someone to take it out on.
8119,Gabrielle,"celia! juanita! i am not gonna ask you again to pick up these clothes! you've got till the count of three! one-- two-- three! you can hear me, right?"
5740,Gabrielle,"well,i'm siding with bree."
4899,Gabrielle,i'm throwing my husband a going-away party.
7085,Gabrielle,"oh, so you're not engaged?"
8047,Gabrielle,"oh, it's silly. i sold that baseball of yours. but you're right. you can see, and that's all that matters."
4507,Gabrielle,i'm the one who was sleeping with your son. i'm so sorry.
4149,Gabrielle,"this table is hand carved. carlos had it imported from italy. it cost him $23,000."
5350,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, this is her. did, did something happen with carlos?"
6908,Gabrielle,"yeah, and then you wouldn't be mad at me for the date, and i wouldn't feel guilty. and we could be brides--"
8344,Gabrielle,"thank you. i mean, it's sad how it happened, but, you know, when opportunity knocks, you gotta answer the door, right?"
5295,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know, i would, but the store has this strict thirty-day return policy."
6417,Gabrielle,sorry for doing this.
6693,Gabrielle,sorry. i wanted options. stop judging me. i was hopped up on couture.
5513,Gabrielle,"good morning,luis,ralph."
5933,Gabrielle,"you don't even have to say it out loud.if you see hymen, just give me a thumbs up."
8457,Gabrielle,"now, now, edie. don't be snarky. we're both hot, remember? although, apparently, i'm just a little bit hotter."
5475,Gabrielle,"you're enjoying this,aren't you?punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?well,i won't tolerate it."
4215,Gabrielle,"yes, it is."
5290,Gabrielle,"i'm fine. thank you for the messages. i'm, i'm sorry i haven't had time to return calls."
4986,Gabrielle,"the prescription was dated, carlos, and juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed. you did this, not your mother. at least be man enough to own up to it. she would've been."
6990,Gabrielle,i was--just counting gifts.
8089,Gabrielle,no. i think i should stay and clean this up. it's a--huge mess.
5763,Gabrielle,do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
6456,Gabrielle,your boss?
4602,Gabrielle,"well, why, uh, why would he do that?"
4130,Gabrielle,the police.they called me.
8583,Gabrielle,"i mean, i know it was expensive, but you can't put a price tag on beauty. am i right?"
7207,Gabrielle,and you flew all the way here to twist my arm?
8063,Gabrielle,what?
5045,Gabrielle,"isn't it bizarre that paul and mary alice had this secret all those years, and we didn't even know about it?"
5903,Gabrielle,"no! men can't help it.when they become fathers,they become lousy husbands,and some wives don't mind,but you didn't marry one of those women."
7994,Gabrielle,"it's okay, it's okay. let her talk. at least she's being honest. it's the kind of support and friendship i need right now."
5637,Gabrielle,"because--she knew exactly what was going on with alejandro,and she chose to look the other way."
8262,Gabrielle,"it's like you saidtheir marriage is none of our business. he's the one who's cheating. if we say anything, it'll just make things worse. we're the good guys here, carlos."
4534,Gabrielle,we're not into clutter.
7800,Gabrielle,"give me my money, or next time we're trading paint."
7638,Gabrielle,yes?
7626,Gabrielle,"so sarcastic, but what would you expect from a ""lynette""? what? if your name was ""francesca"", you wouldn't have time for sarcasm. you'd be too busy having sex on a vespa."
5077,Gabrielle,"uh, no. no. you, you seem to have everything you need."
8541,Gabrielle,"juanita, hurry up. the bus will be here any minute."
7922,Gabrielle,thank you.
7932,Gabrielle,some animated thing.
8594,Gabrielle,"well, you should've thought about that before you started acting like such a diva. now sit down. father crowley!"
4254,Gabrielle,oh he used to have a thing for spiked heels.
8272,Gabrielle,"i mean, let's be honest, susan. you weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together."
8471,Gabrielle,"oh, that's ridiculous."
5835,Gabrielle,"no,you can't go!you can't--you can't take her!you can't take her! no!she's our baby!she's our--no!please!"
7769,Gabrielle,"or i could get the radiator fixed, which is gonna cost $300, which you are paying for."
6704,Gabrielle,"and every time you say that, eventually gets a little further away. stop begging, or i'm not going to your rally tomorrow."
5168,Gabrielle,"no. i'm talking about us. our relationship, our marriage. carlos, you're gonna be a father. when you get out of here, you're gonna need to get a job and make an honest living, for me and our child."
5371,Gabrielle,i saw your nun!
7178,Gabrielle,"seriously, john, you have got to get out of here."
4647,Gabrielle,i am not a mattress sales person.
6032,Gabrielle,no!
4745,Gabrielle,"bree, hi."
8107,Gabrielle,i can't believe you're leaving.
5572,Gabrielle,i wanna have a baby.i wanna have a baby with you.
6654,Gabrielle,what the hell is this?
8313,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a real gem."
7546,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i love cash. cash and i go way back. so are you okay with this, or do you need to grope her, too?"
7630,Gabrielle,"yeah, the second that bitch gets home, i'm gonna let her have it. boy, you trust someone, and they just betray you. it sucks, you know?"
7950,Gabrielle,"uh, look, i'm sorry, but i don't want you driving off with my daughter."
7710,Gabrielle,i can see that. i can see a lot of things--things that can never be unseen.
4266,Gabrielle,how long are you going to be?
7267,Gabrielle,ice pick? what are you doing?
6202,Gabrielle,"well, i'd do it myself, but i don't wanna get a snag."
6024,Gabrielle,carlos!
6732,Gabrielle,taking my piece.
6298,Gabrielle,"all right, girls, first things first things first. if you can't walk, you can't win. hit it, vern!"
6274,Gabrielle,"ready, ready!"
4386,Gabrielle,"this is what we'll do. i'll sell some old jewelry, pay off the credit card, and carlos will never find out!"
5446,Gabrielle,"yes,i would have."
6159,Gabrielle,"stop it, phil. i told you to beat it. no means no!"
4297,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
5014,Gabrielle,"your honor, this whole mess is just a result of my loneliness. my marriage is a bit strained, and after carlos was convicted-"
8663,Gabrielle,"yeah. okay, well--don't take this the wrong way, but that's not exactly from the versace virgin line."
8480,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i can't believe we forgot."
7408,Gabrielle,carlos! i have a priest with me.
8148,Gabrielle,he has a name. what's your name?
8012,Gabrielle,no. we don't accept charity.
6175,Gabrielle,"i don't want to, but if you wear them one more time, they're gonna ask me themselves."
7825,Gabrielle,"yeah, carlos, stop that. okay, go to your room, and i'm gonna bring you something for your tummy. i think she bought it."
7018,Gabrielle,what?
7583,Gabrielle,"oh, on his-- got it. does it hurt?"
5409,Gabrielle,tell me where he is!
5366,Gabrielle,of course it did. everyone needs a strong male role model.
5431,Gabrielle,"boy, sister mary's done a number on you."
5914,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand.he's already dead.there was an accident.he's all over the highway."
7271,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you were trying to kill me."
7390,Gabrielle,"why do people have to die?! why, god?! why? why? why? why? why?"
7321,Gabrielle,of course.
4352,Gabrielle,"--i'm going to be exhausted at night--just like all the other wives -- till i build up my stamina, of course, but that might take a couple years--"
4795,Gabrielle,okay.
8076,Gabrielle,aren't they? daddy bought them for mommy - he doesn't know it yet - because he has a wonderful new job. he doesn't that yet either.
8259,Gabrielle,yeah. and brad saw me. why do you think your bonus jumped from a stuffed chicken breast to 30 grand in a day?
5646,Gabrielle,"oh,nothing,really.carlos and i are gonna go see the adoption counselor today."
8252,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a gift. sure, yeah. we'd love to help out. so what's the occasion?"
6402,Gabrielle,"oh, don't act innocent. you know you sent me these flowers."
5025,Gabrielle,you brought luggage?
4441,Gabrielle,what?
5335,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to think? you lie about protecting me and then you lock me in that heap without door handles so i can't get out.
4568,Gabrielle,"come on, honey, let's celebrate! sorry it's the cheap stuff. i had to economize. now that you're back, we can restock the wine cellar. let's toast."
5571,Gabrielle,"i think that's the right decision.you know,i made a decision, too.the answer to your question earlier is yes."
8349,Gabrielle,"look, lynette, you're my friend, and i love you, but as far as knowing if you're any good at your job--"
6233,Gabrielle,what? what are you gonna do?
4637,Gabrielle,clean it now.
7669,Gabrielle,"aah! carlos! carlos, don't just stand there! go get help!"
8166,Gabrielle,why would they want to talk about their lives? their lives are boring.
6752,Gabrielle,no! fifty thousand dollars? are you insane?!
6130,Gabrielle,"what, you've been doing some thinking, and you realize that i'm your soul mate, and there's a vacancy in your heart only i can fill?"
4912,Gabrielle,thank you.
6719,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. our mothers had the right idea. they let men think they were the only ones who needed sex, and women just went along as a favor. men begged for every crumb, and we never lost the upper hand."
6601,Gabrielle,"oh, you're--here."
5710,Gabrielle,please. do i look middle class to you?
7866,Gabrielle,got a lot on my mind. i think i'm pregnant.
4708,Gabrielle,who knows? it might even be fun.
7386,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet that was hard. so where'd you put 'em?"
5220,Gabrielle,"well, you protected me from a hail of gun fire, so i thought i'd stop by and give you a card."
6312,Gabrielle,i know.i never did that.you would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
7281,Gabrielle,then maybe the boat needs to go back out--alone.
4590,Gabrielle,"you know honey, tonight's the last night of the boat show. we'll be able to spend some time together before that home and garden thing next week. carlos."
6476,Gabrielle,"zach young! oh, my god! it's been ages. wow. look at you! so handsome in a suit."
6777,Gabrielle,"no. damn things traveled five thousand miles, and they were still moist."
4499,Gabrielle,"susan, i feel awful about what happened. susan, talk to me!"
4536,Gabrielle,it's not your fault. you didn't do anything wrong. i'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself. and you will be soon.
4681,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's not here. he had a meeting with his lawyer.
7072,Gabrielle,"susan, good news. we can come to the party after all. hey, you know who else you should invite?"
6206,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you think we're making a mistake?"
5839,Gabrielle,"i don't have an appetite.in fact,this is all gonna go to waste.you guys should take something."
5026,Gabrielle,the three of us? how exactly does that benefit carlos?
7380,Gabrielle,"hi. um, i'm a friend of al's, and i was wondering if i could see him."
5164,Gabrielle,"yes, we got it. uh, we interrupt our lovemaking to answer the phone or you call out the dogs."
5156,Gabrielle,"with all due respect, i will decide for myself what needs to be scratched and when."
5064,Gabrielle,"honey, i think this is a mistake. if we give in to extortion, the guy's just gonna keep coming back for more money."
6020,Gabrielle,you want a clear signal? how's this?
4527,Gabrielle,how am i supposed to live without a car?
4332,Gabrielle,"well,maybe i made a mistake."
7021,Gabrielle,"oh,far be it for me to speak ill of the future mrs.carlos solis."
8167,Gabrielle,"well, thanks for the advice. you wanna add that your bill?"
6270,Gabrielle,"i do. aren't you a little worried that i'm gonna pull focus? i mean, it's a little confusing. people are gonna see tanya, and then they're gonna-- see that guy, and they're gonna wonder who i am."
6895,Gabrielle,you don't mean that. that's just a big dramatic gesture.
6411,Gabrielle,hi. i received some flowers from your shop yesterday and the card didn't say who they were from. can you check the name is solis.
6948,Gabrielle,what? and just go to the reception? you can't do that.
4770,Gabrielle,pretty sure?
6917,Gabrielle,jumping up and down and hugging me.
4643,Gabrielle,mm.
6336,Gabrielle,"amy! for god sakes, little miss snowflake does not scratch down there!"
7169,Gabrielle,"uh, no. he's away at a conference, so i decided to treat myself to a spa weekend."
7347,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're moral all of a sudden? you didn't care where the money was coming from when you thought carlos was gonna spend it on you!"
6615,Gabrielle,"zach, a real man is honest. all you've ever tried to do is bribe and trick me into falling in love with you. a little advice next time: don't play games. just stand up and be the kind of man a woman would be proud to share her life with."
6197,Gabrielle,"carlos, could you come help me?"
4259,Gabrielle,can i say something? i'm glad paul's moving.
8434,Gabrielle,i hate that we have to this.
5429,Gabrielle,"carlos, you can't do this. you can't just go to africa."
6477,Gabrielle,"aren't you sweet? uh, well, anyway, i--i'd love to catch up, but i'm kinda waiting for someone."
7303,Gabrielle,you okay with tequila?
5177,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?
8133,Gabrielle,"hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?"
8629,Gabrielle,"well, then you have no choice. bite the bullet and be bitch."
8463,Gabrielle,"sure, you can, just not as many as me."
4584,Gabrielle,"oh, really?"
6063,Gabrielle,i know.i wouldn't trade with you for anything.
7282,Gabrielle,victor!
6870,Gabrielle,you did?
6717,Gabrielle,fantastic. as good as with carlos.
5245,Gabrielle,"i said i was catholic, not a fanatic. you know, david, you could tell me to stop. just tell me to stop, and i will, or you can have me right now, on my terms."
5617,Gabrielle,don't be so suicidal.we can always adopt.
8495,Gabrielle,"i know i'm new here at the garden club, but what's with all the gardening? i thought this was just an excuse to get together for bitchin' and boozin'."
7177,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing here?"
7551,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? it can wait. i'll see you in the morning."
4778,Gabrielle,what is that?
4689,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm gonna tell him how you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you. i wonder how he'll react."
7454,Gabrielle,"look at all these handicapped spots. i mean, what a waste. take that guy selling oranges, put him in a vest, stick him under an umbrella, and bam! you got valet parking. i don't know why poor people refuse to better themselves."
8003,Gabrielle,"okay, look. mommy needs to lose a few pounds, and it's not easy eating healthy with you two in front of me, scarfing down all the good stuff. so what do you say? you want to help mommy be beautiful again?"
7839,Gabrielle,"oh, we totally agree. kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days."
8532,Gabrielle,then why did you keep hanging out with her?
5039,Gabrielle,here it is in black and white. it's your kid. what? why aren't you smiling?
7521,Gabrielle,"well, sorry it didn't work out. i gotta run."
7132,Gabrielle,ew! how did you get those?
4877,Gabrielle,it's me.
4762,Gabrielle,what?
7958,Gabrielle,"honey, i'm home. you wouldn't believe the traffic--"
5411,Gabrielle,i was just about to ask you the same thing. you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
5035,Gabrielle,paternity test results? i know. i'm in the same situation.
4290,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something. i know it.
8181,Gabrielle,i wish i had one.
4654,Gabrielle,"hello, yao lin. how are you?"
6281,Gabrielle,"you know,just hours and hours of sitting around,looking pretty.but i think i'm done with modeling."
6080,Gabrielle,you knew about carlos! my cheating was upfront and honest.
4485,Gabrielle,this isn't about you.
7184,Gabrielle,"uh, does not ring a bell."
6921,Gabrielle,"i do, and i know you've worked really hard to make our wedding perfect."
4821,Gabrielle,"hmm, so the post-nup changes the terms of the pre-nup so that-"
4857,Gabrielle,what?
4560,Gabrielle,i guess i got too close to the turn table. i'm a sucker for these buicks.
5836,Gabrielle,"oh,no,thanks,xiao-mei.the poor thing.she was so attached to lily."
7977,Gabrielle,excuse me. you don't get to insist on anything when it comes to my daughters.
4706,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i've been broke a lot of times in my life. but, i've never been poor, because poor is just a state of mind, and right now you and i are just--"
8300,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's what i thought at first, and then i realized that's stupid. i mean, what about his poor wife?"
5384,Gabrielle,"okay, i think we should all just calm down a little bit!"
7946,Gabrielle,"hey, i seem to remember some melted butter on your bib, too. now how we getting out of here?"
5316,Gabrielle,"yes. yes, i do. i need my space. thank you."
6228,Gabrielle,"as a matter of fact, i do have a few thoughts.carlos, you're a dead man! do you hear me?"
8347,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you did advertising."
6737,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
4743,Gabrielle,"why? because it happened to you? bree, this is how i see it -- good friends support each other after they've been humiliated. great friends pretend nothing happened in the first place."
5078,Gabrielle,so are you gonna do it?
6005,Gabrielle,your mama's pearls? carlos! thank you.
7622,Gabrielle,"of course i do. carlos solis is the love of my life. but sometimes you get bored, and a big, greasy, disgusting handyman really hits the spot."
7654,Gabrielle,"i just found $118,000 in ellie's teddy bear."
4619,Gabrielle,"hey, bob! i get why she's so angry with me, but, what i don't get is, why you're so nice."
5157,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
5738,Gabrielle,"oh,bree could never have done that!"
6083,Gabrielle,don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new one and just launder the money through you?
8219,Gabrielle,are you out of mind? i have two sleeping children.
6086,Gabrielle,"well, i'm single now, and i thought we could maybe--"
7919,Gabrielle,why not?
4278,Gabrielle,carlos found this under the bed.
6406,Gabrielle,"bill is not boring. he is vibrant, and, and sexy."
5272,Gabrielle,what?
6424,Gabrielle,there. i'm done. let's go.
6537,Gabrielle,"i had a good time tonight, but i hated the way it ended."
6165,Gabrielle,but you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.
4363,Gabrielle,"well, who am i to argue with sociologists? wow this, uh, this guacamole has got a kick. i'm going to run to the little girls' room. you guys go ahead, i might be a while."
4272,Gabrielle,"for god's sake, carlos, it's yeolin's."
6491,Gabrielle,"uh, it was fabulous. thanks for asking."
5879,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. okay. sorry."
6041,Gabrielle,"lynette, listen to me. you and tom will survive this."
8070,Gabrielle,i know. life is good. now all we have to do is find him a job.
6914,Gabrielle,practically in tears over this whole wedding date thing.
5656,Gabrielle,"oh,here's one we took on vacation."
5018,Gabrielle,"my point is that carlos is an angry, jealous neanderthal. but he's not a gay-basher."
6127,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing in my room?"
7484,Gabrielle,"here, honey. let me."
8206,Gabrielle,it's hard.
7770,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? that's it. i wanna talk to your mother."
4839,Gabrielle,"well, that was risky, i mean the feds are watching you right now."
7273,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm getting pretty good at that."
6149,Gabrielle,"uh, feng shui."
6418,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna make it up to you, okay? once i'm done, i'll send you flowers."
4786,Gabrielle,at least she's gonna have a roof over her head.
6722,Gabrielle,"yes, it was."
8450,Gabrielle,how about bree?
7524,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i'm afraid i have some bad news."
6536,Gabrielle,you play that pretty well.
5138,Gabrielle,he refused to help me get a conjugal visit.
5713,Gabrielle,"well,here."
6018,Gabrielle,what would make you think i would have even consider taking you back?
6828,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
8544,Gabrielle,now march in there and wipe that stuff off!
7130,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
8354,Gabrielle,you told me you slept with her.
6765,Gabrielle,excuse me. excuse me. excuse me.
5882,Gabrielle,why in the hell?
7443,Gabrielle,of course not. i use a spoon.
7173,Gabrielle,because i want to feel pretty and feminine. ooh! my chili cheese fries! just a second!
5943,Gabrielle,"because carlos doesn't have an adulterous bone in his body.what we just did he could never do.for him, sex isn't just sex. it's a sign of intimacy.it's the way he shows love.you know, instead of talking and listening and spending time with me. what was that for?"
6037,Gabrielle,"oh for god's sake, what?"
7887,Gabrielle,what proposal?
4356,Gabrielle,"hi, john."
4283,Gabrielle,it did cross our minds.
4333,Gabrielle,while you get changed i'm going to run to the book store.
6608,Gabrielle,"thank you! okay, look, there he goes. go! go get all cholo on his ass."
8453,Gabrielle,too much?
4998,Gabrielle,"i am not lying for you, carlos."
4320,Gabrielle,so why are we arguing?
7039,Gabrielle,"uh, you, uh, have a birthday coming up, and, uh, i don't know what to get ya."
4958,Gabrielle,you sit. sit!
8557,Gabrielle,hi. nice to meet you. you're probably wondering why i look like this.
5826,Gabrielle,"no, no,no, no, no, no!"
7633,Gabrielle,"thank you. now please, i just lost a friend. stop being so insensitive."
4415,Gabrielle,i love long good byes.
6867,Gabrielle,"mm, it's not as bad as it looks."
4296,Gabrielle,mama solis!
5202,Gabrielle,"carlos, he's kidding. tell him you're kidding."
5201,Gabrielle,"oh for pete's sake, carlos. at least listen to the man."
8048,Gabrielle,"yeah, but it's just a thing. we don't care about things."
6059,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry."
7818,Gabrielle,really? you're so lucky.
7364,Gabrielle,no. i'm not thinking about money today. i'm burying my husband.
7867,Gabrielle,i know. it's crazy. you had a vasectomy. it's impossible.
5585,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
4514,Gabrielle,carlos! carlos! i am so sorry! i am so sorry!
7645,Gabrielle,"mm--well, it would be easier if i knew what you knew."
6392,Gabrielle,so where were we?
7330,Gabrielle,yeah. this afternoon.
8528,Gabrielle,"hey, don't snap at me. lynette's my friend. i was just watching her back."
5980,Gabrielle,i may have mentioned deportation but i didn't think she'd take it personally.
6114,Gabrielle,that's probably because i had the locks changed.
6766,Gabrielle,i am the woman in the photos!
6454,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're gonna give me attitude?!"
8336,Gabrielle,"we've moved on to my daughter, the thief."
4300,Gabrielle,"hey! i'm not going to stop my life just because she decides to show up. unannounced, i might add."
6109,Gabrielle,don't act like you didn't deserve that.
5037,Gabrielle,okay. we're in slightly different situations. but do you wanna get a cup of coffee and talk about it?
5470,Gabrielle,i can't believe you.i have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
7337,Gabrielle,"carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where i don't need a boa, then i don't want to go. fine. you could be a little bit more sensitive. i had to say good-bye to my friends today."
5948,Gabrielle,"so, wait, you're gonna get down on one knee, pop the question, and while you're down there, dig in his pocket?"
5558,Gabrielle,"me? oh, i'm just a humble sinner.you're the one with all the power around here--all the-- annulment mojo."
6817,Gabrielle,me? you two owe me an apology.
4734,Gabrielle,"carlos, i have to go."
7792,Gabrielle,"i used to be. look at my life, susan. i--i've been beaten down."
7799,Gabrielle,true. now here's a valuable lesson for you.
5723,Gabrielle,"well,why wouldn't she?it's exactly what she asked for,the most expensive one in the store.you know,i'm telling you,carlos.i'm getting really tired of kissing her ass."
6449,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm scared, but not of the dress."
7032,Gabrielle,one second!
5255,Gabrielle,"luckily, the judge dropped the hate crime charge. so now all carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing. he'll be out in six months."
5930,Gabrielle,xiao-mei--how did you rip your panties?
7353,Gabrielle,you just threw my money in a tornado. i am not getting in there with you.
7295,Gabrielle,"well, that's weird. what--what do you think that means?"
4353,Gabrielle,did you find out where zach is?
5545,Gabrielle,"who cares?father, it's me."
5145,Gabrielle,is this about the gay bashing thing? he's innocent.
8050,Gabrielle,"hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years. you have no idea what i had to do to keep this roof over our heads."
7729,Gabrielle,really? we'd love to.
6310,Gabrielle,i invited her to a party once.
6416,Gabrielle,"you're right,and i am so sorry for taking up so much of your time."
6571,Gabrielle,what?
6413,Gabrielle,"really? uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful, i'd like to know who to thank."
5643,Gabrielle,seriously?but i thought you wanted a kid with your own dna?
6155,Gabrielle,i'm what?!
6599,Gabrielle,"well, we were both half-naked, and there was a condom wrapper. and he said i was amazing, which totally sounds like me. he thinks we're a couple now. you have to help me."
7114,Gabrielle,now or before tonight?
4543,Gabrielle,"i'm not saying it's your fault, i'm just saying, fix it!"
6079,Gabrielle,how could you do this to me?i would never have let you seduce me if i knew you were getting married.
5927,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei said the strangest thing to me when i told her you were dead.she said, please don't kill him.'"
6796,Gabrielle,"i've been doing some thinking, and you know how--how do i put this? you know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?"
4437,Gabrielle,you need to keep a low profile right now.
6095,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, the gloves aren't just off-- they're 70 % off! get your cashmere gloves!"
4992,Gabrielle,is john here?
7188,Gabrielle,"boy, that was a close one, huh?"
8147,Gabrielle,don't leave me here. i'm going out of my mind. everyone is so boring and suburban. and how many freakin' honor students n that school have?
8137,Gabrielle,"hey, you're the one who told me to get creative."
6956,Gabrielle,"well, they're not gonna get us again. i made nice with fairview. i'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state."
7150,Gabrielle,that's what's so exciting.
4545,Gabrielle,don't you have a toilet to scrub?
6344,Gabrielle,after the harsh things you said about amy? i don't think so.
7187,Gabrielle,please!
6301,Gabrielle,but where's your confidence? where's your pride?
6289,Gabrielle,the divorce decree came through today. carlos is officially out of my life.
6938,Gabrielle,i just paid a makeup artist five hundred bucks to do my face. do you really think i wanna march down the aisle looking like i just ate a popsicle?
8183,Gabrielle,"the palm? as in, ""they don't even show the prices on the menu"" the palm? honey, we're still paying off credit card debt."
5753,Gabrielle,no.i'm not giving up the baby.
6110,Gabrielle,you peed in my shampoo. admit it!
6649,Gabrielle,"been there, done that."
4414,Gabrielle,okay. take good care of carlos.
5137,Gabrielle,he called me a bitch.
7286,Gabrielle,"yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives. it was self-defense."
4566,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
7176,Gabrielle,"really? because his father-in-law goes hunting with victor --you know, the guy who hired someone to tail us and possibly kill us?"
5918,Gabrielle,oh!why is your back all sweaty?
7874,Gabrielle,"katherine, great dress. you're gonna turn some heads with that one. i hope you're enjoying this party, carlos, because you're not gonna live to see another one."
5932,Gabrielle,"um, and, doctor, uh, while you're down there, could you check if she's still a virgin?"
7089,Gabrielle,"adam, i feel the tag of my dress sticking out, and i can't reach it. do you mind?"
5204,Gabrielle,what?
8365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i thought that was something we had in common."
4529,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. no! some of this stuff is mine. when i modeled. before i even met carlos! see this, costa boda, bought it when i landed my first cover. this, i spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting!"
5878,Gabrielle,oh!
6137,Gabrielle,"does her pimp want the rest of the money? you know, there is some cash in my purse."
6597,Gabrielle,"i mean, i think we did. that's what he told me."
8470,Gabrielle,what?
7348,Gabrielle,aah!
6725,Gabrielle,"i've been taken for granted before, and i'm not gonna let it happen again. if i'm gonna give myself to you, you damn well better worship me!"
7963,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that woman is crazy."
7655,Gabrielle,savings? nobody does that anymore.
4558,Gabrielle,"just doing a little shopping, trying to get my mind off things."
7417,Gabrielle,hero? why am i a hero?
6905,Gabrielle,"and getting married is scary, but at least we'll be doing it together. oh, my god! we should totally do that!"
4167,Gabrielle,come on.
4686,Gabrielle,"hello, justin."
5939,Gabrielle,"no, no, you were good.just, if it comes up in school, paul revere was never president."
5820,Gabrielle,"so my point is,do the right thing,and no one gets hurt."
8120,Gabrielle,"all right, that's it! i'm calling your father! you are gonna get it now! he is gonna tear into you! it is gonna be a bloodbath!"
7166,Gabrielle,okay. so-- are you guys staying here?
4402,Gabrielle,"oh, and i would so love to help you get there."
6116,Gabrielle,hello? there's an intruder breaking into my home. can you tell them to come armed? i think he's mexican.
4814,Gabrielle,if you didn't take the plea deal the government would have seized the settlement.
5787,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
8523,Gabrielle,"although i keep telling tom how dangerous gardens can be. everywhere you step, there are shovels and rakes and hoes."
7499,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was on my hands and knees that day, scouring the bathroom floor because you refused to pee like a girl."
5433,Gabrielle,"no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car."
6122,Gabrielle,"wow, you are crazy."
4774,Gabrielle,"so, how much did that horse and buggy set us back?"
7214,Gabrielle,"milton lang doesn't want me to leave victor until after he runs for governor. once the election's over, ka-ching!"
8432,Gabrielle,"i know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me."
5264,Gabrielle,"well, try harder."
6180,Gabrielle,"all right, well, let's just say something happened to postpone the divorce.i would still get my share of that two million, right?"
4340,Gabrielle,what did you do?
4991,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. whoever said you were the father?"
5465,Gabrielle,"well, i saw that tom was overwhelmed,so i thought i'd give him a hand."
5131,Gabrielle,excuse me! we are husband and wife. when we make love it is a very sacred covenant.
8412,Gabrielle,"yeah. lately, carlos just doesn't want to do it."
4407,Gabrielle,john--john--
5654,Gabrielle,"so,um,we're auditioning to be parents?"
7423,Gabrielle,"yes, sweetheart. i'm in the kitchen making dinner."
6902,Gabrielle,please. mike is not karl.
6688,Gabrielle,so what kind of orange is this shirt? like a salmon or a coral?
4771,Gabrielle,"uh huh. was anyone with her? an orderly, candy striper, anyone?"
6730,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you clever?"
6565,Gabrielle,"well, let's just say it's going to be served upstairs and involves whipped cream."
4520,Gabrielle,what?
8366,Gabrielle,"hey, are you still looking for a marketing director? i have a friend that i would love to see working with you two."
7516,Gabrielle,roxy--look what i've got. come on. come on.
6628,Gabrielle,now you're hitting on me?
4705,Gabrielle,"honey, i know. i love this place, too. it's just, i think it's time for us to face the music."
7438,Gabrielle,i'll work on it.
7554,Gabrielle,"that was for the ""useless"" comment, wasn't it?"
6554,Gabrielle,it was a--shameless sex joke. i was flirting with you.
7117,Gabrielle,"when you saw me flirting, you smashed a glass. when victor heard i had an affair, he started crunching poll numbers. i need a man who cares enough to explode when he thinks he's gonna lose me. i don't just love you. i love the way you love me."
6351,Gabrielle,how was it?
4323,Gabrielle,don't worry. i'll think of something.
6251,Gabrielle,"oh, see that coat i'm wearing in this shot? that's genuine ocelot fur. although the photographer was the real animal, if you know what i'm saying-- which i hope you don't. and don't ever do drugs, okay?"
8431,Gabrielle,"you're right, and i'm sorry. it's just--i'm scared. we're turning into what we used to be. i'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved. we've made these mistakes before, carlos. for god sakes, let's not make 'em again."
5452,Gabrielle,okay.
4570,Gabrielle,tell me what?
6067,Gabrielle,"your company? you have a company now?oh, my gosh, when i met you, all you had was a bike."
6614,Gabrielle,zach! how can you claim to care about me and lie to my face?
7955,Gabrielle,"okay, we're done here. good-bye. am i not making myself clear? get off my property!"
8429,Gabrielle,you think you can buy me off with presents?
4813,Gabrielle,because i couldn't trust you to make the right decision.
7406,Gabrielle,"absolutely. oh, but if i don't, i promise you, i will change religions."
4614,Gabrielle,"hi, what are you doing here?"
8025,Gabrielle,"can you see me, babe?"
6247,Gabrielle,"sure, knock yourself out."
6724,Gabrielle,"hey, you hurt me. if i have to strike back hard to protect myself--"
7013,Gabrielle,"neither am i!you told me you wanna run away together,and then i don't hear from you for a month!"
4844,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
5658,Gabrielle,"yeah,but it's st. barts,and your hands are covering my naughty parts."
4932,Gabrielle,"don't insult me, carlos! you've been whining about wanting a baby for months. who else could it have been?"
5029,Gabrielle,she doesn't look that busy to me.
7105,Gabrielle,sorry.
6776,Gabrielle,yep. she's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins.
5437,Gabrielle,poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar. now that's suffering.
6170,Gabrielle,okay.
8599,Gabrielle,"me either. my daughter's gotten so snooty, i am forcing her to spend time with the great unwashed. you wanna ditch this place for a cappuccino?"
7379,Gabrielle,"okay. all right, you look very tired, so i'm just gonna go."
6287,Gabrielle,"vern, i worked the catwalks in milan and paris. i'm not gonna give makeup tips to little miss training bra."
5788,Gabrielle,"oh,you're welcome.all right,lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.i don't wanna miss my yoga class."
4901,Gabrielle,eight months. six with good behaviour.
5027,Gabrielle,you don't know it's your baby. i don't even know it's your baby. and i don't wanna know 'cause it doesn't matter!
6721,Gabrielle,thank you. you can go now. i don't want to take any more time out of your busy schedule.
7349,Gabrielle,aah! edie!
5845,Gabrielle,"all right.look,my friends wanna take some of this to go,so pack it up,and we're a little low on coffee."
8547,Gabrielle,"he's right, sweetie. you don't need all that gunk on your face."
5915,Gabrielle,"oh, honey!oh, you're not dead!"
7915,Gabrielle,"what the hell? you're never too young to see paris, right?"
7472,Gabrielle,i just have to drop off a gift to my manicurist. why don't you listen to the radio?
5514,Gabrielle,"good morning,honey."
8192,Gabrielle,"jean, carlos is taking me to the palm, not out for hoagies. make it perfect."
7056,Gabrielle,why don't i go check if there are some other ones?
5616,Gabrielle,"well,the doctor's not 100% positive,but it's very,very iffy."
6013,Gabrielle,i said it was a theory.
7060,Gabrielle,you think i don't care?
5239,Gabrielle,"and you know what? a lesser woman would let you rot in here, but i'm not gonna do that. i'm not gonna give you the satisfaction. so you better start packing up your shanks or whatever you people make in here, because you're coming home with me!"
7939,Gabrielle,what?
6979,Gabrielle,"i don't know and i don't care. today, i'm so filled with love, i can forgive anyone anything. oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security."
4896,Gabrielle,we made a deal. no kids.
6525,Gabrielle,when did i say that?
7328,Gabrielle,"you would think so, but no such luck. that vindictive have told victor everything."
8542,Gabrielle,there's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.
4157,Gabrielle,absolutely not. you are much too young to smoke.
8615,Gabrielle,"i didn't think so. you were always so classy. 20,40,60-- was it drugs?"
5395,Gabrielle,"look, i don't mean any disrespect. it's just now that carlos is home, we need to get back on our routine, and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church and charity bake sales. we need us time. do you know what i mean?"
8388,Gabrielle,what do you mean by affectionate?
7563,Gabrielle,what is he wearing? he looks like the lost member of wham!
5997,Gabrielle,and i want my pearl necklace back. don't think i didn't notice that you swiped it.
6017,Gabrielle,perfect.
5544,Gabrielle,"oh, um, i'm looking for father crowley.do you know where he is?"
8501,Gabrielle,"okay, so the lush gives us six. what about them?"
5050,Gabrielle,"that's ridiculous. you're my husband. i love you. obviously, i would come visit."
4843,Gabrielle,"that? uh, oh carlos just got a little rough, made me sign some papers."
8087,Gabrielle,"come on. you were with a plumber and a housepainter. i mean, let's face it - you like your service providers."
6140,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i do. phil, come meet my basically ex-husband--"
7966,Gabrielle,virginia! why can't i stay mad at you?
6102,Gabrielle,"no, that's how she got crabs. poor bunny. it's always something. if it's not the clap, it's a botched face-lift."
4917,Gabrielle,i want to know who to be angry at.
4906,Gabrielle,"well, you assumed wrong."
7881,Gabrielle,"or--we use birth control, and i'm talking double-bagging, at least until we both decide it's a good idea."
7304,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you'll find this has a real kick."
7270,Gabrielle,"well, i came back for you, didn't i?"
5953,Gabrielle,"i had a reason to. you were never here! i've been here, carlos.i have tried so hard to not be selfish and to put your needs above mine.i mean, for god sakes, look at me!i have agreed to be a mother for you!"
8346,Gabrielle,i don't know.
6478,Gabrielle,"wow, someone got an advance on their allowance."
6248,Gabrielle,"i think you mean vogue, sweetie."
5975,Gabrielle,"come on out, i have your lunch.xiao mei! xiao mei!"
8227,Gabrielle,really?
5672,Gabrielle,"carlos,we're catholics,okay?god is pretty johnny one note on the whole subject of procreation.hey,and will you stop with this defeatist attitude?okay,do you wanta baby or not?"
5562,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!oh, my god! hold on!"
6885,Gabrielle,only because i admire your taste. it's not theft. it's an homage.
6640,Gabrielle,there was no accident. i know you told your chauffeur to ram my car.
5806,Gabrielle,"she's never too young to start accessorizing.besides, all the neighbors are out today,and i want them to see how happy we are and wish they were us."
7433,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i think it was a fantastic plan. i mean, there's no way i ever would have figured out that i was married to a permanently blind guy!"
7474,Gabrielle,where the hell have you been?
6412,Gabrielle,yeah.
6434,Gabrielle,it would've been nice if someone else could've found you.there was a whole lot of drama around here.
7686,Gabrielle,thank you.
4759,Gabrielle,don't you think that's a little over the top?
6873,Gabrielle,"oh, susan! julie told me about ian. i am so sorry. you must be devastated."
4381,Gabrielle,juanita!
7565,Gabrielle,"oh, crap! abort! abort!"
4175,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
7532,Gabrielle,he called you? why didn't he ask me?
4904,Gabrielle,"yeah, why has it been going around?"
5254,Gabrielle,i know i haven't been to the store lately but i've been a little busy getting my husband out of jail.
6923,Gabrielle,press? at our wedding?
5013,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, if you can swing that one, more power to you."
8620,Gabrielle,"i don't agree, fran. you know, carlos went blind for five years. we went broke. we almost lost our house. but we worked our asses off and we made it back."
5527,Gabrielle,be a good person.knock yourself out.
6653,Gabrielle,"oh, stop it. you cannot be that hard up."
4235,Gabrielle,i don't know. hey! you!
8398,Gabrielle,but can't lucy cover it?
7816,Gabrielle,"aw. what's it like, carlos?"
4832,Gabrielle,"so sophie, susan said you're going to the spa tomorrow. is that an all day thing?"
6343,Gabrielle,great! it's a date.
4787,Gabrielle,whatcha doing?
8064,Gabrielle,you quit?! why?
6539,Gabrielle,so stop doing it. stop buying people.
6051,Gabrielle,i feel so--
5242,Gabrielle,"this, us, stolen moments, seeing each other whenever we can. carlos never needs to know."
6968,Gabrielle,"god, milton, the newspaper's not even here yet."
8596,Gabrielle,fran schulman? fran. it's gabrielle solis from the tennis club.
4746,Gabrielle,what's up?
4206,Gabrielle,"oh, john."
5786,Gabrielle,"oh,no,xiao-mei,that's okay. that's okay. i know you were up all night with the baby,and i really appreciate it.you know,i'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for lily.so to thank you,i bought you a gift certificate to my spa.and you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself."
8474,Gabrielle,now come on. let's go to my house. let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
5717,Gabrielle,really?just like that?
7992,Gabrielle,"i know. it's just--he's been through so much these past five years, and he's never complained. i just think he deserves to open his eyes to a wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants."
7049,Gabrielle,"hey, what's up?"
6219,Gabrielle,"oh, hon, again?"
5601,Gabrielle,"carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.she would have been the best damn maid ever."
6904,Gabrielle,"honey, you're gonna be okay. all right? we're gonna help each other through this."
6889,Gabrielle,"it was short notice, okay? these people are booked months in advance. the only people available were thones you just bailed on."
4737,Gabrielle,"thank you so much, bree. seeing your tile has really helped me make my decision. next time i remodel, i am using limestone."
5673,Gabrielle,"well,then who the hell does?i mean,look at all the idiots popping kids.okay,they're not any more qualified than we are."
7772,Gabrielle,really?
6535,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm just a little--grossed out, that's all!"
5171,Gabrielle,"no, it's his foot."
7855,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had. but it's not just about the money, carlos. it's-- oh, after my miscarriage, i gave up on this dream. i just figured god decided i couldn't possibly be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen."
8447,Gabrielle,"oh, i feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar."
7579,Gabrielle,"me, too. it's impossible to argue with her in the house. she makes us laugh. she takes you off my hands every once in a while."
6677,Gabrielle,"trust me, it was a steal. i'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off."
4634,Gabrielle,what did you say?
7026,Gabrielle,"well,it's hard when you're so busy.maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks a month.let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with."
5743,Gabrielle,we were supposed to have four weeks.she promised me the baby wasn't due for four more weeks.
8225,Gabrielle,what the hell for?
8194,Gabrielle,"no, not that story. something about a boot camp."
7889,Gabrielle,"$50,000?"
7339,Gabrielle,"who cares?! thanks to her, i'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe. so do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase, ""that conniving skank."" ya think you can do that?"
4440,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sakes, between you and carlos! listen to me carefully, you didn't do anything wrong."
6584,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay? just for a minute."
5207,Gabrielle,are you sure?
4731,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm materialistic? when the johnson's bought their new 7-series, you were the one who went right in and traded in his car for something better."
4241,Gabrielle,okay! so we're good. right?
7006,Gabrielle,"i'm not waiting for anything.oh,look,a moving van."
8419,Gabrielle,"oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now."
5413,Gabrielle,there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
7956,Gabrielle,back off!
5317,Gabrielle,you said you were leaving.
6890,Gabrielle,"oh, i see what you're getting at. and you know what? you are right. you have been my de facto wedding planner, and you deserve to get paid. all right, what's the going rate? seven thousand? eight thousand?"
5017,Gabrielle,"he knows how men look at me, and, well, i, i didn't exactly ease his mind. i falsely led him to believe i was having an affair. and, and before carlos's house arrest, he was always working, and he was never with me. and i thought that maybe if he believed i was having an affair, he would realize he loved me. and i know it sounds stupid, i do. i just-"
8321,Gabrielle,i'm so sorry.
7746,Gabrielle,"now it's official. i've lost everything. first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
5649,Gabrielle,"no,i'm good."
7064,Gabrielle,you promise? 'cause if i did--then--god! i'm such a mess.
8549,Gabrielle,"well, it's a big, fancy dinner. of course."
6408,Gabrielle,yeah.
8132,Gabrielle,yeah. it's very effective.
7764,Gabrielle,"guys, hey, knock it off back there. oh, god. what now?"
5824,Gabrielle,yes?
7539,Gabrielle,"well, you know--anyhow, uh, you have a great credit score."
5178,Gabrielle,about time.
8518,Gabrielle,"all right, tom, you leave me no choice. you are no longer allowed to see patty."
7359,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i'm still sorry, though."
8530,Gabrielle,hey.
7617,Gabrielle,"okay, okay. we're going."
8202,Gabrielle,"hey, i know some of those women in your exercise class. the most exercise they ever get is cutting a piece of cake."
6186,Gabrielle,show-offs.
7811,Gabrielle,"carlos, the only time you and i have to ourselves is late at night, but by that time, we're too exhausted. and now that we have celia in afternoon preschool, all we have to do is unload juanita, and then we can get back to doing the nasty."
6772,Gabrielle,the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
8062,Gabrielle,"yeah, pretty. what? you're gonna be late for work."
7055,Gabrielle,"oh, sorry. i stopped off to get you some magazines."
5148,Gabrielle,only if it ends with me getting what i want.
7896,Gabrielle,"oh, i need to sweet-talk him into giving carlos two months off."
4579,Gabrielle,i worked ten hours today. i'll go by tomorrow. she doesn't even know when i'm there.
4577,Gabrielle,"you know, edie, i'd love to go, but, um, i just got back into modeling, you know, just for fun, and i have a gig tomorrow. i can't leave 'em hanging."
4872,Gabrielle,i can't.
7505,Gabrielle,"do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now? just because you're blind, the world should suffer?"
4797,Gabrielle,uh huh.
6047,Gabrielle,how could this have happened? what kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
6583,Gabrielle,"ah, that's so sweet--but it's a lie. every tick of the clock takes away something. zach, what am i gonna do when i'm not pretty anymore?"
7820,Gabrielle,"no, i think we're done."
8170,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. what?
6977,Gabrielle,it means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
8423,Gabrielle,i forgot these were in the nightstand. this is gonna be fun.
5686,Gabrielle,"fine. just know that in a couple of days,when that thing is born,and you're gonna have to cuddle and snuggle up with something with that face on it, don't come crying to me."
6382,Gabrielle,are you kidding? what could be more romantic?
7665,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, can you carry the house keys? they don't fit in my purse."
4488,Gabrielle,"i have some not-so-awesome news, so you go first."
6277,Gabrielle,where do you get off talking to me like that? i shot thirty-six covers by the time i was twenty!
8676,Gabrielle,"and the teenager has finally arrived. ana, listen. we want you to be part of this family. we will love you and support you and take care of you, but in exchange, you will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules, which means doing your own chores, no boys in the house and no more gifts from men."
6268,Gabrielle,"excuse me, durkin?"
6278,Gabrielle,do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again?
6254,Gabrielle,"well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. i'm just gonna fly to new york, meet with my old agent and take it from there. come on, you guys, this is exciting. be happy for me."
6320,Gabrielle,"fine, i may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning. i didn't say anything inappropriate for kids."
6190,Gabrielle,"anyway, what if i never find that passion with anybody else?"
4153,Gabrielle,yes.
4497,Gabrielle,you really do look fantastic.
7053,Gabrielle,"what, is this a test of our friendship?"
6221,Gabrielle,"oh, he's cute!"
5072,Gabrielle,"um, hello! is there a problem?"
6996,Gabrielle,"oh,my god! is she okay?"
5570,Gabrielle,"no, carlos, i am sorry.i am not gonna be blackmailed into giving birth.you have to choose.and i wish you would do it so i can move on with my life."
5394,Gabrielle,"sorry. he's such an animal but since we have a couple of minutes, why don't we, uh, chat?"
4726,Gabrielle,i've been to bree's twice today.
8200,Gabrielle,"not tough enough? let me tell you something, mr. iraqi army guy."
5297,Gabrielle,"carlos, your hands."
5147,Gabrielle,why does everybody have a problem with me having sex with my husband?
8460,Gabrielle,"okay, you really think you're hotter than me?"
6423,Gabrielle,"okay, i see what you mean."
4631,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
8071,Gabrielle,why? you need someone?
6132,Gabrielle,"lynette, you're not serious."
7477,Gabrielle,what smell?
8589,Gabrielle,who told you that?
5059,Gabrielle,"well, how much money?"
8598,Gabrielle,so what are you doing here? are you volunteering?
6854,Gabrielle,free parking!
7148,Gabrielle,"absolutely. it's kind of exciting, though."
6778,Gabrielle,"wait, wait. you're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast, are you?"
6609,Gabrielle,hey. so how'd it go?
6380,Gabrielle,how did you find that out?
4667,Gabrielle,you want to mow my lawn for free?
7491,Gabrielle,"if it for anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it."
4638,Gabrielle,because i said so.
4592,Gabrielle,"don't talk like that. everything is going to be fine. we're going to sort this mess out, and you're gonna be on top again."
6152,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.no offense,you're a nice guy.i'm just not into you that way.oh,god,phil! yes,yes,give it to me!"
8198,Gabrielle,here you go. all signed.
5038,Gabrielle,yeah. us girls have to stick together. we shouldn't let a stupid piece of paper ruin our life.
7991,Gabrielle,oh.
4718,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, no, it's not the money. it's just, uh, carlos and i are trying to prioritize some little things we need to do around the house."
7731,Gabrielle,"the bowmans. i found out mrs. bowman is home with the flu. score! oh, will you unclench? it'll be fine."
5203,Gabrielle,"honey. i am so sorry. honestly, that guy's insane!"
4346,Gabrielle,it's a big house. i need help.
4326,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sake, bree, you're a woman. manipulate him. it's what we do!"
7542,Gabrielle,you're as blind as a fruit bat. how would you know if he's a bodybuilder?
8567,Gabrielle,"ladies! attention, please. i am in a jam, and i need lipstick and eyeliner. come on. chop chop."
4552,Gabrielle,"a warrior princess? mr. gibbs. i am a professional model. look at this bone structure. this face is a cash cow, and if you don't have the vision to take advantage of that, then maybe i'm at the wrong agency."
6784,Gabrielle,"edie, are you okay?"
6135,Gabrielle,he despised you for saying no?
4285,Gabrielle,we had no idea.
6054,Gabrielle,see you then.
7062,Gabrielle,"i'm not finished. those last weeks, every day we thought we were gonna lose him. and every day, before i would go into his room, my mom would say, ""no tears"". daddy wants to see you smiling. if you're gonna cry, you can't go in"". so--on the last night--i sat there and i watched him die. his eyes were closed, but i thought he could still see me. so i kept smiling--all night. i was 5."
5321,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
8417,Gabrielle,hi there.
6181,Gabrielle,"i know how carlos thinks. more importantly, what he thinks with."
7220,Gabrielle,"mm. oh, wait, wait, wait. if this is tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?"
8298,Gabrielle,i need a fresh look. i've been going through some pretty intense personal stuff lately.
6339,Gabrielle,"i'm always diplomatic. now just get in there, you spineless 'mo."""
6617,Gabrielle,"i'm not mad, zach. i'm done!"
4783,Gabrielle,take the plea!
6200,Gabrielle,"huh. weird. well, you know what? i don't wanna be late, so i should, um, probably change."
4576,Gabrielle,"yeah, but this is different. someone was actually murdered on our street."
5489,Gabrielle,okay! okay!i get your point.
5663,Gabrielle,you're in advertising.you can do it.just write us a character reference saying we're great with kids.
4418,Gabrielle,do you have a cell phone?
4742,Gabrielle,i don't know. probably for the same reason you didn't tell me rex was one of maisy's clients.
6671,Gabrielle,"okay, ""a,"" i'm not your girlfriend, and ""b,"" she's not gonna find out unless you tell her. come on! a dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen. every day it hangs in the closet, an angel loses its wings."
6543,Gabrielle,"wow. why don't you just hum it, okay?"
6128,Gabrielle,"god, carlos! strawberries and champagne? did you really think you're gonna seduce me?"
8461,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, i have a vodka soda here that says otherwise."
6657,Gabrielle,"apparently, the water heater in the attic had burst. everything is ruined. my clothes, my shoes, dresses. why are you smiling?"
6117,Gabrielle,"all right, but we're going through a very messy divorce, and he moved back in on me. and everyone knows the wife keeps the house, and the husband gets the crappy apartment. it's the american way."
6530,Gabrielle,by who? the same girl that taught you to use your tongue like a windshield wiper?
6782,Gabrielle,"isn't he great? i know it's been quick, but he's just so amazing."
4879,Gabrielle,i ate already!
6556,Gabrielle,it could happen.
7908,Gabrielle,"i know what you've been up to, and shame on you."
4180,Gabrielle,out the window.
4891,Gabrielle,"oh, you've heard it all before. girl meets boy. boy buys girl nice things. girl leaves happy."
5952,Gabrielle,"to have meaningless sex, carlos. not to sleep with the woman who's carrying our child!"
5115,Gabrielle,"i know you're friends, and i have a hunch you don't do to your friends what i saw you doing to that wrinkly old lady."
8625,Gabrielle,"cause that's what grown-ups do, sweetie. when we don't like someone, we don't punch them or say mean things. we just find subtle ways to make them feel bad about their lives. ooh, like these earrings, aunt connie can't afford them, and that'll make her sad. and this will bring her to her knees. and this will be a kick in her throat."
5530,Gabrielle,"if you're trying to come between me and my husband,i will take you down."
5116,Gabrielle,you're supposed to be in love with me.
7897,Gabrielle,"no, just carlos. mrs. hildebrand is taking him to europe as her personal massage therapist."
8524,Gabrielle,us?
6797,Gabrielle,"we, you should, 'cause they do."
7957,Gabrielle,we're done here. good bye.
4782,Gabrielle,"this is too much. the only reason i agreed to give up the house is because i thought i was gonna get a gorgeous little apartment. now, i'm not even going to get that!"
7507,Gabrielle,why don't you get a job?
6331,Gabrielle,"getting there, sweetie. if she was a horse, we'd have to shoot her."
7319,Gabrielle,no. no.
5393,Gabrielle,hi. carlos will be down in a little while. we had an intense talk. he's resting.
4131,Gabrielle,how do you think he'll react when we tell him?
5817,Gabrielle,but it's not even his.
7371,Gabrielle,"tragic. i found out everything victor had is in milton's name, and he told his father about us, so i'm not getting a penny."
4953,Gabrielle,alright. you win. wait right here.
5091,Gabrielle,"me either, carlos. and if you expect me to go back and sweet talk her into getting the operation, i can't show up empty-handed."
6036,Gabrielle,"not now, xiao-mei!"
6815,Gabrielle,i don't believe it. this is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.
7338,Gabrielle,"like what? ""rot in hell, you maggoty who*e""? that woman ruined our lives. if she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away."
6073,Gabrielle,i intend to.
6171,Gabrielle,"uh, hold it. you're a sweaty mess."
6334,Gabrielle,"yes, i know, i know, and it's tragic, but we are running a business. amy is sucking up all of our time, and we should be focusing on sherri. she actually has a shot at winning."
4311,Gabrielle,i'm getting something to drink. do you want something?
7695,Gabrielle,"i know, but so much? you could've gone back for a second piece."
8693,Gabrielle,"ah, get the camera, get the camera!"
8282,Gabrielle,"well, bradley, we all want things. for instance, i would like carlos to have a week off next month."
6663,Gabrielle,"oh, shut up and get me a sweater. have you even noticed how cold i am?"
7642,Gabrielle,"no way, bree. i don't want katherine in our games. she bums me out."
5320,Gabrielle,"yes, i do."
7147,Gabrielle,all quiet on the southern front.
5343,Gabrielle,and i would've been a terrible mother.
4557,Gabrielle,tom! lynette! what are you doing here?
8635,Gabrielle,let me see your palms.
5808,Gabrielle,"uh, well, hi, dale.nice to meet you.a lot of people have been looking for you."
8352,Gabrielle,it's all part of being the president's wife. so tell me about your new hire. she's gonna be your number two?
8401,Gabrielle,all gone. now let's do this. it'll be like old times.
5884,Gabrielle,"yeah, well,it gives me volume,so i guess we're both gonna have a problem."
4691,Gabrielle,"oh, i can, and i will, you little worthless piece of crap."
8616,Gabrielle,good to know. because gambling is bad enough without being high.
4253,Gabrielle,well since we're doing true confessions. carlos and i once broke a waterbed in cancun.
6315,Gabrielle,"well, yeah. when's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover? now i'm gonna go talk to vern about our next session. you guys finish lunch so we can get back to work."
6637,Gabrielle,that's what you think.
6311,Gabrielle,"well,honey,most models don't eat pizza. well, at least not without having a finger for dessert."
4409,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be that way."
5390,Gabrielle,that's so sweet. i feel so close to you right now.
6176,Gabrielle,got it.
5837,Gabrielle,the people from carlos' church.
6891,Gabrielle,"all right, ten thousand. i'm not gonna haggle."
7135,Gabrielle,"this is serious, okay? if victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, there's gonna be hell to pay."
7693,Gabrielle,"all i'm saying is that our daughter has a weight problem, and the sooner we admit it, the better. carlos: she's only 4. but, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem? go ahead. nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious. see what happens."
5248,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
5184,Gabrielle,oh my god. you fired him because you're jealous?
7017,Gabrielle,"oh,my god,are you serious?"
4571,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, he neglected to tell me that."
7972,Gabrielle,"well, i guess we're all going to the same place. i'll just see my friends there."
7981,Gabrielle,"no, i haven't. why? is he supposed to be here?"
7826,Gabrielle,relax. i told her i was fine.
7196,Gabrielle,"so what are you suggesting, we stay with victor and edie?"
7884,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing home?"
7393,Gabrielle,"the whole nine yards. i'm gonna go down to the cafeteria and get us a couple of ginger ales to toast our future. hey, doctor. he's looking better and better every day. keep up the good work."
4349,Gabrielle,you like that?
6744,Gabrielle,"oh, you don't wanna marry her. she's a tramp. hold out for a good girl."
7610,Gabrielle,"hey! you don't even know her. okay, yes, she's made some bad choices, but deep down, she's a good person."
6879,Gabrielle,uh--my wedding?
8334,Gabrielle,the same compensation package! we're rich!
6482,Gabrielle,"next time? honey, let's get real. you are way too young for me."
4287,Gabrielle,wow.
6946,Gabrielle,"look, everyone knows you're living with edie. if she shows up alone, people will think i asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together."
5720,Gabrielle,so why put me through this?
4999,Gabrielle,"am i supposed to be impressed? because of your little stunt with my birth control pills, i've lost my freedom for the next eighteen years."
4493,Gabrielle,"okay, you're up first, followed by lynette, uh, and then edie--edie. where's edie britt?"
4581,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know. the feds towed away my maserati. my husband is, is a felon, and i spend my days getting groped by fat tracker salesmen at trade shows. i am well aware things change!"
6121,Gabrielle,don't talk to me.
8638,Gabrielle,"well, let her wait. i need something to drink. trying to keep down one of hers world-famous tamales."
5803,Gabrielle,"exactly! like,""he wouldn't have been with me if he was gettin' it at home."""
7313,Gabrielle,"well, why wouldn't i? just let me grab my purse."
7993,Gabrielle,"but i'm not most women. i was an international fashion model, and that's how carlos remembers me."
7777,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, let's face it. m.j. could get beaten up by a kitten."
8079,Gabrielle,oh. great. and what's the signing bonus for that-a cup of pencils? i thought you were gonna get a better job. what happened to the world being your oyster?
7054,Gabrielle,i can't wait.
5134,Gabrielle,oh really. then how about for this?
7523,Gabrielle,"well, that's it. it's not a dog. we got him a seeing-- eye-- monkey. he's amazing. not only can he call 9-1-1, he can toast a bagel. bye."
6547,Gabrielle,"there will be no celebration. i'm turning thirty-one. i'm a single woman in her thirties. i now have to subscribe to ""cat fancy."" it's the law."
8036,Gabrielle,per nulla? what does that mean?
7002,Gabrielle,i remember telling you i wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
7870,Gabrielle,because he and lee are here. bob's an attorney. i'm gonna get him to sue the quack who obviously botched your vasectomy.
6439,Gabrielle,oh. i had a great time. bye.
8263,Gabrielle,hey. when did you two get here?
4200,Gabrielle,"no, no, he doesn't have a clue, god love him. it's just, i was thinking, that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden."
4462,Gabrielle,"listen, betty! okay? you're not quitting on me now. we're going to find you a gown. it's going to be black, and slimming, and you're going to look great! i need you to be brave now."
8010,Gabrielle,"also, the surgery is very expensive. we need time to figure out how we're gonna pay for it."
4548,Gabrielle,i'm still searching.
6669,Gabrielle,"and normally that would creep me out, except it means that i can borrow this one-of-a-kind undari for our date!"
5873,Gabrielle,"honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.that tends to make everyone a little nauseous."
8618,Gabrielle,mark died? i didn't know.
7336,Gabrielle,that's what i'm doing.
4454,Gabrielle,what i want is to be happy.
4927,Gabrielle,i'll call 911.
5135,Gabrielle,"carlos, will you calm down?"
5589,Gabrielle,you know what i mean?it's such a repressive regime.we forget how good we have it.
8613,Gabrielle,"i feel bad i ducked out so fast the other day. and i've been thinking about you a lot, and i just-- i really wanna help."
5438,Gabrielle,"baby, that's the fever talking. the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?"
5517,Gabrielle,"aw,you're so mean."
5768,Gabrielle,"my husband,the comedian."
5103,Gabrielle,i apologized a million times.
8151,Gabrielle,you're right. it's not.
7361,Gabrielle,milton. hi. it's a nice turnout.
6852,Gabrielle,"listen, buddy, you're not getting it. you answer to me now. i could have you fired."
7092,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. i will pick adam."
8387,Gabrielle,"ooh! what's going on? i mentioned lucy, and you get all weird. is something going on with her--and carlos?"
5497,Gabrielle,"oh,i'm sorry.i didn't know you and bonita were having problems."
7496,Gabrielle,"i get that, but surely she's trained to do other stuff, you know, like find his keys or turn off the radio or lick up his spills."
5073,Gabrielle,okay.
4880,Gabrielle,i bought shoes!
5991,Gabrielle,"uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet. but if you got a band, maybe people could dance as opposed to sway."
6314,Gabrielle,"but before they do, they kill your appetite. one time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh--well, if you're ever at the chateau milan in room two thirty-eight, do not use the jacuzzi."
7159,Gabrielle,"hours? are you serious? oh, my god."
6250,Gabrielle,"uh, way."
7065,Gabrielle,"well, don't get sappy on me. i won't stand for it. all right. susan, is the camera ready?"
7181,Gabrielle,"i-i wasn't ""trapped."""
7691,Gabrielle,"ha! we can only hope, with your dna running through her veins."
6501,Gabrielle,i know. she practically had sparklers coming out of her ass.
6349,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a special girl."
8095,Gabrielle,"wow. impressive. huh, carlos?"
4727,Gabrielle,i hate susan's. she has all these weird scented candles. her house reeks of apricot. hose.
8002,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm not a short-order cook. i don't have time to make different meals for everyone."
6788,Gabrielle,yeah! i wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.
4894,Gabrielle,"yes, you are. because if you don't, i'm going to put on my new shoes and walk out that door."
4796,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
6668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! she wears my size! it's amazing. nobody wears my size."
4480,Gabrielle,could have fooled me.
7239,Gabrielle,oh!
5237,Gabrielle,you think david and i planned this so we could sleep together?
4837,Gabrielle,then i'll go to the police.
6783,Gabrielle,"he is, and i've never been happier."
7373,Gabrielle,"um, remember that day, uh--when al was going to drop off the account information?"
8507,Gabrielle,"first of all, you're a real prince for coming today. thanks to you, our coup is complete."
5810,Gabrielle,you're trying to take our baby!how is it not gonna be ugly?
5209,Gabrielle,"excuse me. hello, david."
4466,Gabrielle,for what?
7928,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. i can't reach it."
7819,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, you were right. blind sex is incredible."
4399,Gabrielle,"oh, danielle, remember when you said you wanted to be a model?"
6698,Gabrielle,"a guy who can admit he screwed up, one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is. i wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy."
7835,Gabrielle,juanita! stop talking to your sister!
5876,Gabrielle,oh.
7084,Gabrielle,"edie---she's wearing a big, honkin' engagement ring the size of a peach pit."
5612,Gabrielle,really?what did you buy?
6644,Gabrielle,"i have noticed, and i'm throwing you back."
7548,Gabrielle,"oh, right. i keep forgetting you're useless. i'm gonna see if ellie has one."
6097,Gabrielle,oh?
7322,Gabrielle,but you're okay now. that's the important thing.
8199,Gabrielle,"oh, no need. i'm up for anything. although i did just get a manicure, so nothing that might chip a nail."
7659,Gabrielle,money? what money?
5102,Gabrielle,"i feel tons of guilt, so back off."
6292,Gabrielle,"and i hate helping others, too, but i'm doing that, aren't i?"
7560,Gabrielle,"well, no offense. i just think bob has a better shot at pulling it off. he's a little more--"
4478,Gabrielle,have you been thinking about me?
4936,Gabrielle,that bitch! i can't believe her!
6407,Gabrielle,anything for a good cause.
4503,Gabrielle,"susan, don't be like this!"
6546,Gabrielle,you can buy me that toilet seat cover.
6933,Gabrielle,"i do, too."
8190,Gabrielle,"jean, you didn't just give in to it. you slapped a piece of cheese on it. yeah, i said it. now just fix the hem. and this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. hey, edie! wait up!"
5344,Gabrielle,"if it was a boy, i was gonna name it charlie."
5790,Gabrielle,motherhood is such a blessing.i hope you get to experience it one day.
6163,Gabrielle,"oh,i have to,carlos.i need you to give up on us.we're not good for each other,and i can't keep doing this."
8657,Gabrielle,"""all right""? young lady, if you live under my roof, you will not disparage versace."
